The [[Tokyo District Court]] rejected Taiko's claim to proprietary use of the Seirogan name, and the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] upheld that decision<ref name=nishioka/> in 1974. The Supreme Court delivered the opinion that the name seirogan had passed into a common noun, so that use of the Seirogan (\u6b63\u9732\u4e38) name by any company was valid, not answerable to the claims of this trademark, and did not constitute an infringement of any intellectually property rights thereof. The court also did not recognize Taiko Pharmaceutical's exclusive right to use the distinctive color scheme and graphic design on the packaged box (and sticker label on the pill bottle), with the exception of the product logo depicting a bugle.

Surgeon-major {{Nihongo|Michitomo Tozuka|\u6238\u585a\u6a5f\u77e5}}, an instructor at the Military Medical College, discovered in 1903 that creosote agent was an effective suppressant for the [[typhoid fever]] pathogen. Taiko Pharmaceutical claims the Osaka-based medicine merchant {{Nihongo|Saichi Nakajima|\u4e2d\u5cf6\u4f50\u4e00}} developed the {{Nihongo|Ch\u016by\u016b Seirogan|\u5fe0\u52c7\u5f81\u9732\u4e38}} a year earlier in 1902 and initiated sales, which business was eventually handed over to Taiko.\n\nThe higher echelons of the Army Medical Corps, including writer [[Mori \u014cgai]], favored the German view that [[beriberi]], a disease that caused an even heavier death toll than typhoid, was caused by an undiscovered transmittable pathogens (in contrast, British-trained doctors in the navy correctly saw it as a nutritional disorder). Prompted by their misguided view, the army distributed vast quantities of Seirogan (with their proven antiseptic properties) among the troops to be administered daily throughout the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-5. In an army medical journal of 1901 there is mention of the pill as {{Nihongo|Kureos\u014dto gan|\u30af\u30ec\u30aa\u30bd\u30fc\u30c8\u4e38}}, but in the journals of 1904-5 appears the name {{Nihongo|Seirogan|\u5f81\u9732\u4e38 \"Conquer Russia pills\"}}.<ref name=gold>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gold|first=Hal|title=Unit 731: Testimony|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cprBEpxvexgC&pg=PA21|isbn=9780804835657}}, p.21-22</ref> The name Seirogan was widely used as the academic term by army doctors for about a 4-year span.\n\nBut this was in the days when drug use as preventive medicine was not a widely embraced concept, and soldiers resisted swallowing this weird-smelling and unfamiliar pill, even when so instructed.  The top brass decided to invoke the name of [[Emperor Meiji]], telling the men that taking the pill was \"according to the wishes of His Imperial Majesty\".<ref name=gold/> This subterfuge reportedly greatly improved the soldiers' [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] towards taking the pill, making them less prone to be forced out of action due to stomach aches or diarrhea. The army doctors were however disappointed to find that the pill did not show any of the desired combative effect towards the (non-existent) beriberi microbe. The army insisted on feeding their men pure white rice to boost morale, but that led to vitamin-deficient diet, so that one in three men serving the Russo-Japanese War were afflicted by beriberi, and 27,800 succumbed to it. Meanwhile, the Japanese navy deduced early on that beriberi was a nutritional disorder, and added breads and {{Nihongo|mugimeshi|\u9ea6\u98ef}} (wheat or wheat-rice mixture steam-cooked like rice) to their rations, so that none of their servicemen fell ill with beriberi.\n\nWhile Seirogan proved powerless against beriberi, the [[antidiarrheal]] and toothache-soothing properties of the pill were passed on, in somewhat exaggerated fashion, by repatriated war veterans. Amid the mood of victory in war, Seirogan's name became \"the cure-all that defeated Russia\" and many drug-makers rushed to manufacture the pill, which became a national medicine unique to Japan.\n\nThe reputation for the pill's effectiveness also spread within areas under Japanese control before the end of World War II, and Seirogan is said to be one of the popular items purchased by travelers from [[Taiwan]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and other Asian countries.\n\nThe pill ceased to be part of regular military issue supplies in 1906, but the military continued to keep itself constantly supplied for use. In 2007, it was part of the supply kit issued to the [[Self Defense Force|SDF]] during the [[United Nations Mission in Nepal|UN Mission in Nepal]].\n\nAfter the war with Russia, and again after World War II, [[administrative guidance]] was issued against the use of the kanji character {{Nihongo|\u5f81|Sei|\"conquer\"}} as being undesirable from the standpoint of international relations.  So in most cases, the written name of the pill was changed to {{Nihongo|\u6b63\u9732\u4e38|\"right dew pill\"}}. Taiko Pharmaceutical made the change in 1949.<ref name=nagai>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Nagai|first=Sonoko (\u9577\u4e95\u82d1\u5b50)|last2=Izumi|first2=Takahide (\u6cc9\u5b5d\u82f1)|title=\u751f\u304d\u3064\u3065\u3051\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068: \u6587\u5b66\u306b\u307f\u308b\u75c5\u3044\u3068\u8001\u3044|volume=2|publisher=\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u793e|year=2009|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cpNAQAAIAAJ}}, quote:\"\u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u306f\u5f53\u521d\u3001\u4e00\u4e5d\u3007\u4e8c\u5e74\u3001\u4e2d\u5cf6\u4f4f\u4e00\u306b\u3088\u3064\u3066\u300c\u4efb\u9732\u4e38(\u9732\u897f\u4e9c\u3092\u4efb\u4f10\u3059\u308b\u306e\u610f)\u300d\u306e\u5546\u54c1\u540d\u306b\u3088\u3064\u3066\u88fd\u9020\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4e00\u4e5d\u56db\u516d\u5e74\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1\u304c\u88fd\u9020\u767a\u58f2\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u4e00\u4e5d\u56db\u4e5d\u5e74\u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u3068\u540d\u79f0\u5909\u66f4\"</ref> But one manufacturer {{Nihongo|Nihon Iyakuhin Seiz\u014d|\u65e5\u672c\u533b\u85ac\u54c1\u88fd\u9020}} still uses the old written form that reads \"conquer\".\n\n== Intellectual property rights dispute ==\n\n=== Taiko's trademark registration and Izumi's lawsuit to revoke trademark ===\nIn 1946,<ref name=nagai/> {{Interlanguage link multi|Taiko Pharmaceutical|ja|3=\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1|vertical-align=sup}} the leading manufacturer of the pill, had obtained through formal negotiation with Saichi Nakajima the right to continue selling his \"Ch\u016by\u016b Seirogan\" pill. Accordingly, in 1954, Taiko made a claim for the exclusive use of the \"Seirogan\" name, and filed for trademark registration.\n\nOther manufacturers of the seirogan-type pill objected to this move, led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou Co., Ltd.|ja|3=\u548c\u6cc9\u85ac\u54c1\u5de5\u696d\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|vertical-align=sup}}, which had developed its own creosote formula, and had supplied the military with its seirogan throughout World War II despite supply shortages. The group petitioned the [[Japan Patent Office|Patent Office]] in April 1955 to revoke the trademark. It was not until April 1960, that the Patent Office handed down its decision to maintain the registered trademark. So the group filed a suit in the [[Tokyo High Court]], which in September 1971, ruled that \"The seirongan is recognized by the nation's populace as a common name for bowels-regulating agents that use creosote as main ingredient, and [the court hereby] rules to void the Patent Office's decision to make it a proprietary trademark\". This ruling was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]], thus finalizing the decision in March 1974.\n\nHowever, the Seirogan registered trademark is still retained by Taiko Pharmaceutical (Trademark Registration No. 545984).  It is not clear why the registered trademark remains unexpunged despite the supreme court ruling, but a trademark registration does not vanish automatically, and needs to go through a Patent Office review process. The Patent Office may have surmised that the Court's ruling effectively accomplished the purpose or remedy sought by the petitioners, obviating the need for another review. The Court's opinion made it expressly clear that the name Seirogan had passed into a common noun, which meant that the trademark privileges (proprietary rights) upon it was not protected or enforceable pursuant to Japan's Trademark Act, Article 26, Paragaraph 2.\n\nThus companies other than Taiko are allowed to sell the drug under the \"Seirogan\" name, without this constituting an infringement of trademark. Taiko's attempted litigation in 2005-8 (described) also failed to establish its proprietary rights. But the Court's opinion curiously left open a leeway, allowing for possible future reversal depending on the shift in popular convention. Seirogan is one of few pharmaceutical drugs names thus given [[public domain]] status, [[aspirin]] being another immediately called to mind.\n\n=== Taiko's petition for an injunction against unfair competitive practices ===\nOn November 24, 2005,<ref name=braina>{{cite web|ref=harv|author=braina|title=\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1\u3001\u3072\u3087\u3046\u305f\u3093\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u8ca9\u58f2\u306e\u548c\u6cc9\u85ac\u54c1\u3092\u63d0\u8a34|publisher=\u77e5\u8ca1\u60c5\u5831\u5c40(Braina) |date=2005-11-26 |url=http://news.braina.com/2005/1126/judge_20051126_001____.html |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> Taiko Pharmaceutical filed a suit against Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Osaka District Court|ja|3=\u5927\u962a\u5730\u65b9\u88c1\u5224\u6240|vertical-align=sup}}, claiming the sales of merchandise with similar packaging constituted an act of unfair competitive practice under {{Interlanguage link multi|Unfair Competition Prevention Act (Japan)|ja|3=\u4e0d\u6b63\u7af6\u4e89\u9632\u6b62\u6cd5|vertical-align=sup}} 2.1.1 or 2.1.2, and was an infringement of its trademark rights (docket number: Heisei 17 (wa\uff09No. 11663).<ref name=kizuna>{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Wada|first=Narinori(\u548c\u7530\u3000\u6210\u5247)|title=\u5224\u4f8b13 \u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u6709\u540d\u5546\u6a19\u306e\u666e\u901a\u540d\u79f0\u5316\uff09|publisher=Kizuna International Patent Office|year=2006|url=http://www.wada-pat.jp/hanrei/hanrei-13.htm |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> On July 27, 2006,<ref name=braina2006>{{cite web|ref=harv|author=braina|title=\u30e9\u30c3\u30d1\u3068\u3072\u3087\u3046\u305f\u3093\u3067\u8b58\u5225\u53ef\u80fd\u3001\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u8a34\u8a1f\u3067\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1\u306e\u8acb\u6c42\u68c4\u5374|publisher=\u77e5\u8ca1\u60c5\u5831\u5c40(Braina)|date=2006-07-28 |url=http://news.braina.com/2006/0728/judge_20060728_001____.html |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Osaka District Court ruled against the plaintiff saying a distinction can be made between the bugle and calabash logos.<ref name=kizuna/><ref>[http://www.courts.go.jp/hanrei/pdf/20060731093511.pdf \u5e73\u6210\uff11\uff18\u5e74\uff17\u6708\uff12\uff17\u65e5\u5224\u6c7a\u8a00\u6e21 \u5e73\u6210\uff11\uff17\u5e74(\u30ef)\u7b2c\uff11\uff11\uff16\uff16\uff13\u53f7\u4e0d\u6b63\u7af6\u4e89\u884c\u70ba\u5dee\u6b62\u7b49\u8acb\u6c42\u4e8b\u4ef6] (text of the Osaka Court's opinion)</ref><ref name=47news/> Taiko then appealed on August 7, but the [[Osaka High Court]] upheld the decision, and the Supreme Court's second {{Interlanguage link multi|Petty bench (Japan)|ja|3=\u5c0f\u6cd5\u5ef7|vertical-align=sup}}<ref name=47news>{{cite web|ref=harv|author=Kyodo News (\u5171\u540c\u901a\u4fe1)|title=\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1\u306e\u6557\u8a34\u78ba\u5b9a\u3000\u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u6df7\u540c\u305b\u305a |url=http://www.47news.jp/CN/200807/CN2008070401000727.html |work=47 News|date=2008-07-04 <!-- 19:53 --> |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> rejected against hearing the case on July 4, 2008,<ref name=47news/> which finalized Taiko's loss in this lawsuit.\n\nBut in the opinion read by the court contained this passage: \"Whether a certain label is a common name or not is an issue pertaining to perception by users (commercial dealers and consumers at large), so even if a label has been regarded as a common name within a certain period, it may later come to be perceived as denoting a specific product as a matter of the ongoing real situation of its commerce, and it is not impossible for it to regain its {{Nihongo|source designator|\u51fa\u6240\u8868\u793a\u6a5f|''shussho hy\u014dji kin\u014d''}} (i.e., manufacturer specifying) purpose\".\n\n== Misinformed drug risk accusation controversy ==\n{{Hatnote|This is a much abridged version of the write-up in the Japanese wiki article}}\nThe primary active ingredient used in seirogan is wood-tar creosote.

The Supreme Court delivered the opinion that the name seirogan had passed into a common noun, so that use of the Seirogan (\u6b63\u9732\u4e38) name by any company was valid, not answerable to the claims of this trademark, and did not constitute an infringement of any intellectually property rights thereof.

Surgeon-major {{Nihongo|Michitomo Tozuka|\u6238\u585a\u6a5f\u77e5}}, an instructor at the Military Medical College, discovered in 1903 that creosote agent was an effective suppressant for the [[typhoid fever]] pathogen. Taiko Pharmaceutical claims the Osaka-based medicine merchant {{Nihongo|Saichi Nakajima|\u4e2d\u5cf6\u4f50\u4e00}} developed the {{Nihongo|Ch\u016by\u016b Seirogan|\u5fe0\u52c7\u5f81\u9732\u4e38}} a year earlier in 1902 and initiated sales, which business was eventually handed over to Taiko.\n\nThe higher echelons of the Army Medical Corps, including writer [[Mori \u014cgai]], favored the German view that [[beriberi]], a disease that caused an even heavier death toll than typhoid, was caused by an undiscovered transmittable pathogens (in contrast, British-trained doctors in the navy correctly saw it as a nutritional disorder). Prompted by their misguided view, the army distributed vast quantities of Seirogan (with their proven antiseptic properties) among the troops to be administered daily throughout the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-5. In an army medical journal of 1901 there is mention of the pill as {{Nihongo|Kureos\u014dto gan|\u30af\u30ec\u30aa\u30bd\u30fc\u30c8\u4e38}}, but in the journals of 1904-5 appears the name {{Nihongo|Seirogan|\u5f81\u9732\u4e38 \"Conquer Russia pills\"}}.<ref name=gold>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gold|first=Hal|title=Unit 731: Testimony|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cprBEpxvexgC&pg=PA21|isbn=9780804835657}}, p.21-22</ref> The name Seirogan was widely used as the academic term by army doctors for about a 4-year span.\n\nBut this was in the days when drug use as preventive medicine was not a widely embraced concept, and soldiers resisted swallowing this weird-smelling and unfamiliar pill, even when so instructed.  The top brass decided to invoke the name of [[Emperor Meiji]], telling the men that taking the pill was \"according to the wishes of His Imperial Majesty\".<ref name=gold/> This subterfuge reportedly greatly improved the soldiers' [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] towards taking the pill, making them less prone to be forced out of action due to stomach aches or diarrhea. The army doctors were however disappointed to find that the pill did not show any of the desired combative effect towards the (non-existent) beriberi microbe. The army insisted on feeding their men pure white rice to boost morale, but that led to vitamin-deficient diet, so that one in three men serving the Russo-Japanese War were afflicted by beriberi, and 27,800 succumbed to it. Meanwhile, the Japanese navy deduced early on that beriberi was a nutritional disorder, and added breads and {{Nihongo|mugimeshi|\u9ea6\u98ef}} (wheat or wheat-rice mixture steam-cooked like rice) to their rations, so that none of their servicemen fell ill with beriberi.\n\nWhile Seirogan proved powerless against beriberi, the [[antidiarrheal]] and toothache-soothing properties of the pill were passed on, in somewhat exaggerated fashion, by repatriated war veterans. Amid the mood of victory in war, Seirogan's name became \"the cure-all that defeated Russia\" and many drug-makers rushed to manufacture the pill, which became a national medicine unique to Japan.\n\nThe reputation for the pill's effectiveness also spread within areas under Japanese control before the end of World War II, and Seirogan is said to be one of the popular items purchased by travelers from [[Taiwan]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and other Asian countries.\n\nThe pill ceased to be part of regular military issue supplies in 1906, but the military continued to keep itself constantly supplied for use. In 2007, it was part of the supply kit issued to the [[Self Defense Force|SDF]] during the [[United Nations Mission in Nepal|UN Mission in Nepal]].\n\nAfter the war with Russia, and again after World War II, [[administrative guidance]] was issued against the use of the kanji character {{Nihongo|\u5f81|Sei|\"conquer\"}} as being undesirable from the standpoint of international relations.  So in most cases, the written name of the pill was changed to {{Nihongo|\u6b63\u9732\u4e38|\"right dew pill\"}}. Taiko Pharmaceutical made the change in 1949.<ref name=nagai>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Nagai|first=Sonoko (\u9577\u4e95\u82d1\u5b50)|last2=Izumi|first2=Takahide (\u6cc9\u5b5d\u82f1)|title=\u751f\u304d\u3064\u3065\u3051\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068: \u6587\u5b66\u306b\u307f\u308b\u75c5\u3044\u3068\u8001\u3044|volume=2|publisher=\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u793e|year=2009|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cpNAQAAIAAJ}}, quote:\"\u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u306f\u5f53\u521d\u3001\u4e00\u4e5d\u3007\u4e8c\u5e74\u3001\u4e2d\u5cf6\u4f4f\u4e00\u306b\u3088\u3064\u3066\u300c\u4efb\u9732\u4e38(\u9732\u897f\u4e9c\u3092\u4efb\u4f10\u3059\u308b\u306e\u610f)\u300d\u306e\u5546\u54c1\u540d\u306b\u3088\u3064\u3066\u88fd\u9020\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4e00\u4e5d\u56db\u516d\u5e74\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1\u304c\u88fd\u9020\u767a\u58f2\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u4e00\u4e5d\u56db\u4e5d\u5e74\u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u3068\u540d\u79f0\u5909\u66f4\"</ref> But one manufacturer {{Nihongo|Nihon Iyakuhin Seiz\u014d|\u65e5\u672c\u533b\u85ac\u54c1\u88fd\u9020}} still uses the old written form that reads \"conquer\".\n\n== Intellectual property rights dispute ==\n\n=== Taiko's trademark registration and Izumi's lawsuit to revoke trademark ===\nIn 1946,<ref name=nagai/> {{Interlanguage link multi|Taiko Pharmaceutical|ja|3=\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1|vertical-align=sup}} the leading manufacturer of the pill, had obtained through formal negotiation with Saichi Nakajima the right to continue selling his \"Ch\u016by\u016b Seirogan\" pill. Accordingly, in 1954, Taiko made a claim for the exclusive use of the \"Seirogan\" name, and filed for trademark registration.\n\nOther manufacturers of the seirogan-type pill objected to this move, led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou Co., Ltd.|ja|3=\u548c\u6cc9\u85ac\u54c1\u5de5\u696d\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|vertical-align=sup}}, which had developed its own creosote formula, and had supplied the military with its seirogan throughout World War II despite supply shortages. The group petitioned the [[Japan Patent Office|Patent Office]] in April 1955 to revoke the trademark. It was not until April 1960, that the Patent Office handed down its decision to maintain the registered trademark. So the group filed a suit in the [[Tokyo High Court]], which in September 1971, ruled that \"The seirongan is recognized by the nation's populace as a common name for bowels-regulating agents that use creosote as main ingredient, and [the court hereby] rules to void the Patent Office's decision to make it a proprietary trademark\". This ruling was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]], thus finalizing the decision in March 1974.\n\nHowever, the Seirogan registered trademark is still retained by Taiko Pharmaceutical (Trademark Registration No. 545984).  It is not clear why the registered trademark remains unexpunged despite the supreme court ruling, but a trademark registration does not vanish automatically, and needs to go through a Patent Office review process. The Patent Office may have surmised that the Court's ruling effectively accomplished the purpose or remedy sought by the petitioners, obviating the need for another review. The Court's opinion made it expressly clear that the name Seirogan had passed into a common noun, which meant that the trademark privileges (proprietary rights) upon it was not protected or enforceable pursuant to Japan's Trademark Act, Article 26, Paragaraph 2.\n\nThus companies other than Taiko are allowed to sell the drug under the \"Seirogan\" name, without this constituting an infringement of trademark. Taiko's attempted litigation in 2005-8 (described) also failed to establish its proprietary rights. But the Court's opinion curiously left open a leeway, allowing for possible future reversal depending on the shift in popular convention. Seirogan is one of few pharmaceutical drugs names thus given [[public domain]] status, [[aspirin]] being another immediately called to mind.\n\n=== Taiko's petition for an injunction against unfair competitive practices ===\nOn November 24, 2005,<ref name=braina>{{cite web|ref=harv|author=braina|title=\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1\u3001\u3072\u3087\u3046\u305f\u3093\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u8ca9\u58f2\u306e\u548c\u6cc9\u85ac\u54c1\u3092\u63d0\u8a34|publisher=\u77e5\u8ca1\u60c5\u5831\u5c40(Braina) |date=2005-11-26 |url=http://news.braina.com/2005/1126/judge_20051126_001____.html |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> Taiko Pharmaceutical filed a suit against Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Osaka District Court|ja|3=\u5927\u962a\u5730\u65b9\u88c1\u5224\u6240|vertical-align=sup}}, claiming the sales of merchandise with similar packaging constituted an act of unfair competitive practice under {{Interlanguage link multi|Unfair Competition Prevention Act (Japan)|ja|3=\u4e0d\u6b63\u7af6\u4e89\u9632\u6b62\u6cd5|vertical-align=sup}} 2.1.1 or 2.1.2, and was an infringement of its trademark rights (docket number: Heisei 17 (wa\uff09No. 11663).<ref name=kizuna>{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Wada|first=Narinori(\u548c\u7530\u3000\u6210\u5247)|title=\u5224\u4f8b13 \u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u6709\u540d\u5546\u6a19\u306e\u666e\u901a\u540d\u79f0\u5316\uff09|publisher=Kizuna International Patent Office|year=2006|url=http://www.wada-pat.jp/hanrei/hanrei-13.htm |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> On July 27, 2006,<ref name=braina>{{cite web|ref=harv|author=braina|title=\u30e9\u30c3\u30d1\u3068\u3072\u3087\u3046\u305f\u3093\u3067\u8b58\u5225\u53ef\u80fd\u3001\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u8a34\u8a1f\u3067\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1\u306e\u8acb\u6c42\u68c4\u5374|publisher=\u77e5\u8ca1\u60c5\u5831\u5c40(Braina)|date=2006-07-28 |url=http://news.braina.com/2006/0728/judge_20060728_001____.html |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Osaka District Court ruled against the plaintiff saying a distinction can be made between the bugle and calabash logos.<ref name=kizuna/><ref>[http://www.courts.go.jp/hanrei/pdf/20060731093511.pdf \u5e73\u6210\uff11\uff18\u5e74\uff17\u6708\uff12\uff17\u65e5\u5224\u6c7a\u8a00\u6e21 \u5e73\u6210\uff11\uff17\u5e74(\u30ef)\u7b2c\uff11\uff11\uff16\uff16\uff13\u53f7\u4e0d\u6b63\u7af6\u4e89\u884c\u70ba\u5dee\u6b62\u7b49\u8acb\u6c42\u4e8b\u4ef6] (text of the Osaka Court's opinion)</ref><ref name=47news/> Taiko then appealed on August 7, but the [[Osaka High Court]] upheld the decision, and the Supreme Court's second {{Interlanguage link multi|Petty bench (Japan)|ja|3=\u5c0f\u6cd5\u5ef7|vertical-align=sup}}<ref name=47news>{{cite web|ref=harv|author=Kyodo News (\u5171\u540c\u901a\u4fe1)|title=\u5927\u5e78\u85ac\u54c1\u306e\u6557\u8a34\u78ba\u5b9a\u3000\u300c\u6b63\u9732\u4e38\u300d\u6df7\u540c\u305b\u305a |url=http://www.47news.jp/CN/200807/CN2008070401000727.html |work=47 News|date=2008-07-04 <!-- 19:53 --> |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> rejected against hearing the case on July 4, 2008,<ref name=47news/> which finalized Taiko's loss in this lawsuit.\n\nBut in the opinion read by the court contained this passage: \"Whether a certain label is a common name or not is an issue pertaining to perception by users (commercial dealers and consumers at large), so even if a label has been regarded as a common name within a certain period, it may later come to be perceived as denoting a specific product as a matter of the ongoing real situation of its commerce, and it is not impossible for it to regain its {{Nihongo|source designator|\u51fa\u6240\u8868\u793a\u6a5f|''shussho hy\u014dji kin\u014d''}} (i.e., manufacturer specifying) purpose\".\n\n== Misinformed drug risk accusation controversy ==\n{{Hatnote|This is a much abridged version of the write-up in the Japanese wiki article}}\nThe primary active ingredient used in seirogan is wood-tar creosote.

Initially, the plan was to release the album on [[Sub Pop]], but the band received a great deal of interest based on the demos. Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]]. In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles to record ''[[Nevermind]]'' (as seen in Grohl's 2013 documentary ''[[Sound City (film)|Sound City]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dave-grohl-butch-vig-grammy-adele-nirvana-289304|title=Grammys 2012: Dave Grohl and Butch Vig Reflect on Nirvana, Adele and the State of the Music Business (Q&A)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513112143/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dave-grohl-butch-vig-grammy-adele-nirvana-289304|archive-date=May 13, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUpon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Drummer: 100 Years of Rhythmic Power and Invention|p=253|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4768-5589-9}}</ref> At the same time, Grohl was compiling and recording his own material, which he released on a cassette called ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]'' in 1992 on indie label Simple Machines.

In Grohl's initial months in Seattle, Cobain overheard him working on a song called \"Color Pictures of a Marigold\", and the two subsequently worked on it together. Grohl would later record the song for the ''Pocketwatch'' cassette. Grohl stated in a 2014 episode of ''[[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways]]'' that Cobain reacted by kissing him upon first hearing a demo of \"[[Alone + Easy Target]]\" that Grohl had recently recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/dave-grohl-opens-up-on-why-he-didnt-write-any-nirvana-songs|title=Dave Grohl opens up on why he didn't write any Nirvana songs|last=Louder|first=Briony Edwards2018-07-09T14:30:50Z|website=loudersound|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>\n\nDuring the sessions for ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'', Nirvana decided to re-record \"Color Pictures of a Marigold\" released this version as a B-side on the \"[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\" single, titled simply \"Marigold\". Grohl also contributed the main guitar riff for \"Scentless Apprentice\". Cobain admitted in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff was \"kind of boneheaded\", but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box set ''[[With the Lights Out]]''). Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-dave-grohl-on-kurts-last-days-and-the-making-of-in-utero-2-108580/|title=Dave Grohl on Kurt's Last Days|last=Fricke|first=David|date=2013-09-24|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513113138/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-dave-grohl-on-kurts-last-days-and-the-making-of-in-utero-2-108580/|archive-date=May 13, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nPrior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several of Grohl's songs, including future [[Foo Fighters]] songs \"Exhausted\", \"[[Big Me]]\", \"February Stars\", and \"Butterflies\". On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived, and the band recorded a demo of a song later named \"[[You Know You're Right]]\". It was the band's final studio recording.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6334646/nirvana-kurt-cobain-kissed-dave-grohl-after-hearing-foo-fighters-demo-sonic-highways|title=Nirvana's Kurt Cobain Kissed Dave Grohl After Hearing Foo Fighters Demo|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>\n\nThe Cobain, Novoselic and Grohl incarnation of Nirvana was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on April 10, 2014, 20 years after the death of Cobain.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== Foo Fighters (1994\u2013present) ===\n{{Main|Foo Fighters}}\nFollowing Cobain's death in April 1994, Grohl retreated, unsure of where to go and what to do with himself. In October 1994, Grohl scheduled studio time, again at Robert Lang Studios, and quickly recorded a fifteen-track demo. With the exception of a single guitar part on \"X-Static\" played by [[Greg Dulli]] of [[the Afghan Whigs]], Grohl performed all of the instruments himself.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=David|title=Dave Grohl: From Antsy Student to Nirvana to Foo Fighters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/this-is-a-call-the-life-and-times-of-dave-grohl-by-paul-brannigan-book-review.html|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Grohl wondered if his future might be in drumming for other bands.

Nirvana's [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] rep [[Gary Gersh]] had subsequently taken over as president of [[Capitol Records]] and lured Grohl to sign with the label. Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career, so he recruited other band members: former Germs and touring Nirvana guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and two members of the recently disbanded [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[William Goldsmith]] (drums) and [[Nate Mendel]] (bass). Rather than re-record the album, Grohl's demo was given a professional mix by [[Rob Schnapf]] and [[Tom Rothrock]] and was released in July 1995 as Foo Fighters' [[Foo Fighters (album)|debut album]].\n\nDuring a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover of [[Gary Numan]]'s \"[[Down in the Park]]\". In February 1996, Grohl and his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood made a brief [[cameo appearance]] on  ''[[The X-Files]]'' third-season episode \"[[Pusher (The X-Files)|Pusher]]\".\n\nAfter touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the soundtrack to the 1997 movie ''[[Touch (1997 film)|Touch]]''. Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for vocals from [[Veruca Salt]] singer [[Louise Post]] on the title track, keyboards by Barrett Jones (who also co-produced the record) on one track, and vocals and guitar by [[X (American band)|X's]] [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] on \"This Loving Thing (Lynn's Song)\". Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined Foo Fighters to work on their follow-up.\n\nIn the midst of the initial sessions for Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and drummer William Goldsmith. According to Goldsmith, \"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one. [...] It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else\". Goldsmith also believed that Capitol and producer Gil Norton wanted Grohl to drum on the album.<ref name=\"roberts\">Roberts, Michael. \"[http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day Bring Back that Sunny Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20090825182828/http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day |date=August 25, 2009 }}\".

Grohl penned a few new songs, recording one of them, \"[[Walking After You]]\", by himself at a studio in Washington, D.C. Inspired by the session, Grohl opted to move the band, without Goldsmith's knowledge,<ref name=\"roberts\" /> to Los Angeles to re-record most of the album with Grohl behind the kit. After the sessions were complete, Goldsmith officially announced his departure from the band.\n\nSpeaking in 2011 about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl explained that \"there were a lot of reasons it didn't work out, but there was also a part of [him] that was like, you know, [he doesn't] know if [he's] finished playing the drums yet\". He also stated that he wished he had \"handled things differently\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWhsYINKcKM#t=2m56s|title=Oxegen 2011 \u2013 Foo Fighters Dave Grohl|publisher=YouTube|date=July 10, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dave Grohl in London.jpg|thumb|upright|Grohl on stage in 2006]]\nThe effort was released in May 1997 as the band's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', which eventually cemented Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio. The album spawned several hits, including \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\". Just prior to the album's release, former [[Alanis Morissette]] drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band on drums. The following September, Smear (a close friend of Jennifer Youngblood) left the band,<ref name=\"guardian\" /> citing a need to settle down following a lifetime of touring. Smear was subsequently replaced by Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]]. Stahl was kicked out of the band prior to recording of Foo Fighters' third album<ref name=\"guardian\" /> and was replaced by touring guitarist [[Chris Shiflett]], who later became a full-fledged member during the recording of ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.\n\nGrohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with Foo Fighters' popularity. During his infrequent pauses he lived in [[Seattle]] and Los Angeles before returning to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. It was there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the 1999 album ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' was recorded.<ref name=back>{{cite video|author=[[James Moll|Moll, James]] (director)|title=[[Foo Fighters: Back and Forth|Back and Forth]]|year=2011|medium=documentary|publisher=RCA}}</ref> It was recorded following the departure from Capitol and their former president Gary Gersh. Grohl described the recording experience as \"intoxicating at times\" because the band members were left completely to their own devices.

It was complete and not open to outside tampering.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/981242/0|journal=Billboard - the International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=October 16, 1999|access-date=2016-09-25|title=Foo Fighters had 'Nothing To Lose'|\nlast=Flick|first= Larry|volume=111|issue=42|pages=14\u201314, 44}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the band recruited [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] to add some guitar flourish to a cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Have a Cigar]]\", a song which Foo Fighters previously recorded as a b-side.

After four months in the studio, with the sessions finished, Grohl accepted an invitation to join [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and helped them to record their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. (Grohl can be seen drumming for the band in the video for the song \"[[No One Knows]]\".) After a brief tour through North America, Britain and Japan with the band<ref name=\"guardian\" /> and feeling rejuvenated by the effort, Grohl recalled the other band members to completely re-record their album at his studio in Virginia. The effort became their fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''. While initially pleased with the results, in another 2005 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Grohl admitted to not liking the record: \"Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.\"<ref>Scaggs, Austin.

When \"All My Life\" ended its run, after a one-week respite, \"[[No One Knows]]\" by Queens of the Stone Age took the number one spot. Between October 26, 2002 and March 1, 2003 Grohl was in the number one spot on the Modern rock charts for 17 of 18 successive weeks, as a member of three different groups.\n\nGrohl and Foo Fighters released their fifth album ''[[In Your Honor]]'' on June 14, 2005.

He is known for being the longest-serving drummer for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] from late 1990 to early 1994. When Nirvana disbanded following the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain]] he became the founder, lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band [[Foo Fighters]]. Grohl is also the drummer and co-founder of the rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Them Crooked Vultures]], and wrote the music and performed all the instruments for his short-lived side projects [[Pocketwatch (album)|Late!]] and [[Probot]]. He has also recorded and toured with [[Queens of the Stone Age]].\n\nGrohl established himself as a highly appreciated drummer with Nirvana and in 2014 was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] alongside bandmates [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]] in the group's first year of eligibility.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/blog/post/2014-rock-hall-induction-ceremony-special-guests/|title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces Special Guests for the 29th Annual Induction Ceremony at Barclays Center &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|date=|publisher=Rockhall.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130632/https://rockhall.com/blog/post/2014-rock-hall-induction-ceremony-special-guests/|archivedate=April 13, 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=May 20, 2014|df=mdy}}</ref> In 2010, Grohl was described by Ken Micallef, co-author of the book ''Classic Rock Drummers'', as one of the most influential rock musicians of the previous 20 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Micallef|first=Ken|year=2010|title=Dave Grohl|journal=[[Modern Drummer]]|pages=34, 42\u201346, 48\u201349, 51, 53\u201354}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Eric Grohl was born on January 14, 1969,<ref name=\"Grohl- drummerworld\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Dave_Grohl.html|title=Dave Grohl biography|year=2009|work=AMG|publisher=Drummerworld|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fooarchive.com/news/?m=200901 \"Happy 40th Birthday Dave Grohl!\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219031209/http://www.fooarchive.com/news/?m=200901|date=February 19, 2009}}, fooarchive.com,  January 14, 2009.</ref> in [[Warren, Ohio]], the son of teacher Virginia Jean (''n\u00e9e'' Hanlon) and newswriter James Harper Grohl (1938{{ndash}}2014).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ks1JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HYUMAAAAIBAJ&dq=virginia-hanlon-teacher-troth-told-is-bride-of-news&pg=5088%2C3102676 |title=Virginia Hanlon, teacher, is Bride of News Writer|newspaper=[[The Vindicator]] |location=[[Youngstown, Ohio]]|date=January 28, 1961|volume=LXXII|number=151|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> In addition to being an award-winning journalist, James had also served as the special assistant to Sen.

Initially, the plan was to release the album on [[Sub Pop]], but the band received a great deal of interest based on the demos. Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]]. In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles to record ''[[Nevermind]]'' (as seen in Grohl's 2013 documentary ''[[Sound City (film)|Sound City]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dave-grohl-butch-vig-grammy-adele-nirvana-289304|title=Grammys 2012: Dave Grohl and Butch Vig Reflect on Nirvana, Adele and the State of the Music Business (Q&A)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513112143/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dave-grohl-butch-vig-grammy-adele-nirvana-289304|archive-date=May 13, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUpon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Drummer: 100 Years of Rhythmic Power and Invention|p=253|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4768-5589-9}}</ref> At the same time, Grohl was compiling and recording his own material, which he released on a cassette called ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]'' in 1992 on indie label Simple Machines.

In Grohl's initial months in Seattle, Cobain overheard him working on a song called \"Color Pictures of a Marigold\", and the two subsequently worked on it together. Grohl would later record the song for the ''Pocketwatch'' cassette. Grohl stated in a 2014 episode of ''[[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways]]'' that Cobain reacted by kissing him upon first hearing a demo of \"[[Alone + Easy Target]]\" that Grohl had recently recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/dave-grohl-opens-up-on-why-he-didnt-write-any-nirvana-songs|title=Dave Grohl opens up on why he didn't write any Nirvana songs|last=Louder|first=Briony Edwards2018-07-09T14:30:50Z|website=loudersound|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>\n\nDuring the sessions for ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'', Nirvana decided to re-record \"Color Pictures of a Marigold\" released this version as a B-side on the \"[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\" single, titled simply \"Marigold\". Grohl also contributed the main guitar riff for \"Scentless Apprentice\". Cobain admitted in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff was \"kind of boneheaded\", but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box set ''[[With the Lights Out]]''). Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-dave-grohl-on-kurts-last-days-and-the-making-of-in-utero-2-108580/|title=Dave Grohl on Kurt's Last Days|last=Fricke|first=David|date=2013-09-24|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513113138/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-dave-grohl-on-kurts-last-days-and-the-making-of-in-utero-2-108580/|archive-date=May 13, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nPrior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several of Grohl's songs, including future [[Foo Fighters]] songs \"Exhausted\", \"[[Big Me]]\", \"February Stars\", and \"Butterflies\". On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived, and the band recorded a demo of a song later named \"[[You Know You're Right]]\".

Nirvana's [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] rep [[Gary Gersh]] had subsequently taken over as president of [[Capitol Records]] and lured Grohl to sign with the label. Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career, so he recruited other band members: former Germs and touring Nirvana guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and two members of the recently disbanded [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[William Goldsmith]] (drums) and [[Nate Mendel]] (bass). Rather than re-record the album, Grohl's demo was given a professional mix by [[Rob Schnapf]] and [[Tom Rothrock]] and was released in July 1995 as Foo Fighters' [[Foo Fighters (album)|debut album]].\n\nDuring a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover of [[Gary Numan]]'s \"[[Down in the Park]]\". In February 1996, Grohl and his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood made a brief [[cameo appearance]] on  ''[[The X-Files]]'' third-season episode \"[[Pusher (The X-Files)|Pusher]]\".\n\nAfter touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the soundtrack to the 1997 movie ''[[Touch (1997 film)|Touch]]''. Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for vocals from [[Veruca Salt]] singer [[Louise Post]] on the title track, keyboards by Barrett Jones (who also co-produced the record) on one track, and vocals and guitar by [[X (American band)|X's]] [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] on \"This Loving Thing (Lynn's Song)\". Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined Foo Fighters to work on their follow-up.\n\nIn the midst of the initial sessions for Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and drummer William Goldsmith. According to Goldsmith, \"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one. [...] It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else\". Goldsmith also believed that Capitol and producer Gil Norton wanted Grohl to drum on the album.<ref name=\"roberts\">Roberts, Michael. \"[http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day Bring Back that Sunny Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20090825182828/http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day |date=August 25, 2009 }}\". ''Miami New Times''. December 3, 1998.</ref> With the album seemingly complete, Grohl headed home to Virginia with a copy of the rough mixes and found himself unhappy with the results. Grohl penned a few new songs, recording one of them, \"[[Walking After You]]\", by himself at a studio in Washington, D.C. Inspired by the session, Grohl opted to move the band, without Goldsmith's knowledge,<ref name=\"roberts\" /> to Los Angeles to re-record most of the album with Grohl behind the kit. After the sessions were complete, Goldsmith officially announced his departure from the band.\n\nSpeaking in 2011 about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl explained that \"there were a lot of reasons it didn't work out, but there was also a part of [him] that was like, you know, [he doesn't] know if [he's] finished playing the drums yet\". He also stated that he wished he had \"handled things differently\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWhsYINKcKM#t=2m56s|title=Oxegen 2011 \u2013 Foo Fighters Dave Grohl|publisher=YouTube|date=July 10, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dave Grohl in London.jpg|thumb|upright|Grohl on stage in 2006]]\nThe effort was released in May 1997 as the band's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', which eventually cemented Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio. The album spawned several hits, including \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\". Just prior to the album's release, former [[Alanis Morissette]] drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band on drums. The following September, Smear (a close friend of Jennifer Youngblood) left the band,<ref name=\"guardian\" /> citing a need to settle down following a lifetime of touring. Smear was subsequently replaced by Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]]. Stahl was kicked out of the band prior to recording of Foo Fighters' third album<ref name=\"guardian\" /> and was replaced by touring guitarist [[Chris Shiflett]], who later became a full-fledged member during the recording of ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.\n\nGrohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with Foo Fighters' popularity. During his infrequent pauses he lived in [[Seattle]] and Los Angeles before returning to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. It was there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the 1999 album ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' was recorded.<ref name=back>{{cite video|author=[[James Moll|Moll, James]] (director)|title=[[Foo Fighters: Back and Forth|Back and Forth]]|year=2011|medium=documentary|publisher=RCA}}</ref> It was recorded following the departure from Capitol and their former president Gary Gersh. Grohl described the recording experience as \"intoxicating at times\" because the band members were left completely to their own devices. He added, \"One of the advantages of finishing the record before we had a new label was that it was purely our creation. It was complete and not open to outside tampering.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/981242/0|journal=Billboard - the International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=October 16, 1999|access-date=2016-09-25|title=Foo Fighters had 'Nothing To Lose'|\nlast=Flick|first= Larry|volume=111|issue=42|pages=14\u201314, 44}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the band recruited [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] to add some guitar flourish to a cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Have a Cigar]]\", a song which Foo Fighters previously recorded as a b-side.

After four months in the studio, with the sessions finished, Grohl accepted an invitation to join [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and helped them to record their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. (Grohl can be seen drumming for the band in the video for the song \"[[No One Knows]]\".) After a brief tour through North America, Britain and Japan with the band<ref name=\"guardian\" /> and feeling rejuvenated by the effort, Grohl recalled the other band members to completely re-record their album at his studio in Virginia. The effort became their fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''. While initially pleased with the results, in another 2005 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Grohl admitted to not liking the record: \"Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.\"<ref>Scaggs, Austin.

When \"All My Life\" ended its run, after a one-week respite, \"[[No One Knows]]\" by Queens of the Stone Age took the number one spot. Between October 26, 2002 and March 1, 2003 Grohl was in the number one spot on the Modern rock charts for 17 of 18 successive weeks, as a member of three different groups.\n\nGrohl and Foo Fighters released their fifth album ''[[In Your Honor]]'' on June 14, 2005. Prior to starting work on the album, the band spent almost a year relocating Grohl's home-based Virginia studio to a brand new facility, dubbed [[Studio 606]], located in a warehouse near Los Angeles. Featuring collaborations with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Josh Homme]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and [[Norah Jones]], the album was a departure from previous efforts, and included one rock and one acoustic disc.\n\n[[File:Foo Fighters 2009.jpg|left|thumb|Foo Fighters in 2009, from left to right: Hawkins, Shiflett, Grohl, Mendel]]\nFoo Fighters' sixth studio album ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'' was released on September 25, 2007.

This was Sir Roger Moore's final film appearance and the film was dedicated to his memory; Moore portrayed Templar in a [[The Saint (TV series)|1960s TV series of the same title]]. Filmed in 2013 as a [[television pilot]] for a proposed TV series, the film was not originally intended for release when the series was not picked up. It eventually saw release direct-to-video in 2017 when it was released in tribute to Moore following his death. [[Ian Ogilvy]], who portrayed Templar in a 1970s TV series titled ''[[Return of the Saint]]'', also appears.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[Simon Templar]] intervenes when terrorists attempt to trade gold to the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] for bombs. After subduing both parties, he takes most of the gold and escapes, leaving his calling card as \"The Saint\". Agent Cooper of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has been monitoring the meeting.\n\n[[President of Nigeria|Nigerian President]] Ezekiel Ibaka secures $2.5 billion in private aid for his country, but a mysterious man ([[Ian Ogilvy]]) instructs associate Arnie Valecross, a private banker with criminal ties, to steal the funds. He gives Valecross a ring, claiming that it is an heirloom he took from \"someone pathetic\". \n\nTemplar takes the gold from the Moscow heist to an old friend in [[Bucharest]]. He gives instructions to distribute the funds among various [[humanitarian aid]] organizations. \n\nIn [[Los Angeles]], Valecross diverts the funds to one of his own accounts and requests protection from the FBI. His mysterious employer sends his henchman, Rayt Marius, to kidnap Valecross' daughter Zooey, giving Arnie only 48 hours to return the money. \n\nIn [[Paris, France]], Templar hears of the Nigerian theft and agrees to help recover the funds. Simon's friend [[Patricia Holm]] and the FBI each use their own methods to quickly identify the thief as Valecross and track him to the Grand Del Mar Resort in [[San Diego]].\n\nSpecial Agent John Henry Fernack, who has been pursuing The Saint for years, gets to Valecross' suite first and unsuccessfully attempts to question him. Templar uses the adjoining room to break into Valecross' suite, but he is discovered. Valecross asks Templar to rescue his daughter. Marius uses a helicopter to fire on Templar through the window. Templar shoots down the helicopter, but Valecross is fatally wounded. As he dies, Valecross tells Templar, \"The account numbers are in your ring, the key is in the nomad.\"\n\nSimon and Patricia engage Doyle Cosentino to develop a new plan now that Valecross is dead. It is revealed that Simon met Patricia in Iraq while escaping from the Russian deal. The trio search for the \"nomad\" in Valecross' home. Mrs Valecross immediately recognizes Templar. They decide to call Marius, who has a history with Patricia.\n\nFernack obtains help from the Los Angeles Police Department in the form of Detective Garces ([[Greg Grunberg]]). The two men nearly catch Simon when he, Patricia and Doyle leave the Valecross home. The trio notice the men tailing them and escape. Fernack catches up to Templar on a [[funicular]] railway car in a busy retail area. Simon overpowers and handcuffs him, escaping by jumping onto a car moving in the opposite direction. Simon, Patricia and Doyle visit former counterfeiter Sonali Alves in her hidden [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighting studio and gambling den. They ask for help breaking into Arnold Valecross' data storage facility. She forces Simon to battle a fighter in the ring while handcuffed in exchange for the heist gear he needs. During the fight, Simon's handcuffs are broken and he easily defeats his opponent.\n\nEntering the storage facility, Patricia knocks out the guards. She guides Simon as he penetrates the security on two heavy duty doors and disables the pressure-sensitive floor. He uses a glove that mimics fingerprints of a building employee to access the computer server room, and begins searching for the account data. Fernack arrives too late and Simon escapes with the data, locking Fernack in the server room. Outside he finds that Garces has been shot and that Marius has captured Patricia.\n\nFernack agrees to work with Simon to rescue Patricia and Zooey. Overpowering the armed guards on the boat, they attempt to trade the stolen funds for Marius' hostages. Marius reveals that Patricia is his ex-wife and that he is working for the man who killed Simon's parents. Fernack tries to rescue Zooey but is restrained by her stepmother, who is working with Marius. Templar shoots Marius when tries to use Zooey as a shield and Patricia knocks him to the floor. Marius refuses to identify his employer. \n\nZooey returns the money to President Ibaka. Templar evades Fernack. \n\nThe mysterious man calls for help from an associate ([[Roger Moore]]) who refuses him, knowing their superiors will make an example of him for his failure. Simon tails the mystery man, recognizing him as his parents' killer by a unique tattoo on his arm. Templar identifies him as Xander, hired by Simon's father to train Simon to fight. Resisting the urge to kill the man, Templar allows Xander to be arrested by Agent Cooper on terrorism charges.
