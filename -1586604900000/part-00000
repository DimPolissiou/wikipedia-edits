Di\u1ec7m was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|killed in a military coup]] led by general [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] in 1963, and a series of short-lived military governments followed. General [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] then led the country after a US-encouraged civilian presidential election from 1967 until 1975. The beginnings of the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in 1955 with an uprising by the newly organized [[National Liberation Front for South Vietnam]] (Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng), armed and supported by the [[North Vietnam]], with backing mainly from [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Larger escalation of the insurgency occurred in 1965 with [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|American intervention]] and the introduction of regular forces of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], followed by [[United States Army|Army]] units to supplement the cadre of military advisors guiding the [[Republic of Vietnam Military Forces|Southern armed forces]]. A [[Operation Rolling Thunder|regular bombing campaign]] over North Vietnam was conducted by offshore [[United States Navy|US Navy]] airplanes, warships, and aircraft carriers joined by [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] squadrons through 1966 and 1967. Fighting peaked up to that point during the [[Tet Offensive]] of February 1968, when there were over a million South Vietnamese soldiers and 500,000 [[United States Armed Forces|US soldiers]] in South Vietnam. Later on the war the initial guerrilla war turned into a more conventional fight as the balance of power became equalized. An even larger, armored invasion from the North commenced during the [[Easter Offensive]] following US ground-forces withdrawal, and had nearly overran some major northern cities until beaten back.\n\nDespite a truce agreement under the [[Paris Peace Accords]], concluded in January 1973, after a torturous five years of on and off negotiations, fighting continued almost immediately afterwards. The regular [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese army]] and Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng auxiliaries launched a major [[1975 Spring Offensive|second combined-arms conventional invasion in 1975]]. Communist forces [[Fall of Saigon|overran Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, marking the end of the Republic of Vietnam. On 2 July 1976, the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] (which had taken over administration of the country) and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (then the government of [[North Vietnam]]) merged to form the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Vietnam}}\nThe official name of the South Vietnamese state was ''Vi\u1ec7t Nam C\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a'' (Republic of Vietnam) and the French name was referred to as ''R\u00e9publique du Vi\u00eat Nam''.

A French governor-general (to\u00e0n quy\u1ec1n) in [[Hanoi]] administered all the five parts of Indochina ([[Tonkin]], [[Name of Vietnam|Annam]], [[Cochinchina]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia]]) while Cochinchina (Nam K\u1ef3) was under a French governor (th\u1ed1ng \u0111\u1ed1c), but the difference from the other parts with most indigenous intelligensia and wealthy were naturalized French (Tourane now \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng in the central third of Vietnam also enjoyed this privilege because this city was a concession too.) The northern third of Vietnam (then the [[colony]] (thu\u1ed9c \u0111\u1ecba) of [[Tonkin]] (B\u1eafc K\u1ef3) was under a French resident general (th\u1ed1ng s\u1ee9). Between Tonkin in the north and Cochinchina in the south was the protectorate (x\u1ee9 b\u1ea3o h\u1ed9) of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] (Trung K\u1ef3), under a French resident superior (kh\u00e2m s\u1ee9). A Vietnamese emperor, [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], residing in [[Hu\u1ebf]], was the nominal ruler of Annam and Tonkin, which had parallel French and Vietnamese systems of administration, but his influence was less in Tonkin than in Annam. Cochinchina had been annexed by France in 1862 and even elected a deputy to the [[French National Assembly]]. It was more [[\u00c9volu\u00e9|\"evolved\"]], and French interests were stronger than in other parts of Indochina, notably in the form of French-owned [[rubber plantation]]s. [[French Indochina in World War II|During World War II]], Indochina was administered by [[Vichy France]] and occupied by Japan in September 1940. Japanese troops [[Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina|overthrew the Vichy administration]] on 9 March 1945, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i proclaimed Vietnam independent. When the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrendered]] on 16 August 1945, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i abdicated, and Vi\u1ec7t Minh leader [[Ho Chi Minh|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]] proclaimed the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (DRV) in Hanoi and the [[August Revolution|DRV controlled almost the entire country of Vietnam]]. In June 1946, [[France]] declared Cochinchina a republic, separate from the northern and central parts. A [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Kuomintang army]] arrived to occupy Vietnam's north of the [[16th parallel north]], while a British led force occupied the south in September. The British-led force facilitated the return of French forces who [[War in Vietnam (1945\u201346)|fought the Viet Minh]] for control of the cities and towns of the south. The [[French Indochina War]] began on 19 December 1946, with the French regaining control of Hanoi and many other cities.\n\nThe [[State of Vietnam]] was created through co-operation between [[anti-communist]] Vietnamese and the French government on 14 June 1949. Former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i accepted the position of chief of state (''qu\u1ed1c tr\u01b0\u1edfng''). This was known as the \"B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i Solution\". The colonial struggle in Vietnam became part of the global [[Cold War]]. In 1950, China, the [[Soviet Union]] and other communist nations recognised the DRV while the United States and other non-communist states recognised the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i government.\n\nIn July 1954, France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh agreed at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] that the Vietnam would be temporarily divided at [[17th parallel north]] and State of Vietnam would rule the territory south of the 17th parallel, pending unification on the basis of supervised elections in 1956. At the time of the conference, it was expected that the South would continue to be a French dependency. However, South Vietnamese Premier [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]], who preferred American sponsorship to French, rejected the agreement. When Vietnam was divided, 800,000 to 1 million North Vietnamese, mainly (but not exclusively) Roman Catholics, sailed south as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]] due to a fear of religious persecution in the North.

Kennedy#Presidency|Kennedy administration]], due to its repression of Buddhists and military defeats by the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng. Notably, the [[Hu\u1ebf Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u1ea3n shootings]] of 8 May 1963 led to the [[Buddhist crisis]], provoking widespread protests and [[civil resistance]]. Di\u1ec7m was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|overthrown in a coup]] on 1 November 1963 with the tacit approval of the US.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nDi\u1ec7m's removal and assassination set off a period of political instability and declining legitimacy of the Saigon government. General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] became president, but he was [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|ousted in January 1964]] by General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]]. [[Phan Kh\u1eafc S\u1eedu]] was named head of state, but power remained with a junta of generals led by Kh\u00e1nh, which soon fell to infighting. Meanwhile, the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] of 2 August 1964 led to a dramatic increase in direct American participation in the war, with nearly 200,000 troops deployed by the end of the year. Kh\u00e1nh sought to capitalize on the crisis with the [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Charter]], a new constitution that would have curtailed civil liberties and concentrated his power, but was forced to back down in the face of widespread protests and strikes. Coup attempts followed [[September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt|in September]] and February, the latter resulting in Air Marshall [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] becoming prime minister and General [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] becoming nominal head of state.\n\nK\u1ef3 and Thieu functioned in those roles until 1967, bringing much-desired stability to the government. They imposed censorship and suspended civil liberties, and intensified anticommunist efforts. Under pressure from the US, they held elections for president and the legislature in 1967. The [[1967 South Vietnamese Senate election|Senate election]] took place on 2 September 1967. The [[1967 South Vietnamese presidential election|Presidential election]] took place on 3 September 1967, Thi\u1ec7u was elected president with 34% of the vote in a widely criticised poll. The [[1967 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|Parliamentary election]] took place on 22 October 1967.\n\nOn 31 January 1968, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng broke the traditional truce accompanying the [[T\u1ebft]] (Lunar New Year) holiday. The [[Tet Offensive]] failed to spark a national uprising and was militarily disastrous. By bringing the war to South Vietnam's cities, however, and by demonstrating the continued strength of communist forces, it marked a turning point in US support for the government in South Vietnam. The new administration of [[Richard Nixon]] introduced a policy of [[Vietnamization]] to reduce US combat involvement and began negotiations with the North Vietnamese to end the war. Thi\u1ec7u used the aftermath of the Tet Offensive to sideline K\u1ef3, his chief rival.\n\nOn 26 March 1970 the government began to implement the Land-to-the-Tiller program of land reform with the US providing US$339m of the program's US$441m cost. Individual landholdings were limited to 15 hectares.\n\nUS and South Vietnamese forces launched a series of [[Cambodian campaign|attacks on PAVN/VC bases]] in [[Cambodia]] in April\u2013July 1970. South Vietnam launched an [[Operation Lam Son 719|invasion]] of North Vietnamese bases in [[Laos]] in February/March 1971 and were defeated by the PAVN in what was widely regarded as a setback for Vietnamization.\n\nThi\u1ec7u was reelected unopposed in the [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|Presidential election]] on 2 October 1971.\n\nNorth Vietnam launched a [[Easter Offensive|conventional invasion]] of South Vietnam in late March 1972 which was only finally repulsed by October with massive US air support.\n\n===1973\u20131975===\nIn accordance with the [[Paris Peace Accords]] signed on 27 January 1973, US military forces withdrew from South Vietnam at the end of March 1973 while PAVN forces in the South were permitted to remain in place.\n\nNorth Vietnamese leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favour their side, but as Saigon began to roll back the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng, they found it necessary to adopt a new strategy, hammered out at a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973, according to the memoirs of [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0]]. As the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's top commander, Tr\u00e0 participated in several of these meetings. A plan to improve logistics was prepared so that the PAVN would be able to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for 1976. A gas pipeline would be built from North Vietnam to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng provisional capital in [[L\u1ed9c Ninh, B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc|L\u1ed9c Ninh]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of Saigon.\n\nOn 15 March 1973, US President [[Richard Nixon]] implied that the US would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire. Public reaction was unfavorable, and on 4 June 1973 the [[US Senate]] passed the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]] to prohibit such intervention. The [[1973 oil crisis|oil price shock of October 1973]] caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy. A spokesman for Thi\u1ec7u admitted in a TV interview that the government was being \"overwhelmed\" by the inflation caused by the oil shock, while an American businessman living in Saigon stated after the oil shock that attempting to make money in South Vietnam was \"like making love to a corpse\".<ref>Cooper, Andrew Scott ''The Oil Kings How the US, [[Iran]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] Changed the Balance of Power in the Middle East'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 2011 p.  205</ref> One consequence of the inflation was the South Vietnamese government had increasing difficulty in paying its soldiers and imposed restrictions on fuel and munition usage. After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thieu announced on 4 January 1974 that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There were over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=1592 This Day in History 1974: Thieu announces war has resumed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225151920/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=1592 |date=25 February 2009 }}</ref> Also in January 1974 China attacked South Vietnamese forces in the [[Battle of the Paracel Islands|Paracel Islands]] taking control of the islands.\n\nIn August 1974, Nixon was forced to resign as a result of the [[Watergate scandal]], and the [[US Congress]] voted to reduce assistance to South Vietnam from $1&nbsp;billion a year to $700&nbsp;million. By this time, the Ho Chi Minh trail, once an arduous mountain trek, had been upgraded into a drivable highway with gasoline stations.\n\nIn December 1974, the PAVN [[Battle of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long|launched an invasion at Phuoc Long]] to test two things: South Vietnamese combat strength and political will and whether the US would respond militarily. With no US military assistance forthcoming the ARVN were unable to hold and the PAVN successfully captured many of the districts around the provincial capital of Phuoc Long weakening ARVN resistance in stronghold areas. President Thieu later abandoned Phuoc Long in early January 1975. As a result, Phuoc Long was the first provincial capital to fall to the PAVN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1974/12/13/battle-of-phuoc-long-begins|title=Battle of Phuoc Long Begins|website=World History Project|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the PAVN launched an [[Battle of Ban Me Thuot|offensive at Ban Me Thuot]] in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], in the first phase of what became known as the [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]]. The South Vietnamese unsuccessfully attempted a defence and counterattack but had few reserve forces, as well as a shortage of spare parts and ammunition. As a consequence, Thi\u1ec7u ordered a withdrawal of key army units from the Central Highlands, which exacerbated an already perilous military situation and undermined the confidence of the ARVN soldiers in their leadership. The retreat became a rout exacerbated by poor planning and conflicting orders from Thi\u1ec7u. PAVN forces also attacked south and from sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia [[Hue\u2013Da Nang Campaign|capturing Hu\u1ebf and Da Nang]] and advanced southwards. As the military situation deteriorated, ARVN troops started deserting. By early April, South Vietnam had lost almost 3/5th of the country.\n\nThi\u1ec7u requested aid from US President [[Gerald Ford]], but the US Senate would not release extra money to provide aid to South Vietnam, and had already passed laws to prevent further involvement in Vietnam. In desperation, Thi\u1ec7u recalled K\u1ef3 from retirement as a military commander, but resisted calls to name his old rival prime minister.\n\n===Fall of Saigon: April 1975===\n{{main|Fall of Saigon|Operation Frequent Wind}}\n\nMorale was low in South Vietnam as the PAVN advanced. A last-ditch defense was made by the ARVN [[18th Division (South Vietnam)|18th Division]] at the [[Battle of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c]] from 9\u201321 April. Thi\u1ec7u resigned on 21 April 1975, and fled to [[Taiwan]]. He nominated his Vice President [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] as his successor. After only one week in office, the South Vietnamese national assembly voted to hand over the presidency to General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh. Minh was seen as a more conciliatory figure toward the North, and it was hoped he might be able to negotiate a more favourable settlement to end the war. The North, however, was not interested in negotiations, and its forces [[Fall of Saigon|captured Saigon]]. Minh [[Unconditional surrender|unconditionally surrendered]] Saigon and the rest of South Vietnam to North Vietnam on 30 April 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1975/Fall-of-Saigon/12305821478075-2/|title=Fall of Saigon - 1975 Year in Review - Audio - UPI.com|website=UPI}}</ref>\n\nDuring the hours leading up to the surrender, the United States undertook a massive [[Operation Frequent Wind|evacuation]] of US government personnel as well as high-ranking members of the ARVN and other South Vietnamese who were seen as potential targets for persecution by the Communists. Many of the evacuees were taken directly by helicopter to multiple [[aircraft carrier]]s waiting off the coast. An iconic image of the evacuation is the widely seen footage of empty [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]] helicopters being jettisoned over the side of the carriers, to provide more room on the ship's deck for more evacuees to land.\n\n=== Provisional Revolutionary Government ===\n{{main|Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam}}\nFollowing the surrender of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces on 30 April 1975, the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] officially became the government of South Vietnam. Subsequently, the provisional government and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] would merge into the current government of [[Vietnam]] in 2 July 1976.\n\n== Government ==<!--This section is linked from [[Senate]]-->\n{{see|1955 State of Vietnam referendum|1959 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt|1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing|Buddhist crisis|Hu\u1ebf Vesak shootings|X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda raids|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|1964 South Vietnamese coup}}\n\nSouth Vietnam went through many political changes during its short life. Initially, former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i served as [[Head of State]]. He was unpopular however, largely because monarchical leaders were considered collaborators during French rule and because he had spent his reign absent in France.\n\nIn 1955, Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m held a [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|referendum]] to decide whether the State of Vietnam would remain a [[monarchy]] or become a republic. This referendum was blatantly rigged in favor of a republic. Not only did an implausible 98% vote in favor of deposing B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, but over 380,000 more votes were cast than the total number of registered voters; in [[Saigon]], for instance, Di\u1ec7m was credited with 133% of the vote. Di\u1ec7m proclaimed himself the president of the newly formed Republic of Vietnam. Despite successes in politics, economics and social change in the first 5 years, Di\u1ec7m quickly became a dictatorial leader. With the support of the United States government and the [[CIA]], ARVN officers led by General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh staged a coup and killed him in 1963. The military held a brief interim military government until General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|deposed Minh]] in a January 1964 coup. Until late 1965, multiple coups and changes of government occurred, with some civilians being allowed to give a semblance of civil rule overseen by a military junta.\n\nIn 1965, the feuding civilian government voluntarily resigned and handed power back to the nation's military, in the hope this would bring stability and unity to the nation. An elected constituent assembly including representatives of all the branches of the military decided to switch the nation's system of government to a Semi-Presidential system. Military rule initially failed to provide much stability however, as internal conflicts and political inexperience caused various factions of the army to launch coups and counter-coups against one another, making leadership very tumultuous. The situation within the ranks of the military stabilised in mid-1965 when the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] chief Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 became Prime Minister, with General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u as the figurehead chief of state. As Prime Minister, K\u1ef3 consolidated control of the South Vietnamese government and ruled the country with an iron fist.<ref name=Farber>{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=David Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1412710091}}</ref>{{rp|273}}\n\nIn June 1965, K\u1ef3's influence over the ruling military government was solidified when he forced civilian prime minister [[Phan Huy Qu\u00e1t]] from power.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|232}} Often praising aspects of Western culture in public,<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} Ky was supported by the United States and its allied nations,<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} though doubts began to circulate among Western officials by 1966 on whether or not Ky could maintain stability in South Vietnam.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} A repressive leader, Ky was greatly despised by his fellow countrymen.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}} In early 1966, protesters influenced by popular [[Buddhist monk]] [[Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Quang]] attempted an [[Buddhist Uprising|uprising]] in Quang's hometown of Da Nang.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}} The uprising was unsuccessful and Ky's repressive stance towards the nation's Buddhist population continued.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}}\n\nIn 1967, the [[unicameral]] [[1956 South Vietnamese Constitutional Assembly election|National Assembly]] was replaced by a [[bicameral]] system consisting of a [[1967 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|Parliament]] or Lower House (''Ha Nghi Vi\u1ec7n'') and a [[1967 South Vietnamese Senate election|Senate]] or Upper House (''Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Nghi Vi\u1ec7n'') and South Vietnam held its first elections under the new system. The military nominated Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u as their candidate, and he was [[1967 South Vietnamese presidential election|elected]] with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote. Thieu quickly consolidated power much to the dismay of those who hoped for an era of more political openness. He was [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|re-elected]] unopposed in 1971, receiving a suspiciously high 94% of the vote on an 87% turn-out. Thieu ruled until the final days of the war, resigning on 21 April 1975. Vice-President Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng assumed power for a week, but on 27 April the Parliament and Senate voted to transfer power to D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh who was the nation's last president and who unconditionally surrendered to the Communist forces on 30 April 1975.\n\nThe National Assembly/Parliament was located in the Saigon Opera House, now the [[Municipal Theatre, Ho Chi Minh City]],<ref name=Doling>{{cite book|last=Doling|first=Tim|title=Exploring Saigon-Cholon \u2013 Vanishing Heritage of Ho Cho Minh City|publisher=Th\u1ebf Gi\u1edbi Publishers|year=2019|isbn=9786047761388}}</ref>{{rp|100}} while the Senate was located at 45-47 B\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng Street (''B\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng''), District 1, originally the Chamber of Commerce, and now the [[Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange]].<ref name=Doling/>{{rp|218}}\n\nThe South Vietnamese government was regularly accused of holding large quantity of political prisoners, of which the exact number was a source of contention. [[Amnesty International]], in a report in 1973, gave the estimation of number of South Vietnam's civilian prisoners ranging from 35,257 (as confirmed by Saigon) to 200,000 or more. Among them, approximately 22,000\u201341,000 were accounted \"communist\" political prisoners.<ref>Report No. ASA 41/001/1973, [https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/204000/asa410011973en.pdf \"Political Prisoners in South Vietnam\"], Amnesty International, 1 January 1973, p. 6-8.</ref> Robert F.

After the [[Second World War]], the anti-Japanese [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] guerrilla forces, led by [[Ho Chi Minh]], proclaimed the establishment of a [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] in [[Hanoi]] in September 1945, issuing a [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Declaration of Independence]] modeled on the [[United States Declaration of Independence|US one from 1776]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/opinion/the-end-of-south-vietnam.html|title=The End of South Vietnam|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 March 2018|last1=Huynh|first1=Dien}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, anti-communist [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] politicians formed a rival government in Saigon led by former [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|emperor]] [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]].

Di\u1ec7m was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|killed in a military coup]] led by general [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] in 1963, and a series of short-lived military governments followed. General [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] then led the country after a US-encouraged civilian presidential election from 1967 until 1975. The beginnings of the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in 1955 with an uprising by the newly organized [[National Liberation Front for South Vietnam]] (Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng), armed and supported by the [[North Vietnam]], with backing mainly from [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Larger escalation of the insurgency occurred in 1965 with [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|American intervention]] and the introduction of regular forces of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], followed by [[United States Army|Army]] units to supplement the cadre of military advisors guiding the [[Republic of Vietnam Military Forces|Southern armed forces]]. A [[Operation Rolling Thunder|regular bombing campaign]] over North Vietnam was conducted by offshore [[United States Navy|US Navy]] airplanes, warships, and aircraft carriers joined by [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] squadrons through 1966 and 1967. Fighting peaked up to that point during the [[Tet Offensive]] of February 1968, when there were over a million South Vietnamese soldiers and 500,000 [[United States Armed Forces|US soldiers]] in South Vietnam. Later on the war the initial guerrilla war turned into a more conventional fight as the balance of power became equalized. An even larger, armored invasion from the North commenced during the [[Easter Offensive]] following US ground-forces withdrawal, and had nearly overran some major northern cities until beaten back.\n\nDespite a truce agreement under the [[Paris Peace Accords]], concluded in January 1973, after a torturous five years of on and off negotiations, fighting continued almost immediately afterwards. The regular [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese army]] and Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng auxiliaries launched a major [[1975 Spring Offensive|second combined-arms conventional invasion in 1975]]. Communist forces [[Fall of Saigon|overran Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, marking the end of the Republic of Vietnam. On 2 July 1976, the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] (which had taken over administration of the country) and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (then the government of [[North Vietnam]]) merged to form the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Vietnam}}\nThe official name of the South Vietnamese state was ''Vi\u1ec7t Nam C\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a'' (Republic of Vietnam) and the French name was referred to as ''R\u00e9publique du Vi\u00eat Nam''.

A French governor-general (to\u00e0n quy\u1ec1n) in [[Hanoi]] administered all the five parts of Indochina ([[Tonkin]], [[Name of Vietnam|Annam]], [[Cochinchina]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia]]) while Cochinchina (Nam K\u1ef3) was under a French governor (th\u1ed1ng \u0111\u1ed1c), but the difference from the other parts with most indigenous intelligensia and wealthy were naturalized French (Tourane now \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng in the central third of Vietnam also enjoyed this privilege because this city was a concession too.) The northern third of Vietnam (then the [[colony]] (thu\u1ed9c \u0111\u1ecba) of [[Tonkin]] (B\u1eafc K\u1ef3) was under a French resident general (th\u1ed1ng s\u1ee9). Between Tonkin in the north and Cochinchina in the south was the protectorate (x\u1ee9 b\u1ea3o h\u1ed9) of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] (Trung K\u1ef3), under a French resident superior (kh\u00e2m s\u1ee9). A Vietnamese emperor, [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], residing in [[Hu\u1ebf]], was the nominal ruler of Annam and Tonkin, which had parallel French and Vietnamese systems of administration, but his influence was less in Tonkin than in Annam. Cochinchina had been annexed by France in 1862 and even elected a deputy to the [[French National Assembly]]. It was more [[\u00c9volu\u00e9|\"evolved\"]], and French interests were stronger than in other parts of Indochina, notably in the form of French-owned [[rubber plantation]]s. [[French Indochina in World War II|During World War II]], Indochina was administered by [[Vichy France]] and occupied by Japan in September 1940. Japanese troops [[Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina|overthrew the Vichy administration]] on 9 March 1945, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i proclaimed Vietnam independent. When the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrendered]] on 16 August 1945, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i abdicated, and Vi\u1ec7t Minh leader [[Ho Chi Minh|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]] proclaimed the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (DRV) in Hanoi and the [[August Revolution|DRV controlled almost the entire country of Vietnam]]. In June 1946, [[France]] declared Cochinchina a republic, separate from the northern and central parts. A [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Kuomintang army]] arrived to occupy Vietnam's north of the [[16th parallel north]], while a British led force occupied the south in September. The British-led force facilitated the return of French forces who [[War in Vietnam (1945\u201346)|fought the Viet Minh]] for control of the cities and towns of the south. The [[French Indochina War]] began on 19 December 1946, with the French regaining control of Hanoi and many other cities.\n\nThe [[State of Vietnam]] was created through co-operation between [[anti-communist]] Vietnamese and the French government on 14 June 1949. Former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i accepted the position of chief of state (''qu\u1ed1c tr\u01b0\u1edfng''). This was known as the \"B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i Solution\". The colonial struggle in Vietnam became part of the global [[Cold War]]. In 1950, China, the [[Soviet Union]] and other communist nations recognised the DRV while the United States and other non-communist states recognised the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i government.\n\nIn July 1954, France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh agreed at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] that the Vietnam would be temporarily divided at [[17th parallel north]] and State of Vietnam would rule the territory south of the 17th parallel, pending unification on the basis of supervised elections in 1956. At the time of the conference, it was expected that the South would continue to be a French dependency. However, South Vietnamese Premier [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]], who preferred American sponsorship to French, rejected the agreement. When Vietnam was divided, 800,000 to 1 million North Vietnamese, mainly (but not exclusively) Roman Catholics, sailed south as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]] due to a fear of religious persecution in the North. About 90,000 Vi\u1ec7t Minh were evacuated to the North while 5,000 to 10,000 cadre remained in the South, most of them with orders to refocus on political activity and agitation.<ref name=Pentagon>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent14.htm |title=Origins of the Insurgency in South Vietnam, 1954\u20131960|work=The Pentagon Papers|year=1971|pages=242\u2013314}}</ref> The Saigon-Cholon Peace Committee, the first [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] front, was founded in 1954 to provide leadership for this group.<ref name=Pentagon/>\n\n===1955\u20131963===\n{{main|Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m}}\n{{see also|1955 State of Vietnam referendum|Battle of Saigon (1955)}}\n[[File:Ngo Dinh Diem at Washington - ARC 542189.jpg|thumb|US President [[Dwight D.

Kennedy#Presidency|Kennedy administration]], due to its repression of Buddhists and military defeats by the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng. Notably, the [[Hu\u1ebf Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u1ea3n shootings]] of 8 May 1963 led to the [[Buddhist crisis]], provoking widespread protests and [[civil resistance]]. Di\u1ec7m was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|overthrown in a coup]] on 1 November 1963 with the tacit approval of the US.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nDi\u1ec7m's removal and assassination set off a period of political instability and declining legitimacy of the Saigon government. General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] became president, but he was [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|ousted in January 1964]] by General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]]. [[Phan Kh\u1eafc S\u1eedu]] was named head of state, but power remained with a junta of generals led by Kh\u00e1nh, which soon fell to infighting. Meanwhile, the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] of 2 August 1964 led to a dramatic increase in direct American participation in the war, with nearly 200,000 troops deployed by the end of the year. Kh\u00e1nh sought to capitalize on the crisis with the [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Charter]], a new constitution that would have curtailed civil liberties and concentrated his power, but was forced to back down in the face of widespread protests and strikes. Coup attempts followed [[September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt|in September]] and February, the latter resulting in Air Marshall [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] becoming prime minister and General [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] becoming nominal head of state.\n\nK\u1ef3 and Thieu functioned in those roles until 1967, bringing much-desired stability to the government. They imposed censorship and suspended civil liberties, and intensified anticommunist efforts. Under pressure from the US, they held elections for president and the legislature in 1967. The [[1967 South Vietnamese Senate election|Senate election]] took place on 2 September 1967. The [[1967 South Vietnamese presidential election|Presidential election]] took place on 3 September 1967, Thi\u1ec7u was elected president with 34% of the vote in a widely criticised poll. The [[1967 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|Parliamentary election]] took place on 22 October 1967.\n\nOn 31 January 1968, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng broke the traditional truce accompanying the [[T\u1ebft]] (Lunar New Year) holiday. The [[Tet Offensive]] failed to spark a national uprising and was militarily disastrous. By bringing the war to South Vietnam's cities, however, and by demonstrating the continued strength of communist forces, it marked a turning point in US support for the government in South Vietnam. The new administration of [[Richard Nixon]] introduced a policy of [[Vietnamization]] to reduce US combat involvement and began negotiations with the North Vietnamese to end the war. Thi\u1ec7u used the aftermath of the Tet Offensive to sideline K\u1ef3, his chief rival.\n\nOn 26 March 1970 the government began to implement the Land-to-the-Tiller program of land reform with the US providing US$339m of the program's US$441m cost. Individual landholdings were limited to 15 hectares.\n\nUS and South Vietnamese forces launched a series of [[Cambodian campaign|attacks on PAVN/VC bases]] in [[Cambodia]] in April\u2013July 1970. South Vietnam launched an [[Operation Lam Son 719|invasion]] of North Vietnamese bases in [[Laos]] in February/March 1971 and were defeated by the PAVN in what was widely regarded as a setback for Vietnamization.\n\nThi\u1ec7u was reelected unopposed in the [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|Presidential election]] on 2 October 1971.\n\nNorth Vietnam launched a [[Easter Offensive|conventional invasion]] of South Vietnam in late March 1972 which was only finally repulsed by October with massive US air support.\n\n===1973\u20131975===\nIn accordance with the [[Paris Peace Accords]] signed on 27 January 1973, US military forces withdrew from South Vietnam at the end of March 1973 while PAVN forces in the South were permitted to remain in place.\n\nNorth Vietnamese leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favour their side, but as Saigon began to roll back the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng, they found it necessary to adopt a new strategy, hammered out at a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973, according to the memoirs of [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0]]. As the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's top commander, Tr\u00e0 participated in several of these meetings. A plan to improve logistics was prepared so that the PAVN would be able to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for 1976. A gas pipeline would be built from North Vietnam to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng provisional capital in [[L\u1ed9c Ninh, B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc|L\u1ed9c Ninh]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of Saigon.\n\nOn 15 March 1973, US President [[Richard Nixon]] implied that the US would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire. Public reaction was unfavorable, and on 4 June 1973 the [[US Senate]] passed the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]] to prohibit such intervention. The [[1973 oil crisis|oil price shock of October 1973]] caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy. A spokesman for Thi\u1ec7u admitted in a TV interview that the government was being \"overwhelmed\" by the inflation caused by the oil shock, while an American businessman living in Saigon stated after the oil shock that attempting to make money in South Vietnam was \"like making love to a corpse\".<ref>Cooper, Andrew Scott ''The Oil Kings How the US, [[Iran]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] Changed the Balance of Power in the Middle East'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 2011 p.  205</ref> One consequence of the inflation was the South Vietnamese government had increasing difficulty in paying its soldiers and imposed restrictions on fuel and munition usage. After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thieu announced on 4 January 1974 that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There were over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=1592 This Day in History 1974: Thieu announces war has resumed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225151920/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=1592 |date=25 February 2009 }}</ref> Also in January 1974 China attacked South Vietnamese forces in the [[Battle of the Paracel Islands|Paracel Islands]] taking control of the islands.\n\nIn August 1974, Nixon was forced to resign as a result of the [[Watergate scandal]], and the [[US Congress]] voted to reduce assistance to South Vietnam from $1&nbsp;billion a year to $700&nbsp;million. By this time, the Ho Chi Minh trail, once an arduous mountain trek, had been upgraded into a drivable highway with gasoline stations.\n\nIn December 1974, the PAVN [[Battle of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long|launched an invasion at Phuoc Long]] to test two things: South Vietnamese combat strength and political will and whether the US would respond militarily. With no US military assistance forthcoming the ARVN were unable to hold and the PAVN successfully captured many of the districts around the provincial capital of Phuoc Long weakening ARVN resistance in stronghold areas. President Thieu later abandoned Phuoc Long in early January 1975. As a result, Phuoc Long was the first provincial capital to fall to the PAVN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1974/12/13/battle-of-phuoc-long-begins|title=Battle of Phuoc Long Begins|website=World History Project|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the PAVN launched an [[Battle of Ban Me Thuot|offensive at Ban Me Thuot]] in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], in the first phase of what became known as the [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]]. The South Vietnamese unsuccessfully attempted a defence and counterattack but had few reserve forces, as well as a shortage of spare parts and ammunition. As a consequence, Thi\u1ec7u ordered a withdrawal of key army units from the Central Highlands, which exacerbated an already perilous military situation and undermined the confidence of the ARVN soldiers in their leadership. The retreat became a rout exacerbated by poor planning and conflicting orders from Thi\u1ec7u. PAVN forces also attacked south and from sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia [[Hue\u2013Da Nang Campaign|capturing Hu\u1ebf and Da Nang]] and advanced southwards. As the military situation deteriorated, ARVN troops started deserting. By early April, South Vietnam had lost almost 3/5th of the country.\n\nThi\u1ec7u requested aid from US President [[Gerald Ford]], but the US Senate would not release extra money to provide aid to South Vietnam, and had already passed laws to prevent further involvement in Vietnam. In desperation, Thi\u1ec7u recalled K\u1ef3 from retirement as a military commander, but resisted calls to name his old rival prime minister.\n\n===Fall of Saigon: April 1975===\n{{main|Fall of Saigon|Operation Frequent Wind}}\n\nMorale was low in South Vietnam as the PAVN advanced. A last-ditch defense was made by the ARVN [[18th Division (South Vietnam)|18th Division]] at the [[Battle of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c]] from 9\u201321 April. Thi\u1ec7u resigned on 21 April 1975, and fled to [[Taiwan]]. He nominated his Vice President [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] as his successor. After only one week in office, the South Vietnamese national assembly voted to hand over the presidency to General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh. Minh was seen as a more conciliatory figure toward the North, and it was hoped he might be able to negotiate a more favourable settlement to end the war. The North, however, was not interested in negotiations, and its forces [[Fall of Saigon|captured Saigon]].

Many of the evacuees were taken directly by helicopter to multiple [[aircraft carrier]]s waiting off the coast. An iconic image of the evacuation is the widely seen footage of empty [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]] helicopters being jettisoned over the side of the carriers, to provide more room on the ship's deck for more evacuees to land.\n\n=== Provisional Revolutionary Government ===\n{{main|Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam}}\nFollowing the surrender of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces on 30 April 1975, the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] officially became the government of South Vietnam. Subsequently, the provisional government and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] would merge into the current government of [[Vietnam]] in 2 July 1976.\n\n== Government ==<!--This section is linked from [[Senate]]-->\n{{see|1955 State of Vietnam referendum|1959 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt|1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing|Buddhist crisis|Hu\u1ebf Vesak shootings|X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda raids|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|1964 South Vietnamese coup}}\n\nSouth Vietnam went through many political changes during its short life. Initially, former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i served as [[Head of State]]. He was unpopular however, largely because monarchical leaders were considered collaborators during French rule and because he had spent his reign absent in France.\n\nIn 1955, Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m held a [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|referendum]] to decide whether the State of Vietnam would remain a [[monarchy]] or become a republic. This referendum was blatantly rigged in favor of a republic. Not only did an implausible 98% vote in favor of deposing B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, but over 380,000 more votes were cast than the total number of registered voters; in [[Saigon]], for instance, Di\u1ec7m was credited with 133% of the vote. Di\u1ec7m proclaimed himself the president of the newly formed Republic of Vietnam. Despite successes in politics, economics and social change in the first 5 years, Di\u1ec7m quickly became a dictatorial leader. With the support of the United States government and the [[CIA]], ARVN officers led by General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh staged a coup and killed him in 1963. The military held a brief interim military government until General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|deposed Minh]] in a January 1964 coup. Until late 1965, multiple coups and changes of government occurred, with some civilians being allowed to give a semblance of civil rule overseen by a military junta.\n\nIn 1965, the feuding civilian government voluntarily resigned and handed power back to the nation's military, in the hope this would bring stability and unity to the nation. An elected constituent assembly including representatives of all the branches of the military decided to switch the nation's system of government to a Semi-Presidential system. Military rule initially failed to provide much stability however, as internal conflicts and political inexperience caused various factions of the army to launch coups and counter-coups against one another, making leadership very tumultuous. The situation within the ranks of the military stabilised in mid-1965 when the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] chief Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 became Prime Minister, with General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u as the figurehead chief of state. As Prime Minister, K\u1ef3 consolidated control of the South Vietnamese government and ruled the country with an iron fist.<ref name=Farber>{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=David Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1412710091}}</ref>{{rp|273}}\n\nIn June 1965, K\u1ef3's influence over the ruling military government was solidified when he forced civilian prime minister [[Phan Huy Qu\u00e1t]] from power.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|232}} Often praising aspects of Western culture in public,<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} Ky was supported by the United States and its allied nations,<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} though doubts began to circulate among Western officials by 1966 on whether or not Ky could maintain stability in South Vietnam.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} A repressive leader, Ky was greatly despised by his fellow countrymen.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}} In early 1966, protesters influenced by popular [[Buddhist monk]] [[Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Quang]] attempted an [[Buddhist Uprising|uprising]] in Quang's hometown of Da Nang.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}} The uprising was unsuccessful and Ky's repressive stance towards the nation's Buddhist population continued.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}}\n\nIn 1967, the [[unicameral]] [[1956 South Vietnamese Constitutional Assembly election|National Assembly]] was replaced by a [[bicameral]] system consisting of a [[1967 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|Parliament]] or Lower House (''Ha Nghi Vi\u1ec7n'') and a [[1967 South Vietnamese Senate election|Senate]] or Upper House (''Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Nghi Vi\u1ec7n'') and South Vietnam held its first elections under the new system. The military nominated Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u as their candidate, and he was [[1967 South Vietnamese presidential election|elected]] with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote. Thieu quickly consolidated power much to the dismay of those who hoped for an era of more political openness. He was [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|re-elected]] unopposed in 1971, receiving a suspiciously high 94% of the vote on an 87% turn-out. Thieu ruled until the final days of the war, resigning on 21 April 1975. Vice-President Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng assumed power for a week, but on 27 April the Parliament and Senate voted to transfer power to D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh who was the nation's last president and who unconditionally surrendered to the Communist forces on 30 April 1975.\n\nThe National Assembly/Parliament was located in the Saigon Opera House, now the [[Municipal Theatre, Ho Chi Minh City]],<ref name=Doling>{{cite book|last=Doling|first=Tim|title=Exploring Saigon-Cholon \u2013 Vanishing Heritage of Ho Cho Minh City|publisher=Th\u1ebf Gi\u1edbi Publishers|year=2019|isbn=9786047761388}}</ref>{{rp|100}} while the Senate was located at 45-47 B\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng Street (''B\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng''), District 1, originally the Chamber of Commerce, and now the [[Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange]].<ref name=Doling/>{{rp|218}}\n\nThe South Vietnamese government was regularly accused of holding large quantity of political prisoners, of which the exact number was a source of contention.

They were initially classified 7F, but this was later changed to the more familiar 8F.\n\nOn the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the design was chosen to become the country's standard freight design, reprising the role the [[GCR Class 8K]] had in the [[World War I|First World War]].  The [[War Department (United Kingdom)|War Department]] had 208 8Fs built by [[Beyer Peacock]] and [[North British Locomotive Company]] and [[requisitioned]] 51 more.\n\nStanier 8F production for the WD continued until 1943 when the cheaper [[WD Austerity 2-8-0]] was introduced.  Production for British domestic use continued until 1946.\n\n== Construction ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Order\n! Builder\n! Delivered\n! Quantity\n! Original Numbers\n!

However, most of them did see wartime military service overseas in [[Egypt]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iran]] and [[Italy]].  Many of these locomotives were later sold to the local railways in these countries, and some were also sold to [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]].<ref name=\"Tourret, R. 1995\">Tourret, R., 1995, ''Allied Military Locomotives of the Second World War'', Abingdon: Tourrett Publishing.</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nThe British Army's [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] (MEF) in Egypt received 42 8Fs in 1941-42, with some having been lost at sea en route (246-304, 322, 370, 371, 415, 416, 428, 429, 444 & 445)<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\">HaRakevet: Rothschild PhD, Rabbi Walter (March 1991), ROD 2-8-0s in Palestina, 11942-1946. Issue 12</ref> possibly on the {{SS|Thistlegorm}}.<ref>In the fins of Cousteau \u2026 The S.S. Thistlegorm and its incredible cargo</ref>  Some of these were loaned to [[Egyptian State Railways]] (ESR) and the others were used by the MEF on the Western Desert Extension Railway (WDER).  The scarcity of water made steam locomotive operations on the WDER difficult, and their smoke also attracted unwanted attention from enemy aircraft, so once American diesels began to arrive from late 1942 the use of 8Fs on the WDER declined.  Forty locomotives were sold to ESR in 1942-44.  The other two locomotives had accident damage, and were made into one good locomotive which was also sold to ESR in 1945.  The remains of the last locomotive were bought by ESR for spares in 1946.\n\nThe MEF received another 50 8Fs from Iran in 1944, for use in both Egypt and Palestine, although 15 of these were transferred to Italy later in the year.  Some of the 50 were not in operational condition, and 4 were scrapped by the MEF in 1946 without further use.  Another 59 former Iranian 8Fs were transferred to the MEF in 1946, most of which were initially used in Palestine.  This brought the number of 8Fs in the Middle East Forces up to 90.\n\nAfter the war the British military presence in the region waned, so the need for military locomotives declined. The MEF's fleet was largely sold off in 1947-48 to British Railways (39), Palestine Railways (24) and ESR (11).  Five returned to Britain for continued WD use in 1952.  MEF railway operation ended in 1954, with 10 8Fs being sold to ESR, and 1 scrapped by MEF following bomb damage.\n\nESR thus purchased a total of 62 8Fs from MEF between 1942 and 1954, and operated the type until 1963.\n\n===Iran===\nFollowing the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupation of Iran]] in 1941, WD locomotives were required to operate the [[Persian Corridor]] supply route, delivering war materials to the Soviet Union via the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]].  163 8F were dispatched to Iran in 1941-42, but only 143 arrived (12 being lost at sea (246-444, 445, 608, 617, 619, 622 (latter 4 former [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] 8066, 8068, 8071, 8087)<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\" />) and 8 returned to Britain with sea damage).  These operated as [[Iranian Railways|Iranian State Railways']] Class 41.{{sfn|Hughes|1981|p=124}}\n\nThe arrival of [[Transportation Corps|US Army Transportation Corps]] units in Iran with their own locomotives (including diesels which were more suitable for use in desert regions) made many of the 8Fs redundant, and 50 locomotives were transferred to the [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] in 1944.  At the end of the war the need for steam locomotives in Iran was further reduced and another 71 locomotives left for the MEF (59) and Iraq (12) in 1945-48.  The remaining 22 locomotives in Iran had all been withdrawn by 1963.\n\n===Iraq===\nTen WD locomotives were transferred from Iran in 1946-47, being purchased by [[Iraqi State Railways]] in 1947, and two more locomotive were purchased from Iran in 1948.

In 1947 24 MEF 8Fs were sold to [[Palestine Railways#World War II locomotives|Palestine Railways]].  Following the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] 23 of these locomotives were taken over by [[Israel Railways]], being operated until 1958. The war stranded the other 8F, 70372 (NBL works no. 24680),{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=132}} on a small section of the main line near [[Tulkarm]] on the West Bank side of the [[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Armistice line]].{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=69}} It remained there, increasingly derelict, until after the [[Six-Day War|1967 Israeli invasion]] of the West Bank.  The Israelis finally removed and scrapped it in about 1973.{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=70}}\n\n===Turkey===\nTwenty five new WD locomotives were sold to [[Turkish State Railways|Turkish State Railways (TCDD)]] in 1941 for diplomatic reasons, but seven of these were lost at sea en route (246-338, 343-345, 354-356.<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\" /> 345 sunk when the {{SS|Jesmore}} collided with ''Baron Pentland'' on 16 February 1941). Two more locomotives were delivered in 1943, making a total of 20.  These served as the [[TCDD 45151 Class]], operating until the 1980s.\n\n==War Department use in UK==\nWith their intended role in France having ceased to exist, early WD 8Fs were loaned to British railway companies in 1940-42, being given temporary numbers in the LMS series.  However, by late 1941 the need for locomotives in Iran and Egypt was such that all of the WD locomotives which had been completed up to that point were recalled for military service, and 50 more locomotives were requisitioned from the LMS.  Locomotive WD 407 (LMS 8293) had been damaged in an accident whilst on loan to the Great Western Railway, so a 51st LMS engine was requisitioned as a replacement.<ref name=\"Tourret, R. 1995\"/>\n\nBy 1942 the need for locomotives overseas had been satisfied, and the final 24 new WD 8Fs remained in the UK on loan to LMS.  Also remaining in the UK were nine damaged locomotives (WD 407 and 8 requisitioned locomotives whose voyage to Iran had been aborted after the {{SS|Pentridge Hill|1941|6}} suffered severe storm damage \u2013 4 other locomotives had had to be jettisoned into the sea to save the ship).  Two locomotives were sold to Turkey in 1944, and the other 31 were sold to the LMS in 1943.\n\nIn 1952 five WD 8Fs returned to the UK from the MEF in poor condition.  These were refurbished for WD use at the [[Longmoor Military Railway]] (LMR).  Three of these were sold to British Railways in 1957 becoming Nos. 48773-75.  The other two were transferred to the [[Cairnryan Harbour|Cairnryan Military Railway]] and were scrapped in 1959, ending the WD's use of 8F locomotives.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 21 January 1941, Locomotive No. 8247 of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] was derailed at Wallneuk Junction, [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]].

A further 245 were built by the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], [[Great Western Railway]] and [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] in 1943-45 for LMS stock, though mostly retained on loan by the other railways during the war.  The LNER also purchased 68 Stanier 8Fs for its own use in 1944-46, classifying them [[LNER Class O6|O6]], though these were also sold to the LMS after the war.  As noted above, 51 LMS locomotives were requisitioned by the WD in 1941, but 31 WD locomotives were subsequently purchased by the LMS in 1943 (including 8 of the requisitioned engines).\n\n===British Railways===\nAs a result, 624 8Fs passed into [[British Rail]]ways ownership when Britain's railways were [[Transport Act 1947|nationalised]] in 1948.  A further 39 (10 requisitioned) were purchased from MEF stock in 1948, and a final 3 (1 requisitioned) from the [[Longmoor Military Railway]] in 1957, bringing the total to 666.  The 8Fs were concentrated on the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]], but were also allocated to former LMS sheds on other regions.  Despite some having operated in Scotland by the LMS, they were not common on the [[Scottish Region of British Railways|Scottish Region]] under BR ownership as the later WD 'Austerity' 2-8-0 and 2-10-0 types were used instead.\n\n8F No. 48600 was used in the 1953 [[Glenn Ford]] film ''[[Time Bomb (1953 film)|Time Bomb]]'', also called ''[[Terror on a Train]]''.\n\n===Withdrawal===\n[[File:Withdrawn Stanier 8Fs at Newton Heath.jpg|thumb|right|250px|End of the line: withdrawn 8Fs in spring 1968 at Newton Heath, Manchester awaiting scrapping]]\nThe 8Fs were successful and durable locomotives in BR service, with all 666 locomotives surviving until 1960 and routine withdrawals not beginning until 1964. The first to go in 1960 was 48616, followed two years later by 48009. 48773\u201348775 (the former Longmoor Military Railway locomotives which were the only 8Fs on the Scottish Region) were also withdrawn in 1962, but these were reinstated into London Midland Region stock in 1963. The remaining 664 were withdrawn between 1964 and 1968, with 150 surviving to the last year of steam on BR.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, no. 48773 had diagonal yellow stripes painted on the cabsides to indicate that it could not run south of Crewe due to it being out of gauge for the new 25\u00a0kV AC overhead electrification.{{sfn|Hunt|Jennison|James|Essery|2005|p=117}}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!

None of the prewar 8Fs survived into preservation. Of the six LMS/BR locomotives that exist only 48773 was purchased directly from BR for preservation following withdrawal from Rose Grove in July 1968, the remaining five including 48518 which would later be used as a donor engine were all rescued from Barry Scrapyard. Three members of the class have over the years been repatriated to the UK from Turkey, with one later sent to a museum in Israel. Two of the Turkish based 8F's which were to be repatriated to the UK no's 45166 & 45170 made an appearance on the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] TV programme [[Monster Moves]],<ref>http://www.windfallfilms.com/show/1756/monster-moves-episode-3-titanic-trains.aspx Monster Moves, Windfall Films</ref> this episode showed the two engines being moved 850 miles by rail across Turkey from [[Sivas]] to [[Izmir]]. 45166 would later end up in Israel as a static exhibit while 45170 is presently under restoration at Bo'ness. In addition, two Turkish Railway (TCDD) locomotives have been preserved in Turkey, and some more remain there in a derelict state. One locomotive has even survived in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.ajg41.plus.com/iraq/locomotives.html#steam Railways of Iraq: Locomotives and rolling stock in Iraq]</ref> The complete list is shown below. Two more are also visible underwater on the wreck of the {{SS|Thistlegorm}}.\n\nOf the fourteen engines known to have survived into preservation, all the British located examples except 48173 & 45170 \u201cSir William McAlpine\u201d have run in preservation (both are undergoing restoration). Two of the British-based engines have even seen main line operation: Nos. 48151 and 48773. These have been regular main line performers in recent years with 48773 being withdrawn from operation in 2000. As of 2019 none of the class are operational on the main line.\n\nSome of the preserved examples have stars on their cabsides indicating that they have specially balanced wheelsets/motion. This practice began under the auspices of British Railways, to denote that locomotives thus treated were able to work fast, vacuum-braked goods services.<ref>Foster, Michael (1998). ''Hornby Dublo, 1938-1964: The Story of the Perfect Table Railway''. London: New Cavendish. {{ISBN|0-904568-18-0}}.</ref> Other members of the class have a yellow stripe on the cab meaning that they were not permitted to run south of Crewe as the WCML south of Crewe had been electrified with overhead wires. Another difference between the British engines and the locos that were exported from Britain is the position of the driver's controls. The British based engines like all LMS engines were left hand drive, the locos exported to Turkey and other countries were right-hand drive.\n\nLoco numbers in bold mean their current number.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=4|Number\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Manufacturer\n!rowspan=2 width=45 align=left|Built\n!rowspan=2 width=45 align=left|Withdrawn\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Balanced Motion\n!rowspan=2 align=left|LH Drive\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Location\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Status\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Notes\n|-\n!width=45|LMS\n!width=45|BR\n!width=45|WD\n!width=45|TCDD\n|-\n|align=center|[[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151|8151]]\n|align=center|'''48151'''\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|[[Crewe Works]]\n|align=center|Sept 1942\n|align=center|Jan 1968\n|align=center|Yes\n|align=center|Yes\n|[[West Coast Railway Company]] (Carnforth)\n|Under Overhaul\n|In November 1995 it was loaned to [[Tunstead, Derbyshire|Tunstead Quarry]] to haul a 975-ton train of hopper wagons for a special train out of Tunstead, it also on 19 December 2000 worked a special one off freight train along the [[Settle-Carlisle Line|Settle and Carlisle line]] from [[Hellifield]] to [[Ribblehead|Ribblehead Quarry]] where the hopper wagons were loaded and it then worked the loaded train on from Ribblehead Quarry to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].\n|-\n|align=center|8173\n|align=center|48173\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|[[Crewe Works]]\n|align=center|Jun 1943\n|align=center|Jul 1965\n|align=center|Yes\n|align=center|Yes\n|[[Churnet Valley Railway]]\n|Under restoration.\n|Restoration started in 2018.\n|-\n|align=center|[[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8233|8233]]\n|align=center|'''48773'''\n|align=center|307\n|align=center|\u2014\n|[[North British Locomotive Co.]]\n|align=center|Jun 1940\n|align=center|Aug 1968\n|align=center|Yes\n|align=center|Yes\n|[[Severn Valley Railway]]\n|Static Display\n|Built as WD 307 and loaned to LMS as 8233.

They were initially classified 7F, but this was later changed to the more familiar 8F.\n\nOn the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the design was chosen to become the country's standard freight design, reprising the role the [[GCR Class 8K]] had in the [[World War I|First World War]].  The [[War Department (United Kingdom)|War Department]] had 208 8Fs built by [[Beyer Peacock]] and [[North British Locomotive Company]] and [[requisitioned]] 51 more.\n\nStanier 8F production for the WD continued until 1943, when the cheaper [[WD Austerity 2-8-0]] was introduced.  Production for British domestic use continued until 1946.\n\n== Construction ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Order\n! Builder\n! Delivered\n! Quantity\n! Original Numbers\n!

However, most of them did see wartime military service overseas in [[Egypt]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iran]] and [[Italy]].  Many of these locomotives were later sold to the local railways in these countries, and some were also sold to [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]].<ref name=\"Tourret, R. 1995\">Tourret, R., 1995, ''Allied Military Locomotives of the Second World War'', Abingdon: Tourrett Publishing.</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nThe British Army's [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] (MEF) in Egypt received 42 8Fs in 1941-42, with some having been lost at sea en route (246-304, 322, 370, 371, 415, 416, 428, 429, 444 & 445)<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\">HaRakevet: Rothschild PhD, Rabbi Walter (march 1991), ROD 2-8-0s in Palestina, 11942-1946. Issue 12</ref> possibly on the {{SS|Thistlegorm}}.<ref>In the fins of Cousteau \u2026 The S.S. Thistlegorm and its incredible cargo</ref>  Some of these were loaned to [[Egyptian State Railways]] (ESR) and the others were used by the MEF on the Western Desert Extension Railway (WDER).  The scarcity of water made steam locomotive operations on the WDER difficult, and their smoke also attracted unwanted attention from enemy aircraft, so once American diesels began to arrive from late 1942 the use of 8Fs on the WDER declined.  Forty locomotives were sold to ESR in 1942-44.  The other two locomotives had accident damage, and were made into one good locomotive which was also sold to ESR in 1945.  The remains of the last locomotive were bought by ESR for spares in 1946.\n\nThe MEF received another 50 8Fs from Iran in 1944, for use in both Egypt and Palestine, although 15 of these were transferred to Italy later in the year.  Some of the 50 were not in operational condition, and 4 were scrapped by the MEF in 1946 without further use.  Another 59 former Iranian 8Fs were transferred to the MEF in 1946, most of which were initially used in Palestine.  This brought the number of 8Fs in the Middle East Forces up to 90.\n\nAfter the war the British military presence in the region waned, so the need for military locomotives declined. The MEF's fleet was largely sold off in 1947-48 to British Railways (39), Palestine Railways (24) and ESR (11).  Five returned to Britain for continued WD use in 1952.  MEF railway operation ended in 1954, with 10 8Fs being sold to ESR, and 1 scrapped by MEF following bomb damage.\n\nESR thus purchased a total of 62 8Fs from MEF between 1942 and 1954, and operated the type until 1963.\n\n===Iran===\nFollowing the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupation of Iran]] in 1941, WD locomotives were required to operate the [[Persian Corridor]] supply route, delivering war materials to the Soviet Union via the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]].  163 8F were dispatched to Iran in 1941-42, but only 143 arrived (12 being lost at sea (246-444, 445, 608, 617, 619, 622 (latter 4 former [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] 8066, 8068, 8071, 8087)<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\" />) and 8 returned to Britain with sea damage).  These operated as [[Iranian Railways|Iranian State Railways']] Class 41.{{sfn|Hughes|1981|p=124}}\n\nThe arrival of [[Transportation Corps|US Army Transportation Corps]] units in Iran with their own locomotives (including diesels which were more suitable for use in desert regions) made many of the 8Fs redundant, and 50 locomotives were transferred to the [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] in 1944.  At the end of the war the need for steam locomotives in Iran was further reduced and another 71 locomotives left for the MEF (59) and Iraq (12) in 1945-48.  The remaining 22 locomotives in Iran had all been withdrawn by 1963.\n\n===Iraq===\nTen WD locomotives were transferred from Iran in 1946-47, being purchased by [[Iraqi State Railways]] in 1947, and two more locomotive were purchased from Iran in 1948.

In 1947 24 MEF 8Fs were sold to [[Palestine Railways#World War II locomotives|Palestine Railways]].  Following the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] 23 of these locomotives were taken over by [[Israel Railways]], being operated until 1958. The war stranded the other 8F, 70372 (NBL works no. 24680),{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=132}} on a small section of the main line near [[Tulkarm]] on the West Bank side of the [[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Armistice line]].{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=69}} It remained there, increasingly derelict, until after the [[Six-Day War|1967 Israeli invasion]] of the West Bank.  The Israelis finally removed and scrapped it in about 1973.{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=70}}\n\n===Turkey===\nTwenty five new WD locomotives were sold to [[Turkish State Railways|Turkish State Railways (TCDD)]] in 1941 for diplomatic reasons, but seven of these were lost at sea en route (246-338, 343-345, 354-356.<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\" /> 345 sunk when the {{SS|Jesmore}} collided with ''Baron Pentland'' on 16 February 1941). Two more locomotives were delivered in 1943, making a total of 20.  These served as the [[TCDD 45151 Class]], operating until the 1980s.\n\n==War Department use in UK==\nWith their intended role in France having ceased to exist, early WD 8Fs were loaned to British railway companies in 1940-42, being given temporary numbers in the LMS series.  However, by late 1941 the need for locomotives in Iran and Egypt was such that all of the WD locomotives which had been completed up to that point were recalled for military service, and 50 more locomotives were requisitioned from the LMS.  Locomotive WD 407 (LMS 8293) had been damaged in an accident whilst on loan to the Great Western Railway, so a 51st LMS engine was requisitioned as a replacement.<ref name=\"Tourret, R. 1995\"/>\n\nBy 1942 the need for locomotives overseas had been satisfied, and the final 24 new WD 8Fs remained in the UK on loan to LMS.  Also remaining in the UK were nine damaged locomotives (WD 407 and 8 requisitioned locomotives whose voyage to Iran had been aborted after the {{SS|Pentridge Hill|1941|6}} suffered severe storm damage \u2013 4 other locomotives had had to be jettisoned into the sea to save the ship).  Two locomotives were sold to Turkey in 1944, and the other 31 were sold to the LMS in 1943.\n\nIn 1952 five WD 8Fs returned to the UK from the MEF in poor condition.  These were refurbished for WD use at the [[Longmoor Military Railway]] (LMR).  Three of these were sold to British Railways in 1957 becoming Nos. 48773-75.  The other two were transferred to the [[Cairnryan Harbour|Cairnryan Military Railway]] and were scrapped in 1959, ending the WD's use of 8F locomotives.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 21 January 1941, Locomotive No. 8247 of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] was derailed at Wallneuk Junction, [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]].

A further 245 were built by the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], [[Great Western Railway]] and [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] in 1943-45 for LMS stock, though mostly retained on loan by the other railways during the war.  The LNER also purchased 68 Stanier 8Fs for its own use in 1944-46, classifying them [[LNER Class O6|O6]], though these were also sold to the LMS after the war.  As noted above, 51 LMS locomotives were requisitioned by the WD in 1941, but 31 WD locomotives were subsequently purchased by the LMS in 1943 (including 8 of the requisitioned engines).\n\n===British Railways===\nAs a result, 624 8Fs passed into [[British Rail]]ways ownership when Britain's railways were [[Transport Act 1947|nationalised]] in 1948.  A further 39 (10 requisitioned) were purchased from MEF stock in 1948, and a final 3 (1 requisitioned) from the [[Longmoor Military Railway]] in 1957, bringing the total to 666.  The 8Fs were concentrated on the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]], but were also allocated to former LMS sheds on other regions.

The remaining 664 were withdrawn between 1964 and 1968, with 150 surviving to the last year of steam on BR.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, no. 48773 had diagonal yellow stripes painted on the cabsides to indicate that it could not run south of Crewe due to it being out of gauge for the new 25\u00a0kV AC overhead electrification.{{sfn|Hunt|Jennison|James|Essery|2005|p=117}}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!

None of the prewar 8Fs survived into preservation. Of the six LMS/BR locomotives that exist only 48773 was purchased directly from BR for preservation following withdrawal from Rose Grove in July 1968, the remaining five including 48518 which would later be used as a donor engine were all rescued from Barry Scrapyard. Three members of the class have over the years been repatriated to the UK from Turkey, with one later sent to a museum in Israel. Two of the Turkish based 8F's which were to be repatriated to the UK no's 45166 & 45170 made an appearance on the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] tv programme [[Monster Moves]],<ref>http://www.windfallfilms.com/show/1756/monster-moves-episode-3-titanic-trains.aspx Monster Moves, Windfall Films</ref> this episode showed the two engines being moved 850 miles by rail across Turkey from [[Sivas]] to [[Izmir]]. 45166 would later end up in Israel as a static exhibit while 45170 is presently under restoration at Bo'ness. In addition, two Turkish Railway (TCDD) locomotives have been preserved in Turkey, and some more remain there in a derelict state. One locomotive has even survived in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.ajg41.plus.com/iraq/locomotives.html#steam Railways of Iraq: Locomotives and rolling stock in Iraq]</ref> The complete list is shown below. Two more are also visible underwater on the wreck of the {{SS|Thistlegorm}}.\n\nOf the fourteen engines known to have survived into preservation, all the British located examples except 48173 & 45170 \u201cSir William McAlpine\u201d have run in preservation (both are undergoing restoration). Two of the British-based engines have even seen main line operation: Nos. 48151 and 48773. These have been regular main line performers in recent years with 48773 being withdrawn from operation in 2000. As of 2019 none of the class are operational on the main line.\n\nSome of the preserved examples have stars on their cabsides indicating that they have specially balanced wheelsets/motion. This practice began under the auspices of British Railways, to denote that locomotives thus treated were able to work fast, vacuum-braked goods services.<ref>Foster, Michael (1998). ''Hornby Dublo, 1938-1964: The Story of the Perfect Table Railway''. London: New Cavendish. {{ISBN|0-904568-18-0}}.</ref> Other members of the class have a yellow stripe on the cab meaning that they were not permitted to run south of Crewe as the WCML south of Crewe had been electrified with overhead wires. Another difference between the British engines and the locos that were exported from Britain is the position of the drivers controls. The British based engines like all LMS engines were left hand drive, the locos exported to Turkey and other country's were right hand drive.\n\nLoco numbers in bold mean their current number.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=4|Number\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Manufacturer\n!rowspan=2 width=45 align=left|Built\n!rowspan=2 width=45 align=left|Withdrawn\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Balanced Motion\n!rowspan=2 align=left|LH Drive\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Location\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Status\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Notes\n|-\n!width=45|LMS\n!width=45|BR\n!width=45|WD\n!width=45|TCDD\n|-\n|align=center|[[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151|8151]]\n|align=center|'''48151'''\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|[[Crewe Works]]\n|align=center|Sept 1942\n|align=center|Jan 1968\n|align=center|Yes\n|align=center|Yes\n|[[West Coast Railway Company]] (Carnforth)\n|Under Overhaul\n|In November 1995 it was loaned to [[Tunstead, Derbyshire|Tunstead Quarry]] to haul a 975-ton train of hopper wagons for a special train out of Tunstead, it also on 19 December 2000 worked a special one off freight train along the [[Settle-Carlisle Line|Settle and Carlisle line]] from [[Hellifield]] to [[Ribblehead|Ribblehead Quarry]] where the hopper wagons were loaded and it then worked the loaded train on from Ribblehead Quarry to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].\n|-\n|align=center|8173\n|align=center|48173\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|[[Crewe Works]]\n|align=center|Jun 1943\n|align=center|Jul 1965\n|align=center|Yes\n|align=center|Yes\n|[[Churnet Valley Railway]]\n|Under restoration.\n|Restoration started in 2018.\n|-\n|align=center|[[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8233|8233]]\n|align=center|'''48773'''\n|align=center|307\n|align=center|\u2014\n|[[North British Locomotive Co.]]\n|align=center|Jun 1940\n|align=center|Aug 1968\n|align=center|Yes\n|align=center|Yes\n|[[Severn Valley Railway]]\n|Static Display\n|Built as WD 307 and loaned to LMS as 8233.

Because of demand in the American market from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s (with only a brief recession in 1979), Surat's diamond industry grew tremendously.

The scientists said that obtaining well-preserved, uncontaminated DNA from mummies has been a problem for the field and that these samples provided \"the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods\". The study showed that Ancient Egyptians had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern (Arab, Levantine and Anatolian) populations, and had significantly more affinity with southeastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Nevertheless, there was a small sub-Saharan African component in the ancestry of the three mummies tested: \"absolute estimates of African ancestry using these two methods in the three ancient individuals range from 6 to 15%.\" This level of sub-Saharan African ancestry is significantly lower than that of modern Egyptians from Abusir, who \"range from 14 to 21%.\"<ref name=\"nature.com\"/>\n\nThe authors of the study cautioned that the samples from the mummies, which were taken from a region that (while technically part of Middle Egypt) is geographically in the far north of Egypt, may not be representative of Ancient Egypt as a whole.

The scientists said that obtaining well-preserved, uncontaminated DNA from mummies has been a problem for the field and that these samples provided \"the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods\". The study showed that Ancient Egyptians had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern (Arab, Levantine and Anatolian) populations, and had significantly more affinity with southeastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Nevertheless, there was a small sub-Saharan African component in the ancestry of the three mummies tested: \"absolute estimates of African ancestry using these two methods in the three ancient individuals range from 6 to 15%.\" This level of sub-Saharan African ancestry is significantly lower than that of modern Egyptians from Abusir, who \"range from 14 to 21%.\"<ref name=\"nature.com\"/>\n\nThe authors of the study cautioned that the samples from the mummies, which were taken from a region that (while technically part of Middle Egypt) is geographically in the far north of Egypt, may not be representative of Ancient Egypt as a whole.

The most common types of bonds include [[municipal bond]]s and [[corporate bond]]s. The bond is known as a [https://www.mini-invest.com/2020/04/why-is-high-quality-bond-typically-considered-a-lower-risk-investment-than-a-stock.html low-risk investment than stocks].\n\nThe bond is a debt [[security (finance)|security]], under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them [[interest]] (the [[coupon (bond)|coupon]]) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] date.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = O'Sullivan\n | first = Arthur\n | author2=Sheffrin, Steven M.\n | title = Economics: Principles in action\n | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall\n | year = 2004\n | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458\n | pages = 197, 507\n | url = http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ3R9&PMDbSiteId=2781&PMDbSolutionId=6724&PMDbCategoryId=&PMDbProgramId=12881&level=4\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}</ref> Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.<ref>[http://www.moneycontrol.com/pehlakadam/bonds.php Bonds], accessed: 2012-06-08</ref>\n\nThus a bond is a form of [[loan]] or [[IOU]]: the ''holder'' of the bond is the lender (creditor), the ''issuer'' of the bond is the borrower (debtor), and the ''coupon'' is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term [[investment]]s, or, in the case of [[government bond]]s, to finance current expenditure. [[certificate of deposit|Certificates of deposit]] (CDs) or short-term [[commercial paper]] are considered{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be [[money market]] instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nBonds and [[stock]]s are both [[security (finance)|securities]], but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an [[Equity (finance)|equity]] stake in a company (that is, they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (that is, they are lenders). Being a creditor, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders but will rank behind [[secured creditor]]s, in the event of bankruptcy.<ref>\n[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absolutepriority.asp Absolute Priority], accessed: 2013-10-8\n</ref>\nAnother difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, such as a [[Consol (bond)|consol]], which is a [[perpetuity]], that is, a bond with no maturity.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[English language|English]], the word \"{{linktext|bond}}\" relates to the etymology of \"bind\". In the sense \"instrument binding one to pay a sum to another\", use of the word \"bond\" dates from at least the 1590s.<ref>\n{{OEtymD|bond|accessdate=2017-07-23}}\n</ref>\n\n==Issuance==\nBonds are issued by public authorities, credit institutions, companies and [[Supranational union|supranational]] institutions in the [[primary market]]s. The most common process for issuing bonds is through [[underwriting]]. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a [[syndicate]], buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and re-sell them to investors. The security firm takes the risk of being unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by ''[[bookrunner]]s'' who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the [[tombstone (advertising)|tombstone ads]] commonly used to announce bonds to the public. The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.\n\nIn contrast, government bonds are usually issued in an auction. In some cases, both members of the public and banks may bid for bonds. In other cases, only market makers may bid for bonds. The [[Yield to maturity|overall rate of return]] on the bond depends on both the terms of the bond and the price paid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts/Operations |title=UK Debt Management Office |publisher=Dmo.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404181639/http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts%2FOperations |archive-date=2012-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The terms of the bond, such as the coupon, are fixed in advance and the price is determined by the market.\n\nIn the case of an underwritten bond, the underwriters will charge a fee for underwriting. An alternative process for bond issuance, which is commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost, is the private placement bond. Bonds sold directly to buyers may not be tradeable in the [[bond market]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housingfinance.com/ahf/articles/2005/march/bond1.html |title=Affordable Housing Finance |publisher=Housingfinance.com |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Tap}}Historically an alternative practice of issuance was for the borrowing government authority to issue bonds over a period of time, usually at a fixed price, with volumes sold on a particular day dependent on market conditions. This was called a ''tap issue'' or ''bond tap''.<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tap_issue.asp Tap issue] at ''[[Investopedia]]''</ref>\n\n==Features==\n===Principal===\n[[File:1978 $1000 8 3-8% Treasury Bond (reverse).jpg|thumb|upright=1|1978 $1,000 U.S. Treasury Bond]]\nNominal, principal, par, or face amount is the amount on which the issuer pays interest, and which, most commonly, has to be repaid at the end of the term. Some structured bonds can have a redemption amount which is different from the face amount and can be linked to the performance of particular assets.\n\n===Maturity===\nThe issuer has to repay the nominal amount on the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] date. As long as all due payments have been made, the issuer has no further obligations to the bond holders after the maturity date. The length of time until the maturity date is often referred to as the term or tenor or maturity of a bond. The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term of up to 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no maturity date (irredeemable). In the market for United States Treasury securities, there are three categories of bond maturities:\n* short term (bills): maturities between zero and one year;\n* medium term (notes): maturities between one and ten years;\n* long term (bonds): maturities between ten and thirty years;\n* Perpetual: which has no maturity Period.\n\n===Coupon===\nThe [[Coupon (bond)|coupon]] is the interest rate that the issuer pays to the holder. Usually this rate is fixed throughout the life of the bond. It can also vary with a money market index, such as [[LIBOR]], or it can be even more exotic. The name \"coupon\" arose because in the past, paper bond certificates were issued which had coupons attached to them, one for each interest payment. On the due dates the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the interest payment. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual, i.e. every 6 months, or annual.\n[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond - Middelburg - Amsterdam - 1622.jpg|thumb|right|Bond issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1623]]\n\n===Yield===\nThe yield is the rate of return received from investing in the bond. It usually refers either to\n* The [[current yield]], or running yield, which is simply the annual interest payment divided by the current market price of the bond (often the [[clean price]]).\n* The [[yield to maturity]], or redemption yield, which is a more useful measure of the return of the bond. This takes into account the current market price, and the amount and timing of all remaining coupon payments and of the repayment due on maturity. It is equivalent to the [[internal rate of return]] of a bond.\n\n===Credit quality===\nThe quality of the issue refers to the probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates. In other words, credit quality tells investors how likely the borrower is going to default. This will depend on a wide range of factors.\n[[High-yield bond]]s are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]]. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield. These bonds are also called ''junk bonds''.\n\n===Market price===\nThe market price of a tradable bond will be influenced, amongst other factors, by the amounts, currency and timing of the interest payments and capital repayment due, the quality of the bond, and the available redemption yield of other comparable bonds which can be traded in the markets.\n\nThe price can be quoted as [[clean price|clean]] or [[dirty price|dirty]]. \"Dirty\" includes the present value of all future cash flows, including accrued interest, and is most often used in Europe. \"Clean\" does not include accrued interest, and is most often used in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dirtyprice.asp|title=Dirty Price|work=Investopedia|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe issue price at which investors buy the bonds when they are first issued will typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or there is a high [[probability of default]] on the bond).\n\n===Others===\n* Indentures and Covenants\u2014An [[indenture]] is a formal debt agreement that establishes the terms of a bond issue, while covenants are the clauses of such an agreement. Covenants specify the rights of bondholders and the duties of issuers, such as actions that the issuer is obligated to perform or is prohibited from performing. In the U.S., federal and state securities and commercial laws apply to the enforcement of these agreements, which are construed by courts as contracts between issuers and bondholders. The terms may be changed only with great difficulty while the bonds are outstanding, with amendments to the governing document generally requiring approval by a [[majority]] (or [[Supermajority|super-majority]]) vote of the bondholders.\n* Optionality: Occasionally a bond may contain an [[embedded option]]; that is, it grants [[option (finance)|option-like]] features to the holder or the issuer:\n** Callability\u2014Some bonds give the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates; see [[call option]]. These bonds are referred to as [[callable bond]]s. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at [[Par value|par]]. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.\n** Puttability\u2014Some bonds give the holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date on the put dates; see [[put option]]. These are referred to as retractable or [[putable bond]]s.\n** Call dates and put dates\u2014the [[option style|dates]] on which callable and putable bonds can be redeemed early. There are four main categories:\n*** A Bermudan callable has several call dates, usually coinciding with coupon dates.\n*** A European callable has only one call date. This is a special case of a Bermudan callable.\n*** An American callable can be called at any time until the maturity date.\n*** A death put is an optional redemption feature on a debt instrument allowing the beneficiary of the estate of a deceased bondholder to put (sell) the bond back to the issuer at face value in the event of the bondholder's death or legal incapacitation. This is also known as a \"survivor's option\".\n** [[Sinking fund]] provision of the corporate bond indenture requires a certain portion of the issue to be retired periodically. The entire bond issue can be liquidated by the maturity date; if not, the remainder is called balloon maturity. Issuers may either pay to trustees, which in turn call randomly selected bonds in the issue, or, alternatively, purchase bonds in open market, then return them to trustees.\n*** Bonds are often identified by its international securities identification number, or [[International Securities Identification Number|ISIN]], which is a 12 digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies debt securities.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:South Carolina consolidation bond.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Bond certificate for the state of South Carolina issued in 1873 under the state's Consolidation Act.]]\n[[File:Obligatie-Moskau-Kiev-Woronesch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Railroad obligation of the Moscow-Kiev-Voronezh railroad company, printed in Russian, Dutch and German.]]\n\nThe following descriptions are not mutually exclusive, and more than one of them may apply to a particular bond:\n* [[Fixed rate bond]]s have a coupon that remains constant throughout the life of the bond. A variation are stepped-coupon bonds, whose coupon increases during the life of the bond.\n* [[Floating rate note]]s (FRNs, floaters) have a variable coupon that is linked to a [[reference rate]] of interest, such as [[Libor]] or [[Euribor]]. For example, the coupon may be defined as three-month USD LIBOR + 0.20%. The coupon rate is recalculated periodically, typically every one or three months.\n* [[Zero-coupon bond]]s (zeros) pay no regular interest. They are issued at a substantial discount to [[par value]], so that the interest is effectively rolled up to maturity (and usually taxed as such). The bondholder receives the full principal amount on the redemption date. An example of zero coupon bonds is Series E savings bonds issued by the U.S. government<!-- are these traded securities?--->. [[Zero-coupon bond]]s may be created from fixed rate bonds by a financial institution separating (\"stripping off\") the coupons from the principal. In other words, the separated coupons and the final principal payment of the bond may be traded separately. See IO (Interest Only) and PO (Principal Only).\n* [[High-yield bond]]s (junk bonds) are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]]. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield.\n* [[Convertible bond]]s let a bondholder exchange a bond to a number of shares of the issuer's common stock. These are known as [[Hybrid security|hybrid securities]], because they combine [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and [[debt]] features.\n* [[Exchangeable bond]]s allows for exchange to shares of a corporation other than the issuer.\n* [[Inflation-indexed bond]]s (linkers) (US) or Index-linked bond (UK), in which the principal amount and the interest payments are indexed to inflation. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this position briefly reversed itself for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). However, as the principal amount grows, the payments increase with inflation. The [[United Kingdom]] was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation linked [[Gilt-edged securities|gilts]] in the 1980s. [[Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities]] (TIPS) and [[Treasury security#Series I|I-bonds]] are examples of inflation linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.\n[[File:Receipt for temporary bonds.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Receipt for temporary bonds for the state of Kansas issued in 1922]]\n* Other indexed bonds, for example [[equity-linked note]]s and bonds indexed on a business indicator (income, added value) or on a country's [[GDP]].\n* [[Asset-backed security|Asset-backed securities]] are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are [[mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBSs), [[collateralized mortgage obligation]]s (CMOs) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).\n* [[Subordinated debt|Subordinated bonds]] are those that have a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of [[liquidation]]. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what is called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds can be found in bonds issued by banks, and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in [[tranche]]s. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.\n* [[Covered bond]]s are backed by cash flows from mortgages or public sector assets. Contrary to [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] the assets for such bonds remain on the issuers balance sheet.\n* [[Perpetual bond]]s are also often called [[Perpetuity|perpetuities]] or 'Perps'. They have no maturity date. The most famous of these are the UK Consols, which are also known as Treasury Annuities or Undated Treasuries. Some of these were issued back in 1888 and still trade today, although the amounts are now insignificant. Some ultra-long-term bonds (sometimes a bond can last centuries: West Shore Railroad issued a bond which matures in 2361 (i.e. 24th century)) are virtually perpetuities from a financial point of view, with the current value of principal near zero.\n* The ''Methuselah'' is a type of bond with a maturity of 50-years or longer.<ref>https://www.ledevoir.com/economie/561203/obligations-quand-les-etats-sont-tentes-par-la-dette-mathusalem , talking about 100-year maturity bonds.</ref> The term is a reference to [[Methuselah]], the oldest person whose age is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The issuance in Methuselahs has been increasing in recent years due to demand for longer-dated assets from [[pension]] plans, particularly in [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Issuance of Methuselahs in the [[United States]] has been limited, however, as the [[U.S. Treasury]] does not currently issue [[Treasury security|Treasuries]] with maturities beyond 30 years, which would serve as a reference level for any [[corporate debt|corporate]] issuance.\n* [[Bearer bond]] is an official certificate issued without a named holder. In other words, the person who has the paper certificate can claim the value of the bond. Often they are registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting, but may be traded like cash. Bearer bonds are very risky because they can be lost or stolen. Especially after federal income tax began in the United States, bearer bonds were seen as an opportunity to conceal income or assets.<ref>Eason, Yla (June 6, 1983). \"Final Surge in Bearer Bonds\" ''New York Times''.</ref> U.S. corporations stopped issuing bearer bonds in the 1960s, the U.S. Treasury stopped in 1982, and state and local tax-exempt bearer bonds were prohibited in 1983.<ref>Quint, Michael (August 14, 1984). \"Elements in Bearer Bond Issue\". ''New York Times''.</ref>\n* Registered bond is a bond whose ownership (and any subsequent purchaser) is recorded by the issuer, or by a transfer agent. It is the alternative to a [[Bearer bond]]. Interest payments, and the principal upon maturity are sent to the registered owner.\n* A [[government bond]], also called Treasury bond, is issued by a national government and is not exposed to default risk. It is characterized as the safest bond, with the lowest interest rate. A treasury bond is backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the relevant government. For that reason, for the major OECD countries this type of bond is often referred to as risk-free.\n* A [[supranational bond]] also known as a \"supra\" is issued by a [[Supranational union|supranational organisation]] like the [[World Bank]]. They are have very good credit rating like government bonds.\n* [[File:San Francisco Pacific Railroad Bond WPRR 1865.jpg|thumb|right|'''Pacific Railroad Bond''' issued by City and County of San Francisco, CA. May 1, 1865]] [[Municipal bond]] is a bond issued by a state, U.S. Territory, city, local government, or their agencies. Interest income received by holders of municipal bonds is [[tax advantage|exempt]] from the federal [[income tax]] and sometimes from the income tax of the state in which they are issued, although municipal bonds issued for certain purposes may not be tax exempt. Municipal bonds issued in U.S. territories are exempted from all federal, state, and local taxes, making them triple-exempted. \n* Build America Bonds (BABs) are a form of [[municipal bond]] authorized by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Unlike traditional US municipal bonds, which are usually tax exempt, interest received on BABs is subject to federal taxation. However, as with municipal bonds, the bond is tax-exempt within the US state where it is issued. Generally, BABs offer significantly higher yields (over 7 percent) than standard municipal bonds.<ref>{{cite web | author=Benjamin Shepherd | title=A Slice of the Pie | url=http://www.investingdaily.com/ruk/18220/a-slice-of-the-pie.html | publisher=InvestingDaily.com | accessdate=2010-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713052252/http://www.investingdaily.com/ruk/18220/a-slice-of-the-pie.html | archive-date=2011-07-13 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Book-entry bond is a bond that does not have a paper certificate. As physically processing paper bonds and interest coupons became more expensive, issuers (and banks that used to collect coupon interest for depositors) have tried to discourage their use. Some book-entry bond issues do not offer the option of a paper certificate, even to investors who prefer them.<ref>no byline (July 18, 1984). \"Book Entry Bonds Popular\". ''New York Times''.</ref>\n* [[Lottery Bond|Lottery bonds]] are issued by European and other states. Interest is paid as on a traditional fixed rate bond, but the issuer will redeem randomly selected individual bonds within the issue according to a schedule. Some of these redemptions will be for a higher value than the face value of the bond.\n* [[War bond]] is a bond issued by a government to fund military operations during wartime. This type of bond has low return rate.\n* [[Serial bond]] is a bond that matures in installments over a period of time. In effect, a $100,000, 5-year serial bond would mature in a $20,000 annuity over a 5-year interval.\n* [[Revenue bond]] is a special type of municipal bond distinguished by its guarantee of repayment solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating entity associated with the purpose of the bonds. Revenue bonds are typically \"non-recourse\", meaning that in the event of default, the bond holder has no recourse to other governmental assets or revenues.\n* [[Climate bond]] is a bond issued by a government or corporate entity in order to raise finance for climate change mitigation- or adaptation-related projects or programmes.\n* Dual currency bonds <ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dual-currency-bond.asp Dual currency bond], accessed 2012-06-08.</ref>\n* Retail bonds are a type of corporate bond mostly designed for ordinary investors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/loans-and-bonds/enquest-cfo-swinney-on-issuing-first-industrial-retail-bond/ |accessdate=February 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209161432/http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/loans-and-bonds/enquest-cfo-swinney-on-issuing-first-industrial-retail-bond/ |archivedate=February 9, 2013 }}</ref> They have become particularly attractive since the [[London Stock Exchange]] (LSE) launched an [[order book for retail bonds]].<ref>http://www.hedgefundonline.com/</ref>\n* [[Social impact bond]]s are an agreement for public sector entities to pay back private investors after meeting verified improved social outcome goals that result in public sector savings from innovative social program pilot projects.\n\n===Foreign currencies===\nSome companies, banks, governments, and other sovereign entities may decide to issue bonds in foreign currencies as it may appear to be more stable and predictable than their domestic currency.\nIssuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies also gives issuers the ability to access investment capital available in foreign markets. The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds can be used by companies to break into foreign markets, or can be converted into the issuing company's local currency to be used on existing operations through the use of foreign exchange swap hedges. Foreign issuer bonds can also be used to hedge foreign exchange rate risk. Some foreign issuer bonds are called by their nicknames, such as the \"samurai bond\". These can be issued by foreign issuers looking to diversify their investor base away from domestic markets. These bond issues are generally governed by the law of the market of issuance, e.g., a samurai bond, issued by an investor based in Europe, will be governed by Japanese law. Not all of the following bonds are restricted for purchase by investors in the market of issuance.\n* [[Eurodollar]] bond, a U.S. dollar-denominated bond issued by a non-[[United States entity|U.S. entity]] outside the U.S<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riskglossary.com/link/eurodollar_deposit.htm|title=Eurodollar deposit|accessdate=2009-01-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226012306/http://www.riskglossary.com/link/eurodollar_deposit.htm|archivedate=2008-12-26}}</ref>\n* [[Baklava bond]], a bond denominated in Turkish Lira and issued by a domestic or foreign entity in the Turkish market<ref>{{cite book|last=Memili|first=\u00dcmit|title=Baklava Bonds: Sweet Margins in Turkey.

That relationship is the definition of the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics, as otherwise there would be [[arbitrage]] opportunities. The yield and price of a bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa. For a discussion of the mathematics see [[Bond valuation]].\n\nThe bond's market price is usually expressed as a percentage of nominal value: 100% of face value, \"at par\", corresponds to a price of 100; prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. The [[market price]] of a bond may be quoted including the [[accrued interest]] since the last coupon date. (Some bond markets include accrued interest in the trading price and others add it on separately when settlement is made.) The price including accrued interest is known as the \"full\" or \"[[dirty price]]\". (''See also'' [[Accrual bond]].) The price excluding accrued interest is known as the \"flat\" or \"[[clean price]]\".\n\nMost government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the [[United States]], or in units of \u00a3100 in the [[United Kingdom]]. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) Some short-term bonds, such as the [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bill|U.S. Treasury bill]], are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.\n\nBonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as \"[[pull to par]]\". At the time of issue of the bond, the coupon paid, and other conditions of the bond, will have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as current market interest rates, the length of the term and the creditworthiness of the issuer. These factors are likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued.\n\nThe interest payment (\"coupon payment\") divided by the current price of the bond is called the [[current yield]] (this is the [[nominal yield]] multiplied by the par value and divided by the price). There are other yield measures that exist such as the yield to first call, yield to worst, yield to first par call, yield to put, cash flow yield and yield to maturity. The relationship between yield and term to maturity (or alternatively between yield and the weighted mean term allowing for both interest and capital repayment) for otherwise identical bonds derives the [[yield curve]], a graph plotting this relationship.\n\nIf the bond includes [[embedded option]]s, the valuation is more difficult and combines [[option pricing]] with discounting. Depending on the type of option, the [[option premium|option price]] as calculated is either added to or subtracted from the price of the \"straight\" portion. See further under [[Bond option#Embedded options]]. This total is then the value of the bond. More sophisticated [[Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid securities|lattice-]] or [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing|simulation-based techniques]] may (also) be employed.\n\nBond markets, unlike stock or share markets, sometimes do not have a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed [[bond market]]s such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] markets. In such a market, [[market liquidity]] is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the [[counterparty]] to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond \"in inventory\", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.\n\nBond markets can also differ from stock markets in that, in some markets, investors sometimes do not pay brokerage commissions to dealers with whom they buy or sell bonds. Rather, the dealers earn revenue by means of the spread, or difference, between the price at which the dealer buys a bond from one investor\u2014the \"bid\" price\u2014and the price at which he or she sells the same bond to another investor\u2014the \"ask\" or \"offer\" price. The [[Bid\u2013ask spread|bid/offer spread]] represents the total [[transaction cost]] associated with transferring a bond from one investor to another.\n\n==Investing in bonds==\nBonds are bought and traded mostly by institutions like [[central bank]]s, [[sovereign wealth fund]]s, [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[hedge fund]]s, and [[bank]]s. Insurance companies and pension funds have liabilities which essentially include fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates. They buy the bonds to match their liabilities, and may be compelled by law to do this. Most individuals who want to own bonds do so through [[bond fund]]s. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.\n\nThe volatility of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) is lower than that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than [[stock]]s, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of [[dividend]] payments. Bonds are often liquid \u2013 it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities \u2013 and the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive. Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], its bondholders will often receive some money back (the [[recovery amount]]), whereas the company's equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also be risky but less risky than stocks:\n* Fixed rate bonds are subject to ''[[interest rate risk]]'', meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, a decrease in the market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the [[market price]] of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere\u2014perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.\n\nBonds are also subject to various other risks such as call and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] risk, [[credit risk]], [[reinvestment risk]], [[liquidity risk]], [[event risk]], [[foreign exchange risk|exchange rate risk]], [[volatility risk]], [[inflation risk]], [[Credit risk#Sovereign risk|sovereign risk]] and [[Interest rate risk#Banks and interest rate risk|yield curve risk]]. Again, some of these will only affect certain classes of investors.\n\nPrice changes in a bond will immediately affect [[mutual fund]]s that hold these bonds. If the value of the bonds in their trading [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] falls, the value of the portfolio also falls. This can be damaging for professional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers (irrespective of whether the value is immediately \"[[Mark-to-market accounting|marked to market]]\" or not).\nIf there is any chance a holder of individual bonds may need to sell their bonds and \"cash out\", [[interest rate risk]] could become a real problem, conversely, bonds' market prices would increase if the prevailing interest rate were to drop, as it did from 2001 through 2003. One way to quantify the interest rate risk on a bond is in terms of its [[Macaulay Duration|duration]]. Efforts to control this risk are called [[immunization (finance)|immunization]] or [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]].\n* Bond prices can become volatile depending on the credit rating of the issuer \u2013 for instance if the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] like [[Standard & Poor's]] and [[Moody's]] upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk does not affect the bond's interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.\n* A company's bondholders may lose much or all their money if the company goes [[bankrupt]]. Under the laws of many countries (including the United States and Canada), bondholders are in line to receive the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a liquidated company ahead of some other creditors. Bank lenders, deposit holders (in the case of a deposit taking institution such as a bank) and trade creditors may take precedence.\nThere is no guarantee of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]], in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2003/06/16/daily13.html|title=More worthless WorldCom stock\n|website=bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.\n* Some bonds are callable, meaning that even though the company has agreed to make payments plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates [[reinvestment risk]], meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor might not be able to find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.\n\n===Bond indices===\n{{See also|Bond market index}}\nA number of bond indices exist for the purposes of managing portfolios and measuring performance, similar to the [[S&P 500]] or [[Russell Indexes]] for [[stock]]s. The most common American benchmarks are the [[Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index|Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate]] (ex Lehman Aggregate), [[Citigroup BIG]] and [[Merrill Lynch Domestic Master]]. Most indices are parts of families of broader indices that can be used to measure global bond portfolios, or may be further subdivided by maturity or sector for managing specialized portfolios.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bond credit rating]]\n* [[Collective action clause]]\n* [[Debenture]]\n* [[Deferred financing costs]]\n* [[GDP-linked bond]]\n* [[Government bond]]/[[Sovereign bonds]]\n* [[Immunization (finance)]]\n* [[Promissory note]]\n* [[Short-rate model]]\n* [[Penal bond]]\n* [[Structured note]]\n\n'''Market specific'''\n* [[Brady Bonds]]\n* [[Build America Bonds]]\n* [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]]\n\n'''General'''\n* [[Fixed income]]\n* [[List of accounting topics]]\n* [[List of economics topics]]\n* [[List of finance topics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n1) According to mini invest the bonds are [https://www.mini-invest.com/2020/04/why-is-high-quality-bond-typically-considered-a-lower-risk-investment-than-a-stock.html low risk investment than stocks]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bonds}}\n* {{curlie|Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds/Bonds/|Bonds links}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133558/https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/november/estate-planner-victimized-terminally-ill/estate-planner-victimized-terminally-ill Estate planner victimized terminally ill], [[FBI]]\n\n{{Prone to spam|date=March 2012}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should it be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be deleted.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] & [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there  using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n\n{{Bond market}}\n{{Corporate finance and investment banking |state=collapsed}}\n{{Debt}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bond (Finance)}}\n[[Category:Bonds (finance)| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the financial instrument||Bond (disambiguation)}}\n\n{{Securities}}\n\nIn [[finance]], a '''bond''' is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders. The most common types of bonds include [[municipal bond]]s and [[corporate bond]]s.\n\nThe bond is a debt [[security (finance)|security]], under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them [[interest]] (the [[coupon (bond)|coupon]]) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] date.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = O'Sullivan\n | first = Arthur\n | author2=Sheffrin, Steven M.\n | title = Economics: Principles in action\n | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall\n | year = 2004\n | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458\n | pages = 197, 507\n | url = http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ3R9&PMDbSiteId=2781&PMDbSolutionId=6724&PMDbCategoryId=&PMDbProgramId=12881&level=4\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}</ref> Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.<ref>[http://www.moneycontrol.com/pehlakadam/bonds.php Bonds], accessed: 2012-06-08</ref>\n\nThus a bond is a form of [[loan]] or [[IOU]]: the ''holder'' of the bond is the lender (creditor), the ''issuer'' of the bond is the borrower (debtor), and the ''coupon'' is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term [[investment]]s, or, in the case of [[government bond]]s, to finance current expenditure. [[certificate of deposit|Certificates of deposit]] (CDs) or short-term [[commercial paper]] are considered{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be [[money market]] instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nBonds and [[stock]]s are both [[security (finance)|securities]], but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an [[Equity (finance)|equity]] stake in a company (that is, they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (that is, they are lenders). Being a creditor, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind [[secured creditor]]s, in the event of bankruptcy.<ref>\n[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absolutepriority.asp Absolute Priority], accessed: 2013-10-8\n</ref>\nAnother difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, such as a [[Consol (bond)|consol]], which is a [[perpetuity]], that is, a bond with no maturity.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[English language|English]], the word \"{{linktext|bond}}\" relates to the etymology of \"bind\". In the sense \"instrument binding one to pay a sum to another\", use of the word \"bond\" dates from at least the 1590s.<ref>\n{{OEtymD|bond|accessdate=2017-07-23}}\n</ref>\n\n==Issuance==\nBonds are issued by public authorities, credit institutions, companies and [[Supranational union|supranational]] institutions in the [[primary market]]s. The most common process for issuing bonds is through [[underwriting]]. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a [[syndicate]], buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and re-sell them to investors. The security firm takes the risk of being unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by ''[[bookrunner]]s'' who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the [[tombstone (advertising)|tombstone ads]] commonly used to announce bonds to the public. The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.\n\nIn contrast, government bonds are usually issued in an auction. In some cases, both members of the public and banks may bid for bonds. In other cases, only market makers may bid for bonds. The [[Yield to maturity|overall rate of return]] on the bond depends on both the terms of the bond and the price paid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts/Operations |title=UK Debt Management Office |publisher=Dmo.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404181639/http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts%2FOperations |archive-date=2012-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The terms of the bond, such as the coupon, are fixed in advance and the price is determined by the market.\n\nIn the case of an underwritten bond, the underwriters will charge a fee for underwriting. An alternative process for bond issuance, which is commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost, is the private placement bond. Bonds sold directly to buyers may not be tradeable in the [[bond market]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housingfinance.com/ahf/articles/2005/march/bond1.html |title=Affordable Housing Finance |publisher=Housingfinance.com |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Tap}}Historically an alternative practice of issuance was for the borrowing government authority to issue bonds over a period of time, usually at a fixed price, with volumes sold on a particular day dependent on market conditions. This was called a ''tap issue'' or ''bond tap''.<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tap_issue.asp Tap issue] at ''[[Investopedia]]''</ref>\n\n==Features==\n===Principal===\n[[File:1978 $1000 8 3-8% Treasury Bond (reverse).jpg|thumb|upright=1|1978 $1,000 U.S. Treasury Bond]]\nNominal, principal, par, or face amount is the amount on which the issuer pays interest, and which, most commonly, has to be repaid at the end of the term. Some structured bonds can have a redemption amount which is different from the face amount and can be linked to the performance of particular assets.\n\n===Maturity===\nThe issuer has to repay the nominal amount on the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] date. As long as all due payments have been made, the issuer has no further obligations to the bond holders after the maturity date. The length of time until the maturity date is often referred to as the term or tenor or maturity of a bond. The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term of up to 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no maturity date (irredeemable). In the market for United States Treasury securities, there are three categories of bond maturities:\n* short term (bills): maturities between zero and one year;\n* medium term (notes): maturities between one and ten years;\n* long term (bonds): maturities between ten and thirty years;\n* Perpetual: which has no maturity Period.\n\n===Coupon===\nThe [[Coupon (bond)|coupon]] is the interest rate that the issuer pays to the holder. Usually this rate is fixed throughout the life of the bond. It can also vary with a money market index, such as [[LIBOR]], or it can be even more exotic. The name \"coupon\" arose because in the past, paper bond certificates were issued which had coupons attached to them, one for each interest payment. On the due dates the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the interest payment. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual, i.e. every 6 months, or annual.\n[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond - Middelburg - Amsterdam - 1622.jpg|thumb|right|Bond issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1623]]\n\n===Yield===\nThe yield is the rate of return received from investing in the bond. It usually refers either to\n* The [[current yield]], or running yield, which is simply the annual interest payment divided by the current market price of the bond (often the [[clean price]]).\n* The [[yield to maturity]], or redemption yield, which is a more useful measure of the return of the bond. This takes into account the current market price, and the amount and timing of all remaining coupon payments and of the repayment due on maturity. It is equivalent to the [[internal rate of return]] of a bond.\n\n===Credit quality===\nThe quality of the issue refers to the probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates. In other words, credit quality tells investors how likely the borrower is going to default. This will depend on a wide range of factors.\n[[High-yield bond]]s are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]]. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield. These bonds are also called ''junk bonds''.\n\n===Market price===\nThe market price of a tradable bond will be influenced, amongst other factors, by the amounts, currency and timing of the interest payments and capital repayment due, the quality of the bond, and the available redemption yield of other comparable bonds which can be traded in the markets.\n\nThe price can be quoted as [[clean price|clean]] or [[dirty price|dirty]]. \"Dirty\" includes the present value of all future cash flows, including accrued interest, and is most often used in Europe. \"Clean\" does not include accrued interest, and is most often used in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dirtyprice.asp|title=Dirty Price|work=Investopedia|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe issue price at which investors buy the bonds when they are first issued will typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or there is a high [[probability of default]] on the bond).\n\n===Others===\n* Indentures and Covenants\u2014An [[indenture]] is a formal debt agreement that establishes the terms of a bond issue, while covenants are the clauses of such an agreement. Covenants specify the rights of bondholders and the duties of issuers, such as actions that the issuer is obligated to perform or is prohibited from performing. In the U.S., federal and state securities and commercial laws apply to the enforcement of these agreements, which are construed by courts as contracts between issuers and bondholders. The terms may be changed only with great difficulty while the bonds are outstanding, with amendments to the governing document generally requiring approval by a [[majority]] (or [[Supermajority|super-majority]]) vote of the bondholders.\n* Optionality: Occasionally a bond may contain an [[embedded option]]; that is, it grants [[option (finance)|option-like]] features to the holder or the issuer:\n** Callability\u2014Some bonds give the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates; see [[call option]]. These bonds are referred to as [[callable bond]]s. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at [[Par value|par]]. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.\n** Puttability\u2014Some bonds give the holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date on the put dates; see [[put option]]. These are referred to as retractable or [[putable bond]]s.\n** Call dates and put dates\u2014the [[option style|dates]] on which callable and putable bonds can be redeemed early. There are four main categories:\n*** A Bermudan callable has several call dates, usually coinciding with coupon dates.\n*** A European callable has only one call date. This is a special case of a Bermudan callable.\n*** An American callable can be called at any time until the maturity date.\n*** A death put is an optional redemption feature on a debt instrument allowing the beneficiary of the estate of a deceased bondholder to put (sell) the bond back to the issuer at face value in the event of the bondholder's death or legal incapacitation. This is also known as a \"survivor's option\".\n** [[Sinking fund]] provision of the corporate bond indenture requires a certain portion of the issue to be retired periodically. The entire bond issue can be liquidated by the maturity date; if not, the remainder is called balloon maturity. Issuers may either pay to trustees, which in turn call randomly selected bonds in the issue, or, alternatively, purchase bonds in open market, then return them to trustees.\n*** Bonds are often identified by its international securities identification number, or [[International Securities Identification Number|ISIN]], which is a 12 digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies debt securities.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:South Carolina consolidation bond.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Bond certificate for the state of South Carolina issued in 1873 under the state's Consolidation Act.]]\n[[File:Obligatie-Moskau-Kiev-Woronesch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Railroad obligation of the Moscow-Kiev-Voronezh railroad company, printed in Russian, Dutch and German.]]\n\nThe following descriptions are not mutually exclusive, and more than one of them may apply to a particular bond:\n* [[Fixed rate bond]]s have a coupon that remains constant throughout the life of the bond. A variation are stepped-coupon bonds, whose coupon increases during the life of the bond.\n* [[Floating rate note]]s (FRNs, floaters) have a variable coupon that is linked to a [[reference rate]] of interest, such as [[Libor]] or [[Euribor]]. For example, the coupon may be defined as three-month USD LIBOR + 0.20%. The coupon rate is recalculated periodically, typically every one or three months.\n* [[Zero-coupon bond]]s (zeros) pay no regular interest. They are issued at a substantial discount to [[par value]], so that the interest is effectively rolled up to maturity (and usually taxed as such). The bondholder receives the full principal amount on the redemption date. An example of zero coupon bonds is Series E savings bonds issued by the U.S. government<!-- are these traded securities?--->. [[Zero-coupon bond]]s may be created from fixed rate bonds by a financial institution separating (\"stripping off\") the coupons from the principal. In other words, the separated coupons and the final principal payment of the bond may be traded separately. See IO (Interest Only) and PO (Principal Only).\n* [[High-yield bond]]s (junk bonds) are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]]. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield.\n* [[Convertible bond]]s let a bondholder exchange a bond to a number of shares of the issuer's common stock. These are known as [[Hybrid security|hybrid securities]], because they combine [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and [[debt]] features.\n* [[Exchangeable bond]]s allows for exchange to shares of a corporation other than the issuer.\n* [[Inflation-indexed bond]]s (linkers) (US) or Index-linked bond (UK), in which the principal amount and the interest payments are indexed to inflation. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this position briefly reversed itself for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). However, as the principal amount grows, the payments increase with inflation. The [[United Kingdom]] was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation linked [[Gilt-edged securities|gilts]] in the 1980s. [[Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities]] (TIPS) and [[Treasury security#Series I|I-bonds]] are examples of inflation linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.\n[[File:Receipt for temporary bonds.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Receipt for temporary bonds for the state of Kansas issued in 1922]]\n* Other indexed bonds, for example [[equity-linked note]]s and bonds indexed on a business indicator (income, added value) or on a country's [[GDP]].\n* [[Asset-backed security|Asset-backed securities]] are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are [[mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBSs), [[collateralized mortgage obligation]]s (CMOs) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).\n* [[Subordinated debt|Subordinated bonds]] are those that have a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of [[liquidation]]. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what is called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds can be found in bonds issued by banks, and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in [[tranche]]s. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.\n* [[Covered bond]]s are backed by cash flows from mortgages or public sector assets. Contrary to [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] the assets for such bonds remain on the issuers balance sheet.\n* [[Perpetual bond]]s are also often called [[Perpetuity|perpetuities]] or 'Perps'. They have no maturity date. The most famous of these are the UK Consols, which are also known as Treasury Annuities or Undated Treasuries. Some of these were issued back in 1888 and still trade today, although the amounts are now insignificant. Some ultra-long-term bonds (sometimes a bond can last centuries: West Shore Railroad issued a bond which matures in 2361 (i.e. 24th century)) are virtually perpetuities from a financial point of view, with the current value of principal near zero.\n* The ''Methuselah'' is a type of bond with a maturity of 50-years or longer.<ref>https://www.ledevoir.com/economie/561203/obligations-quand-les-etats-sont-tentes-par-la-dette-mathusalem , talking about 100-year maturity bonds.</ref> The term is a reference to [[Methuselah]], the oldest person whose age is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The issuance in Methuselahs has been increasing in recent years due to demand for longer-dated assets from [[pension]] plans, particularly in [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Issuance of Methuselahs in the [[United States]] has been limited, however, as the [[U.S. Treasury]] does not currently issue [[Treasury security|Treasuries]] with maturities beyond 30 years, which would serve as a reference level for any [[corporate debt|corporate]] issuance.\n* [[Bearer bond]] is an official certificate issued without a named holder. In other words, the person who has the paper certificate can claim the value of the bond. Often they are registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting, but may be traded like cash. Bearer bonds are very risky because they can be lost or stolen. Especially after federal income tax began in the United States, bearer bonds were seen as an opportunity to conceal income or assets.<ref>Eason, Yla (June 6, 1983). \"Final Surge in Bearer Bonds\" ''New York Times''.</ref> U.S. corporations stopped issuing bearer bonds in the 1960s, the U.S. Treasury stopped in 1982, and state and local tax-exempt bearer bonds were prohibited in 1983.<ref>Quint, Michael (August 14, 1984). \"Elements in Bearer Bond Issue\". ''New York Times''.</ref>\n* Registered bond is a bond whose ownership (and any subsequent purchaser) is recorded by the issuer, or by a transfer agent. It is the alternative to a [[Bearer bond]]. Interest payments, and the principal upon maturity are sent to the registered owner.\n* A [[government bond]], also called Treasury bond, is issued by a national government and is not exposed to default risk. It is characterized as the safest bond, with the lowest interest rate. A treasury bond is backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the relevant government. For that reason, for the major OECD countries this type of bond is often referred to as risk-free.\n* A [[supranational bond]] also known as a \"supra\" is issued by a [[Supranational union|supranational organisation]] like the [[World Bank]]. They are have very good credit rating like government bonds.\n* [[File:San Francisco Pacific Railroad Bond WPRR 1865.jpg|thumb|right|'''Pacific Railroad Bond''' issued by City and County of San Francisco, CA. May 1, 1865]] [[Municipal bond]] is a bond issued by a state, U.S. Territory, city, local government, or their agencies. Interest income received by holders of municipal bonds is [[tax advantage|exempt]] from the federal [[income tax]] and sometimes from the income tax of the state in which they are issued, although municipal bonds issued for certain purposes may not be tax exempt. Municipal bonds issued in U.S. territories are exempted from all federal, state, and local taxes, making them triple-exempted. \n* Build America Bonds (BABs) are a form of [[municipal bond]] authorized by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Unlike traditional US municipal bonds, which are usually tax exempt, interest received on BABs is subject to federal taxation. However, as with municipal bonds, the bond is tax-exempt within the US state where it is issued. Generally, BABs offer significantly higher yields (over 7 percent) than standard municipal bonds.<ref>{{cite web | author=Benjamin Shepherd | title=A Slice of the Pie | url=http://www.investingdaily.com/ruk/18220/a-slice-of-the-pie.html | publisher=InvestingDaily.com | accessdate=2010-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713052252/http://www.investingdaily.com/ruk/18220/a-slice-of-the-pie.html | archive-date=2011-07-13 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Book-entry bond is a bond that does not have a paper certificate.

The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds can be used by companies to break into foreign markets, or can be converted into the issuing company's local currency to be used on existing operations through the use of foreign exchange swap hedges. Foreign issuer bonds can also be used to hedge foreign exchange rate risk. Some foreign issuer bonds are called by their nicknames, such as the \"samurai bond\". These can be issued by foreign issuers looking to diversify their investor base away from domestic markets. These bond issues are generally governed by the law of the market of issuance, e.g., a samurai bond, issued by an investor based in Europe, will be governed by Japanese law.

That relationship is the definition of the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics, as otherwise there would be [[arbitrage]] opportunities. The yield and price of a bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa. For a discussion of the mathematics see [[Bond valuation]].\n\nThe bond's market price is usually expressed as a percentage of nominal value: 100% of face value, \"at par\", corresponds to a price of 100; prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. The [[market price]] of a bond may be quoted including the [[accrued interest]] since the last coupon date. (Some bond markets include accrued interest in the trading price and others add it on separately when settlement is made.) The price including accrued interest is known as the \"full\" or \"[[dirty price]]\". (''See also'' [[Accrual bond]].) The price excluding accrued interest is known as the \"flat\" or \"[[clean price]]\".\n\nMost government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the [[United States]], or in units of \u00a3100 in the [[United Kingdom]]. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) Some short-term bonds, such as the [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bill|U.S. Treasury bill]], are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.\n\nBonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as \"[[pull to par]]\". At the time of issue of the bond, the coupon paid, and other conditions of the bond, will have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as current market interest rates, the length of the term and the creditworthiness of the issuer. These factors are likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued.\n\nThe interest payment (\"coupon payment\") divided by the current price of the bond is called the [[current yield]] (this is the [[nominal yield]] multiplied by the par value and divided by the price). There are other yield measures that exist such as the yield to first call, yield to worst, yield to first par call, yield to put, cash flow yield and yield to maturity. The relationship between yield and term to maturity (or alternatively between yield and the weighted mean term allowing for both interest and capital repayment) for otherwise identical bonds derives the [[yield curve]], a graph plotting this relationship.\n\nIf the bond includes [[embedded option]]s, the valuation is more difficult and combines [[option pricing]] with discounting. Depending on the type of option, the [[option premium|option price]] as calculated is either added to or subtracted from the price of the \"straight\" portion. See further under [[Bond option#Embedded options]]. This total is then the value of the bond. More sophisticated [[Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid securities|lattice-]] or [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing|simulation-based techniques]] may (also) be employed.\n\nBond markets, unlike stock or share markets, sometimes do not have a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed [[bond market]]s such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] markets. In such a market, [[market liquidity]] is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the [[counterparty]] to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond \"in inventory\", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.\n\nBond markets can also differ from stock markets in that, in some markets, investors sometimes do not pay brokerage commissions to dealers with whom they buy or sell bonds. Rather, the dealers earn revenue by means of the spread, or difference, between the price at which the dealer buys a bond from one investor\u2014the \"bid\" price\u2014and the price at which he or she sells the same bond to another investor\u2014the \"ask\" or \"offer\" price. The [[Bid\u2013ask spread|bid/offer spread]] represents the total [[transaction cost]] associated with transferring a bond from one investor to another.\n\n==Investing in bonds==\nBonds are bought and traded mostly by institutions like [[central bank]]s, [[sovereign wealth fund]]s, [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[hedge fund]]s, and [[bank]]s. Insurance companies and pension funds have liabilities which essentially include fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates. They buy the bonds to match their liabilities, and may be compelled by law to do this. Most individuals who want to own bonds do so through [[bond fund]]s. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.\n\nThe volatility of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) is lower than that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than [[stock]]s, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of [[dividend]] payments. Bonds are often liquid \u2013 it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities \u2013 and the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive. Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], its bondholders will often receive some money back (the [[recovery amount]]), whereas the company's equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also be risky but less risky than stocks:\n* Fixed rate bonds are subject to ''[[interest rate risk]]'', meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, a decrease in the market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the [[market price]] of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere\u2014perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.\n\nBonds are also subject to various other risks such as call and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] risk, [[credit risk]], [[reinvestment risk]], [[liquidity risk]], [[event risk]], [[foreign exchange risk|exchange rate risk]], [[volatility risk]], [[inflation risk]], [[Credit risk#Sovereign risk|sovereign risk]] and [[Interest rate risk#Banks and interest rate risk|yield curve risk]]. Again, some of these will only affect certain classes of investors.\n\nPrice changes in a bond will immediately affect [[mutual fund]]s that hold these bonds. If the value of the bonds in their trading [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] falls, the value of the portfolio also falls. This can be damaging for professional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers (irrespective of whether the value is immediately \"[[Mark-to-market accounting|marked to market]]\" or not).\nIf there is any chance a holder of individual bonds may need to sell their bonds and \"cash out\", [[interest rate risk]] could become a real problem, conversely, bonds' market prices would increase if the prevailing interest rate were to drop, as it did from 2001 through 2003. One way to quantify the interest rate risk on a bond is in terms of its [[Macaulay Duration|duration]]. Efforts to control this risk are called [[immunization (finance)|immunization]] or [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]].\n* Bond prices can become volatile depending on the credit rating of the issuer \u2013 for instance if the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] like [[Standard & Poor's]] and [[Moody's]] upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk does not affect the bond's interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.\n* A company's bondholders may lose much or all their money if the company goes [[bankrupt]]. Under the laws of many countries (including the United States and Canada), bondholders are in line to receive the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a liquidated company ahead of some other creditors. Bank lenders, deposit holders (in the case of a deposit taking institution such as a bank) and trade creditors may take precedence.\nThere is no guarantee of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]], in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2003/06/16/daily13.html|title=More worthless WorldCom stock\n|website=bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.\n* Some bonds are callable, meaning that even though the company has agreed to make payments plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates [[reinvestment risk]], meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor might not be able to find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.\n\n===Bond indices===\n{{See also|Bond market index}}\nA number of bond indices exist for the purposes of managing portfolios and measuring performance, similar to the [[S&P 500]] or [[Russell Indexes]] for [[stock]]s. The most common American benchmarks are the [[Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index|Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate]] (ex Lehman Aggregate), [[Citigroup BIG]] and [[Merrill Lynch Domestic Master]]. Most indices are parts of families of broader indices that can be used to measure global bond portfolios, or may be further subdivided by maturity or sector for managing specialized portfolios.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bond credit rating]]\n* [[Collective action clause]]\n* [[Debenture]]\n* [[Deferred financing costs]]\n* [[GDP-linked bond]]\n* [[Government bond]]/[[Sovereign bonds]]\n* [[Immunization (finance)]]\n* [[Promissory note]]\n* [[Short-rate model]]\n* [[Penal bond]]\n* [[Structured note]]\n\n'''Market specific'''\n* [[Brady Bonds]]\n* [[Build America Bonds]]\n* [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]]\n\n'''General'''\n* [[Fixed income]]\n* [[List of accounting topics]]\n* [[List of economics topics]]\n* [[List of finance topics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bonds}}\n* {{curlie|Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds/Bonds/|Bonds links}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133558/https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/november/estate-planner-victimized-terminally-ill/estate-planner-victimized-terminally-ill Estate planner victimized terminally ill], [[FBI]]\n\n{{Prone to spam|date=March 2012}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should it be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be deleted.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] & [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there  using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n\n{{Bond market}}\n{{Corporate finance and investment banking |state=collapsed}}\n{{Debt}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bond (Finance)}}\n[[Category:Bonds (finance)| ]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:202d:ec21:b438:7b09:df10:31de", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)"}

He was a composer, pianist, conductor and teacher. After an early career as a performer and composer, he was an early member of the staff of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London, and became its principal in 1832, remaining in the post until 1859.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\nPotter was born in London to a musical family. He was the third son of the seven children of Richard Huddleston Potter (1755\u20131821), a flautist, violinist, and teacher, and his wife, Charlotte, ''n\u00e9e'' Baumgarten (1757\u20131837).

The last, who, like Attwood, was a former pupil of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], is considered by the biographer Philip Olleson to have been the teacher who most influenced the young Potter. At 21 Potter was accepted as an associate member of the recently-founded [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society]], and was elected to full membership in 1815.<ref name=dnb/> The following year the society commissioned an overture in E minor from him, and he featured in subsequent concerts both as composer and performer.
