At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played in the second position for all games except three because Niklas Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played this position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won its second World Curling Championship bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2012), and European Masters (2013), as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Elite Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and reaching their first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]]. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]], as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Team Eriksson reached the final and won the silver medal in their World Curling Championship debut.\n\n=== Seniors II (2014-present): Team Edin ===\n\nIn May 2014, Edin and Team Eriksson came to an agreement to form a new Team Edin, with Edin skipping the team in the fourth position and Oskar Eriksson playing third along with Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m playing second and Christoffer Sundgren in the lead position.<ref name=nwt2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2014/05/13/edin-och-eriksson-bildar-supercurlinglag/ |title=Edin och Eriksson bilder supercurlinglag|publisher=Nya Wermlands-Tidningen |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}.</ref> When Lindstr\u00f6m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran\u00e5 took over as second. From the start, however, the new Team Edin team immediately saw their increased potential and aimed to become the number one team in the world.<ref name=nwt2014 /> Indeed,  Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the [[2016\u201317 curling season]] on both lists and finished in first place on the prize money list in the [[2017-18 curling season]]. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured medals in the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017).\n\nAs part of Team Edin, Eriksson and his teammates have been consistently ranked in the top ten teams in the world since they joined forces, due to their performance in Canada and around the world. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In the 2016-17 season, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players\u2019 Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup) of all but one of the slams, securing the Pinty\u2019s Cup, the first non-Canadian men's team to do so. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> Team Edin has also won the [[Swedish Men's Curling Championships]] six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping only the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.\n\n=== Career Achievements  ===\n\nCurrently, Eriksson is the only Swedish curler to have taken part in nine consecutive [[World Curling Championships]] in the men's division (2011-2019). Eriksson has also competed in eleven consecutive [[European Curling Championships]], winning a record seven gold medals, a record that he shares only with Niklas Edin. With Team Edin, Eriksson has won four World Curling Championship gold medals (in 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2019), placing him in an elite group of curlers to hold four World Championship titles.<ref>[[List of men%27s World Curling champions]]</ref> In 2019, Eriksson became the first curler in history to hold three key gold medals in a single calendar year: the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|World Curling Championship]], the [[2019 European Curling Championships|European Curling Championship]], and the [[2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship|World Mixed Doubles Championship]] (with Anna Hasselborg).<ref name=Erikssonhistoria /> As part of Team Edin, Eriksson, Niklas Edin, and Christoffer Sundgren also became the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold the World Curling Championship and European Curling Championship titles in two separate calendar years (2015 and 2019).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref> Eriksson and Edin had previously become the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold those same titles in three separate competition seasons (2012-2013, 2014\u20132015, and 2017-2018).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Eriksson was inducted into the [[Swedish Curling Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Grand Slam record==\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

for the [[Niklas Edin]] rink. He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019. He won medals in all but one of these championships, as well as playing in multiple positions \u2013 as skip (silver, [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship|2014]]), third (gold, [[2015 World Men's Curling Championship|2015]], [[2018 World Men's Curling Championship|2018]], [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|2019]] and silver, [[2017 World Men's Curling Championship|2017]]) second (bronze, [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship|2012]]), and as an alternate (gold, [[2013 World Men's Curling Championship|2013]] and bronze, [[2011 World Men's Curling Championship|2011]]). As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old.

As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nEriksson made his first run for a junior world championship title when he was sixteen at the [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]], skipping his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and Nils Karlsson, to a silver medal, losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]]. In 2008, Eriksson moved to H\u00e4rnosand to join other promising curlers at H\u00e4rnosands gymnasium.<ref name=Eriksson2008>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/01/06/oskar-kom-hem-och-vann/|title=Oskar kom hem \u2013 och vann|publisher=Nya Wermalands Tidningen|date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> He also joined Team Lits CC/Lindstr\u00f6m, formed by brothers [[Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m]] and [[Alexander Lindstr\u00f6m]] along with [[Christoffer Sundgren]] and [[Henrik Leek]].

His official team during this period was Team Lit, alternatively known as Team Lindstr\u00f6m and eventually Team Eriksson. Eriksson skipped the team for most of this period through 2014.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 5 April 2020|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref> From 2009 through February 2014, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Niklas Edin]], [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, Team Lit became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2012/10/04/topplag-i-samma-bo |title=Topplag i samma bo|publisher=Nya Wermlands Tidningen |date= 4 October 2012|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship gold medal (2013) and two bronze medals (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played in the second position for all games except three because Niklas Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played this position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won its second World Curling Championship bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2012), and European Masters (2013), as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Elite Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and reaching their first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]]. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]], as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Team Eriksson reached the final and won the silver medal in their World Curling Championship debut.\n\n=== Seniors II (2014-present): Team Edin ===\n\nIn May 2014, Edin and Team Eriksson came to an agreement to form a new Team Edin, with Edin skipping the team in the fourth position and Oskar Eriksson playing third along with Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m playing second and Christoffer Sundgren in the lead position.<ref name=nwt2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2014/05/13/edin-och-eriksson-bildar-supercurlinglag/ |title=Edin och Eriksson bilder supercurlinglag|publisher=Nya Wermlands-Tidningen |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}.</ref> When Lindstr\u00f6m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran\u00e5 took over as second. From the start, however, the new Team Edin team immediately saw their increased potential and aimed to become the number one team in the world.<ref name=nwt2014 /> Indeed,  Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the [[2016\u201317 curling season]] on both lists and finished in first place on the prize money list in the [[2017-18 curling season]]. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured medals in the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017).\n\nAs part of Team Edin, Eriksson and his teammates have been consistently ranked in the top ten teams in the world since they joined forces, due to their performance in Canada and around the world. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In the 2016-17 season, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players\u2019 Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup) of all but one of the slams, securing the Pinty\u2019s Cup, the first non-Canadian men's team to do so. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> Team Edin has also won the [[Swedish Men's Curling Championships]] six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping only the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.\n\n=== Career Achievements  ===\n\nCurrently, Eriksson is the only Swedish curler to have taken part in nine consecutive [[World Curling Championships]] in the men's division (2011-2019). Eriksson has also competed in eleven consecutive [[European Curling Championships]], winning a record seven gold medals, a record that he shares only with Niklas Edin. With Team Edin, Eriksson has won four World Curling Championship gold medals (in 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2019), placing him in an elite group of curlers to hold four World Championship titles.<ref>[[List of men%27s World Curling champions]]</ref> In 2019, Eriksson became the first curler in history to hold three key gold medals in a single calendar year: the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|World Curling Championship]], the [[2019 European Curling Championships|European Curling Championship]], and the [[2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship|World Mixed Doubles Championship]] (with Anna Hasselborg).<ref name=Erikssonhistoria /> As part of Team Edin, Eriksson, Niklas Edin, and Christoffer Sundgren also became the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold the World Curling Championship and European Curling Championship titles in two separate calendar years (2015 and 2019).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref> Eriksson and Edin had previously become the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold those same titles in three separate competition seasons (2012-2013, 2014\u20132015, and 2017-2018).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Eriksson was inducted into the [[Swedish Curling Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Grand Slam record==\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A visa number might not be immediately available even if the USCIS approves the petition, because the number of immigrant visa numbers is limited every year by quotas set in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA). There are also certain additional limitations by [[country of chargeability]]. Thus, most immigrants will be placed on lengthy waiting lists. Those immigrants who are immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen (spouses and children under 21 years of age, and parents of a U.S. citizen who is 21 years of age or older) are not subject to these quotas and may proceed to the next step immediately (since they qualify for the IR immigrant category).\n#'''Immigrant visa adjudication''' \u2013 in the third step, when an immigrant visa number becomes available, the applicant must either apply with USCIS to adjust their current status to permanent resident status or apply with the DOS for an immigrant visa at the nearest U.S. consulate before being allowed to come to the United States.\n#*'''[[Adjustment of status]] (AOS)''' \u2013 Adjustment of status is for when the immigrant is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally.

It still requires the immigrant visa petition to be first completed and approved. The applicant may make an appointment at the U.S. embassy or consulate in his/her home country, where a consular officer adjudicates the case. If the case is approved, an immigrant visa is issued by the U.S. embassy or consulate. The visa entitles the holder to travel to the United States as an immigrant. At the port of entry, the immigrant visa holder immediately becomes a permanent resident, and is processed for a permanent resident card and receives an I-551 stamp in his/her passport. The permanent resident card is mailed to his/her U.S. address within 120 days.\nAn applicant (alien) in the United States can obtain two permits while the case is pending after a certain stage is passed in green card processing (filing of I-485). \n* The first is a temporary work permit known as the [[Employment Authorization Document]] (EAD), which allows the alien to take employment in the United States. \n* The second is a temporary travel document, [[advance parole]], which allows the alien to re-enter the United States. Both permits confer benefits that are independent of any existing status granted to the alien.

The foreign spouse of a green-card holder must wait for approval of an \"immigrant visa\" from the State Department before entering the United States. Due to numerical limitation on the number of these visas, the wait time for approval may be months or years. In the interim, the spouse cannot be legally present in the United States, unless he or she secures a visa by some other means. Green-card holders may opt to wait to become U.S. citizens, and only then sponsor their spouses and children, as the process is much faster for U.S. citizens. However, many green-card holders can choose to apply for the spouse or children and update their application after becoming a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe issue of U.S. green-card holders separated from their families for years is not a new problem. A mechanism to unite families of green-card holders was created by the LIFE Act by the introduction of a \"[[V visa]]\", signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]]. The law expired on December 31, 2000, and V visas are no longer available. From time to time, bills are introduced in Congress to reinstate V visas, but so far none have been successful.\n\n====Improving the application process in obtaining a green card====\nThe most common challenges that USCIS faces in providing services in the green card process are: (1) the length of the application and approval process, and (2) the quotas of green cards granted. USCIS tries to shorten the time qualified applicants wait to receive permanent residence.\n\n=====Challenges with processing time of application=====\nUnder the current system, immediate family members (spouse, child, and dependent mother and father), have priority status for green cards and generally wait 6 months to a year to have their green card application approved. For non-immediate family members, the process may take up to 10 years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Paperwork is processed on a first-come, first-served basis, so new applications may go untouched for several months. To address the issue of slow processing times, USCIS has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the I-130 and I-485 forms at the same time. This has reduced the processing time. Another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes. In these cases papers are sent back to the applicant, further delaying the process. Currently the largest issue creating long wait times is not processing time, but rather immigrant visa quotas set by Congress.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Millions stay in green-card limbo|journal=The Augusta Chronicle|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=====Quota system challenges=====\nLong wait times are a symptom of another issue\u2014quotas preventing immigrants from receiving immigrant visas. Georgia's ''Augusta Chronicle'' in 2006 stated that an estimated two million people are on waiting lists in anticipation to become legal and permanent residents of the United States. Immigrants need visas to get off of these waiting lists, and Congress would need to change immigration law in order to accommodate them with legal status.\n\nThe number of green cards that can be granted to family-based applicants depends on what preference category they fall under. An unlimited number of immediate relatives can receive green cards because there is no quota for that category. Family members who fall under the other various preference categories have fixed quotas, however the number of visas issued from each category may vary because unused visas from one category may rollover into another category.\n\n===Application process for employment-based visa===\nMany immigrants opt for this route, which typically requires an employer to \"sponsor\" (i.e., to petition before USCIS) the immigrant (known as the ''alien beneficiary'') through a presumed future job (in some special categories, the applicant may apply on his/her behalf without a sponsor). The three-step process outlined above is described here in more detail for employment-based immigration applications. After the process is complete, the alien is expected to take the certified job offered by the employer to substantiate his or her immigrant status, since the application ultimately rests on the alien's employment with that company in that particular position.\n#'''Immigrant petition''' \u2013 the first step includes the pre-requisite [[labor certification]] upon which the actual petition will reside.\n#*'''Labor certification''' \u2013 the employer must legally prove that it has a need to hire an alien for a specific position and that there is no minimally qualified U.S. citizen or LPR available to fill that position, hence the reason for hiring the alien. Some of the requirements to prove this situation include: proof of advertising for the specific position; skill requirements particular to the job; verification of the prevailing wage for a position; and the employer's ability to pay. This is currently done through an electronic system known as [[PERM, labor certification|PERM]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Permanent Labor Certification |publisher=Employment and Training Administration, US Department of Labor |url=http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/perm.cfm |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107152920/http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/perm.cfm |archive-date=January 7, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The date when the labor certification application is filed becomes the applicant's ''[[priority date]]''.

Many of the EB categories allow expedited processing of this stage, known as \"premium processing\".\n#'''Immigrant visa availability'''. When the immigrant petition is approved by the USCIS, the petition is forwarded to the NVC for visa allocation. Currently this step centers around the [[priority date]] concept.\n#*'''Priority date''' \u2013 the visa becomes available when the applicant's ''[[priority date]]'' is earlier than the ''cutoff date'' announced on the DOS's Visa Bulletin<ref>[https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/law-and-policy/bulletin.html Visa Bulletin], ''US Department of State'', retrieved on December 3, 2007</ref> or when the immigrant visa category the applicant is assigned to is announced as \"current\". A \"current\" designation indicates that visa numbers are available to all applicants in the corresponding immigrant category. Petitions with priority dates earlier than the cutoff date are expected to have visas available, therefore those applicants are eligible for final adjudication. When the NVC determines that a visa number could be available for a particular immigrant petition, a visa is tentatively allocated to the applicant. The NVC will send a letter stating that the applicant may be eligible for adjustment of status, and requiring the applicant to choose either to adjust status with the USCIS directly, or apply at the U.S. consulate abroad. This waiting process determines when the applicant can expect the immigration case to be adjudicated. Due to quotas imposed on EB visa categories, there are more approved immigrant petitions than visas available under INA. High demand for visas has created a backlog of approved but unadjudicated cases. In addition, due to processing inefficiencies throughout DOS and USCIS systems, not all visas available under the quota system in a given year were allocated to applicants by the DOS. Since there is no quota carry-over to the next fiscal year, for several years visa quotas have not been fully used, thus adding to the visa backlog.<ref>October 2006, [https://www.immigrationsupport.com/pdf/Newsletter fall 2006.pdf Business Immigration Review], Issue Fall 2006, ''Immigration Support Services'', retrieved December 3, 2007</ref>\n#'''Immigrant visa adjudication'''. When the NVC determines that an immigrant visa is available, the case can be adjudicated. If the alien is already in the US, that alien has a choice to finalize the green card process via adjustment of status in the US, or via consular processing abroad. If the alien is outside of the USA he/she can only apply for an immigrant visa at the U.S. consulate. The USCIS does not allow an alien to pursue consular processing and AOS simultaneously. Prior to filing the form I-485 (Adjustment of Status) it is required that the applicant have a ''medical examination'' performed by a USCIS-approved civil surgeon. The examination includes a blood test and specific immunizations, unless the applicant provides proof that the required immunizations were already done elsewhere. The civil surgeon hands the applicant a sealed envelope containing a completed form I-693, which must be included unopened with the I-485 application.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070630133347/http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=eb1f3591ec04d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status], form I-693 description, ''USCIS Website'', retrieved December 3, 2007</ref> (The cited reference also states that the February 25, 2010 edition of the Form I-693 reflects that an individual should no longer be tested for HIV infection.)\n#*'''Adjustment of status (AOS)''' \u2013 after the alien has a labor certification and has been provisionally allocated a visa number, the final step is to change his or her status to permanent residency. [[Adjustment of status]] is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, ''Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status''. If an immigrant visa number is available, the USCIS will allow ''\"concurrent filing\"'': it will accept forms I-140 and I-485 submitted in the same package or will accept form I-485 even before the approval of the I-140.\n#*'''Consular processing''' \u2013 this is an alternative to AOS, but still requires the immigrant visa petition to be completed. In the past (pre-2005), this process was somewhat faster than applying for AOS, so was sometimes used to circumvent long backlogs (of over two years in some cases). However, due to recent efficiency improvements by the USCIS, it is not clear whether applying via consular processing is faster than the regular AOS process. Consular processing is also thought to be riskier since there is no or very little recourse for appeal if the officer denies the application.\n\n===Green card lottery===\n{{main|Diversity Immigrant Visa}}\n\nEach year, around 50,000 immigrant visas are made available through the Diversity Visa (DV) program, also known as the [[Green Card Lottery]] to people who were born in countries with low rates of [[immigration to the United States]] (fewer than 50,000 immigrants in the past five years). Applicants can only qualify by [[country of chargeability]], not by citizenship. Anyone who is selected under this lottery will be given the opportunity to apply for permanent residence. They can also file for their spouse and any unmarried children under the age of 21.\n\nIf permanent residence is granted, the winner (and his/her family, if applicable) receives an immigrant visa in their passport(s) that has to be \"activated\" within six months of issuance at any port of entry to the United States. If already in the U.S. adjustment of status may be pursued. The new immigrant receives a stamp on the visa as proof of lawful admittance to the United States, and the individual is now authorized to live and work permanently in the United States. Finally, the actual \"green card\" typically arrives by mail within a few months.\n\n====Crime: green card lottery scam====\nThere is a growing number of fraudulent green card lottery [[Confidence trick|scams]], in which false agents take money from applicants by promising to submit application forms for them. Most agents are not working for the distribution service. Some claim that they can increase the chance of winning the lottery. This is not true; in fact, they may delay or not submit the application. Likewise, some claim to provide to winners free airline tickets or other benefits, such as submissions in future years or cash funds. There is no way to guarantee their claims, and there are numerous nefarious reasons for them not to fulfill their promises. Applicants are advised to use only official U.S. government websites, in which the [[URL]] ends in [[.gov]].\n\n====Green card lottery e-mail fraud====\nOther fraud perpetrators will e-mail potential victims posing as State Department or other government officials with requests to wire or transfer money online as part of a \"processing fee.\" These fraudulent e-mails are designed to steal money from unsuspecting victims. The senders often use phony e-mail addresses and logos designed to make them look more like official government correspondence. One easy way to tell that an email is a fraud is that it does not end with a \".gov\". One particularly common fraud email asks potential victims to wire money via [[Western Union]] to an individual (the name varies) at the following address in the United Kingdom: 24 Grosvenor Square, London. These emails come from a variety of email addresses designed to impersonate the U.S. State Department. The USCIS blog has published information on this email scam and how to report fraudulent emails to the authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/archive/blog/2011/03/e-mail-scam-avoid-green-card-lottery|title=E-mail Scam: Avoid Green Card Lottery Fraud|website=USCIS|access-date=January 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109172924/https://www.uscis.gov/archive/blog/2011/03/e-mail-scam-avoid-green-card-lottery|archive-date=January 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The U.S. government has issued warnings about this type of fraud or similar business practices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.uscis.gov/2011/03/e-mail-scam-avoid-green-card-lottery.html |title=The Beacon: E-mail Scam: Avoid Green Card Lottery Fraud |publisher=Blog.uscis.gov |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719015539/http://blog.uscis.gov/2011/03/e-mail-scam-avoid-green-card-lottery.html |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Website Fraud Warning |publisher=US Department of State |url=https://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/types/types_1749.html |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230232918/http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/types/types_1749.html |archive-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=FTC Consumer Alert: Diversity Visa Lottery: Read the Rules, Avoid the Rip-Offs |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt003.htm |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102043240/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt003.htm |archive-date=January 2, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Registry====\nThe \"registry\" is a provision of the INA which allows an alien who has previously entered the United States illegally to obtain legal permanent residence simply on the basis of having ''de facto'' resided in the country over a very long time.

An exception to this rule is the case of a U.S. citizen legally sponsoring a spouse in which the marriage at the time of the adjustment of status (I-485) is more than two years old. In this case, the conditional status is waived and a 10-year \"permanent resident card\" is issued after the USCIS approves the case. A permanent resident under the conditional clause may receive an I-551 stamp as well as a permanent resident card. The expiration date of the conditional period is two years from the approval date. The immigrant visa category is CR (conditional resident).\n\nWhen this two-year conditional period is over, the permanent residence automatically expires and the applicant is subject to deportation and removal unless, up to 90 days before the conditional residence expires, the applicant must file form I-751 ''Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence''<ref>[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-751.pdf form I-751] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029120854/http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-751.pdf |date=October 29, 2007 }}, ''USCIS Website'', retrieved on December 3, 2007</ref> (if conditional permanent residence was obtained through marriage) or form I-829 ''Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions''<ref>[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-829.pdf form I-829] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029120855/http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-829.pdf |date=October 29, 2007 }}, ''USCIS Website'', retrieved December 3, 2007</ref> (if conditional permanent residence was obtained through investment) with USCIS to have the conditions removed. Once the application is received, permanent residence is extended in 1-year intervals until the request to remove conditions is approved or denied. For conditional permanent residence obtained through marriage, both spouses must sign the form I-751; if the spouses are divorced, it is possible to get a waiver of the other spouse's signing requirement, if it can be proved that the marriage was bona fide.\n\nThe USCIS requires that the application for the removal of conditions provide both general and specific supporting evidence that the basis on which the applicant obtained conditional permanent residence was not fraudulent. For an application based on marriage, birth certificates of children, joint financial statements, and letters from employers, friends and relatives are some types of evidence that may be accepted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridge.us/blog/faqs/evidence/|title=\"Legal List of acceptable Green Card evidence\"|publisher=|access-date=September 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911134646/http://www.bridge.us/blog/faqs/evidence/|archive-date=September 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> That is to ensure that the marriage was in good faith and not a fraudulent [[marriage of convenience]] with a sole intention of obtaining a green card. A follow-up interview with an immigration officer is sometimes required but may be waived if the submitted evidence is sufficient. Both the spouses must usually attend the interview.\n\nThe applicant receives an I-551 stamp in their foreign passport upon approval of their case. The applicant is then free from the conditional requirement once the application is approved. The applicant's new permanent resident card arrives ''via'' mail to their house several weeks to several months later and replaces the old two-year conditional residence card. The new card must be renewed after 10 years, but permanent resident status is now granted for an indefinite term if residence conditions are satisfied at all times. The USCIS may request to renew the card earlier because of security enhancements of the card or as a part of a revalidation campaign to exclude counterfeit green cards from circulation.\n\nIt is important to note that the two-year conditional residence period counts toward satisfying a residency requirement for U.S. [[naturalization]], and other purposes. Application for the removal of conditions must be adjudicated before a separate naturalization application could be reviewed by the USCIS on its own merits.\n\n===Differences between permanent residents and conditional permanent residents===\nConditional permanent residents have all of the equal \"rights, privileges, responsibilities and duties which apply to all other lawful permanent residents.\"<ref>{{uscfr|8|1216.1}} (\"Definition of conditional permanent resident\").{{PD-notice}}</ref> The only difference is the requirement to satisfy the conditions (such as showing marriage status or satisfying entrepreneur requirements) before the two-year period ends.\n\n==Abandonment or loss of permanent residence status==\nA green-card holder may abandon permanent residence by filing form I-407, with the green card, at a U.S. Embassy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://london.usembassy.gov/dhs/uscis/abandon.html |title=London US Embassy website |publisher=London.usembassy.gov |date=February 10, 2012 |accessdate=February 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215042816/http://london.usembassy.gov/dhs/uscis/abandon.html |archive-date=February 15, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nUnder certain conditions, permanent residence status can be lost involuntarily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article27.html |title=Maintaining US Lawful Permanent Resident Status |publisher=usvisalawyers.co.uk |date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507042231/http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article27.html |archive-date=May 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> This includes committing a criminal act that makes a person removable from the United States.

If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien's last known mailing address.\n#*'''Consular processing''' \u2013 This is the process if the immigrant is outside the United States, or is ineligible for AOS. It still requires the immigrant visa petition to be first completed and approved. The applicant may make an appointment at the U.S. embassy or consulate in his/her home country, where a consular officer adjudicates the case. If the case is approved, an immigrant visa is issued by the U.S. embassy or consulate. The visa entitles the holder to travel to the United States as an immigrant. At the port of entry, the immigrant visa holder immediately becomes a permanent resident, and is processed for a permanent resident card and receives an I-551 stamp in his/her passport. The permanent resident card is mailed to his/her U.S. address within 120 days.\nAn applicant (alien) in the United States can obtain two permits while the case is pending after a certain stage is passed in green card processing (filing of I-485). \n* The first is a temporary work permit known as the [[Employment Authorization Document]] (EAD), which allows the alien to take employment in the United States. \n* The second is a temporary travel document, [[advance parole]], which allows the alien to re-enter the United States. Both permits confer benefits that are independent of any existing status granted to the alien. For example, the alien might already have permission to work in the United States under an [[H-1B visa]].\n\n===Application process for family-sponsored visa for both parents and for children===\nU.S. citizens may sponsor for permanent residence in the United States the following relatives:\n#Spouses, and unmarried children under the age of 21;\n#Parents (once the U.S. citizen is at least 21 years old);\n#Unmarried children over the age of 21 (called \"sons and daughters\");\n#Married sons and daughters;\n#Brothers and sisters (once the U.S. citizen is at least 21 years old).\n\nU.S. permanent residents may sponsor for permanent residence in the United States the following relatives:\n#Spouses, and unmarried children under the age of 21;\n#Unmarried children over the age of 21 (called \"sons and daughters\");\n\nThe Department of State's \"Visa Bulletin,\" issued every month, gives the priority date for those petition beneficiaries currently entitled to apply for immigrant status through immigrant visas or adjustment of status.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html |title=Visa Bulletin |publisher=Travel.state.gov |accessdate=February 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314222858/http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html |archivedate=March 14, 2012 }}</ref> There is no annual quota for the spouses, unmarried children, and parents of U.S. citizens, so there is no waiting period for these applicants\u2014just the required processing time.

The foreign spouse of a green-card holder must wait for approval of an \"immigrant visa\" from the State Department before entering the United States. Due to numerical limitation on the number of these visas, the wait time for approval may be months or years. In the interim, the spouse cannot be legally present in the United States, unless he or she secures a visa by some other means. Green-card holders may opt to wait to become U.S. citizens, and only then sponsor their spouses and children, as the process is much faster for U.S. citizens. However, many green-card holders can choose to apply for the spouse or children and update their application after becoming a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe issue of U.S. green-card holders separated from their families for years is not a new problem. A mechanism to unite families of green-card holders was created by the LIFE Act by the introduction of a \"[[V visa]]\", signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]]. The law expired on December 31, 2000, and V visas are no longer available. From time to time, bills are introduced in Congress to reinstate V visas, but so far none have been successful.\n\n====Improving the application process in obtaining a green card====\nThe most common challenges that USCIS faces in providing services in the green card process are: (1) the length of the application and approval process, and (2) the quotas of green cards granted. USCIS tries to shorten the time qualified applicants wait to receive permanent residence.\n\n=====Challenges with processing time of application=====\nUnder the current system, immediate family members (spouse, child, and dependent mother and father), have priority status for green cards and generally wait 6 months to a year to have their green card application approved. For non-immediate family members, the process may take up to 10 years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Paperwork is processed on a first-come, first-served basis, so new applications may go untouched for several months. To address the issue of slow processing times, USCIS has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the I-130 and I-485 forms at the same time. This has reduced the processing time. Another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes. In these cases papers are sent back to the applicant, further delaying the process. Currently the largest issue creating long wait times is not processing time, but rather immigrant visa quotas set by Congress.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Millions stay in green-card limbo|journal=The Augusta Chronicle|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=====Quota system challenges=====\nLong wait times are a symptom of another issue\u2014quotas preventing immigrants from receiving immigrant visas. Georgia's ''Augusta Chronicle'' in 2006 stated that an estimated two million people are on waiting lists in anticipation to become legal and permanent residents of the United States. Immigrants need visas to get off of these waiting lists, and Congress would need to change immigration law in order to accommodate them with legal status.\n\nThe number of green cards that can be granted to family-based applicants depends on what preference category they fall under. An unlimited number of immediate relatives can receive green cards because there is no quota for that category. Family members who fall under the other various preference categories have fixed quotas, however the number of visas issued from each category may vary because unused visas from one category may rollover into another category.\n\n===Application process for employment-based visa===\nMany immigrants opt for this route, which typically requires an employer to \"sponsor\" (i.e., to petition before USCIS) the immigrant (known as the ''alien beneficiary'') through a presumed future job (in some special categories, the applicant may apply on his/her behalf without a sponsor). The three-step process outlined above is described here in more detail for employment-based immigration applications. After the process is complete, the alien is expected to take the certified job offered by the employer to substantiate his or her immigrant status, since the application ultimately rests on the alien's employment with that company in that particular position.\n#'''Immigrant petition''' \u2013 the first step includes the pre-requisite [[labor certification]] upon which the actual petition will reside.\n#*'''Labor certification''' \u2013 the employer must legally prove that it has a need to hire an alien for a specific position and that there is no minimally qualified U.S. citizen or LPR available to fill that position, hence the reason for hiring the alien. Some of the requirements to prove this situation include: proof of advertising for the specific position; skill requirements particular to the job; verification of the prevailing wage for a position; and the employer's ability to pay. This is currently done through an electronic system known as [[PERM, labor certification|PERM]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Permanent Labor Certification |publisher=Employment and Training Administration, US Department of Labor |url=http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/perm.cfm |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107152920/http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/perm.cfm |archive-date=January 7, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The date when the labor certification application is filed becomes the applicant's ''[[priority date]]''.

Many of the EB categories allow expedited processing of this stage, known as \"premium processing\".\n#'''Immigrant visa availability'''. When the immigrant petition is approved by the USCIS, the petition is forwarded to the NVC for visa allocation. Currently this step centers around the [[priority date]] concept.\n#*'''Priority date''' \u2013 the visa becomes available when the applicant's ''[[priority date]]'' is earlier than the ''cutoff date'' announced on the DOS's Visa Bulletin<ref>[https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/law-and-policy/bulletin.html Visa Bulletin], ''US Department of State'', retrieved on December 3, 2007</ref> or when the immigrant visa category the applicant is assigned to is announced as \"current\". A \"current\" designation indicates that visa numbers are available to all applicants in the corresponding immigrant category. Petitions with priority dates earlier than the cutoff date are expected to have visas available, therefore those applicants are eligible for final adjudication. When the NVC determines that a visa number could be available for a particular immigrant petition, a visa is tentatively allocated to the applicant. The NVC will send a letter stating that the applicant may be eligible for adjustment of status, and requiring the applicant to choose either to adjust status with the USCIS directly, or apply at the U.S. consulate abroad. This waiting process determines when the applicant can expect the immigration case to be adjudicated. Due to quotas imposed on EB visa categories, there are more approved immigrant petitions than visas available under INA. High demand for visas has created a backlog of approved but unadjudicated cases. In addition, due to processing inefficiencies throughout DOS and USCIS systems, not all visas available under the quota system in a given year were allocated to applicants by the DOS. Since there is no quota carry-over to the next fiscal year, for several years visa quotas have not been fully used, thus adding to the visa backlog.<ref>October 2006, [https://www.immigrationsupport.com/pdf/Newsletter fall 2006.pdf Business Immigration Review], Issue Fall 2006, ''Immigration Support Services'', retrieved December 3, 2007</ref>\n#'''Immigrant visa adjudication'''. When the NVC determines that an immigrant visa is available, the case can be adjudicated. If the alien is already in the US, that alien has a choice to finalize the green card process via adjustment of status in the US, or via consular processing abroad. If the alien is outside of the USA he/she can only apply for an immigrant visa at the U.S. consulate. The USCIS does not allow an alien to pursue consular processing and AOS simultaneously. Prior to filing the form I-485 (Adjustment of Status) it is required that the applicant have a ''medical examination'' performed by a USCIS-approved civil surgeon. The examination includes a blood test and specific immunizations, unless the applicant provides proof that the required immunizations were already done elsewhere. The civil surgeon hands the applicant a sealed envelope containing a completed form I-693, which must be included unopened with the I-485 application.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070630133347/http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=eb1f3591ec04d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status], form I-693 description, ''USCIS Website'', retrieved December 3, 2007</ref> (The cited reference also states that the February 25, 2010 edition of the Form I-693 reflects that an individual should no longer be tested for HIV infection.)\n#*'''Adjustment of status (AOS)''' \u2013 after the alien has a labor certification and has been provisionally allocated a visa number, the final step is to change his or her status to permanent residency. [[Adjustment of status]] is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, ''Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status''. If an immigrant visa number is available, the USCIS will allow ''\"concurrent filing\"'': it will accept forms I-140 and I-485 submitted in the same package or will accept form I-485 even before the approval of the I-140.\n#*'''Consular processing''' \u2013 this is an alternative to AOS, but still requires the immigrant visa petition to be completed. In the past (pre-2005), this process was somewhat faster than applying for AOS, so was sometimes used to circumvent long backlogs (of over two years in some cases). However, due to recent efficiency improvements by the USCIS, it is not clear whether applying via consular processing is faster than the regular AOS process. Consular processing is also thought to be riskier since there is no or very little recourse for appeal if the officer denies the application.\n\n===Green card lottery===\n{{main|Diversity Immigrant Visa}}\n\nEach year, around 50,000 immigrant visas are made available through the Diversity Visa (DV) program, also known as the [[Green Card Lottery]] to people who were born in countries with low rates of [[immigration to the United States]] (fewer than 50,000 immigrants in the past five years). Applicants can only qualify by [[country of chargeability]], not by citizenship. Anyone who is selected under this lottery will be given the opportunity to apply for permanent residence. They can also file for their spouse and any unmarried children under the age of 21.\n\nIf permanent residence is granted, the winner (and his/her family, if applicable) receives an immigrant visa in their passport(s) that has to be \"activated\" within six months of issuance at any port of entry to the United States. If already in the U.S. adjustment of status may be pursued. The new immigrant receives a stamp on the visa as proof of lawful admittance to the United States, and the individual is now authorized to live and work permanently in the United States. Finally, the actual \"green card\" typically arrives by mail within a few months.\n\n====Crime: green card lottery scam====\nThere is a growing number of fraudulent green card lottery [[Confidence trick|scams]], in which false agents take money from applicants by promising to submit application forms for them. Most agents are not working for the distribution service. Some claim that they can increase the chance of winning the lottery. This is not true; in fact, they may delay or not submit the application. Likewise, some claim to provide to winners free airline tickets or other benefits, such as submissions in future years or cash funds. There is no way to guarantee their claims, and there are numerous nefarious reasons for them not to fulfill their promises. Applicants are advised to use only official U.S. government websites, in which the [[URL]] ends in [[.gov]].\n\n====Green card lottery e-mail fraud====\nOther fraud perpetrators will e-mail potential victims posing as State Department or other government officials with requests to wire or transfer money online as part of a \"processing fee.\" These fraudulent e-mails are designed to steal money from unsuspecting victims. The senders often use phony e-mail addresses and logos designed to make them look more like official government correspondence. One easy way to tell that an email is a fraud is that it does not end with a \".gov\". One particularly common fraud email asks potential victims to wire money via [[Western Union]] to an individual (the name varies) at the following address in the United Kingdom: 24 Grosvenor Square, London. These emails come from a variety of email addresses designed to impersonate the U.S. State Department.

An exception to this rule is the case of a U.S. citizen legally sponsoring a spouse in which the marriage at the time of the adjustment of status (I-485) is more than two years old. In this case, the conditional status is waived and a 10-year \"permanent resident card\" is issued after the USCIS approves the case. A permanent resident under the conditional clause may receive an I-551 stamp as well as a permanent resident card. The expiration date of the conditional period is two years from the approval date. The immigrant visa category is CR (conditional resident).\n\nWhen this two-year conditional period is over, the permanent residence automatically expires and the applicant is subject to deportation and removal unless, up to 90 days before the conditional residence expires, the applicant must file form I-751 ''Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence''<ref>[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-751.pdf form I-751] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029120854/http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-751.pdf |date=October 29, 2007 }}, ''USCIS Website'', retrieved on December 3, 2007</ref> (if conditional permanent residence was obtained through marriage) or form I-829 ''Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions''<ref>[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-829.pdf form I-829] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029120855/http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-829.pdf |date=October 29, 2007 }}, ''USCIS Website'', retrieved December 3, 2007</ref> (if conditional permanent residence was obtained through investment) with USCIS to have the conditions removed. Once the application is received, permanent residence is extended in 1-year intervals until the request to remove conditions is approved or denied. For conditional permanent residence obtained through marriage, both spouses must sign the form I-751; if the spouses are divorced, it is possible to get a waiver of the other spouse's signing requirement, if it can be proved that the marriage was bona fide.\n\nThe USCIS requires that the application for the removal of conditions provide both general and specific supporting evidence that the basis on which the applicant obtained conditional permanent residence was not fraudulent. For an application based on marriage, birth certificates of children, joint financial statements, and letters from employers, friends and relatives are some types of evidence that may be accepted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridge.us/blog/faqs/evidence/|title=\"Legal List of acceptable Green Card evidence\"|publisher=|access-date=September 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911134646/http://www.bridge.us/blog/faqs/evidence/|archive-date=September 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> That is to ensure that the marriage was in good faith and not a fraudulent [[marriage of convenience]] with a sole intention of obtaining a green card. A follow-up interview with an immigration officer is sometimes required but may be waived if the submitted evidence is sufficient. Both the spouses must usually attend the interview.\n\nThe applicant receives an I-551 stamp in their foreign passport upon approval of their case. The applicant is then free from the conditional requirement once the application is approved. The applicant's new permanent resident card arrives ''via'' mail to their house several weeks to several months later and replaces the old two-year conditional residence card. The new card must be renewed after 10 years, but permanent resident status is now granted for an indefinite term if residence conditions are satisfied at all times. The USCIS may request to renew the card earlier because of security enhancements of the card or as a part of a revalidation campaign to exclude counterfeit green cards from circulation.\n\nIt is important to note that the two-year conditional residence period counts toward satisfying a residency requirement for U.S. [[naturalization]], and other purposes. Application for the removal of conditions must be adjudicated before a separate naturalization application could be reviewed by the USCIS on its own merits.\n\n===Differences between permanent residents and conditional permanent residents===\nConditional permanent residents have all of the equal \"rights, privileges, responsibilities and duties which apply to all other lawful permanent residents.\"<ref>{{uscfr|8|1216.1}} (\"Definition of conditional permanent resident\").{{PD-notice}}</ref> The only difference is the requirement to satisfy the conditions (such as showing marriage status or satisfying entrepreneur requirements) before the two-year period ends.\n\n==Abandonment or loss of permanent residence status==\nA green-card holder may abandon permanent residence by filing form I-407, with the green card, at a U.S. Embassy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://london.usembassy.gov/dhs/uscis/abandon.html |title=London US Embassy website |publisher=London.usembassy.gov |date=February 10, 2012 |accessdate=February 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215042816/http://london.usembassy.gov/dhs/uscis/abandon.html |archive-date=February 15, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nUnder certain conditions, permanent residence status can be lost involuntarily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article27.html |title=Maintaining US Lawful Permanent Resident Status |publisher=usvisalawyers.co.uk |date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507042231/http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article27.html |archive-date=May 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> This includes committing a criminal act that makes a person removable from the United States.

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].

He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.

Following [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|a lengthy trial]] at Southwark Crown Court, he was convicted on a single count of [[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]].

The programme, ''Tonight With Trevor McDonald \u2013 Major Fraud'', was broadcast on ITV on 21 April 2003 (a month after the trial began), and credited with over 17 million viewers. On 9 May 2003 (the day after ''Major Fraud'' aired in the US as a special episode of ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime]]''), the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled ''The Final Answer'', which was credited with over 5 million viewers.\n\n=== Trial ===\nFollowing [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|a trial]] at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]] lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), Ingram, his wife and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of \"[[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]\" on 7 April 2003. Both the Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences [[suspended sentence|suspended]] for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to eighteen months and Whittock was sentenced to twelve months), each fined \u00a315,000, and each ordered to pay \u00a310,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram \u00a340,000 and Diana Ingram \u00a325,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay \u00a3115,000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Charles Ingram transcript |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/charles-ingram-transcript-6967487.html |accessdate=13 January 2019 |work=Evening Standard |date=21 January 2004}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 August 2003, the [[Army Board]] ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major after 17 years of service, but stated that this would not affect his [[pension]] entitlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3092357.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Millionaire cheat sacked by Army|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2004, the [[Court of Appeal]] denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence, but agreed to quash his wife's fine and prosecution costs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/3728929.stm |title=TV quiz cheat loses his appeal |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=19 May 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref> On 5 October, the [[House of Lords]] denied Ingram leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken. During the trial, Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing throughout the episode, claiming he was too busy to notice.<ref name=\"scotsman\">{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-news/quizmaster-amazed-to-hear-163-1m-winner-could-have-cheated-1-598995 |title=Quizmaster 'amazed' to hear \u00a31m winner could have cheated |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=Karen |last=Mcveigh}}</ref>\n\n====Testimony of Larry Whitehurst====\nLarry Whitehurst, another contestant who had appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions.

Ingram had failed to tell [[Direct Line]] Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts).

The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken.
