He believed that the only purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] is to limit the powers of government and to protect the rights of citizens. For this reason, he voted against the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] when it was before the Senate. Before [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] went into effect, Wadsworth predicted that there would be widespread violations and contempt for the law.<ref name=\"1926Bio\">{{cite news|title=SENATOR WADSWORTH; JAMES W.

He was especially concerned that citizens could be prosecuted by both state and federal officials for a single violation of prohibition law. This seemed to him to constitute [[double jeopardy]], inconsistent with the spirit if not the letter of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. The Fifth Amendment in criminal cases prevents two trials for the same offense in the same level of court, not two trials for the same charge in separate state and national jurisdictions.\n\nIn 1926, he joined the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment and made 131 speeches across the country for the organization between then and repeal. His political acumen and contacts proved valuable in overturning prohibition.\n\nHe served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] from 1933 to 1951, and, like [[Alton Lennon]], [[Garrett Withers]], [[Claude Pepper]], [[Hugh Mitchell (politician)|Hugh Mitchell]], and [[Matthew M. Neely]], is one of the few modern Senators to serve later in the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives he opposed the [[isolationism]] of many of his conservative Republican colleagues, opposed anti-lynching legislation on [[state's rights]] grounds, rejected [[minimum wage]] laws and most of FDR's domestic policy. Although Wadsworth never ran for president, his name was mentioned as a possible candidate in 1936 and 1944.\n\nA confidential 1943 analysis of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]] by [[Isaiah Berlin]] for the British [[Foreign Office]] described Wadsworth as<ref name=\"hachey1973\">{{cite journal | url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf | title=American Profiles on Capitol Hill: A Confidential Study for the British Foreign Office in 1943 | author=Hachey, Thomas E. | journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |date=Winter 1973\u20131974 | volume=57 | issue=2 | pages=141\u2013153 | jstor=4634869 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021185357/http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf | archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|A newcomer to the committee; in the House since 1933.

Wadsworth was the [[United States Senate Minority Whip|Senate Minority Whip]] in 1915 because the Democrats held the majority of Senate seats. He was re-elected in 1920, but defeated by Democrat [[Robert F. Wagner]] in 1926. In 1921, Wadsworth was considered for the post of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] but was ultimately passed over in favor of [[John W. Weeks]].\n[[Image:Time Magazine - James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr.jpg|thumb|left|''Time'', December 28, 1925]]\nWadsworth was a proponent of individual rights and feared what he considered the threat of federal intervention into the private lives of Americans. He believed that the only purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] is to limit the powers of government and to protect the rights of citizens. For this reason, he voted against the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] when it was before the Senate. Before [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] went into effect, Wadsworth predicted that there would be widespread violations and contempt for the law.<ref name=\"1926Bio\">{{cite news|title=SENATOR WADSWORTH; JAMES W.

He was especially concerned that citizens could be prosecuted by both state and federal officials for a single violation of prohibition law. This seemed to him to constitute [[double jeopardy]], inconsistent with the spirit if not the letter of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. The Fifth Amendment in criminal cases prevents two trials for the same offense in the same level of court, not two trials for the same charge in separate state and national jurisdictions.\n\nIn 1926, he joined the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment and made 131 speeches across the country for the organization between then and repeal. His political acumen and contacts proved valuable in overturning prohibition.\n\nHe served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] from 1933 to 1951, and, like [[Alton Lennon]], [[Garrett Withers]], [[Claude Pepper]], [[Hugh Mitchell (politician)|Hugh Mitchell]], and [[Matthew M. Neely]], is one of the few modern Senators to serve later in the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives he opposed the [[isolationism]] of many of his conservative Republican colleagues, opposed anti-lynching legislation on [[state's rights]] grounds, rejected [[minimum wage]] laws and most of FDR's domestic policy. Although Wadsworth never ran for president, his name was mentioned as a possible candidate in 1936 and 1944.\n\nA confidential 1943 analysis of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]] by [[Isaiah Berlin]] for the British [[Foreign Office]] described Wadsworth as<ref name=\"hachey1973\">{{cite journal | url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf | title=American Profiles on Capitol Hill: A Confidential Study for the British Foreign Office in 1943 | author=Hachey, Thomas E. | journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |date=Winter 1973\u20131974 | volume=57 | issue=2 | pages=141\u2013153 | jstor=4634869 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021185357/http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf | archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|A newcomer to the committee; in the House since 1933.
