It covers a wide range of subject matter, but tends to broadcast more \"[[highbrow]]\" programmes than the more mainstream and popular [[BBC One]]. Like the BBC's other domestic TV and radio channels, it is funded by the [[television licence]], and is therefore free of commercial advertising. It is a comparatively well-funded [[Public broadcasting|public-service]] network, regularly attaining a much higher audience share than most public-service networks worldwide.\n\nOriginally styled '''BBC2''', it was the third British television station to be launched (starting on 21 April 1964), and from 1 July 1967, Europe's first television channel to broadcast regularly in colour. It was envisaged as a home for less mainstream and more ambitious programming, and while this tendency has continued to date, most special-interest programmes of a kind previously broadcast on BBC Two, for example the [[The Proms|BBC Proms]], now tend to appear on [[BBC Four]] instead.\n\n==History==\n\n===Launch===\nBritish television at the time of BBC2's launch consisted of two channels: the [[BBC One|BBC Television Service]] and the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network made up of smaller regional companies. Both channels had existed in a state of competition since ITV's launch in 1955, and both had aimed for a populist approach in response. The 1962 [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Report]] on the future of broadcasting noticed this, and that ITV lacked any culturally relevant programming. It therefore decided that Britain's third television station should be awarded to the BBC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |title=British Television up to the end of the Sixties |publisher=Sixtiescity.com |accessdate=12 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024020910/http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |archivedate=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nPrior to its launch, the new BBC2 was promoted on the BBC Television Service: the soon to be renamed [[BBC One|BBC1]]. The animated adverts featured the campaign mascots \"Hullabaloo\", a mother [[kangaroo]], and \"Custard\", her [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]]. Prior to, and several years after, the channel's formal launch, the channel broadcast \"[[Trade test colour films|Trade Test Transmissions]]\", short films made externally by companies such as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[BP]], which served to enable engineers to test reception, but became [[cult following|cult]] viewing.\n\nThe channel was scheduled to begin at 19:20 on 20 April 1964, showing an evening of light entertainment, starting with the comedy show ''[[The Alberts]]'', a performance from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] comedian [[Arkady Raikin]], and a production of [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', culminating with a fireworks display. However, at around 18:45 a huge power failure, originating from a fire at [[Battersea Power Station]], caused [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]], and indeed much of west London, to lose all power. BBC1 was able to continue broadcasting via its facilities at [[Alexandra Palace]], but all attempts to show the scheduled programmes on the new channel failed. [[Associated-Rediffusion]], the London weekday ITV franchise-holder, offered to transmit on the BBC's behalf, but their gesture was rejected. At 22:00 programming was officially postponed until the following morning. As the BBC's news centre at [[Alexandra Palace]] was unaffected, they did in fact broadcast brief bulletins on BBC2 that evening, beginning with an announcement by the newsreader [[Gerald Priestland]] at around 19:25.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starfury.demon.co.uk/bbc2launch/ |title=BBC 2 Aborted Launch Night |publisher=starfury.demon.co.uk |accessdate=12 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913032519/http://www.starfury.demon.co.uk/bbc2launch/ |archivedate=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> There was believed to be no recording made of this bulletin, but a videotape was discovered in early 2003.<ref name=\"BBC2 Launch BBC news\">{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Caroline|title=The launch night that never was|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3585041.stm|accessdate=4 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 April 2004}}</ref>\n\nBy 11:00 on 21 April, power had been restored to the [[BBC Television Centre|studios]] and programming began, thus making ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]'' the first programme to be shown officially on the channel. The launch schedule, postponed from the night before, was then successfully shown that evening, albeit with minor changes. In reference to the power cut, the transmission opened with a shot of a lit candle which was then sarcastically blown out by presenter [[Denis Tuohy]].<ref name=\"BBC2 Launch BBC news\"/>\n\n[[File:BBC Two (2001).svg|thumbnail|left|BBC Two logo used from 19 November 2001 to 18 February 2007]]\nTo establish the new channel's identity and draw viewers to it, the BBC decided that a widely promoted, lavish series would be essential in its earliest days. The production chosen was ''[[The Forsyte Saga (1967 series)|The Forsyte Saga]]'' (1967), a no-expense-spared adaptation of the novels by [[John Galsworthy]], featuring well-established actors [[Kenneth More]] and [[Eric Porter]]. Critically for the future of the fledgling channel, the BBC's gamble was hugely successful, with an average of six million viewers tuning in per episode: a feat made more prominent by the fact that only 9 million were able to receive the channel at the time. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Technological advancements===\nUnlike [[BBC One|BBC1]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], BBC2 was broadcast only on the [[576i|625 line]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] system, so was not available to viewers still using sets on the [[405-line television system|405-line]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] system. This created a market for dual standard receivers which could switch between the two systems. Set manufacturers increased production of UHF sets in anticipation of a large market demand for the new BBC2, but the market did not materialise. The early technical problems, which included being unable to transmit US-recorded videotapes due to a lack of [[Television standards conversion|system conversion]] from the US [[NTSC]] system, were resolved by a committee headed by [[James Redmond (broadcaster)|James Redmond]].\n\nOn 1 July 1967, during the [[1967 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], BBC2 became the first channel in Europe to begin regular broadcasts in colour, using the [[PAL]] system.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/technology/technology8.html TV Technology 8.

BBC1 and ITV simultaneously introduced PAL colour on UHF on 15 November 1969, although they both had broadcast some programmes in colour \"unofficially\" since September 1969.\n\nIn 1979, the station adopted the first computer-generated channel identification (ident) in Britain, with its use of the [[BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident|double striped, orange '2' logo]]. The ident, created in house by BBC engineers, lasted until March 1986 and heralded the start of computer-generated logos.\n\nAs the [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Digital switchover|switch to digital-only terrestrial transmission]] progressed, BBC Two was (in each region in turn) the first [[Analogue terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|analogue TV channel]] to be replaced with the BBC multiplex, at first four, then two weeks ahead of the other four channels. This was required for those relay transmitters that had no current [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service giving viewers time to purchase the equipment unless they had already selected a satellite or cable service. The last region for BBC Two to end on analogue terrestrial television was [[Northern Ireland]] on 10 October 2012.\n\nAt the 2012 [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]], BBC Two was named \"Terrestrial Channel of the Year\".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19376264  \"BBC Two wins terrestrial channel of the year\".

Over its first thirty or so years the channel developed a reputation for screening highly praised and prestigious drama series, among these ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]'' (1982) or 1996's, critically acclaimed ''[[Our Friends in the North]]''. The channel's \"highbrow\" profile is also in part attributable to a long history of demanding documentaries of all types, beginning with ''[[Civilisation: A Personal View|Civilisation]]'' and ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' in the 1960s. Like the early [[Channel 4]], BBC Two also established for itself a reputation as a champion of independent and international cinema, under the ''Screen 2'' brand.\n\nThe channel has sometimes been judged, increasingly in more recent years, to have moved away from this original role and closer to the mainstream. Since the launch of the digital-only [[BBC Four]], the BBC has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel, which, until the end of the UK's digital TV switchover in October 2012,<ref>[http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82057/24-10-12_DSO_completion.pdf ''End of analogue era as switchover completes'', Digital UK, London, 10 October 2012].

BBC Four's remit is very similar to that of the earlier remit of BBC2 and contains many documentaries and arts programmes. It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/09/bbc_funding_debate_why_bbc2_bb.html|title=Blogposts|work=the Guardian}}</ref> Since 2004 there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of BBC Two's earlier output with the arts strand ''[[The Culture Show]]''. Its most popular programme at the moment is ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.\n\nMuch of BBC Two's output has previously or subsequently been shown on other channels. Some of these programmes are repeats of popular or flagship programmes from BBC Four in a late-night strand, originally called ''BBC Four on Two'' but now unbranded, for the benefit of audiences without access to BBC Four. Other programmes are moved to the channel as a result of their success on [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] or Four, so that subsequent series are well received. An example of this is the BBC Three series ''[[Torchwood]]'' that was transferred to the channel following the success of the first series. BBC Two is also used as a testing ground for programmes prior to their moving to the flagship [[BBC One]]: such examples include ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and popular comedies ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]]'', which moved to BBC One after success on Two. Also in August 2014 ''[[The Great British Bake Off]]'' moved to BBC One due to its success the previous year on BBC Two. In 2017, Bake Off moved from BBC One to [[Channel 4]].\n\nAnother founding part of BBC Two was to provide educational and community programming on the BBC, as part of its public service remit. The educational section of this commitment saw BBC2 broadcast a large amount of programming for the [[Open University]], who co-produced programming with the corporation, and saw the channel broadcast [[BBC Schools]] programmes from 1983 until the programmes were transferred to the [[BBC Learning Zone]] in 2010.\n\nAs a result of the channel's commitment to community broadcasting, the channel produced the symbolic ''[[Open Space (BBC TV)|Open Space]]'' series, a strand developed in the early 1970s in which members of the public would be allotted half an hour of television time, and given a level of editorial and technical training in order to produce for themselves a film on an issue most important to them. BBC2's [[Community Programme Unit]] kept this aspect of the channel's tradition alive into the 1990s in the form of ''Video Diaries'' and later ''[[Video Nation]]''. The Community Programmes Unit was disbanded in 2004.\n\nSince January 2013, BBC Two stopped showing children's programmes and replaced the weekday morning schedule with repeats of the previous BBC One daytime schedule. They also started showing ''Sign Zone'' in the early hours, which BBC One used to show before 2013.\n\nFrom October 2013, BBC Two has shown classic programmes like ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]'', ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'', and ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' on weekday afternoons, with the retro logos from 1970s and 1980s, between the current programmes.\n\nIn October 2014, ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' and ''[[Backchat (2013 TV series)|Backchat]]'' moved to BBC Two from BBC Three.\n\nIn 2014, BBC Two commissioned Britain's first transgender sitcom, ''[[Boy Meets Girl (BBC TV series)|Boy Meets Girl]]'', which follows the developing relationship between Leo, a 26-year-old man, and Judy, a 40-year-old transgender woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbc2-commissions-britains-first-transgender-sitcom-boy-meets-girl-9683788.html|title=BBC2 commissions Britain's first transgender sitcom Boy Meets Girl|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nFrom 7 April 2015, the morning ''Sign Zone'' was shown before ''[[Victoria Derbyshire]]'' between 8:00am-9:00&nbsp;am including ''See Hear'' on Wednesday morning.\n\nBBC Two is also known for broadcasting some [[news]] and [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programmes. Every morning at 9 am (Monday to Friday) it broadcasts [[BBC News at Nine]], with the latest news stories with breaking news as it happens. It returns at 11am as [[BBC Newsroom Live]]. At 10 am [[Victoria Derbyshire]] hosts her [[Victoria Derbyshire (TV programme)|current affairs programme of the same name]]. At 12:15pm political debate happens with [[Politics Live]]. And at 10:30pm, late-night current affairs with [[Newsnight]].\n\nFrom 2017 until 2019, it broadcast the UK selection show for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest |''Eurovision: You Decide.'']] The channel stopped broadcasting the show after the 2019 edition due to the fact that the BBC opted for an internal selection in collaboration with [[BMG Rights Management]].\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that ''Victoria Derbyshire'' would come to an end as part of the BBC's \u00a380m cuts. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51214425|title=Derbyshire tells viewers 'we don't give up'|date=2020-01-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-16|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n{{Main|History of BBC television idents|l1=History of BBC television idents}}\n[[File:BBC Two Paint ident.jpg|thumb|The sans-serif 2 served as the channel's design icon between 1991 and 2018, and was used in several different forms. \"Paint\", pictured above, was the first such variant to air, and aired between 1991 and 2001 and again between 2014 and 2018.]]\nAs well as programmes, BBC Two has also proved memorable for its numerous [[Station identification|idents]]\u2014various short sequences shown between programme junctions that serve as the channel identity. Nearly all of the identity packages used since the channel's launch in 1964 have featured a prominent numeral ''2'' in the design. Notable designs include the electronic [[BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident|double-striped ''2'']], the [[BBC Two 'Two' ident|white ''TWO'']] ident (the only ident not to use a numeral ''2''), and most notably the [[BBC Two '1991\u20132001' idents|1991 ''2''s]].\n\nThe 1991 idents featured a [[sans-serif]] numeral ''2'' at the centre of an initially art-related scene; however, the idents moved away from this style as the station's style changed. Although highly praised, this expansive set of idents was ended in November 2001. The [[Logo of the BBC|BBC corporate logo]] was updated within the idents in October 1997, though the idents moved away from the original [[viridian]] colour scheme in these latter years. The [[BBC Two 'Personality' idents|subsequent presentation style]] was introduced on 19 November 2001 and kept the same figure ''2'', but in a yellow background and given a personality. At the time, BBC Two became the first BBC channel to feature a box logo.\n\nIn 2007, BBC Two debuted the new theme, a \"Window on the World\", with the ''2'' numeral providing that view. Introduced on 18 February 2007, the new look also had the channel adopt a teal-coloured box logo, featuring the BBC logo above the word ''TWO'', in the font [[Avenir (typeface)|Avenir]].\n\nIn 2014, in honour of the channel's 50th anniversary, some of the 1990s idents were re-introduced and from 2015, BBC Two [[Northern Ireland]] opted to use nearly forty idents from the 1991\u20132001 set.\n\nOn 27 September 2018, the 1991\u20132001 idents were retired once again and BBC Two introduced a new set of idents, based on scenes incorporating a curve motif resembling the number 2. The new branding is designed to reflect BBC Two's \"constant evolution, constant eclecticism, [and] constant sense of quality\". The new idents are produced by various artists and studios, including [[Aardman Animations]], [[The Mill (company)|The Mill]] and others. The new identity was co-developed by BBC Creative and Superunion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Waterson |first=Jim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/25/bbc-two-first-full-rebrand-25-years |title=BBC Two to get first full rebrand since early 90s |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 September 2018 |accessdate=26 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/26/bbc-two-issues-re-invigorating-rebrand-vivid-and-colourful-reflect-content-diversity|title=BBC Two issues 're-invigorating' rebrand, vivid and colourful to reflect content diversity|work=The Drum|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dawood |first1=Sarah |title=BBC Two rebrands for first time in 20 years |url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/24-30-september-2018/bbc-two-rebrands-for-first-time-in-20-years/ |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=Design Week |publisher=Centaur Communications |date=26 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Regional variations===\nBBC Two also has regional variations in [[BBC Two Wales|Wales]] and [[BBC Two Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. These versions of BBC Two share the same idents, but with the nation name in the BBC Two box. BBC Two Scotland showed a lot of specifically Scottish programming on the channel, as well as its sister channel [[BBC One Scotland]], and the schedules were often mixed around to match. BBC Two Northern Ireland and BBC Two Wales both have the option to opt-out of the main network schedule but generally stick to it, only opting out a couple of times each week. Until December 2008, [[BBC Wales]] broadcast a special, digital-only channel, [[BBC 2W]], which contained more opt-outs than analogue-only BBC Two Wales. [[BBC Two Scotland]] existed until February 2019 when it was replaced with the national BBC Two feed in preparation for the launch of the [[BBC Scotland (TV channel)|BBC Scotland channel]].\n\nIn England, many of the [[BBC English regions]] were combined to form \"super-regions\", such as the entire North or Midlands. These had the option to opt-out of the network programming on the analogue feed, and replace it with local programming. However this was usually only done in exceptional circumstances, as all regular regional programming has been transferred to BBC One, and the English regions are not available on digital on BBC Two. There is no specific \"BBC Two England\"; this role is fulfilled by the network version of BBC Two.\n\n==Availability outside the UK==\nBBC Two is widely available in the [[Republic of Ireland]] on satellite and [[Cable television in the Republic of Ireland|cable]], as well as being received directly in areas bordering [[Northern Ireland]], or in coastal areas from [[Wales]]. It is also available on cable and [[IPTV]] in the [[Netherlands]], Belgium, [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. On 27 March 2013, it began being carried by [[BFBS|British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS)]] to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the [[BFBS#BFBS Television|BFBS2]] TV channel, which already carried a selection of BBC Two programmes.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-forces-broadcasting-contract-begins UK Forces broadcasting contract begins], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], 2 April 2013</ref> It shares a channel with [[CBBC]], which broadcasts from early morning until the early evening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfbs.com/radio/article/bfbs-tv-set-for-a-makeover-on-27th-march|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603111429/http://www.bfbs.com/radio/article/bfbs-tv-set-for-a-makeover-on-27th-march|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 June 2013|title=BFBS Radio Set For A Makeover On 27th March - BFBS|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Accessibility==\nThe BBC announced in May 2008 that it had achieved its aim for all programming to have [[subtitles]] for viewers with hearing difficulties.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/05_may/07/subtitling.shtml BBC Vision celebrates 100% subtitling] BBC Press Office, 7 May 2008.</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/subtitles.shtml About the BBC \u2013 Policy on subtitles] BBC</ref> These are available on the [[BBC Red Button]], and until 23 October 2012, via the [[Ceefax]] teletext service.\n\nThe BBC also offers [[audio description]] on some popular programmes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvhelp.org.uk/audes/schedule.php|title=Freeview Audio Description TV Schedule|work=TV Help}}</ref> for visually impaired-viewers as well as [[sign language]] interpretation on some of its programmes for [[deaf]] and hard-of-hearing viewers.

It covers a wide range of subject matter, but tends to broadcast more \"[[highbrow]]\" programmes than the more mainstream and popular [[BBC One]]. Like the BBC's other domestic TV and radio channels, it is funded by the [[television licence]], and is therefore free of commercial advertising. It is a comparatively well-funded [[Public broadcasting|public-service]] network, regularly attaining a much higher audience share than most public-service networks worldwide.\n\nOriginally styled '''BBC2''', it was the third British television station to be launched (starting on 21 April 1964), and from 1 July 1967, Europe's first television channel to broadcast regularly in colour. It was envisaged as a home for less mainstream and more ambitious programming, and while this tendency has continued to date, most special-interest programmes of a kind previously broadcast on BBC Two, for example the [[The Proms|BBC Proms]], now tend to appear on [[BBC Four]] instead.\n\n==History==\n\n===Launch===\nBritish television at the time of BBC2's launch consisted of two channels: the [[BBC One|BBC Television Service]] and the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network made up of smaller regional companies. Both channels had existed in a state of competition since ITV's launch in 1955, and both had aimed for a populist approach in response. The 1962 [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Report]] on the future of broadcasting noticed this, and that ITV lacked any culturally relevant programming. It therefore decided that Britain's third television station should be awarded to the BBC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |title=British Television up to the end of the Sixties |publisher=Sixtiescity.com |accessdate=12 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024020910/http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |archivedate=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nPrior to its launch, the new BBC2 was promoted on the BBC Television Service: the soon to be renamed [[BBC One|BBC1]]. The animated adverts featured the campaign mascots \"Hullabaloo\", a mother [[kangaroo]], and \"Custard\", her [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]]. Prior to, and several years after, the channel's formal launch, the channel broadcast \"[[Trade test colour films|Trade Test Transmissions]]\", short films made externally by companies such as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[BP]], which served to enable engineers to test reception, but became [[cult following|cult]] viewing.\n\nThe channel was scheduled to begin at 19:20 on 20 April 1964, showing an evening of light entertainment, starting with the comedy show ''[[The Alberts]]'', a performance from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] comedian [[Arkady Raikin]], and a production of [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', culminating with a fireworks display. However, at around 18:45 a huge power failure, originating from a fire at [[Battersea Power Station]], caused [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]], and indeed much of west London, to lose all power. BBC1 was able to continue broadcasting via its facilities at [[Alexandra Palace]], but all attempts to show the scheduled programmes on the new channel failed. [[Associated-Rediffusion]], the London weekday ITV franchise-holder, offered to transmit on the BBC's behalf, but their gesture was rejected. At 22:00 programming was officially postponed until the following morning. As the BBC's news centre at [[Alexandra Palace]] was unaffected, they did in fact broadcast brief bulletins on BBC2 that evening, beginning with an announcement by the newsreader [[Gerald Priestland]] at around 19:25.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starfury.demon.co.uk/bbc2launch/ |title=BBC 2 Aborted Launch Night |publisher=starfury.demon.co.uk |accessdate=12 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913032519/http://www.starfury.demon.co.uk/bbc2launch/ |archivedate=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> There was believed to be no recording made of this bulletin, but a videotape was discovered in early 2003.<ref name=\"BBC2 Launch BBC news\">{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Caroline|title=The launch night that never was|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3585041.stm|accessdate=4 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 April 2004}}</ref>\n\nBy 11:00 on 21 April, power had been restored to the [[BBC Television Centre|studios]] and programming began, thus making ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]'' the first programme to be shown officially on the channel. The launch schedule, postponed from the night before, was then successfully shown that evening, albeit with minor changes. In reference to the power cut, the transmission opened with a shot of a lit candle which was then sarcastically blown out by presenter [[Denis Tuohy]].<ref name=\"BBC2 Launch BBC news\"/>\n\n[[File:BBC Two (2001).svg|thumbnail|left|BBC Two logo used from 19 November 2001 to 18 February 2007]]\nTo establish the new channel's identity and draw viewers to it, the BBC decided that a widely promoted, lavish series would be essential in its earliest days. The production chosen was ''[[The Forsyte Saga (1967 series)|The Forsyte Saga]]'' (1967), a no-expense-spared adaptation of the novels by [[John Galsworthy]], featuring well-established actors [[Kenneth More]] and [[Eric Porter]]. Critically for the future of the fledgling channel, the BBC's gamble was hugely successful, with an average of six million viewers tuning in per episode: a feat made more prominent by the fact that only 9 million were able to receive the channel at the time. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Technological advancements===\nUnlike [[BBC One|BBC1]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], BBC2 was broadcast only on the [[576i|625 line]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] system, so was not available to viewers still using sets on the [[405-line television system|405-line]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] system. This created a market for dual standard receivers which could switch between the two systems. Set manufacturers increased production of UHF sets in anticipation of a large market demand for the new BBC2, but the market did not materialise. The early technical problems, which included being unable to transmit US-recorded videotapes due to a lack of [[Television standards conversion|system conversion]] from the US [[NTSC]] system, were resolved by a committee headed by [[James Redmond (broadcaster)|James Redmond]].\n\nOn 1 July 1967, during the [[1967 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], BBC2 became the first channel in Europe to begin regular broadcasts in colour, using the [[PAL]] system.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/technology/technology8.html TV Technology 8. Britain In Colour \u2013 and UHF.] Screenonline, Richard G. Elen.

BBC1 and ITV simultaneously introduced PAL colour on UHF on 15 November 1969, although they both had broadcast some programmes in colour \"unofficially\" since September 1969.\n\nIn 1979, the station adopted the first computer-generated channel identification (ident) in Britain, with its use of the [[BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident|double striped, orange '2' logo]]. The ident, created in house by BBC engineers, lasted until March 1986 and heralded the start of computer-generated logos.\n\nAs the [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Digital switchover|switch to digital-only terrestrial transmission]] progressed, BBC Two was (in each region in turn) the first [[Analogue terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|analogue TV channel]] to be replaced with the BBC multiplex, at first four, then two weeks ahead of the other four channels. This was required for those relay transmitters that had no current [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service giving viewers time to purchase the equipment unless they had already selected a satellite or cable service. The last region for BBC Two to end on analogue terrestrial television was [[Northern Ireland]] on 10 October 2012.\n\nAt the 2012 [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]], BBC Two was named \"Terrestrial Channel of the Year\".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19376264  \"BBC Two wins terrestrial channel of the year\".

Over its first thirty or so years the channel developed a reputation for screening highly praised and prestigious drama series, among these ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]'' (1982) or 1996's, critically acclaimed ''[[Our Friends in the North]]''. The channel's \"highbrow\" profile is also in part attributable to a long history of demanding documentaries of all types, beginning with ''[[Civilisation: A Personal View|Civilisation]]'' and ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' in the 1960s. Like the early [[Channel 4]], BBC Two also established for itself a reputation as a champion of independent and international cinema, under the ''Screen 2'' brand.\n\nThe channel has sometimes been judged, increasingly in more recent years, to have moved away from this original role and closer to the mainstream. Since the launch of the digital-only [[BBC Four]], the BBC has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel, which, until the end of the UK's digital TV switchover in October 2012,<ref>[http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82057/24-10-12_DSO_completion.pdf ''End of analogue era as switchover completes'', Digital UK, London, 10 October 2012].

BBC Four's remit is very similar to that of the earlier remit of BBC2 and contains many documentaries and arts programmes. It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/09/bbc_funding_debate_why_bbc2_bb.html|title=Blogposts|work=the Guardian}}</ref> Since 2004 there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of BBC Two's earlier output with the arts strand ''[[The Culture Show]]''. Its most popular programme at the moment is ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.\n\nMuch of BBC Two's output has previously or subsequently been shown on other channels. Some of these programmes are repeats of popular or flagship programmes from BBC Four in a late-night strand, originally called ''BBC Four on Two'' but now unbranded, for the benefit of audiences without access to BBC Four. Other programmes are moved to the channel as a result of their success on [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] or Four, so that subsequent series are well received. An example of this is the BBC Three series ''[[Torchwood]]'' that was transferred to the channel following the success of the first series. BBC Two is also used as a testing ground for programmes prior to their moving to the flagship [[BBC One]]: such examples include ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and popular comedies ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]]'', which moved to BBC One after success on Two. Also in August 2014 ''[[The Great British Bake Off]]'' moved to BBC One due to its success the previous year on BBC Two. In 2017, Bake Off moved from BBC One to [[Channel 4]].\n\nAnother founding part of BBC Two was to provide educational and community programming on the BBC, as part of its public service remit. The educational section of this commitment saw BBC2 broadcast a large amount of programming for the [[Open University]], who co-produced programming with the corporation, and saw the channel broadcast [[BBC Schools]] programmes from 1983 until the programmes were transferred to the [[BBC Learning Zone]] in 2010.\n\nAs a result of the channel's commitment to community broadcasting, the channel produced the symbolic ''[[Open Space (BBC TV)|Open Space]]'' series, a strand developed in the early 1970s in which members of the public would be allotted half an hour of television time, and given a level of editorial and technical training in order to produce for themselves a film on an issue most important to them. BBC2's [[Community Programme Unit]] kept this aspect of the channel's tradition alive into the 1990s in the form of ''Video Diaries'' and later ''[[Video Nation]]''. The Community Programmes Unit was disbanded in 2004.\n\nSince January 2013, BBC Two stopped showing children's programmes and replaced the weekday morning schedule with repeats of the previous BBC One daytime schedule. They also started showing ''Sign Zone'' in the early hours, which BBC One used to show before 2013.\n\nFrom October 2013, BBC Two has shown classic programmes like ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]'', ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'', and ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' on weekday afternoons, with the retro logos from 1970s and 1980s, between the current programmes.\n\nIn October 2014, ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' and ''[[Backchat (2013 TV series)|Backchat]]'' moved to BBC Two from BBC Three.\n\nIn 2014, BBC Two commissioned Britain's first transgender sitcom, ''[[Boy Meets Girl (BBC TV series)|Boy Meets Girl]]'', which follows the developing relationship between Leo, a 26-year-old man, and Judy, a 40-year-old transgender woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbc2-commissions-britains-first-transgender-sitcom-boy-meets-girl-9683788.html|title=BBC2 commissions Britain's first transgender sitcom Boy Meets Girl|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nFrom 7 April 2015, the morning ''Sign Zone'' was shown before ''[[Victoria Derbyshire]]'' between 8:00am-9:00&nbsp;am including ''See Hear'' on Wednesday morning.\n\nBBC Two is also known for broadcasting some [[news]] and [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programmes. Every morning at 9 am (Monday to Friday) it broadcasts [[BBC News at Nine]], with the latest news stories with breaking news as it happens. It returns at 11am as [[BBC Newsroom Live]]. At 10 am [[Victoria Derbyshire]] hosts her [[Victoria Derbyshire (TV programme)|current affairs programme of the same name]]. At 12:15pm political debate happens with [[Politics Live]]. And at 10:30pm, late-night current affairs with [[Newsnight]].\n\nFrom 2017 until 2019, it broadcast the UK selection show for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest |''Eurovision: You Decide.'']] The channel stopped broadcasting the show after the 2019 edition due to the fact that the BBC opted for an internal selection in collaboration with [[BMG Rights Management]].\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that ''Victoria Derbyshire'' would come to an end as part of the BBC's \u00a380m cuts. <ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51214425</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n{{Main|History of BBC television idents|l1=History of BBC television idents}}\n[[File:BBC Two Paint ident.jpg|thumb|The sans-serif 2 served as the channel's design icon between 1991 and 2018, and was used in several different forms. \"Paint\", pictured above, was the first such variant to air, and aired between 1991 and 2001 and again between 2014 and 2018.]]\nAs well as programmes, BBC Two has also proved memorable for its numerous [[Station identification|idents]]\u2014various short sequences shown between programme junctions that serve as the channel identity.

Notable designs include the electronic [[BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident|double-striped ''2'']], the [[BBC Two 'Two' ident|white ''TWO'']] ident (the only ident not to use a numeral ''2''), and most notably the [[BBC Two '1991\u20132001' idents|1991 ''2''s]].\n\nThe 1991 idents featured a [[sans-serif]] numeral ''2'' at the centre of an initially art-related scene; however, the idents moved away from this style as the station's style changed. Although highly praised, this expansive set of idents was ended in November 2001. The [[Logo of the BBC|BBC corporate logo]] was updated within the idents in October 1997, though the idents moved away from the original [[viridian]] colour scheme in these latter years. The [[BBC Two 'Personality' idents|subsequent presentation style]] was introduced on 19 November 2001 and kept the same figure ''2'', but in a yellow background and given a personality. At the time, BBC Two became the first BBC channel to feature a box logo.\n\nIn 2007, BBC Two debuted the new theme, a \"Window on the World\", with the ''2'' numeral providing that view. Introduced on 18 February 2007, the new look also had the channel adopt a teal-coloured box logo, featuring the BBC logo above the word ''TWO'', in the font [[Avenir (typeface)|Avenir]].\n\nIn 2014, in honour of the channel's 50th anniversary, some of the 1990s idents were re-introduced and from 2015, BBC Two [[Northern Ireland]] opted to use nearly forty idents from the 1991\u20132001 set.\n\nOn 27 September 2018, the 1991\u20132001 idents were retired once again and BBC Two introduced a new set of idents, based on scenes incorporating a curve motif resembling the number 2. The new branding is designed to reflect BBC Two's \"constant evolution, constant eclecticism, [and] constant sense of quality\". The new idents are produced by various artists and studios, including [[Aardman Animations]], [[The Mill (company)|The Mill]] and others. The new identity was co-developed by BBC Creative and Superunion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Waterson |first=Jim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/25/bbc-two-first-full-rebrand-25-years |title=BBC Two to get first full rebrand since early 90s |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 September 2018 |accessdate=26 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/26/bbc-two-issues-re-invigorating-rebrand-vivid-and-colourful-reflect-content-diversity|title=BBC Two issues 're-invigorating' rebrand, vivid and colourful to reflect content diversity|work=The Drum|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dawood |first1=Sarah |title=BBC Two rebrands for first time in 20 years |url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/24-30-september-2018/bbc-two-rebrands-for-first-time-in-20-years/ |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=Design Week |publisher=Centaur Communications |date=26 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Regional variations===\nBBC Two also has regional variations in [[BBC Two Wales|Wales]] and [[BBC Two Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. These versions of BBC Two share the same idents, but with the nation name in the BBC Two box. BBC Two Scotland showed a lot of specifically Scottish programming on the channel, as well as its sister channel [[BBC One Scotland]], and the schedules were often mixed around to match. BBC Two Northern Ireland and BBC Two Wales both have the option to opt-out of the main network schedule but generally stick to it, only opting out a couple of times each week. Until December 2008, [[BBC Wales]] broadcast a special, digital-only channel, [[BBC 2W]], which contained more opt-outs than analogue-only BBC Two Wales. [[BBC Two Scotland]] existed until February 2019 when it was replaced with the national BBC Two feed in preparation for the launch of the [[BBC Scotland (TV channel)|BBC Scotland channel]].\n\nIn England, many of the [[BBC English regions]] were combined to form \"super-regions\", such as the entire North or Midlands. These had the option to opt-out of the network programming on the analogue feed, and replace it with local programming. However this was usually only done in exceptional circumstances, as all regular regional programming has been transferred to BBC One, and the English regions are not available on digital on BBC Two. There is no specific \"BBC Two England\"; this role is fulfilled by the network version of BBC Two.\n\n==Availability outside the UK==\nBBC Two is widely available in the [[Republic of Ireland]] on satellite and [[Cable television in the Republic of Ireland|cable]], as well as being received directly in areas bordering [[Northern Ireland]], or in coastal areas from [[Wales]]. It is also available on cable and [[IPTV]] in the [[Netherlands]], Belgium, [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. On 27 March 2013, it began being carried by [[BFBS|British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS)]] to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the [[BFBS#BFBS Television|BFBS2]] TV channel, which already carried a selection of BBC Two programmes.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-forces-broadcasting-contract-begins UK Forces broadcasting contract begins], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], 2 April 2013</ref> It shares a channel with [[CBBC]], which broadcasts from early morning until the early evening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfbs.com/radio/article/bfbs-tv-set-for-a-makeover-on-27th-march|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603111429/http://www.bfbs.com/radio/article/bfbs-tv-set-for-a-makeover-on-27th-march|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 June 2013|title=BFBS Radio Set For A Makeover On 27th March - BFBS|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Accessibility==\nThe BBC announced in May 2008 that it had achieved its aim for all programming to have [[subtitles]] for viewers with hearing difficulties.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/05_may/07/subtitling.shtml BBC Vision celebrates 100% subtitling] BBC Press Office, 7 May 2008.</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/subtitles.shtml About the BBC \u2013 Policy on subtitles] BBC</ref> These are available on the [[BBC Red Button]], and until 23 October 2012, via the [[Ceefax]] teletext service.\n\nThe BBC also offers [[audio description]] on some popular programmes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvhelp.org.uk/audes/schedule.php|title=Freeview Audio Description TV Schedule|work=TV Help}}</ref> for visually impaired-viewers as well as [[sign language]] interpretation on some of its programmes for [[deaf]] and hard-of-hearing viewers.

Due to the impending launch of the new BBC Scotland channel in February 2019, replacing the opt-outs on [[BBC Two Scotland]], no Scottish HD variant was required.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|BBC|Television }}\n*[[History of BBC television idents]]\n*[[List of television stations in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikipedia books|BBC Channels (UK)}}\n*{{Bbc.co.uk|id=bbctwo|title=BBC Two}}\n*{{Bbc.co.uk|id=cult/classic/bbc2|title=BBC Two \u2013 Happy 40th Birthday}}\n{{BBC Television}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n{{Freeview}}\n\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:BBC Two}}\n[[Category:BBC Two| ]]\n[[Category:BBC nations and regions|BBC Nations]]\n[[Category:BBC television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1964]]\n[[Category:Peabody Award winners]]\n[[Category:1964 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:International Emmy Awards Current Affairs & News winners]]\n", "name_user": "Piecesofuk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProgramming:updated bare url", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two"}
