[[Christianity in the 4th century|Early in the fourth century]], a form of the religion was legalized by the [[Edict of Milan]], and it eventually became the [[State church of the Roman Empire]].\n\n[[Christian missionaries]] and [[converts to Christianity]] have both been targets of persecution, sometimes to the point of being [[Martyrdom|martyred for their faith]], ever since the emergence of [[Christianity]].\n\nThe [[schism]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] and the later [[Protestant Reformation]], sometimes provoked [[European wars of religion|severe conflicts]] between [[Christian denominations]] and during these conflicts, members of these different denominations [[Persecution of Christians by Christians|frequently]] and [[Sectarian violence among Christians|violently persecuted each other]].\n\nIn the 20th century, Christians were persecuted, sometimes to the point of [[genocide]], by various governments, including the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which committed the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]], [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]] and [[Greek Genocide|Greek Genocides]], and the governments of [[state atheism|atheistic states]] such as the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist Albania]]  and [[North Korea]].\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{see also|Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire}}\n\n===In the New Testament===\n{{main|Persecution of Christians in the New Testament}}\n[[Early Christianity]] began as a sect among [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jews]], and according to the New Testament account, [[Pharisees]], including [[Paul of Tarsus]] prior to his conversion to Christianity, persecuted early Christians. The early Christians preached the second coming of a Messiah which [[Jewish view of Jesus|did not conform]] to their [[Jewish Messianism|religious teachings]].{{sfn|Wand|1990|p=12}} However, feeling that their beliefs were supported by Jewish scripture, Christians had been hopeful that their countrymen would accept their faith. Despite individual conversions, the vast majority of Judean Jews did not become Christians.{{sfn|Wand|1990|p=13}}\n\nClaudia Setzer asserts that, \"Jews did not see Christians as clearly separate from their own community until at least the middle of the second century.\"  Thus, acts of Jewish persecution of Christians fall within the boundaries of synagogue discipline and were so perceived by Jews acting and thinking as the established community.

Decius authorized [[roving commission]]s visiting the cities and villages to supervise the execution of the sacrifices and to deliver written certificates to all citizens who performed them. Christians were often given opportunities to avoid further punishment by publicly offering sacrifices or by burning incense to Roman gods, and were accused by the Romans of impiety when they refused. Refusal was punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and executions. Christians fled to safe havens in the countryside and some purchased their certificates, called ''libelli.'' Several councils held at [[Carthage]] debated the extent to which the community should accept these lapsed Christians. \nThe Christian church, despite no indication in the surviving texts that the edict targeted any specific group, never forgot the reign of Decius whom they labelled as that \"fierce tyrant\".<ref name = Scarre170>Scarre 1995, p.170</ref>\n\nSome early Christians sought out and welcomed martyrdom.

The 2nd-century text ''[[Martyrdom of Polycarp]]'' relates the story of Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who did not desire death, but died a [[martyr]], bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire miraculously failed to touch him. The ''Martyrdom of Polycarp'' advances an argument for a particular understanding of martyrdom, with Polycarp's death as its prized example. The example of the Phrygian Quintus, who actively sought out martyrdom, is repudiated.\n\nAccording to two different Christian traditions, [[Simon bar Kokhba]], the leader of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|second Jewish revolt against Rome]] (132\u2013136 AD) who was proclaimed Messiah, persecuted the Christians: Justin Martyr claims that Christians were punished if they did not deny and blaspheme Jesus Christ, while Eusebius asserts that Bar Kokhba harassed them because they refused to join his revolt against the Romans.<ref>Justin, I ''Apology'' 31, 6; Eusebius, ''Chronicle'', seventeenth year of the Emperor Hadrian.

The [[Great Persecution]] is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were commanded to sacrifice to the [[Roman gods]] or face immediate execution.  According to legend, one of the [[martyrs]] during the Diocletian persecution was [[Saint George]], a Roman soldier who loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and tribunes claimed to be a Christian by declaring his worship of [[Jesus Christ]]. Though [[Diocletian]] zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire, his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts so Christians in [[Gaul]], [[Spain]], and [[Britannia]] were virtually unmolested.\n\nThis persecution lasted until [[Constantine I]] came to power in 313 and legalized Christianity. It was not until [[Theodosius I]] in the later 4th century that Christianity would become the official religion of the Empire. Between these two events [[Julian the Apostate|Julian II]] temporarily restored the traditional Roman religion and established broad religious tolerance renewing Pagan and Christian hostilities.\n\nMartyrs were considered uniquely exemplary of the Christian faith, and few early saints were not also martyrs.\n\nThe ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' states that \"Ancient, medieval and early modern hagiographers were inclined to exaggerate the number of martyrs. Since the title of martyr is the highest title to which a Christian can aspire, this tendency is natural\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howells |first1=Kristina |title=Making Sense of Bible Prophecy |date=2008 |publisher=Lulu |isbn=978-1409207832 |page=91}}</ref>  Attempts at estimating the numbers involved are inevitably based on inadequate sources, but one historian of the persecutions estimates the overall numbers as between 5,500 and 6,500.,<ref name=\"Frend\">{{cite book |title=The Rise of Christianity |author=W.

The punishment of apostates increased under [[Yazdegerd I]] and continued under successive kings. It was normative for apostates who were brought to the notice of authorities to be executed, although the prosecution of apostasy depended on political circumstances and Zoroastrian jurisprudence. Per Richard E. Payne, the executions were meant to create a mutually recognised boundary between interactions of the people of the two religions and preventing one religion challenging another's viability. Although the violence on Christians was selective and especially carried out on elites, it served to keep Christian communities in a subordinate and yet viable position in relation to Zoroastrianism. Christians were allowed to build religious buildings and serve in the government as long as they didn't expand their institutions and population at the expense of Zoroastrianism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rtjsCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA55#v=onepage&f=false|title=A State of Mixture: Christians, Zoroastrians, and Iranian Political Culture in Late Antiquity|publisher=University of California Press|author=Richard E.

Many churches in Malabar and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. Many centuries-old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L. Bernard, ''Kerala History '', pp. 79</ref>\n\nTipu's persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the [[battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Martyrs of Japan}}\n[[File:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|The Christian martyrs of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. 17th-century Japanese painting.]]\n[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] assumed control over Japan in 1600.

Too often, growing European influence in the region during the nineteenth century seemed to disproportionately benefit Christians, thus producing resentment on the part of many Muslims, likewise a suspicion that Christians were colluding with the European powers in order to weaken the Islamic world. Further exacerbating relations was the fact that Christians seemed to benefit disproportionately from efforts at reform (one aspect of which generally sought to elevate the political status of non-Muslims), likewise, the various Christian nationalist uprisings in the Empire's European territories, which often had the support of the European powers.<ref>Erik Freas, Muslim-Christian Relations in Late-Ottoman Palestine: Where Nationalism and Religion Intersect (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), {{ISBN|1137570415}}</ref>\n\nSince the time of the [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Turkish war (1683\u20131699)]] relations between Muslims and Christians in the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire gradually took more extreme forms{{vague|date=January 2018}} and resulted in occasional calls by some Muslim religious leaders for the expulsion or extermination of local Christians.

A very large segment of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested.\nThe widespread persecution and internecine disputes within the church hierarchy lead to the seat of [[Patriarch of Moscow]] being vacant from 1925 to 1943.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church in order to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957, about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985, fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.<ref name=Ostling/>\n\nIn the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closure and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated by the state and converted to public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. With the exception of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy, it could not instruct the faithful or evangelise the youth.

The ''Martyrdom of Polycarp'' advances an argument for a particular understanding of martyrdom, with Polycarp's death as its prized example.

The [[Great Persecution]] is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were commanded to sacrifice to the [[Roman gods]] or face immediate execution.  According to legend, one of the [[martyrs]] during the Diocletian persecution was [[Saint George]], a Roman soldier who loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and tribunes claimed to be a Christian by declaring his worship of [[Jesus Christ]]. Though [[Diocletian]] zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire, his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts so Christians in [[Gaul]], [[Spain]], and [[Britannia]] were virtually unmolested.\n\nThis persecution lasted until [[Constantine I]] came to power in 313 and legalized Christianity. It was not until [[Theodosius I]] in the later 4th century that Christianity would become the official religion of the Empire. Between these two events [[Julian the Apostate|Julian II]] temporarily restored the traditional Roman religion and established broad religious tolerance renewing Pagan and Christian hostilities.\n\nMartyrs were considered uniquely exemplary of the Christian faith, and few early saints were not also martyrs.\n\nThe ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' states that \"Ancient, medieval and early modern hagiographers were inclined to exaggerate the number of martyrs.

The punishment of apostates increased under [[Yazdegerd I]] and continued under successive kings. It was normative for apostates who were brought to the notice of authorities to be executed, although the prosecution of apostasy depended on political circumstances and Zoroastrian jurisprudence. Per Richard E. Payne, the executions were meant to create a mutually recognised boundary between interactions of the people of the two religions and preventing one religion challenging another's viability.

Under [[sharia]], non-Muslims were obligated to pay [[jizya]] and [[al-kharaj]] taxes, together with periodic heavy [[ransom]] levied upon Christian communities by Muslim rulers in order to fund military campaigns, all of which contributed a significant proportion of income to the Islamic states while conversely reducing many Christians to poverty, and these financial and social hardships forced many Christians to convert to Islam.

In the aftermath of these revolts, the Porte now applied pressure in order to Islamize the Albanian Orthodox population, adding economic incentives in order to stimulate this process.

Many churches in Malabar and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. Many centuries-old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L. Bernard, ''Kerala History '', pp. 79</ref>\n\nTipu's persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the [[battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Martyrs of Japan}}\n[[File:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|The Christian martyrs of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. 17th-century Japanese painting.]]\n[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] assumed control over Japan in 1600.

Further exacerbating relations was the fact that Christians seemed to benefit disproportionately from efforts at reform (one aspect of which generally sought to elevate the political status of non-Muslims), likewise, the various Christian nationalist uprisings in the Empire's European territories, which often had the support of the European powers.<ref>Erik Freas, Muslim-Christian Relations in Late-Ottoman Palestine: Where Nationalism and Religion Intersect (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), {{ISBN|1137570415}}</ref>\n\nSince the time of the [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Turkish war (1683\u20131699)]] relations between Muslims and Christians in the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire gradually took more extreme forms{{vague|date=January 2018}} and resulted in occasional calls by some Muslim religious leaders for the expulsion or extermination of local Christians.

A very large segment of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested.\nThe widespread persecution and internecine disputes within the church hierarchy lead to the seat of [[Patriarch of Moscow]] being vacant from 1925 to 1943.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church in order to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957, about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985, fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.<ref name=Ostling/>\n\nIn the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closure and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated by the state and converted to public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. With the exception of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy, it could not instruct the faithful or evangelise the youth.

The aligners are manufactured in a facility in Mumbai, India. Sabka Dentist uses PETG sheets. The software used for making aligners is from 3Shape. Sabka Dentist is one of largest chains of dental clinics in India. They have treated more than 100,000 patients and is a very reliable system.\n\n== Manufacturing process for Making Clear Aligners ==\nClear Aligners are manufactured by using a 3D CAD software which converts a digital file from a dental impression or an intra-oral scan. There are many 3D CAD software products for designing models for clear aligners.  The 3D Model is then used to design a series of steps for moving the teeth to the required position. Each step is a separate model which is 3D printed using a 3D printer. The models are then used to make aligners by vacuum forming. Vacuum forming is a process in which a sheet of PETG or PU is formed into the aligner shape.

Align had previously filed a complaint with the [[U.S. International Trade Commission]] against OrthoClear Inc. In the end an agreement was made between Align and OrthoClear in which Align paid OrthoClear $20 million for its intellectual property and OrthoClear agreed to stop accepting cases in the United States.<ref name=\"six\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Align Technology began to require that doctors prescribing Invisalign complete at least ten cases per year and ten hours of training in order to maintain their Invisalign provider status. In January 2010, 20,000 doctors had their certification suspended for not meeting the requirements, but a class action lawsuit regarding providers that paid for training under the original rules resulted in some certifications being re-instated.<ref>{{citation |last=Rasmussen |first=March |date=March 2011 |title=Invisalign Agrees to Settlement in Class Action Lawsuit |publisher=American Dental Association |url=http://editiondigital.net/article/Invisalign_Agrees_To_Settlement_In_Class_Action_Lawsuit/675122/64825/article.html |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, ClearCorrect filed a [[declaratory judgment]] against Align Technology.
