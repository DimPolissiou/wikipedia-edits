Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

He had been best known for his ''[[Essays in Musical Analysis]]''<ref>{{cite book |last=Tovey |first=Donald |date=1935 |title=Essays in Musical Analysis, Vols. I-VI |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tovey |first=Donald |date=1989 |title=Essays in Musical Analysis; Vol. 1, Symphonies and other Orchestral Works; Vol. 2, Concertos and Choral Works |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn=0-19-315149-9 |author-link=}}</ref> and his editions of works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], but since the 1990s his compositions (relatively small in number but substantial in musical content) have been recorded and performed with increasing frequency. The recordings have mostly been well received by reviewers.\n\n==Life==\n\nHe was born at [[Eton, Berkshire]], the son of Duncan Crookes Tovey, an assistant master at [[Eton College]], and his wife, Mary Fison. As a child Tovey was privately educated exclusively by [[Sophie Weisse]]. She was impressed by his musical gifts evident at an early age and took it upon herself to nurture him. Through her network of associates he was introduced to composers, performers and music critics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Donald Francis Tovey : a biography based on letters|last=Grierson|first=Mary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1952|isbn=|location=London|pages=|oclc=2129936}}</ref> These included [[Walter Parratt]], [[James Higgs]] and (from the age of 14) [[Hubert Parry]] for composition.<ref>Savage, Roger. ''Tovey, Sir Donald Francis (1875-1940)'' in ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 2004</ref>\n\nAlso in Sophie Weisse's network was the friend of [[Brahms]] and eminent violinist [[Joseph Joachim]], who first met Tovey when he was seven or eight years old. Tovey played piano with the [[Joachim Quartet]] in a 1905 performance of the Brahms F minor [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|Piano Quintet]], Op. 34. By then he was already composing, and had gained some moderate fame, with works performed in [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] as well as in London. His large scale Piano Concerto (with Tovey as soloist) made its debut at Queen's Hall in November 1903 under the baton of [[Sir Henry Wood]], and Tovey played it again in 1906 under [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. During this period he also contributed heavily to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], writing many of the articles on music of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn 1914 he began to teach music at the [[University of Edinburgh]], succeeding [[Frederick Niecks]] as [[Reid Professor of Music]]; there he founded the [[Reid Orchestra]]. For their concerts he wrote a series of programme notes, many of which were eventually collected into the books for which he is now best known, the ''[[Essays in Musical Analysis]]''. In 1917 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Ralph Allan Sampson]], [[Cargill Gilston Knott]], [[John Horne]] and Sir [[Edmund Taylor Whittaker]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref>\n \nAs he devoted more and more time to the Reid Orchestra, to writing essays and commentaries and producing performing editions of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], Tovey composed and performed less often later in life; but the few major pieces he did complete are on a large scale, such as his [[Symphony]] of 1913 and the [[Cello Concerto (Tovey)|Cello Concerto]] completed in 1935 for his longtime friend [[Pablo Casals]]. Performing also became problematic. In illustrated radio talks recorded in his last few years, his playing is severely affected by a problem with one of his hands.\n\nTovey made several editions of other composers' music, including a 1931 completion of Bach's ''[[Die Kunst der Fuge]]'' (The Art of Fugue). His edition of the 48 Preludes and Fugues of Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', in two volumes (Vol. 1, March 1924; Vol. 2, June 1924), with fingerings by [[Harold Samuel]], for the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]], has been reprinted continually ever since. His completion of the (presumed) final unfinished fugue in ''The Art of Fugue'' has nothing of pastiche about it, and in fact has often been recorded as the final piece of the set. His influential ''Essays in Musical Analysis'' based on his Reid Orchestra programme notes, were first published at this time, in six volumes between 1935 and 1939. They were edited by [[Hubert J. Foss|Hubert Foss]] of the [[Oxford University Press]].<ref name=foss>[https://boydellandbrewer.com/i-music-in-their-time-i-the-memoirs-and-letters-of-dora-and-hubert-foss-hb.html Lloyd, Stephen (ed.) ''Music in Their Time: The Memoirs and Letters of Dora and Hubert Foss'' (2019)]</ref> \n \nHe was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by King [[George V]] in 1935, reportedly on the recommendation of [[Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar]], who greatly admired Tovey's edition of Bach. He died in 1940 in [[Edinburgh]].  His archive, including scores, letters, handwritten programme notes and annotations in the scores of others, is housed in the Special Collections Unit of the University of Edinburgh library. In 2009 [[Richard Witts]] created a simple catalogue of the archival material available from the University on-line.\n\n==Family==\n\nTovey married his first wife, Margaret \"Grettie\" Cameron, the daughter of [[Hugh Cameron (artist)|Hugh Cameron]] R.S.A., on 22 April 1916. They did not have any biological children, but in May 1919 they decided to adopt an infant son, whom they named John Wellcome Tovey. Following a tumultuous relationship, in part strained by Cameron's mental health issues, the couple divorced in July 1922. She died a few years later.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Donald Francis Tovey : a portrait of a great man|last=Firth|first=George|publisher=Borgue Books|year=2006|isbn=|location=Kirkcudbright|pages=}}</ref> On the divorce from his first wife, Tovey's son John was placed under the guardianship of Weisse and Clara Georgina Wallace, who had also been a pupil of Weisse and known to Tovey since boyhood.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nClara Wallace and Tovey married on 29 December 1925.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donaldtovey.com/?page_id=96|title=Donald Francis Tovey \u00bb Biography|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref> She became Lady Tovey upon his knighthood in 1935. They appear to have had a supportive marriage, often travelling together for Tovey's domestic and international engagements. They remained together until his death in 1940. Lady Tovey died in September 1944 at Hedenham Lodge, Norfolk.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Donald Tovey}}\nFrom the start, the Teutonic heavy seriousness and traditional craftsmanship of Tovey's first concert works in the early 1900s felt somewhat old-fashioned amidst the early stages of the [[English Musical Renaissance]], but they did find more favour on the continent. His official opus 1, the four movement Piano Trio in B minor was already composed on a large scale. It was completed in 1895 during Tovey\u2019s first term at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] and dedicated \"to Sir Hubert Parry as the first work of a grateful pupil\".<ref name=chamb>[https://d2vhizysjb6bpn.cloudfront.net/TOCC0068-cd-notes.pdf Shore, Peter. Notes to ''Donald Francis Tovey: Chamber Music Volume 1'', Toccata TOCC0068 (2008)]</ref> There were other chamber works during this period, most of them including a piano part for Tovey to play himself: from 1900 he energetically promoted them through a series of regular chamber music performances. Early successes, receiving positive press notices, included the Piano Quintet in C, op. 6, first performed at [[St James's Hall]] in London on 8 November 1900, and the Piano Quartet in E minor, op. 12, played at the same hall on 21 November 1901.

In his essays, Tovey developed a theory of tonal structure and its relation to classical forms that he applied in his descriptions of pieces in his famous programme notes for the Reid Orchestra, as well as in more technical and extended writings. His aesthetic regards works of music as organic wholes, and he stresses the importance of understanding how musical principles manifest themselves in different ways within the context of a given piece. He was fond of using figurative comparisons to illustrate his ideas, as in this quotation from the ''Essays'' (on [[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel|Brahms' Handel Variations]], Op. 24, Tovey 1922):\n<blockquote>\nThe relation between Beethoven's freest variations and his theme is of the same order of microscopical accuracy and profundity as the relation of a bat's wing to a human hand.\n</blockquote>\nSimilarly in his book on ''Beethoven'', dictated in 1936 but published posthumously in 1944:<ref>D.F. Tovey, ''Beethoven'', with an editorial preface by [[Hubert J. Foss]] (Oxford University Press, London 1944), p. 29.</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWe do not expect a return to the home tonic to be associated with a theme we have never heard before, any more than we expect on returning from our holiday to find our house completely redecorated and refurnished and inhabited by total strangers.\n</blockquote>\n\n== Recordings ==\n* Recordings of Tovey performing on piano were made for the [[National Gramophonic Society]] ([https://rec.music.classical.recordings.narkive.com/Jye9ZfsZ/national-gramophonic-society-discography NGS-114-117]) on 6 and 11 June, and 4 September 1928, playing Tovey's conjectural completion of [[Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'', [[Bach]]'s Sonata No. 2 in A Major BWV1015 (1st mvt), and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Violin Sonata No. 10 (Beethoven)|10th Violin Sonata in G major]], Op. 96) (complete) with violinist [[Adila Fachiri]]. The latter is the celebrated recording in which, on the first side after the first movement exposition, Tovey calls out, \"Return to the beginning of the record; second time...\" and then resumes playing, so that the listener can take the repeat or omit it, at her/his discretion.  The Columbia recording of ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'' with the [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Fugue-Roth-Quartet/dp/B000CFX604 Roth String Quartet] (1934\u20131935) has Tovey's conjectural completion of the work, played by Tovey on the piano, on the last 78 side.\n* ''The Bride of Dionysus'' \u2013 Prelude and vocal extracts from the full opera [https://www.duttonvocalion.co.uk/proddetail.php?prod=CDLX7241 DUTTON EPOCH CDLX 7241]; also: Prelude.

The recordings have mostly been well received by reviewers.\n\n==Life==\n\nHe was born at [[Eton, Berkshire]], the son of Duncan Crookes Tovey, an assistant master at [[Eton College]], and his wife, Mary Fison. As a child Tovey was privately educated exclusively by [[Sophie Weisse]]. She was impressed by his musical gifts evident at an early age and took it upon herself to nurture him. Through her network of associates he was introduced to composers, performers and music critics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Donald Francis Tovey : a biography based on letters|last=Grierson|first=Mary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1952|isbn=|location=London|pages=|oclc=2129936}}</ref> These included [[Walter Parratt]], [[James Higgs]] and (from the age of 14) [[Hubert Parry]] for composition.<ref>Savage, Roger. ''Tovey, Sir Donald Francis (1875-1940)'' in ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 2004</ref>\n\nAlso in Sophie Weisse's network was the friend of [[Brahms]] and eminent violinist [[Joseph Joachim]], who first met Tovey when he was seven or eight years old. Tovey played piano with the [[Joachim Quartet]] in a 1905 performance of the Brahms F minor [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|Piano Quintet]], Op. 34. By then he was already composing, and had gained some moderate fame, with works performed in [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] as well as in London. His large scale Piano Concerto (with Tovey as soloist) made its debut at Queen's Hall in November 1903 under the baton of [[Sir Henry Wood]], and Tovey played it again in 1906 under [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. During this period he also contributed heavily to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], writing many of the articles on music of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn 1914 he began to teach music at the [[University of Edinburgh]], succeeding [[Frederick Niecks]] as [[Reid Professor of Music]]; there he founded the [[Reid Orchestra]]. For their concerts he wrote a series of programme notes, many of which were eventually collected into the books for which he is now best known, the ''[[Essays in Musical Analysis]]''. In 1917 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Ralph Allan Sampson]], [[Cargill Gilston Knott]], [[John Horne]] and Sir [[Edmund Taylor Whittaker]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref>\n \nAs he devoted more and more time to the Reid Orchestra, to writing essays and commentaries and producing performing editions of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], Tovey composed and performed less often later in life; but the few major pieces he did complete are on a large scale, such as his [[Symphony]] of 1913 and the [[Cello Concerto (Tovey)|Cello Concerto]] completed in 1935 for his longtime friend [[Pablo Casals]]. Performing also became problematic. In illustrated radio talks recorded in his last few years, his playing is severely affected by a problem with one of his hands.\n\nTovey made several editions of other composers' music, including a 1931 completion of Bach's ''[[Die Kunst der Fuge]]'' (The Art of Fugue). His edition of the 48 Preludes and Fugues of Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', in two volumes (Vol. 1, March 1924; Vol. 2, June 1924), with fingerings by [[Harold Samuel]], for the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]], has been reprinted continually ever since. His completion of the (presumed) final unfinished fugue in ''The Art of Fugue'' has nothing of pastiche about it, and in fact has often been recorded as the final piece of the set. His influential ''Essays in Musical Analysis'' based on his Reid Orchestra programme notes, were first published at this time, in six volumes between 1935 and 1939. They were edited by [[Hubert J. Foss|Hubert Foss]] of the [[Oxford University Press]].<ref name=foss>[https://boydellandbrewer.com/i-music-in-their-time-i-the-memoirs-and-letters-of-dora-and-hubert-foss-hb.html Lloyd, Stephen (ed.)

He died in 1940 in [[Edinburgh]].  His archive, including scores, letters, handwritten programme notes and annotations in the scores of others, is housed in the Special Collections Unit of the University of Edinburgh library. In 2009 [[Richard Witts]] created a simple catalogue of the archival material available from the University on-line.\n\n==Family==\n\nTovey married his first wife, Margaret \"Grettie\" Cameron, the daughter of [[Hugh Cameron (artist)|Hugh Cameron]] R.S.A., on 22 April 1916. They did not have any biological children, but in May 1919 they decided to adopt an infant son, whom they named John Wellcome Tovey. Following a tumultuous relationship, in part strained by Cameron's mental health issues, the couple divorced in July 1922. She died a few years later.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Donald Francis Tovey : a portrait of a great man|last=Firth|first=George|publisher=Borgue Books|year=2006|isbn=|location=Kirkcudbright|pages=}}</ref> On the divorce from his first wife, Tovey's son John was placed under the guardianship of Weisse and Clara Georgina Wallace, who had also been a pupil of Weisse and known to Tovey since boyhood.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nClara Wallace and Tovey married on 29 December 1925.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donaldtovey.com/?page_id=96|title=Donald Francis Tovey \u00bb Biography|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref> She became Lady Tovey upon his knighthood in 1935.

His official opus 1, the four movement Piano Trio in B minor was already composed on a large scale. It was completed in 1895 during Tovey\u2019s first term at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] and dedicated \"to Sir Hubert Parry as the first work of a grateful pupil\".<ref name=chamb>[https://d2vhizysjb6bpn.cloudfront.net/TOCC0068-cd-notes.pdf Shore, Peter.

He was fond of using figurative comparisons to illustrate his ideas, as in this quotation from the ''Essays'' (on [[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel|Brahms' Handel Variations]], Op. 24, Tovey 1922):\n<blockquote>\nThe relation between Beethoven's freest variations and his theme is of the same order of microscopical accuracy and profundity as the relation of a bat's wing to a human hand.\n</blockquote>\nSimilarly in his book on ''Beethoven'', dictated in 1936 but published posthumously in 1944:<ref>D.F. Tovey, ''Beethoven'', with an editorial preface by [[Hubert J. Foss]] (Oxford University Press, London 1944), p. 29.</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWe do not expect a return to the home tonic to be associated with a theme we have never heard before, any more than we expect on returning from our holiday to find our house completely redecorated and refurnished and inhabited by total strangers.\n</blockquote>\n\n== Recordings ==\n* Recordings of Tovey performing on piano were made for the [[National Gramophonic Society]] ([https://rec.music.classical.recordings.narkive.com/Jye9ZfsZ/national-gramophonic-society-discography NGS-114-117]) on 6 and 11 June, and 4 September 1928, playing Tovey's conjectural completion of [[Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'', [[Bach]]'s Sonata No. 2 in A Major BWV1015 (1st mvt), and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Violin Sonata No. 10 (Beethoven)|10th Violin Sonata in G major]], Op. 96) (complete) with violinist [[Adila Fachiri]]. The latter is the celebrated recording in which, on the first side after the first movement exposition, Tovey calls out, \"Return to the beginning of the record; second time...\" and then resumes playing, so that the listener can take the repeat or omit it, at her/his discretion.

In 2019, more than 26 million passengers arrived or departed at Brussels Airport, making it the 24th [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|busiest airport in Europe]]. It is located in the municipality of [[Zaventem]] in the [[Flemish Brabant|Province of Flemish Brabant]] in the [[Flemish Region]] of [[Belgium]]. It is home to around 260 companies, together directly employing 20,000 people and serves as the home base for [[Brussels Airlines]] and [[TUI fly Belgium]].\n\nThe company operating the airport is known as The Brussels Airport Company N.V./S.A.; before 19 October 2006, the name was BIAC (Brussels International Airport Company), which was created by Belgian law through a merger of BATC with the ground operations departments of the RLW/RVA. Since 2011, the airport has been owned by the [[Toronto]]-based [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] (39%), [[Macquarie Group]] (Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund I and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund III) (36%) and the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian State]] (25%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-PBaa1-rating-to-Brussels-Airport-Holding-SANVs-senior--PR_273301|title=Moody's assigns (P)Baa1 rating to Brussels Airport Holding SA/NV's senior secured debt; stable outlook|work=Moodys.com|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 March 2016 the airport's departures hall was severely damaged by [[2016 Brussels bombings|two terrorist bomb blasts]].

There the [[Luftwaffe]] established '''Fliegerhorst Melsbroek''' and constructed 3 [[runway]]s in the shape of a triangle: runway 02/20, runway 07L/25R (both of which are still in use today) and runway 12/30. The airport buildings were constructed in the nearby municipality of Melsbroek and not of Zaventem, which is why the airfield was known to the locals as Melsbroek (in Dutch) (or \"Fliegerhorst Melsbroek\" in German). There is an [[urban legend]] that the site of the airport was chosen by the Germans after asking locals where to build it\u2013the Belgians then pointed to this location as it was often foggy.\n\nAfter the liberation on 3 September 1944, the German infrastructure at Melsbroek fell into the hands of the British. When the [[Evere Airport|old civilian airport]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] became too small, the Belgian authorities decided to use the aerodrome at Melsbroek for the new national airport. By 1948, a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] building was constructed to replace the old wooden building. In the same year, the lengths of both runways 02/20 and 07L/25R were increased, to {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2450|m|abbr=on}} respectively, whereas 12/30 remained at {{convert|1300|m|abbr=on}}. The civil aerodrome of Melsbroek was officially opened by [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders]], the [[Prince Regent]], on 20 July 1948. From 1948 to 1956 many more buildings and facilities were erected, mostly on the Melsbroek side of the site.\n\nIn 1955, a railway line from Brussels city centre to the airport was constructed. The line was officially opened by [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] on 15 May 1955.\n\nIn 1956 a new {{convert|2300|m|abbr=on}} runway was constructed, 07R/25L, which almost runs parallel with 07L/25R. The runway is still in use today and saw its length later increased to {{convert|3200|m|abbr=on}}. In April 1956 the [[Belgian federal government|Belgian government]] decided to build a new airport, using the same runways, but with the buildings located within the municipality of Zaventem. In April 1957, construction started of the new terminal, preparing the airport for the [[Expo 58|1958 World Fair]]. The grass runway 12/30 had to make way to allow for the new passenger terminal. This new airport was inaugurated 5 July 1958, almost just in time for the 1958 World Fair. The buildings on the Melsbroek side are still in use by the [[Belgian Air Component|Belgian Air Force]] ([[15th Air Transport Wing]]), and this is still known as Melsbroek airfield. Both [[Zaventem Airport]] and [[Melsbroek Air Base]], the military airfield, share the same runways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|title=Brussels Explosion rocks Europe!|author=Robert Tom|work=Innovative Report|access-date=22 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165822/http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Development since the 1960s===\n[[File:Boeing_707-329C,_Sabena_JP6848038.jpg|thumb|[[Sabena]] [[Boeing 707-300]] at Brussels Airport in 1966]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, Air Zaire AN0199454.jpg|thumb|[[Air Za\u00efre]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] at Brussels Airport at night in 1990]]\nDuring the boom of commercial aviation in the 1960s and 1970s, several hangars were constructed. A new [[Container terminal|cargo terminal]] was constructed in 1976. In 1994, a brand new terminal was constructed adjacent to the old 1958 building. Two old piers were torn down and replaced by modern ones. In 2002, amidst the turmoil surrounding the demise of the national airline [[Sabena]], a new pier was opened.\n\nIn 2005, the airport was awarded Best Airport in Europe by [[Airports Council International]]/[[International Air Transport Association]] (ACI/IATA), based on a survey of over 100,000 passengers worldwide. Brussels Airport continued to appear in top airports lists as of 2012. A direct train link with [[Leuven]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] was opened on 12 December 2005.\n\nIn 2007, the airport served 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 7% over 2006. The cargo volume in the same year amounted to 780,000 tonnes, an increase of 8.9% over 2006. In 2008, the airport served 18.5 million passengers, which was an increase of 3.7% over the previous year.<ref>Expatica: [http://www.expatica.com/be/news/local_news/Record-number-of-passengers-at-Brussels-airport_48886.html Record numbers of passengers at Brussels Airport]</ref>\n\nSabena's demise meant a sharp fall in passenger traffic, a blow from which the airport only slowly recovered.

The terminal building consists of several levels. The [[Brussels National Airport railway station|railway station]] is located on \u22121, buses and taxis arrive at 0, arrivals are located on level 2 and departures on level 3. Levels 2 and 3 are connected to the airport's two piers (A and B).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Plattegrond terminal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014055/http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Pier A===\nPier A is the newest pier on Brussels Airport and was opened on 15 May 2002. This pier was destined to support flights from and to the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries (A-gates). However, since 15 October 2008 all [[Brussels Airlines]] flights to African destinations are also handled at this pier. Therefore, border control was installed towards the end of the pier in order to create a new pier. As a result, gates A61-72 were renamed T61-72. Later, Brussels Airlines' daily flight to New York was also moved here from pier B.\n\nUntil 26 March 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/corporate/connector/connhome/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Introduction|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Pier A was connected to the main building via a {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} tunnel under the apron. Each pier used to have its own security zone, so transfer between the piers involved a security check. This tunnel was replaced by the \"Connector\", a new building that links both piers above ground and allows passengers to walk straight from the check-in desk to their gate in pier A or B, without changing floors. In the opposite direction, the building provides arriving passengers with a smooth and convenient passage to the baggage reclaim hall and the exit. Furthermore, border control has been relocated behind the 25-lane screening platform (Europe's largest) inside the Connector which means that changing planes no longer requires a security check.\n\n===Pier B===\nPier B is the oldest pier still in use at Brussels Airport and is only used for flights outside the [[Schengen Area]]. Pier B is connected immediately to the main departure hall and consists of two decks. The upper deck (level 3) is at the same level as the departure halls and is used for the departing passengers, whereas the lower deck (level 2) is used for arriving passengers and connects immediately to border control and the [[Baggage claim|baggage claim area]].\n\n===Planned===\n\n====Pier A West====\nPier A West is a planned expansion of Pier A, and is meant to relieve Pier B by also handling flights from non-[[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries. Pier A West was due to open in 2016, but because of the slow passenger growth, Brussels Airport announced in July 2013 that the works would be delayed. However, in November 2015, Brussels Airport announced a major 550 million euro investment and pointed out that within this investment the extension of the pier is included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Brussels Airport lowers airport tariffs by 5.2% and invests over \u20ac550 million in its infrastructure|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221153852/http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|archivedate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Low-cost pier====\nJust as is the case for Pier A West, the construction of a new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] pier is currently on hold.

At present, several low-cost airlines including [[Ryanair]] and [[Wizz Air]] fly to [[Charleroi Airport|Brussels-South Charleroi Airport]], {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} away from Brussels.<ref>[http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php?nd=1101&tid=101&site=1&lg=2 Shuttles Brussels&nbsp;\u2013 Charleroi Airport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195240/http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php?nd=1101&tid=101&site=1&lg=2 |date=12 October 2007 }}</ref> In autumn 2013, low-cost carrier [[Pegasus Airlines]] announced it would end its flights between Brussels Airport and [[Turkey]]. The service between Brussels and [[Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport|Istanbul\u2013Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en]] would relocate to Brussels-South Charleroi Airport. However, [[Turkish Airlines]] announced on 26 November 2013 it would offer one daily flight on the same route, starting one month after Pegasus terminated its operations at the airport.<ref name=\"airlineroute.net\">{{cite web|url=http://airlineroute.net/2013/11/26/tk-brutxl-s14/|title=Turkish Airlines Adds Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen \u2013 Brussels / Berlin in S14}}</ref> One day later, Ryanair announced the opening of a second Belgian base at Brussels Airport, giving a boost to low-cost traffic at Brussels Airport. Ryanair announced on 27 November 10 new routes from Brussels Airport,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanair.com/en/news/ryanair-announces-brussels-zaventem-base-from-feb-2014|title=Welcome to Ryanair!|work=Ryanair.com}}</ref> although Brussels-South Charleroi Airport will remain the low-cost carrier's primary Belgian base.\n\n===Services===\nShops, bars and restaurants are scattered throughout the building. A few facilities are located in the departure area. These are mostly convenience stores and small shops such as the airport shop, a pharmacy, [[Relay (shop)|Relay]] stores and a coffee shop. But most of the facilities can only be accessed after Security control \u2013and are tax free. Several brands and chains have a branch in both piers, however several only operate in pier A. The airport also features places of worship (for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Protestants]]), as well as a place for meditation for [[Humanism|humanists]]. The airport provides meeting facilities and can host congresses up to 600 participants, either in the Regus Skyport Meeting Center or in the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Brussels Airport Hotel. The latter is the only hotel located on the airport grounds, opposite the terminal. Shuttle services are provided to 14 nearby hotels.\n\nAll passengers now have unlimited free Wi-Fi access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passngr/facilities/freewifi/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Unlimited free Wi-Fi|website=www.brusselsairport.be|access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passngr/services/internet_telephony/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Internet & Telephony}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/BrusselsAirport/status/951486523899371520|title=Brussels Airport on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere is a small smoking room next to gate A67 in the transfer section of pier A.\n\n===Other facilities===\nSeveral airlines have or had its head offices at the grounds of Brussels Airport.

There the [[Luftwaffe]] established '''Fliegerhorst Melsbroek''' and constructed 3 [[runway]]s in the shape of a triangle: runway 02/20, runway 07L/25R (both of which are still in use today) and runway 12/30. The airport buildings were constructed in the nearby municipality of Melsbroek and not of Zaventem, which is why the airfield was known to the locals as Melsbroek (in Dutch) (or \"Fliegerhorst Melsbroek\" in German). There is an [[urban legend]] that the site of the airport was chosen by the Germans after asking locals where to build it\u2013the Belgians then pointed to this location as it was often foggy.\n\nAfter the liberation on 3 September 1944, the German infrastructure at Melsbroek fell into the hands of the British. When the [[Evere Airport|old civilian airport]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] became too small, the Belgian authorities decided to use the aerodrome at Melsbroek for the new national airport. By 1948, a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] building was constructed to replace the old wooden building. In the same year, the lengths of both runways 02/20 and 07L/25R were increased, to {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2450|m|abbr=on}} respectively, whereas 12/30 remained at {{convert|1300|m|abbr=on}}. The civil aerodrome of Melsbroek was officially opened by [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders]], the [[Prince Regent]], on 20 July 1948. From 1948 to 1956 many more buildings and facilities were erected, mostly on the Melsbroek side of the site.\n\nIn 1955, a railway line from Brussels city centre to the airport was constructed. The line was officially opened by [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] on 15 May 1955.\n\nIn 1956 a new {{convert|2300|m|abbr=on}} runway was constructed, 07R/25L, which almost runs parallel with 07L/25R. The runway is still in use today and saw its length later increased to {{convert|3200|m|abbr=on}}. In April 1956 the [[Belgian federal government|Belgian government]] decided to build a new airport, using the same runways, but with the buildings located within the municipality of Zaventem. In April 1957, construction started of the new terminal, preparing the airport for the [[Expo 58|1958 World Fair]]. The grass runway 12/30 had to make way to allow for the new passenger terminal. This new airport was inaugurated 5 July 1958, almost just in time for the 1958 World Fair. The buildings on the Melsbroek side are still in use by the [[Belgian Air Component|Belgian Air Force]] ([[15th Air Transport Wing]]), and this is still known as Melsbroek airfield. Both [[Zaventem Airport]] and [[Melsbroek Air Base]], the military airfield, share the same runways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|title=Brussels Explosion rocks Europe!|author=Robert Tom|work=Innovative Report|access-date=22 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165822/http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Development since the 1960s===\n[[File:Boeing_707-329C,_Sabena_JP6848038.jpg|thumb|[[Sabena]] [[Boeing 707-300]] at Brussels Airport in 1966]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, Air Zaire AN0199454.jpg|thumb|[[Air Za\u00efre]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] at Brussels Airport at night in 1990]]\nDuring the boom of commercial aviation in the 1960s and 1970s, several hangars were constructed. A new [[Container terminal|cargo terminal]] was constructed in 1976. In 1994, a brand new terminal was constructed adjacent to the old 1958 building. Two old piers were torn down and replaced by modern ones. In 2002, amidst the turmoil surrounding the demise of the national airline [[Sabena]], a new pier was opened.\n\nIn 2005, the airport was awarded Best Airport in Europe by [[Airports Council International]]/[[International Air Transport Association]] (ACI/IATA), based on a survey of over 100,000 passengers worldwide. Brussels Airport continued to appear in top airports lists as of 2012. A direct train link with [[Leuven]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] was opened on 12 December 2005.\n\nIn 2007, the airport served 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 7% over 2006. The cargo volume in the same year amounted to 780,000 tonnes, an increase of 8.9% over 2006.

[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] claimed responsibility for the attacks as an act of revenge against [[Belgium]] for participation in the ongoing [[Military intervention against ISIL]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/isis-claims-responsibility-for-brussels-attacks-explosions-bombings-at-airport-and-maalbeek-maelbeek-a6946136.html|title=Isis claims responsibility for Brussels attacks|author=Lizzie Dearden|date=22 March 2016|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Zaventem333.JPG|thumb|Terminal exterior]]\n[[File:Moving walkway through the A-gates of Brussels Airport (DSCF7310).jpg|thumb|Departures area at Pier A]]\n[[File:Brussels_Airport_Runway_25_R.jpg|thumb|Runway and apron]]\n[[File:Controletoren_Brussel-Nationaal.jpg|thumb|Control tower]]\nBrussels Airport uses a one terminal concept, meaning that all the facilities are located under a single roof. The terminal building consists of several levels. The [[Brussels National Airport railway station|railway station]] is located on \u22121, buses and taxis arrive at 0, arrivals are located on level 2 and departures on level 3. Levels 2 and 3 are connected to the airport's two piers (A and B).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Plattegrond terminal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014055/http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Pier A===\nPier A is the newest pier on Brussels Airport and was opened on 15 May 2002. This pier was destined to support flights from and to the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries (A-gates). However, since 15 October 2008 all [[Brussels Airlines]] flights to African destinations are also handled at this pier. Therefore, border control was installed towards the end of the pier in order to create a new pier. As a result, gates A61-72 were renamed T61-72. Later, Brussels Airlines' daily flight to New York was also moved here from pier B.\n\nUntil 26 March 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/corporate/connector/connhome/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Introduction|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Pier A was connected to the main building via a {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} tunnel under the apron. Each pier used to have its own security zone, so transfer between the piers involved a security check. This tunnel was replaced by the \"Connector\", a new building that links both piers above ground and allows passengers to walk straight from the check-in desk to their gate in pier A or B, without changing floors. In the opposite direction, the building provides arriving passengers with a smooth and convenient passage to the baggage reclaim hall and the exit. Furthermore, border control has been relocated behind the 25-lane screening platform (Europe's largest) inside the Connector which means that changing planes no longer requires a security check.\n\n===Pier B===\nPier B is the oldest pier still in use at Brussels Airport and is only used for flights outside the [[Schengen Area]]. Pier B is connected immediately to the main departure hall and consists of two decks. The upper deck (level 3) is at the same level as the departure halls and is used for the departing passengers, whereas the lower deck (level 2) is used for arriving passengers and connects immediately to border control and the [[Baggage claim|baggage claim area]].\n\n===Planned===\n\n====Pier A West====\nPier A West is a planned expansion of Pier A, and is meant to relieve Pier B by also handling flights from non-[[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries. Pier A West was due to open in 2016, but because of the slow passenger growth, Brussels Airport announced in July 2013 that the works would be delayed. However, in November 2015, Brussels Airport announced a major 550 million euro investment and pointed out that within this investment the extension of the pier is included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Brussels Airport lowers airport tariffs by 5.2% and invests over \u20ac550 million in its infrastructure|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221153852/http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|archivedate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Low-cost pier====\nJust as is the case for Pier A West, the construction of a new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] pier is currently on hold. It will be built roughly where the old south pier used to be. At present, several low-cost airlines including [[Ryanair]] and [[Wizz Air]] fly to [[Charleroi Airport|Brussels-South Charleroi Airport]], {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} away from Brussels.<ref>[http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php?nd=1101&tid=101&site=1&lg=2 Shuttles Brussels&nbsp;\u2013 Charleroi Airport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195240/http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php?nd=1101&tid=101&site=1&lg=2 |date=12 October 2007 }}</ref> In autumn 2013, low-cost carrier [[Pegasus Airlines]] announced it would end its flights between Brussels Airport and [[Turkey]]. The service between Brussels and [[Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport|Istanbul\u2013Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en]] would relocate to Brussels-South Charleroi Airport. However, [[Turkish Airlines]] announced on 26 November 2013 it would offer one daily flight on the same route, starting one month after Pegasus terminated its operations at the airport.<ref name=\"airlineroute.net\">{{cite web|url=http://airlineroute.net/2013/11/26/tk-brutxl-s14/|title=Turkish Airlines Adds Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen \u2013 Brussels / Berlin in S14}}</ref> One day later, Ryanair announced the opening of a second Belgian base at Brussels Airport, giving a boost to low-cost traffic at Brussels Airport. Ryanair announced on 27 November 10 new routes from Brussels Airport,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanair.com/en/news/ryanair-announces-brussels-zaventem-base-from-feb-2014|title=Welcome to Ryanair!|work=Ryanair.com}}</ref> although Brussels-South Charleroi Airport will remain the low-cost carrier's primary Belgian base.\n\n===Services===\nShops, bars and restaurants are scattered throughout the building. A few facilities are located in the departure area. These are mostly convenience stores and small shops such as the airport shop, a pharmacy, [[Relay (shop)|Relay]] stores and a coffee shop. But most of the facilities can only be accessed after Security control \u2013and are tax free. Several brands and chains have a branch in both piers, however several only operate in pier A. The airport also features places of worship (for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Protestants]]), as well as a place for meditation for [[Humanism|humanists]]. The airport provides meeting facilities and can host congresses up to 600 participants, either in the Regus Skyport Meeting Center or in the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Brussels Airport Hotel. The latter is the only hotel located on the airport grounds, opposite the terminal. Shuttle services are provided to 14 nearby hotels.\n\nAll passengers now have unlimited free Wi-Fi access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passngr/facilities/freewifi/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Unlimited free Wi-Fi|website=www.brusselsairport.be|access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passngr/services/internet_telephony/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Internet & Telephony}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/BrusselsAirport/status/951486523899371520|title=Brussels Airport on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere is a small smoking room next to gate A67 in the transfer section of pier A.\n\n===Other facilities===\nSeveral airlines have or had its head offices at the grounds of Brussels Airport.

Bola\u00f1o and Monroe regularly rob and extort criminals, accept bribes, and take drugs.  While surveilling small time thieves, the two come to believe Jimmy Harris, a local criminal, is planning a heist.  They contact one of Harris' former associates, Reggie, and coerce him into revealing information by threatening to falsely arrest him.  Reggie and his friend, Irishman P\u00e1draic Power, identify Clifford Reynard, a getaway driver, and tell them Harris' girlfriend, Jackie Hollis, used to dance at a strip club owned by Russell Birdwell.  Birdwell, though suspicious, reveals Hollis' address.  After bursting into Harris' house and knocking him out, they extort several expensive possessions.\n\nMeanwhile, Birdwell tells his boss, James Mangan, a knighted British businessman who is in charge of the heist,  the cops have been asking about Hollis.  Mangan tells Birdwell to intimidate both Hollis and the cops.  Monroe returns to Hollis and gives her a replacement television.  After flirting with each other, they have sex and begin seeing each other.  While staking out Reynard's house to extort him, too, they hear a scream.  In the house, they find that Reynard's wife has murdered him, though she is too hysterical to explain why.  Irritated, the cops attempt to quiet her while they consider their next step.  Reynard's teenage son flees, but they are unable to catch him.  After a nightmare, Monroe becomes concerned and searches the city for the missing boy.  As he does this, Birdwell scares Bola\u00f1o's wife by smashing the window of her shop as she talks to Hollis.\n\nWith Reynard dead, Reggie takes his place in the heist, though he misleads Bola\u00f1o and Monroe into believing it will be taking place elsewhere.  When the cops finally catch on to him, they discover Harris and his cohorts dead.  Not knowing Mangan's involvement, they assume Reggie is responsible.  Before going after Reggie, they learn about Birdwell's harassment and beat him so badly that he loses an eye.  Knowing they have numerous enemies and believing themselves untouchable anyway, they do not bother asking who sent him. Reggie's friend Power, when offered a bribe, tells them Reggie fled to Iceland.  Though they know nothing more than that, they leave for Iceland, reasoning that an African American man will stick out.  To Monroe's amazement, the plan works, and they spontaneously find him in a crowd.  Under pressure, Reggie reveals Mangan's involvement and agrees to split his take from the heist with them.\n\nBack in Albuquerque, Lieutenant Stanton says Birdwell has filed charges against them.  Monroe and Bola\u00f1o assure him that their investigation is nearing completion and will involve Birdwell.  As Monroe and Bola\u00f1o search for Mangan, they chance upon Reynard's child, who is living homeless on the streets.  Monroe insists on becoming the boy's foster parent over the protests of Bola\u00f1o, who, as a parent, believes Monroe unprepared for the responsibility.  Hollis, who has temporarily moved in with Monroe after Birdwell's attack, also voices her skepticism, but the three eventually come to care for each other.  Although Mangan's thugs kidnap and beat Monroe, he laughs off their attempt to intimidate him, saying he has already been raped.  Not wanting to kill a cop, they release him.  However, after Monroe and Bola\u00f1o harass Mangan during a business meeting, Lieutenant Stanton finally fires them.\n\nMangan beheads Power and contacts the cops, hoping to entrap them with an offer of sharing the money.  Reynard's son, however, tells Monroe that his mother killed Reynard because she found out he was part of a child pornography ring run by Mangan.  Enraged, Monroe enlists Bola\u00f1o to help kill Mangan, having lost interest in the money.

Bola\u00f1o and Monroe regularly rob and extort criminals, accept bribes, and take drugs.  While surveilling small time thieves, the two come to believe Jimmy Harris, a local criminal, is planning a heist.  They contact one of Harris' former associates, Reggie, and coerce him into revealing information by threatening to falsely arrest him.  Reggie and his friend, Irishman P\u00e1draic Power, identify Clifford Reynard, a getaway driver, and tell them Harris' girlfriend, Jackie Hollis, used to dance at a strip club owned by Russell Birdwell.  Birdwell, though suspicious, reveals Hollis' address.  After bursting into Harris' house and knocking him out, they extort several expensive possessions.\n\nMeanwhile, Birdwell tells his boss, James Mangan, a knighted British businessman who is in charge of the heist,  the cops have been asking about Hollis.  Mangan tells Birdwell to intimidate both Hollis and the cops.  Monroe returns to Hollis and gives her a replacement television.  After flirting with each other, they have sex and begin seeing each other.  While staking out Reynard's house to extort him, too, they hear a scream.  In the house, they find that Reynard's wife has murdered him, though she is too hysterical to explain why.  Irritated, the cops attempt to quiet her while they consider their next step.  Reynard's teenage son flees, but they are unable to catch him.  After a nightmare, Monroe becomes concerned and searches the city for the missing boy.  As he does this, Birdwell scares Bola\u00f1o's wife by smashing the window of her shop as she talks to Hollis.\n\nWith Reynard dead, Reggie takes his place in the heist, though he misleads Bola\u00f1o and Monroe into believing it will be taking place elsewhere.  When the cops finally catch on to him, they discover Harris and his cohorts dead.  Not knowing Mangan's involvement, they assume Reggie is responsible.  Before going after Reggie, they learn about Birdwell's harassment and beat him so badly that he loses an eye.  Knowing they have numerous enemies and believing themselves untouchable anyway, they do not bother asking who sent him. Reggie's friend Power, when offered a bribe, tells them Reggie fled to Iceland.  Though they know nothing more than that, they leave for Iceland, reasoning that an African American man will stick out.  To Monroe's amazement, the plan works, and they spontaneously find him in a crowd.  Under pressure, Reggie reveals Mangan's involvement and agrees to split his take from the heist with them.\n\nBack in Albuquerque, Lieutenant Stanton says Birdwell has filed charges against them.  Monroe and Bola\u00f1o assure him that their investigation is nearing completion and will involve Birdwell.  As Monroe and Bola\u00f1o search for Mangan, they chance upon Reynard's child, who is living homeless on the streets.  Monroe insists on becoming the boy's foster parent over the protests of Bola\u00f1o, who, as a parent, believes Monroe unprepared for the responsibility.  Hollis, who has temporarily moved in with Monroe after Birdwell's attack, also voices her skepticism, but the three eventually come to care for each other.  Although Mangan's thugs kidnap and beat Monroe, he laughs off their attempt to intimidate him, saying he has already been raped.  Not wanting to kill a cop, they release him.  However, after Monroe and Bola\u00f1o harass Mangan during a business meeting, Lieutenant Stanton finally fires them.\n\nMangan beheads Power and contacts the cops, hoping to entrap them with an offer of sharing the money.  Reynard's son, however, tells Monroe that his mother killed Reynard because she found out he was part of a child pornography ring run by Mangan.  Enraged, Monroe enlists Bola\u00f1o to help kill Mangan, having lost interest in the money.  In the resulting shootout, Bola\u00f1o is apparently killed but reveals he was wearing a bulletproof vest.  The two shoot Birdwell as he begs for his life. Then they kill Mangan as he attempts to bribe them.  Monroe, Hollis, Reynard's son, Bola\u00f1o and his family, Reggie and Reggie's transgender girlfriend all party together on the beach in Iceland afterward.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]]<ref name=EmpireOnline>{{cite news|last1=de Semlyen|first1=Phil|title=First Look At John Michael McDonagh's War On Everyone|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=44056|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=Empire|date=20 April 2015}}</ref> as Detective Terry Monroe\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]]<ref name=\"EmpireOnline\" /> as Detective Bob Bola\u00f1o\n* [[Theo James]]<ref name=\"EmpireOnline\" /> as Lord James Mangan\n* [[Malcolm Barrett (actor)|Malcolm Barrett]] as Reggie\n* [[Tessa Thompson]]<ref name=\"EmpireOnline\" /> as Jackie Hollis\n* [[Caleb Landry Jones]]<ref name=\"EmpireOnline\" /> as Birdwell\n* [[Paul Reiser]]<ref name=\"EmpireOnline\" /> as Lieutenant Gerry Stanton\n* [[Stephanie Sigman]]<ref name=\"EmpireOnline\" /> as Delores\n* [[David Wilmot (actor)|David Wilmot]]<ref name=\"EmpireOnline\" /> as P\u00e1draic Power\n* [[Derrick Barry]] as Kimberly\n* Zion Rain Leyba as Danny Reynard\n* [[Keith Jardine]] as Barry Webb\n* Geoffrey Pomeroy as Jimmy Harris\n\n==Production==\nThe film is produced by Chris Clark and Flora Fernandez-Marengo, and co-produced by [[Elizabeth Eves]] for Reprisal Films.

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0[[Gobernadorcillo]] of the town. San Isidro was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nIn the 18th century Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was just a part of a settlement as one municipality. When the municipality of San Isidro de Potot was created it became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\n[[File:Jose burgos PG.jpg|thumb|right|Padre Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]\nIn 1913, the mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's\u00a0name to Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from San Isidro to Burgos in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, Mat\u00edas Guiang, a mighty sailor-explorer from the town of [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. Upon his return to the Ilocos region he told stories of his flourishing trade, he later decided to emigrate with his neighbors, relatives and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western most part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the Agno River by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIt was in February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\n===American Occupation===\nIn the mid-part of 1898, the town insurgents returned and established a local Katipunan Government. Don Mauricio Gallardo was made the president of the town. The Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro.\n\nIn November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n===World War II===\nDuring the Japanese Occupation in the year 1941-1945 was an era of terror and fear although the Japanese soldiers did not much disturbed other barrios of the town, this was due to Japanese high command to give compulsory contribution of rice and bamboos for their garrison.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in December 15. For the second time the people felt danger and insecurity for their life and property that the Japanese soldiers were invading the country, while fighting the Japanese army, the people of the town looked after for their safety. Some went to caves nearby, others to the forests and still others made dug-outs, upon assuring their safety some families vacated their houses while those at home continued to live in fear. \n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan.

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0[[Gobernadorcillo]] of the town. San Isidro was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nIn the 18th century Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was just a part of a settlement as one municipality. When the municipality of San Isidro de Potot was created it became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\n[[File:Jose burgos PG.jpg|thumb|right|Padre Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]\nIn 1913, the mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's\u00a0name to Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from San Isidro to Burgos in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, Mat\u00edas Guiang, a mighty sailor-explorer from the town of [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. Upon his return to the Ilocos region he told stories of his flourishing trade, he later decided to emigrate with his neighbors, relatives and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western most part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the Agno River by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIt was in February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\n===American Occupation===\nIn 1898, the town insurgents returned and established a local Katipunan Government. Don Mauricio Gallardo was made the president of the town. The Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro.\n\nIn November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan. It lies in the coastal sitio of Cabongaoan in barangay Ilio-ilio.\n\n[[File:Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Cabongaoan Beach]]\n*'''Death Pool/Depth Pool (Lagoon)''': Cabongaoan Beach has another feature that makes it a cut above the rest of Pangasinan's beaches: the so-called \"Death Pool.\" This tidal pool on the rocky side of the beach gets filled with water when the waves crash against it. This tidal pool was also featured in the national television show [[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho|''Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho'']]. As scary as its name may sound, it's perfectly safe to dive in and float around.\n*\n\n[[File:Death Pool, Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Death Pool]]\n*'''Sangbay Falls''': Located in Barangay San Vicente. The panoramic Sangbay Falls which could be visited best during the ber-months.\n\n[[File:Sangbay Falls.jpg|thumb|right|Sangbay Falls]]\n*'''Rolling Hills''': Other natural attractions in Burgos include the rolling hills in southbound barangays of Sapa Peque\u00f1a, Sapa Grande, Concordia, Pogoruac and Ilio-Ilio where herds of cattle in ranches roam freely.\n*'''Danao Lake''': Located in Barangay Cacayasen.\n*'''Pao Beach/Nambalan Cove''': Located in Barangay Ilio-ilio.\n*'''Paratec Beach''': Located in Barangay Ilio-ilio.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nBurgos is politically subdivided into 14 [[Barangay|barangays]].\n\n* Anapao (Bur Anapac)\n* Cacayasen\n* Concordia\n* Ilio-ilio (Iliw-iliw)\n* Papallasen\n*[[Poblacion]]\n* Pogoruac\n* Don Matias\n* San Miguel\n* San Pascual\n* San Vicente\n* Sapa Grande\n* Sapa Peque\u00f1a\n* Tambacan\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census|align=none\n| title = Population census of Burgos\n| 1903 = 3488\n| 1918 = 5143\n| 1939 = 8075\n| 1948 = 7891\n| 1960 = 10030\n| 1970 = 10586\n| 1975 = 12430\n| 1980 = 12817\n| 1990 = 14774\n| 1995 = 17003\n| 2000 = 18142\n| 2007 = 20187\n| 2010 = 18315\n| 2015 = 21637\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Burgos, Pangasinan\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 31\n| Feb high C = 31\n| Mar high C = 32\n| Apr high C = 34\n| May high C = 35\n| Jun high C = 34\n| Jul high C = 32\n| Aug high C = 32\n| Sep high C = 32\n| Oct high C = 32\n| Nov high C = 32\n| Dec high C = 31\n| Jan low C = 22\n| Feb low C = 22\n| Mar low C = 22\n| Apr low C = 24\n| May low C = 24\n| Jun low C = 24\n| Jul low C = 24\n| Aug low C = 24\n| Sep low C = 24\n| Oct low C = 23\n| Nov low C = 23\n| Dec low C = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 13.6\n| Jan rain days = 3 \n| Feb precipitation mm = 10.4 \n| Feb rain days = 2\n| Mar precipitation mm = 18.2 \n| Mar rain days = 2\n| Apr precipitation mm = 15.7 \n| Apr rain days = 4\n| May precipitation mm = 178.4\n| May rain days = 14    \n| Jun precipitation mm = 227.9 \n| Jun rain days = 16\n| Jul precipitation mm = 368\n| Jul rain days = 23\n| Aug precipitation mm = 306.6 \n| Aug rain days = 21\n| Sep precipitation mm = 310.6 \n| Sep rain days = 21\n| Oct precipitation mm = 215.7 \n| Oct rain days = 15\n| Nov precipitation mm = 70.3 \n| Nov rain days = 10\n| Dec precipitation mm = 31.1 \n| Dec rain days = 6\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Burgos-weather-averages/Pangasinan/PH.aspx\n| title = Burgos, Pangasinan: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 26 September 2015}}</ref>\n| date=September 2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170202040236/http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/pages/profile/?lgu=Burgos%20(PS)  Municipal Profile at the National Competitiveness Council of the Philippines]\n* [http://pangasinan.gov.ph/the-province/cities-and-municipalities/burgos/ Burgos at the Pangasinan Government Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161010201809/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130715074746/https://pangasinan.org/burgos/  Pangasinan.org : Burgos Family and School Reunion Archives]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre = Burgos\n| North  = [[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]]\n| East   = [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]\n| South  = [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]]\n| West   = ''[[South China Sea]]'' / \n[[File:Flag of Vietnam.svg|30px]]\n''[[Da Nang]], [[Vietnam]]''\n}}\n{{Pangasinan}}\n{{One Pangasinan Alliance}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Pangasinan]]\n[[Category:1830 establishments in the Spanish East Indies]]\n\n\n{{IlocosR-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "AnonymousRandom54321", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos,_Pangasinan"}
