{"title_page": "Armorial of Ireland", "text_new": "The following is a list of '''Irish counties' coats of arms'''. In the majority of cases these are arms assigned to [[county council]]s created by the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] or later legislation, either by the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]] in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] or by the [[College of Arms]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. All but two [[county council]]s in the Republic have a [[coat of arms]]. In Northern Ireland county councils were abolished in 1973, but the traditional arms are still occasionally used.\n\nThe arms of the [[county town]] have sometimes been used as an unofficial symbol of a county instead of those of its county council, or when the council had no arms. There are no official county flags. Flags with the [[GAA county colours and flags|GAA county colours]] serve as [[de facto]] county flags. County flags flown at [[Dublin Castle]] incorporate the county council arms, while those sold by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] county board include the county GAA crest. Coats of arms granted in recent decades often incorporate the GAA colours in the field.\n\n==History==\n{{Further information|Irish heraldry}}\nThe earliest Irish county arms date from the late 17th century, when those of counties Carlow, Kilkenny and \"Typerary\" were recorded by [[Richard Carney]], [[Ulster King of Arms]].<ref name=carney>Genealogical office Ms.60, ''Some 1150 Tricks of Family arms, with arms of Bishoprics and of counties Carlow, Tipperary and Kilkenny collected by Carney, Ulster about 1668'', folio 190</ref> In each case the arms consist of an ermine shield bearing a ''fesse'' or central horizontal band on which heraldic devices of local families are displayed. The arms of Tipperary became obsolete when the county was divided into North and South Ridings in 1838.\n\nWhen county councils were established in 1899, each was obliged to adopt a seal. In some cases these used an unofficial coat of arms, but no arms were officially granted prior to the splitting of heraldic jurisdiction in 1943.<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ''The Book of Public Arms'', Second edition, London, 1915</ref>\n\nIn 1914 a system of county and city flags were designed as unit colours for the [[Irish Volunteers]]. Each county flag was to include a coat of arms, with a list of suggested designs drawn by [[The O'Rahilly]]. While few of these colours were ever manufactured, some of the county devices were later to occur in official grants.<ref>G. A. Hayes-McCoy, ''A History of Irish Flags from Earliest Times'', Dublin, 1979</ref>\n\n===Grants by the Chief Herald of Ireland===\nWith the establishment of the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland|Genealogical Office]] in 1943, a native Irish heraldic jurisdiction was established. One of the earliest grants by the new office was to Dublin County Council on 30 September 1944. The grant was notable for its use of [[Norsemen|Norse]] symbolism and the [[motto]] in the [[Irish (language)|Irish language]].<ref name=hood>Susan Hood, ''Royal Roots - Republican Inheritance, the Survival of the Office of Arms'', Dublin, 2002</ref> In 1949 [[Edward MacLysaght]], the Chief Herald, discovered the 17th century arms of counties Carlow and Kilkenny, and wrote to the county councils concerned informing them of their existence.<ref>Genealogical Office Ms 527, MacLysaght Miscellany</ref> From 1956 there was a steady flow of grants to county councils. In 1990 [[South Tipperary|Tipperary South Riding County Council]] was granted arms based on those recorded by Richard Carney.<ref name=register>\nGenealogical Office, {{page number needed|date=February 2018}} \nRegister of Arms Q (1943-52), \n[http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000529310 Register of Arms R] (1952-59), [http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000529314 Register of Arms S] (1959-66), \n[http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000529299 Register of Arms T] (1966-72), \n[http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000511739 Register of Arms U] (1973-78), \nRegister of Arms V (1978-81) [http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000529332 Pt.1], [http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000529325 Pt.2] \n[http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000529325 Register of Arms W+X] (1982-95), \nRegister of Arms Y (1996-99) [http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000544629 Pt.1], [http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000544628 Pt.2]\n</ref>\n\n===Grants by the College of Arms===\nIn 1943 heraldic jurisdiction in Northern Ireland passed to the College of Arms in London, with the creation of the merged office of [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms]].<ref name=hood/> Five out of the six county councils received grants of arms from London.

In the majority of cases these are arms assigned to [[county council]]s created by the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] or later legislation, either by the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]] in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] or by the [[College of Arms]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. All but two [[county council]]s in the Republic have a [[coat of arms]]. In Northern Ireland county councils were abolished in 1973, but the traditional arms are still occasionally used.\n\nThe arms of the [[county town]] have sometimes been used as an unofficial symbol of a county instead of those of its county council, or when the council had no arms. There are no official county flags. Flags with the [[GAA county colours and flags|GAA county colours]] serve as [[de facto]] county flags. County flags flown at [[Dublin Castle]] incorporate the county council arms, while those sold by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] county board include the county GAA crest. Coats of arms granted in recent decades often incorporate the GAA colours in the field.\n\n==History==\n{{Further information|Irish heraldry}}\nThe earliest Irish county arms date from the late 17th century, when those of counties Carlow, Kilkenny and \"Typerary\" were recorded by [[Richard Carney]], [[Ulster King of Arms]].<ref name=carney>Genealogical office Ms.60, ''Some 1150 Tricks of Family arms, with arms of Bishoprics and of counties Carlow, Tipperary and Kilkenny collected by Carney, Ulster about 1668'', folio 190</ref> In each case the arms consist of an ermine shield bearing a ''fesse'' or central horizontal band on which heraldic devices of local families are displayed. The arms of Tipperary became obsolete when the county was divided into North and South Ridings in 1838.\n\nWhen county councils were established in 1899, each was obliged to adopt a seal. In some cases these used an unofficial coat of arms, but no arms were officially granted prior to the splitting of heraldic jurisdiction in 1943.<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ''The Book of Public Arms'', Second edition, London, 1915</ref>\n\nIn 1914 a system of county and city flags were designed as unit colours for the [[Irish Volunteers]]. Each county flag was to include a coat of arms, with a list of suggested designs drawn by [[The O'Rahilly]]. While few of these colours were ever manufactured, some of the county devices were later to occur in official grants.<ref>G. A. Hayes-McCoy, ''A History of Irish Flags from Earliest Times'', Dublin, 1979</ref>\n\n===Grants by the Chief Herald of Ireland===\nWith the establishment of the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland|Genealogical Office]] in 1943, a native Irish heraldic jurisdiction was established. One of the earliest grants by the new office was to Dublin County Council on 30 September 1944. The grant was notable for its use of [[Norsemen|Norse]] symbolism and the [[motto]] in the [[Irish (language)|Irish language]].<ref name=hood>Susan Hood, ''Royal Roots - Republican Inheritance, the Survival of the Office of Arms'', Dublin, 2002</ref> In 1949 [[Edward MacLysaght]], the Chief Herald, discovered the 17th century arms of counties Carlow and Kilkenny, and wrote to the county councils concerned informing them of their existence.<ref>Genealogical Office Ms 527, MacLysaght Miscellany</ref> From 1956 there was a steady flow of grants to county councils.

Types can emerge annually, biennially and perennially, rendering consistent management practices difficult. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control as the weeds regenerate in a manner that oftentimes outpaces eradication efforts. Broadleaf weeds do not differ greatly in terms of visuals, with large main leaves connected via central veins from a branch. Despite this broad similarity, they also differ in various aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive [[taproot]] while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and [[rhizomes]]. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Generally, most common weed plants  belong to one of two weed families namely, ''broadleaf (dicotyledon)'' or ''narrow leaf (monocotyledon)''.  Broadleaf  weeds grow from  tap roots or fibrous root systems and have larger leaves.  Narrow leaf weeds are also referred to as grasses.  They have fibrous roots systems and long narrow leaves.<ref>{{cite news | last =Tilley | first =Nikki | title =What Is A Weed: Weed Info And Control Methods In The Garden\n| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =gardeningknowhow.com| date = | url =https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/weeds/what-is-a-weed.htm | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds have leaves with net-like veins.  They also have  nodes that contain one or more leaves.  They may have showy flowers.  On the other hand, narrow weeds or grasses do not have net-like veins and nodes that contain more leaves.  They can be flat in nature.  Moreover, broadleaf weed have seedlings that come up with two leaves.  This is not the case with grasses that can easily spring up at any given time.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =hgic.clemson.edu| date = | url =https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/broadleaf-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, grassy weeds  are so called because they spring up as desirable grasses.{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}  This makes them very hard to be identified when comparing them with broadleaf weeds.  Grassy weed  come up with blades which showcase as a single leaf from a germinated grass seed.  This makes them quite different from broadleaf weeds especially in appearance.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =The Differences Between Broadleaf and Grassy Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =cardinallawns.com| date =7 July 2016 | url =https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/07/differences-between-broadleaf-grassy-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Methods of controlling==\nAlthough broadleaf weeds  are known to be aggressive and tough in nature, they can still be controlled. The gardens, yards and lawns are the most common place they thrive.  There are several ways of controlling them.<ref name=\"NEWS\">{{cite news | last =Trapp | first =Abby | title =Plan a strategy for weed control |work=News-Press NOW |date=28 May 2019 | url =http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/plan-a-strategy-for-weed-control/article_d6d4f086-7db5-11e9-8117-833bed713e1d.html| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Detecting their growth cycle===\n{{Clarify section|date=April 2020}}\nOne of the best ways of dealing with broadleaf weeds is to detect their growth cycle.  This requires proper monitoring.  Most  plants experts use this method since it has been proven to be the most effective.  It involves discovering how  broadleaf weeds grow and depriving them on that growth cycle.<ref name=\"SC\">{{cite web |title=Learn more about Broadleaf Weeds |website=sciencedirect.com |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/broadleaf-weeds |access-date=30 May 2019}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Using a weed killer===\nIn situations where there are massive growth of broadleaf weeds, using a good weed killer can be very helpful.  This is usually the case for lawns or  yards that are overgrown with such weeds. There are several good weed killers available in the market.  It is also important to seek the advice of a  weed plant expert  when looking for a weed killer.<ref name=\"NEWS\"/>\n\n===Hand-picking===\nIn lawns, gardens or yards where there are few broadleaf weeds present, the best approach to use is hand-pulling.  This should be carried out from time to time in order to check the spread weeds.<ref name=\"SC\"/>\n\n===Lawn mowing===\nIn a thick lawn that is overgrown with broadleaf weeds, the lawn mowing method is considered the best approach.  This involves the use of a lawn mower in uprooting the weed.  It can be very tedious especially in situations where there are massive growth of the broadleaf weeds.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n===Use of chemical herbicides===\nThere are chemical herbicides meant for controlling broadleaf weeds.  The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevents the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.

Types can emerge annually, biennially and perennially, rendering consistent management practices difficult. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control as the weeds regenerate in a manner that oftentimes outpaces eradication efforts. Broadleaf weeds do not differ greatly in terms of visuals, with large main leaves connected via central veins from a branch. Despite this broad similarity, they also differ in various aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive [[taproot]] while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and [[rhizomes]]. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Generally, most common weed plants  belong to one of two weed families namely, ''broadleaf (dicotyledon)'' or ''narrow leaf (monocotyledon)''.  Broadleaf  weeds grow from  tap roots or fibrous root systems and have larger leaves.  Narrow leaf weeds are also referred to as grasses.  They have fibrous roots systems and long narrow leaves.<ref>{{cite news | last =Tilley | first =Nikki | title =What Is A Weed: Weed Info And Control Methods In The Garden\n| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =gardeningknowhow.com| date = | url =https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/weeds/what-is-a-weed.htm | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds have leaves with net-like veins.  They also have  nodes that contain one or more leaves.  They may have showy flowers.  On the other hand, narrow weeds or grasses do not have net-like veins and nodes that contain more leaves.  They can be flat in nature.  Moreover, broadleaf weed have seedlings that come up with two leaves.  This is not the case with grasses that can easily spring up at any given time.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =hgic.clemson.edu| date = | url =https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/broadleaf-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, grassy weeds  are so called because they spring up as desirable grasses.{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}  This makes them very hard to be identified when comparing them with broadleaf weeds.  Grassy weed  come up with blades which showcase as a single leaf from a germinated grass seed.

This is usually the case for lawns or  yards that are overgrown with such weeds. There are several good weed killers available in the market.  It is also important to seek the advice of a  weed plant expert  when looking for a weed killer.<ref name=\"NEWS\"/>\n\n===Hand-picking===\nIn lawns, gardens or yards where there are few broadleaf weeds present, the best approach to use is hand-pulling.  This should be carried out from time to time in order to check the spread weeds.<ref name=\"SC\"/>\n\n===Lawn mowing===\nIn a thick lawn that is overgrown with broadleaf weeds, the lawn mowing method is considered the best approach.  This involves the use of a lawn mower in uprooting the weed.  It can be very tedious especially in situations where there are massive growth of the broadleaf weeds.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n===Use of chemical herbicides===\nThere are chemical herbicides meant for controlling broadleaf weeds.  The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevents the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.

With a strength of 27,535 personnel (December 2019),<ref name=\"bundeswehr\" /> it is the third largest air force within the [[European Union]], after the [[Italian Air Force]] and [[French Air Force]]. The German Air Force (as part of the ''Bundeswehr'') was founded in 1956 during the era of the [[Cold War]] as the aerial warfare branch of the armed forces of then [[West Germany]]. After the [[Reunification of Germany|reunification]] of West and [[East Germany]] in 1990, it integrated parts of the [[Air Forces of the National People's Army|air force of the former German Democratic Republic]], which itself had been founded in 1956 as part of the [[National People's Army]]. There is no organizational continuity between the current German Air Force and the former [[Luftwaffe|''Luftwaffe'' of the ''Wehrmacht'']] founded in 1935, which was completely disbanded in 1945/46 after [[World War II]]. The term ''Luftwaffe'' that is used for both the historic and the current German air force is the German-language generic designation of any air force.\n\nThe commander of the German Air Force is [[Lieutenant General]] Ingo Gerhartz. As of 2015, the German Air Force uses eleven air bases, two of which host no flying units. Furthermore, the Air Force has a presence at three civil airports. In 2012, the German Air Force had an authorized strength of 28,475 active soldiers and 4,914 reservists.<ref name=\"The Military Balance 2012, p.118\">The Military Balance 2012, p.118</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Airforce Museum Berlin-Gatow 43.JPG|thumb|left|This [[Canadair CL-13]] is preserved at the [[Bundeswehr Military History Museum|Military History Museum]] in [[Berlin]].]]\n\nAfter [[World War II]], German aviation was severely curtailed, and military aviation was completely forbidden after the ''Luftwaffe'' of the [[Third Reich]] had been disbanded in August 1946 by the [[Allied Control Commission]]. This changed in 1955 when West Germany joined [[NATO]], as the Western Allies believed that Germany was needed to counter the increasing military threat posed by the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies. Therefore, on 9 January 1956, a new German Air Force called ''Luftwaffe'' was founded as a branch of the new ''[[Bundeswehr]]''.\n\nMany well-known fighter pilots of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Luftwaffe'' joined the new post-war air force and underwent refresher training in the US before returning to West Germany to upgrade on the latest U.S.-supplied hardware. These included [[Erich Hartmann]], [[Gerhard Barkhorn]], [[G\u00fcnther Rall]] and [[Johannes Steinhoff]]. Steinhoff became commander-in-chief of the ''Luftwaffe'', with Rall as his immediate successor. Another pilot of World War II, [[Josef Kammhuber]], also made a significant career in the post-war ''Luftwaffe'', retiring in 1962 as ''Inspekteur der Luftwaffe'' (Chief Inspector of the Air Force).\n\nDespite the partial reliance of the new air force on airmen who had served in the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s air arm, there was no organizational continuity between the old and the new ''Luftwaffe''. This is in line with the policy of the ''Bundeswehr'' on the whole, which does not consider itself a successor of the ''Wehrmacht'' and does not follow the traditions of any other previous German military organization.\n\n===First years===\nThe first volunteers of the ''Luftwaffe'' arrived at the [[N\u00f6rvenich Air Base]] in January 1956. In the same year, the ''Luftwaffe'' was provided with its first aircraft, the US-made [[Republic F-84 Thunderstreak]]. At first, the ''Luftwaffe'' was divided into two operational commands, one in Northern Germany, aligned with the British-led [[Second Allied Tactical Air Force]], and the other in Southern Germany, aligned with the American-led [[Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force]].\n\nIn 1957, the ''Luftwaffe'' took command of the Army Air Defence Troops located in [[Rendsburg]] and began the expansion of its own air defence missile capabilities. The first squadron to be declared operational was the [[Air Transport Wing 61]] at [[Erding Air Base]], followed by the [[Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 31|31st Fighter-Bomber Squadron]] at [[B\u00fcchel|B\u00fcchel Air Base]]. In 1958, the ''Luftwaffe'' received its first conscripts. In 1959, the ''Luftwaffe'' declared the 11th Missile Group in [[Kaufbeuren]] armed with [[MGM-1 Matador]] surface-to-surface tactical nuclear cruise missiles operational. The same year ''[[Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 71 \"Richthofen\"|Jagdgeschwader 71]]'' (Fighter Wing 71) equipped with [[Canadair CL-13]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Jagdgeschwader 71 \"Richthofen\" |url=https://www.geschichte.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/geschlw/start/vde/jagdvd/jg71/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zinSx8QnyMLI2MfMIsXQw8DX29TS0tnYyCvQ31wwkpiAJKG-AAjgb6wSmp-pFAM8xxmuEMVKQfpR-VlViWWKFXkF9UkpNaopeYDHKhfmRGYl5KTmpAfrIjRKAgN6LcoNxREQCnrra3/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Z7_B8LTL2922LV9D0I1MK599B2SC0 |website=geschichte.luftwaffe.de |language=de |access-date=2019-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204231306/https://www.geschichte.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/geschlw/start/vde/jagdvd/jg71/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zinSx8QnyMLI2MfMIsXQw8DX29TS0tnYyCvQ31wwkpiAJKG-AAjgb6wSmp-pFAM8xxmuEMVKQfpR-VlViWWKFXkF9UkpNaopeYDHKhfmRGYl5KTmpAfrIjRKAgN6LcoNxREQCnrra3/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Z7_B8LTL2922LV9D0I1MK599B2SC0 |archive-date=2019-02-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> fighters became operational at [[RAF Ahlhorn|Ahlhorner]] Heide Air Base. All aircraft sported\u2014and continue to sport\u2014the Iron Cross on the fuselage, harking back to the [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte|pre-March 1918 days of World War I]], while the national flag of West Germany is [[Fin flash|displayed on the tail]].\n\n===Cold War===\n{{main|Cold War}}{{See also|1961 F-84 Thunderstreak incident}}\nIn 1963, the ''Luftwaffe'' saw its first major reorganization. The two operational Air Force Group Commands \u2013 Command North and Command South were both split into two mixed Air Force divisions containing flying and air defence units and one Support division. Additionally, a 7th Air Force division was raised in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] containing flying units, missile units, support units and the German Navy's [[Marineflieger|naval aviation]] and placed under command of [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches]].\n\nIn 1960, the ''Luftwaffe'' received it first [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] jets. The Starfighter remained in service for the entire duration of the Cold War, with the last being taken out of service in 1991. The ''Luftwaffe'' received 916 Starfighters, 292 of which crashed, resulting in the deaths of 116 pilots. The disastrous service record of the Starfighter led to the [[F-104 Starfighter#Safety record|Starfighter crisis]] in 1966 as a reaction to 27 Starfighter crashes with 17 casualties in 1965 alone. The West German public referred to the Starfighter as the ''Witwenmacher'' (widow-maker), ''fliegender Sarg'' (flying coffin), ''Fallfighter'' (falling fighter) and ''Erdnagel'' ([[tent peg]], literally \"ground nail\").\n\nOn 25 August 1966, the German Defence Minister [[Kai-Uwe von Hassel]] relieved the ''Inspekteur der Luftwaffe'' ''Generalleutnant'' [[Werner Panitzki]], and transferred Colonel [[Erich Hartmann]], commanding officer of the 71st Fighter Squadron, as both had publicly criticized the acquisition of the Starfighter as a \"purely political decision\". On 2 September 1966, [[Johannes Steinhoff]], with [[G\u00fcnther Rall]] as deputy, became the new ''Inspekteur der Luftwaffe''. Steinhoff and his deputy G\u00fcnther Rall noted that the non-German F-104s proved much safer. The Americans blamed the high loss rate of the ''Luftwaffe'' F-104s on the extreme low-level and aggressive flying of German pilots rather than any faults in the aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yarchive.net/mil/german_f104_losses.html|title=German F-104 losses (Ed Rasimus; LT Scott A. Norton, USN; Mike Schmitt; anon)|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225002750/http://yarchive.net/mil/german_f104_losses.html|archive-date=25 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Steinhoff and Rall went to America to learn to fly the Starfighter under Lockheed instruction and noted some specifics in the training (a lack of mountain and foggy-weather training), combined with handling capabilities (rapidly initiated, high G turns) of the aircraft that could cause accidents. Steinhoff and Rall therefore changed the training regimen for the F-104 pilots, and the accident rates fell to those comparable or better than other air forces. They also brought about the high level of training and professionalism seen today throughout the ''Luftwaffe'', and the start of a strategic direction for ''Luftwaffe'' pilots to engage in tactical and combat training outside of Germany. However, the F-104 never lived down its reputation as a \"widow-maker\", and was replaced by the ''Luftwaffe'' with the [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] fighter and the [[Panavia Tornado]] fighter-bomber in many units much earlier than in other national air forces.\n\n[[File:German Air Force (41+71) Dassault-Dornier Alpha Jet A.jpg|thumb|An [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet A]] in 1996]]\n[[Image:Panavia Tornado IDS of Luftwaffe, static display, Radom AirShow 2005, Poland.jpg|thumb|One of 212 [[Panavia Tornado]] IDSs delivered to the Luftwaffe]]\nOn Steinhoff's initiative, the ''Luftwaffe'' opened the German Air Force Command USA/Canada (''Deutsches Luftwaffenkommando USA/Kanada'') in [[Fort Bliss]], where the ''Luftwaffe'' trained its missile and air defence troops, and pilots received their basic training. At the same time, the ''Luftwaffe'' opened a Tactical Training Command in [[Beja Airbase|Beja]], [[Portugal]], where pilots were trained in [[Close Air Support]] missions.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1970, the ''Luftwaffe'' undertook a major reorganization of its forces. The two operational commands were disbanded and the four mixed Air Force divisions were divided into two flying divisions and two air defence divisions. The remainder of the units were divided into functional commands:\n* Air Force Operation Command (''Luftwaffenf\u00fchrungsdienstkommando''), with the signal regiments, the radar, and the signals intelligence units\n* Air Force Training Command (''Luftwaffenausbildungskommando''), with the schools and training regiments\n* Air Force Support Command (''Luftwaffenunterst\u00fctzungskommando''), with all logistical, maintenance and repair units, and the Material Office of the Air Force\n* Air Force Transport Command (''Lufttransportkommando''), with the air transport squadrons.\n\nOver the next decade, the ''Luftwaffe'' received large amounts of new equipment, including in 1968 the first [[Transall C-160|C-160 Transall]] transport planes, in 1974 the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] fighter-bombers, in 1978 the first [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet Version A]] light attack jets and in 1979 the first of 212 [[Panavia Tornado]] fighters.\n\nIn 1986, the air defense forces began to replace their [[MIM-14 Nike-Hercules|Nike Hercules]] missile systems with state of the art surface-to-air missile systems: first to arrive was the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] system, followed one year later by [[Roland (missile)|Roland]] short range missile system.\n\n==== Nuclear sharing ====\nGermany is participating in [[NATO]]'s [[nuclear sharing]] concept. Nuclear sharing is a concept that involves member countries without [[nuclear weapon]]s of their own in the planning for the use of nuclear weapons by NATO, and in particular provides for the armed forces of these countries to be involved in delivering these weapons in the event of their use.\n\nSoon after its founding, the German Air Force began to train with the US [[Seventeenth Air Force]] in handling, arming and delivering nuclear weapons. At first, the F-104 Starfighter was intended to be used solely as a nuclear delivery platform, armed with nuclear [[Air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] and [[air-to-surface]] missiles, as well as nuclear bombs. The Tornado was the second air force plane fielded that was capable of delivering nuclear ammunition, although it was limited to delivering [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s.\n\nFrom 1965 through 1970, [[Missile Wing 1|Missile Wings 1]] and [[Missile Wing 2|2]] fielded 16 [[Pershing 1]] missile systems with nuclear warheads under U.S. Army custody. In 1970, the system was upgraded to [[Pershing 1a]] with 72 missiles. Although not directly affected by the 1988 [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]], the ''Luftwaffe'' unilaterally removed the Pershing 1a missiles from its inventory in 1991, and the missiles were destroyed. At the end of the Cold War, more than 100,000 soldiers served in the ''Luftwaffe''.\n\nThe [[United States]] still lends [[nuclear weapon]]s for hypothetical use by the ''Luftwaffe'' under the nuclear sharing agreement. In 2007, 22 [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s were still kept in Germany, stored at the [[B\u00fcchel Air Base]] for use with Tornado IDS [[fighter-bomber]]s of [[Jagdbombergeschwader 33|''Jagdbombergeschwader'' 33]]. The American nuclear weapons formerly stored at [[N\u00f6rvenich Air Base]], [[Ramstein Air Base]] and [[Memmingen Air Base]] were all withdrawn from Germany during the mid-and-late-1990s.\n\nBy international treaties between Germany and the \"Big Four\" powers in Europe (that formerly occupied Germany), [[East Germany]] is a nuclear-free zone. The Big Four powers are the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, and with the latter three having no nuclear weapons in Germany anymore.\n\n===Reunification===\n{{main|Reunification of Germany}}\n[[File:Emblem of aircraft of NVA (East Germany).svg|left|70px|GDR Air Force plane marking]]\n[[File:Roundel of Germany \u2013 Type 1 \u2013 Border.svg|left|70px|FRF Air Force plane marking]]\n[[File:MiG-29 Fulcrum.jpg|thumb|right|A ''Luftwaffe'' [[MiG-29]]]]\n\nAfter German reunification in October 1990, the aircraft and personnel of the former [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] air force, the ''[[Air Forces of the National People's Army|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA]]'' were taken. The remnants of the East German Air Force were placed under the newly formed ''[[5. Luftwaffendivision]]'' (5th Air Force Division) in [[Strausberg]]. In 1993, the division was renamed ''3. Luftwaffendivision'', moved to [[Gatow]] in [[Berlin]] and in 1995 assigned to NATO. By 1990, the East German plane markings had been replaced by the Air Force Iron Cross, the first time Soviet-built aircraft had served in a NATO air force. However, as the ''Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA'' were supplied exclusively with [[Eastern Bloc]]-produced aircraft, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-17]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]] and [[MiG-29]] fighters, most of the equipment was not compatible with the West German NATO equipment and therefore taken out of service and sold or given to new members of [[NATO]] in Eastern Europe, such as Poland and the Baltic states.\n\nAn exception to this was the ''Jagdfliegergeschwader 3'' \"[[Vladimir Komarov]]\" (Fighter Wing 3 \"Vladimir Komarov\") in Preschen Air Base. The ''Jagdfliegergeschwader 3'' flew brand new [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] fighters. On 1 June 1993, the wing was renamed ''[[Jagdgeschwader 73]]'' (Fighter [[Wing (air force unit)|Wing]] 73) and on 1 October 1994 completed its move to its new home at [[Rostock-Laage Airport|Laage Air Base]]. The pilots of JG 73 were some of the most experienced MiG-29 pilots in the world. One of their primary duties was to serve as aggressor pilots, training other pilots in [[Dissimilar air combat training|dissimilar combat tactics]]. The United States sent a group of fighter pilots to Germany during the ''Red October'' exercise to practice tactics against the aircraft they were most likely to meet in real combat. The MiG-29s of JG 73 were fully integrated into the ''Luftwaffe''<nowiki/>'s air defence structure and the first Soviet Bloc aircraft to be declared operational within NATO.<ref>[http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRHeft/FRHeft04/FRH0404/FR0404c.htm MiG-29s leave Luftwaffe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624022957/http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRHeft/FRHeft04/FRH0404/FR0404c.htm |date=2010-06-24 }} \u2013 Flug Revue, April 2004</ref> With the introduction of the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] imminent, the decision was taken to withdraw the MiG-29.

The Air Force command directly controls three higher commands.<ref>[http://www.scramblemagazine.nl/orbats/germany/airforce Orbats - Scramble] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624104924/http://www.scramblemagazine.nl/orbats/germany/airforce |date=2013-06-24 }}.

In addition to the higher command authorities, the three air divisions, the Air Force Training Command, and Air Force Weapon Systems Command, were disbanded. The three surface-to-air missile units will merge into a single wing in [[Husum]] in Northern Germany. The wing fields 14 [[MIM-104 Patriot]] and 4 [[N\u00e4chstbereichschutzsystem MANTIS|MANTIS]] systems. The three air transport wings will be merged into a single wing based at [[Wunstorf Air Base]], which will field 40 [[Airbus A400M Atlas|A400M Atlas]] transport planes. The ''Luftwaffe'' will field three Multirole Eurofighter Wings, each with two squadrons for a total of 143 [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].<ref>[http://www.eurofighter.com/news-and-events/2013/12/eurofighter-typhoon-marks-delivery-of-400th-aircraft \"Eurofighter Typhoon Marks Delivery of 400th Aircraft\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212115032/http://www.eurofighter.com/news-and-events/2013/12/eurofighter-typhoon-marks-delivery-of-400th-aircraft |date=2013-12-12 }} December 04, 2013</ref> A fighter-bomber wing fielding [[Panavia Tornado|Panavia Tornado IDS]] planes remains in service at [[B\u00fcchel Air Base]].

at [[CFB Goose Bay]]]]\nIn light of the destroyed infrastructure of West Germany post\u2013World War II, the restrictions on aircraft production placed on Germany and the later restrictive flying zones available for training pilots, the reconstructed ''Luftwaffe'' trained most of its pilots tactically away from Germany, mainly in the United States and Canada where most of its aircraft were sourced.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a very large number of ''Luftwaffe'' jet crashes\u2014the ''Luftwaffe'' suffered a 36 percent crash rate for [[F-84F Thunderstreak]]s and an almost 30 percent loss of [[F-104 Starfighter]]s\u2014created considerable public demand for moving ''Luftwaffe'' combat training centers away from Germany.\n\nAs a result, the ''Luftwaffe'' set up two tactical training centres: one, like those of many of the [[NATO]] forces, at the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] base at [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay]]; and the second in a unique partnership with the United States Air Force at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in [[New Mexico]] (F-104 pilots had already been trained at [[Luke Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], since 1964). Both facilities provide access to large unpopulated areas, where tactical and combat training can take place without danger to large populations.\n\n[[Image:F-4Es 1GAFTS 9FS Holloman 1992.JPEG|thumb|F-4Es of the 1st GAFTS]]\nOn 1 May 1996, the ''Luftwaffe'' established the German Air Force Tactical Training Center (TTC) in concert with the [[United States Air Force]] [[20th Fighter Squadron]] at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in [[New Mexico]], which provides aircrew training in the F-4F Phantom II. The TTC serves as the parent command for two German air crew training squadrons. The F-4 Training Squadron oversees all German F-4 student personnel affairs and provides German instructor pilots to cooperate in the contracted F-4 training program provided by the U.S. Air Force (20th Fighter Squadron). A second TTC unit, the Tornado Training Squadron, provides academic and tactical flying training, by German air force instructors, for German [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] aircrews.\n\nThe first contingent of Tornado aircraft arrived at Holloman in March 1996. More than 300 German air force personnel are permanently assigned at Holloman to the TTC, the only unit of its kind in the United States. The German Air Force Flying Training Center activated on 31 March 1996, with German Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Portz and U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan present. The ''Luftwaffe'' has since stationed up to 800 personnel at Holloman for training exercises, due to limited training space in Europe.\n\nIn September 2004, the ''Luftwaffe'' announced a reduction in its training program by about 20%. By the end of 2006, 650 ''Luftwaffe'' personnel and 25 Tornado aircraft were assigned to Holloman.\n\n==Air bases==\nIn 2018, the Air Force uses 16 air bases, six of which host no flying units. Furthermore, the Air Force has a presence at two civil airports:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|

Each aircraft also carried a serial number consisting of 2 letters, which identified the service and combat wing, followed by three numbers identifying the squadron and the number of the plane within the squadron, almost graphically resembling the USAF's own [[buzz number]]s of the same period.\n\nThis system was changed in 1968. The large Iron Cross and serial numbers have since been replaced on all aircraft by a four number registration code, appearing somewhat in the manner of the earlier alphanumeric ''Geschwaderkennung'' combat wing code characters [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Remaining units|used by their World War II predecessor]] \u2014 separated by an Iron Cross in the middle: the first two numbers identify the type of aircraft and the second two numbers are a sequential for each type. When writing the registration number the Iron Cross is written as a \"+\". I.e. the [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado IDS]] of the Air Force are numbered from 43+01 to 46+22, while the Tornado ECR of the Air Force are numbered from 46+23 to 46+57. The numbers from 30+01 to 33+99 are being used for the [[Eurofighter]].\n\n=== Uniform ===\nThe [[Rank insignia of the German armed forces|ranks]] of the Air Force are identical to the ranks of the [[German Army]]. The Air Force field dress is the same as the army field dress. The [[dress uniform]] of the Air Force is dark blue with gold-yellow wings as [[Gorget patches|collar patches]]. As headdress a dark blue [[side cap]] or dark blue [[peaked cap]] can be worn. Members of the [[German Air Force Regiment]] wear a dark blue [[Military beret|beret]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Aircraft==\n=== Current inventory ===\n[[File:Eurofighter Luftwaffe (26437961262).jpg|thumb| A

With a strength of 27,535 personnel (December 2019),<ref name=\"bundeswehr\" /> it is the third largest air force within the [[European Union]], after the [[Italian Air Force]] and [[French Air Force]]. The German Air Force (as part of the ''Bundeswehr'') was founded in 1956 during the era of the [[Cold War]] as the aerial warfare branch of the armed forces of then [[West Germany]]. After the [[Reunification of Germany|reunification]] of West and [[East Germany]] in 1990, it integrated parts of the [[Air Forces of the National People's Army|air force of the former German Democratic Republic]], which itself had been founded in 1956 as part of the [[National People's Army]]. There is no organizational continuity between the current German Air Force and the former [[Luftwaffe|''Luftwaffe'' of the ''Wehrmacht'']] founded in 1935, which was completely disbanded in 1945/46 after [[World War II]]. The term ''Luftwaffe'' that is used for both the historic and the current German air force is the German-language generic designation of any air force.\n\nThe commander of the German Air Force is [[Lieutenant General]] Ingo Gerhartz. As of 2015, the German Air Force uses eleven air bases, two of which host no flying units. Furthermore, the Air Force has a presence at three civil airports. In 2012, the German Air Force had an authorized strength of 28,475 active soldiers and 4,914 reservists.<ref name=\"The Military Balance 2012, p.118\">The Military Balance 2012, p.118</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Airforce Museum Berlin-Gatow 43.JPG|thumb|left|This [[Canadair CL-13]] is preserved at the [[Bundeswehr Military History Museum|Military History Museum]] in [[Berlin]].]]\n\nAfter [[World War II]], German aviation was severely curtailed, and military aviation was completely forbidden after the ''Luftwaffe'' of the [[Third Reich]] had been disbanded in August 1946 by the [[Allied Control Commission]]. This changed in 1955 when West Germany joined [[NATO]], as the Western Allies believed that Germany was needed to counter the increasing military threat posed by the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies. Therefore, on 9 January 1956, a new German Air Force called ''Luftwaffe'' was founded as a branch of the new ''[[Bundeswehr]]''.\n\nMany well-known fighter pilots of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Luftwaffe'' joined the new post-war air force and underwent refresher training in the US before returning to West Germany to upgrade on the latest U.S.-supplied hardware. These included [[Erich Hartmann]], [[Gerhard Barkhorn]], [[G\u00fcnther Rall]] and [[Johannes Steinhoff]]. Steinhoff became commander-in-chief of the ''Luftwaffe'', with Rall as his immediate successor. Another pilot of World War II, [[Josef Kammhuber]], also made a significant career in the post-war ''Luftwaffe'', retiring in 1962 as ''Inspekteur der Luftwaffe'' (Chief Inspector of the Air Force).\n\nDespite the partial reliance of the new air force on airmen who had served in the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s air arm, there was no organizational continuity between the old and the new ''Luftwaffe''. This is in line with the policy of the ''Bundeswehr'' on the whole, which does not consider itself a successor of the ''Wehrmacht'' and does not follow the traditions of any other previous German military organization.\n\n===First years===\nThe first volunteers of the ''Luftwaffe'' arrived at the [[N\u00f6rvenich Air Base]] in January 1956. In the same year, the ''Luftwaffe'' was provided with its first aircraft, the US-made [[Republic F-84 Thunderstreak]]. At first, the ''Luftwaffe'' was divided into two operational commands, one in Northern Germany, aligned with the British-led [[Second Allied Tactical Air Force]], and the other in Southern Germany, aligned with the American-led [[Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force]].\n\nIn 1957, the ''Luftwaffe'' took command of the Army Air Defence Troops located in [[Rendsburg]] and began the expansion of its own air defence missile capabilities. The first squadron to be declared operational was the [[Air Transport Wing 61]] at [[Erding Air Base]], followed by the [[Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 31|31st Fighter-Bomber Squadron]] at [[B\u00fcchel|B\u00fcchel Air Base]]. In 1958, the ''Luftwaffe'' received its first conscripts. In 1959, the ''Luftwaffe'' declared the 11th Missile Group in [[Kaufbeuren]] armed with [[MGM-1 Matador]] surface-to-surface tactical nuclear cruise missiles operational. The same year ''[[Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 71 \"Richthofen\"|Jagdgeschwader 71]]'' (Fighter Wing 71) equipped with [[Canadair CL-13]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Jagdgeschwader 71 \"Richthofen\" |url=https://www.geschichte.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/geschlw/start/vde/jagdvd/jg71/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zinSx8QnyMLI2MfMIsXQw8DX29TS0tnYyCvQ31wwkpiAJKG-AAjgb6wSmp-pFAM8xxmuEMVKQfpR-VlViWWKFXkF9UkpNaopeYDHKhfmRGYl5KTmpAfrIjRKAgN6LcoNxREQCnrra3/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Z7_B8LTL2922LV9D0I1MK599B2SC0 |website=geschichte.luftwaffe.de |language=de |access-date=2019-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204231306/https://www.geschichte.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/geschlw/start/vde/jagdvd/jg71/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zinSx8QnyMLI2MfMIsXQw8DX29TS0tnYyCvQ31wwkpiAJKG-AAjgb6wSmp-pFAM8xxmuEMVKQfpR-VlViWWKFXkF9UkpNaopeYDHKhfmRGYl5KTmpAfrIjRKAgN6LcoNxREQCnrra3/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Z7_B8LTL2922LV9D0I1MK599B2SC0 |archive-date=2019-02-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> fighters became operational at [[RAF Ahlhorn|Ahlhorner]] Heide Air Base. All aircraft sported\u2014and continue to sport\u2014the Iron Cross on the fuselage, harking back to the [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte|pre-March 1918 days of World War I]], while the national flag of West Germany is [[Fin flash|displayed on the tail]].\n\n===Cold War===\n{{main|Cold War}}{{See also|1961 F-84 Thunderstreak incident}}\nIn 1963, the ''Luftwaffe'' saw its first major reorganization. The two operational Air Force Group Commands \u2013 Command North and Command South were both split into two mixed Air Force divisions containing flying and air defence units and one Support division. Additionally, a 7th Air Force division was raised in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] containing flying units, missile units, support units and the German Navy's [[Marineflieger|naval aviation]] and placed under command of [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches]].\n\nIn 1960, the ''Luftwaffe'' received it first [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] jets. The Starfighter remained in service for the entire duration of the Cold War, with the last being taken out of service in 1991. The ''Luftwaffe'' received 916 Starfighters, 292 of which crashed, resulting in the deaths of 116 pilots. The disastrous service record of the Starfighter led to the [[F-104 Starfighter#Safety record|Starfighter crisis]] in 1966 as a reaction to 27 Starfighter crashes with 17 casualties in 1965 alone. The West German public referred to the Starfighter as the ''Witwenmacher'' (widow-maker), ''fliegender Sarg'' (flying coffin), ''Fallfighter'' (falling fighter) and ''Erdnagel'' ([[tent peg]], literally \"ground nail\").\n\nOn 25 August 1966, the German Defence Minister [[Kai-Uwe von Hassel]] relieved the ''Inspekteur der Luftwaffe'' ''Generalleutnant'' [[Werner Panitzki]], and transferred Colonel [[Erich Hartmann]], commanding officer of the 71st Fighter Squadron, as both had publicly criticized the acquisition of the Starfighter as a \"purely political decision\". On 2 September 1966, [[Johannes Steinhoff]], with [[G\u00fcnther Rall]] as deputy, became the new ''Inspekteur der Luftwaffe''. Steinhoff and his deputy G\u00fcnther Rall noted that the non-German F-104s proved much safer. The Americans blamed the high loss rate of the ''Luftwaffe'' F-104s on the extreme low-level and aggressive flying of German pilots rather than any faults in the aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yarchive.net/mil/german_f104_losses.html|title=German F-104 losses (Ed Rasimus; LT Scott A. Norton, USN; Mike Schmitt; anon)|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225002750/http://yarchive.net/mil/german_f104_losses.html|archive-date=25 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Steinhoff and Rall went to America to learn to fly the Starfighter under Lockheed instruction and noted some specifics in the training (a lack of mountain and foggy-weather training), combined with handling capabilities (rapidly initiated, high G turns) of the aircraft that could cause accidents. Steinhoff and Rall therefore changed the training regimen for the F-104 pilots, and the accident rates fell to those comparable or better than other air forces. They also brought about the high level of training and professionalism seen today throughout the ''Luftwaffe'', and the start of a strategic direction for ''Luftwaffe'' pilots to engage in tactical and combat training outside of Germany. However, the F-104 never lived down its reputation as a \"widow-maker\", and was replaced by the ''Luftwaffe'' with the [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] fighter and the [[Panavia Tornado]] fighter-bomber in many units much earlier than in other national air forces.\n\n[[File:German Air Force (41+71) Dassault-Dornier Alpha Jet A.jpg|thumb|An [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet A]] in 1996]]\n[[Image:Panavia Tornado IDS of Luftwaffe, static display, Radom AirShow 2005, Poland.jpg|thumb|One of 212 [[Panavia Tornado]] IDSs delivered to the Luftwaffe]]\nOn Steinhoff's initiative, the ''Luftwaffe'' opened the German Air Force Command USA/Canada (''Deutsches Luftwaffenkommando USA/Kanada'') in [[Fort Bliss]], where the ''Luftwaffe'' trained its missile and air defence troops, and pilots received their basic training. At the same time, the ''Luftwaffe'' opened a Tactical Training Command in [[Beja Airbase|Beja]], [[Portugal]], where pilots were trained in [[Close Air Support]] missions.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1970, the ''Luftwaffe'' undertook a major reorganization of its forces. The two operational commands were disbanded and the four mixed Air Force divisions were divided into two flying divisions and two air defence divisions. The remainder of the units were divided into functional commands:\n* Air Force Operation Command (''Luftwaffenf\u00fchrungsdienstkommando''), with the signal regiments, the radar, and the signals intelligence units\n* Air Force Training Command (''Luftwaffenausbildungskommando''), with the schools and training regiments\n* Air Force Support Command (''Luftwaffenunterst\u00fctzungskommando''), with all logistical, maintenance and repair units, and the Material Office of the Air Force\n* Air Force Transport Command (''Lufttransportkommando''), with the air transport squadrons.\n\nOver the next decade, the ''Luftwaffe'' received large amounts of new equipment, including in 1968 the first [[Transall C-160|C-160 Transall]] transport planes, in 1974 the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] fighter-bombers, in 1978 the first [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet Version A]] light attack jets and in 1979 the first of 212 [[Panavia Tornado]] fighters.\n\nIn 1986, the air defense forces began to replace their [[MIM-14 Nike-Hercules|Nike Hercules]] missile systems with state of the art surface-to-air missile systems: first to arrive was the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] system, followed one year later by [[Roland (missile)|Roland]] short range missile system.\n\n==== Nuclear sharing ====\nGermany is participating in [[NATO]]'s [[nuclear sharing]] concept. Nuclear sharing is a concept that involves member countries without [[nuclear weapon]]s of their own in the planning for the use of nuclear weapons by NATO, and in particular provides for the armed forces of these countries to be involved in delivering these weapons in the event of their use.\n\nSoon after its founding, the German Air Force began to train with the US [[Seventeenth Air Force]] in handling, arming and delivering nuclear weapons. At first, the F-104 Starfighter was intended to be used solely as a nuclear delivery platform, armed with nuclear [[Air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] and [[air-to-surface]] missiles, as well as nuclear bombs. The Tornado was the second air force plane fielded that was capable of delivering nuclear ammunition, although it was limited to delivering [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s.\n\nFrom 1965 through 1970, [[Missile Wing 1|Missile Wings 1]] and [[Missile Wing 2|2]] fielded 16 [[Pershing 1]] missile systems with nuclear warheads under U.S. Army custody. In 1970, the system was upgraded to [[Pershing 1a]] with 72 missiles. Although not directly affected by the 1988 [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]], the ''Luftwaffe'' unilaterally removed the Pershing 1a missiles from its inventory in 1991, and the missiles were destroyed. At the end of the Cold War, more than 100,000 soldiers served in the ''Luftwaffe''.\n\nThe [[United States]] still lends [[nuclear weapon]]s for hypothetical use by the ''Luftwaffe'' under the nuclear sharing agreement. In 2007, 22 [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s were still kept in Germany, stored at the [[B\u00fcchel Air Base]] for use with Tornado IDS [[fighter-bomber]]s of [[Jagdbombergeschwader 33|''Jagdbombergeschwader'' 33]]. The American nuclear weapons formerly stored at [[N\u00f6rvenich Air Base]], [[Ramstein Air Base]] and [[Memmingen Air Base]] were all withdrawn from Germany during the mid-and-late-1990s.\n\nBy international treaties between Germany and the \"Big Four\" powers in Europe (that formerly occupied Germany), [[East Germany]] is a nuclear-free zone. The Big Four powers are the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, and with the latter three having no nuclear weapons in Germany anymore.\n\n===Reunification===\n{{main|Reunification of Germany}}\n[[File:Emblem of aircraft of NVA (East Germany).svg|left|70px|GDR Air Force plane marking]]\n[[File:Roundel of Germany \u2013 Type 1 \u2013 Border.svg|left|70px|FRF Air Force plane marking]]\n[[File:MiG-29 Fulcrum.jpg|thumb|right|A ''Luftwaffe'' [[MiG-29]]]]\n\nAfter German reunification in October 1990, the aircraft and personnel of the former [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] air force, the ''[[Air Forces of the National People's Army|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA]]'' were taken. The remnants of the East German Air Force were placed under the newly formed ''[[5. Luftwaffendivision]]'' (5th Air Force Division) in [[Strausberg]]. In 1993, the division was renamed ''3. Luftwaffendivision'', moved to [[Gatow]] in [[Berlin]] and in 1995 assigned to NATO. By 1990, the East German plane markings had been replaced by the Air Force Iron Cross, the first time Soviet-built aircraft had served in a NATO air force. However, as the ''Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA'' were supplied exclusively with [[Eastern Bloc]]-produced aircraft, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-17]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]] and [[MiG-29]] fighters, most of the equipment was not compatible with the West German NATO equipment and therefore taken out of service and sold or given to new members of [[NATO]] in Eastern Europe, such as Poland and the Baltic states.\n\nAn exception to this was the ''Jagdfliegergeschwader 3'' \"[[Vladimir Komarov]]\" (Fighter Wing 3 \"Vladimir Komarov\") in Preschen Air Base. The ''Jagdfliegergeschwader 3'' flew brand new [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] fighters. On 1 June 1993, the wing was renamed ''[[Jagdgeschwader 73]]'' (Fighter [[Wing (air force unit)|Wing]] 73) and on 1 October 1994 completed its move to its new home at [[Rostock-Laage Airport|Laage Air Base]]. The pilots of JG 73 were some of the most experienced MiG-29 pilots in the world. One of their primary duties was to serve as aggressor pilots, training other pilots in [[Dissimilar air combat training|dissimilar combat tactics]]. The United States sent a group of fighter pilots to Germany during the ''Red October'' exercise to practice tactics against the aircraft they were most likely to meet in real combat. The MiG-29s of JG 73 were fully integrated into the ''Luftwaffe''<nowiki/>'s air defence structure and the first Soviet Bloc aircraft to be declared operational within NATO.<ref>[http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRHeft/FRHeft04/FRH0404/FR0404c.htm MiG-29s leave Luftwaffe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624022957/http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRHeft/FRHeft04/FRH0404/FR0404c.htm |date=2010-06-24 }} \u2013 Flug Revue, April 2004</ref> With the introduction of the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] imminent, the decision was taken to withdraw the MiG-29.

The Air Force command directly controls three higher commands.<ref>[http://www.scramblemagazine.nl/orbats/germany/airforce Orbats - Scramble] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624104924/http://www.scramblemagazine.nl/orbats/germany/airforce |date=2013-06-24 }}.

In addition to the higher command authorities, the three air divisions, the Air Force Training Command, and Air Force Weapon Systems Command, were disbanded. The three surface-to-air missile units will merge into a single wing in [[Husum]] in Northern Germany. The wing fields 14 [[MIM-104 Patriot]] and 4 [[N\u00e4chstbereichschutzsystem MANTIS|MANTIS]] systems. The three air transport wings will be merged into a single wing based at [[Wunstorf Air Base]], which will field 40 [[Airbus A400M Atlas|A400M Atlas]] transport planes. The ''Luftwaffe'' will field three Multirole Eurofighter Wings, each with two squadrons for a total of 143 [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].<ref>[http://www.eurofighter.com/news-and-events/2013/12/eurofighter-typhoon-marks-delivery-of-400th-aircraft \"Eurofighter Typhoon Marks Delivery of 400th Aircraft\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212115032/http://www.eurofighter.com/news-and-events/2013/12/eurofighter-typhoon-marks-delivery-of-400th-aircraft |date=2013-12-12 }} December 04, 2013</ref> A fighter-bomber wing fielding [[Panavia Tornado|Panavia Tornado IDS]] planes remains in service at [[B\u00fcchel Air Base]].

at [[CFB Goose Bay]]]]\nIn light of the destroyed infrastructure of West Germany post\u2013World War II, the restrictions on aircraft production placed on Germany and the later restrictive flying zones available for training pilots, the reconstructed ''Luftwaffe'' trained most of its pilots tactically away from Germany, mainly in the United States and Canada where most of its aircraft were sourced.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a very large number of ''Luftwaffe'' jet crashes\u2014the ''Luftwaffe'' suffered a 36 percent crash rate for [[F-84F Thunderstreak]]s and an almost 30 percent loss of [[F-104 Starfighter]]s\u2014created considerable public demand for moving ''Luftwaffe'' combat training centers away from Germany.\n\nAs a result, the ''Luftwaffe'' set up two tactical training centres: one, like those of many of the [[NATO]] forces, at the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] base at [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay]]; and the second in a unique partnership with the United States Air Force at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in [[New Mexico]] (F-104 pilots had already been trained at [[Luke Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], since 1964). Both facilities provide access to large unpopulated areas, where tactical and combat training can take place without danger to large populations.\n\n[[Image:F-4Es 1GAFTS 9FS Holloman 1992.JPEG|thumb|F-4Es of the 1st GAFTS]]\nOn 1 May 1996, the ''Luftwaffe'' established the German Air Force Tactical Training Center (TTC) in concert with the [[United States Air Force]] [[20th Fighter Squadron]] at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in [[New Mexico]], which provides aircrew training in the F-4F Phantom II. The TTC serves as the parent command for two German air crew training squadrons. The F-4 Training Squadron oversees all German F-4 student personnel affairs and provides German instructor pilots to cooperate in the contracted F-4 training program provided by the U.S. Air Force (20th Fighter Squadron). A second TTC unit, the Tornado Training Squadron, provides academic and tactical flying training, by German air force instructors, for German [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] aircrews.\n\nThe first contingent of Tornado aircraft arrived at Holloman in March 1996. More than 300 German air force personnel are permanently assigned at Holloman to the TTC, the only unit of its kind in the United States. The German Air Force Flying Training Center activated on 31 March 1996, with German Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Portz and U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan present. The ''Luftwaffe'' has since stationed up to 800 personnel at Holloman for training exercises, due to limited training space in Europe.\n\nIn September 2004, the ''Luftwaffe'' announced a reduction in its training program by about 20%. By the end of 2006, 650 ''Luftwaffe'' personnel and 25 Tornado aircraft were assigned to Holloman.\n\n==Air bases==\nIn 2018, the Air Force uses 16 air bases, six of which host no flying units. Furthermore, the Air Force has a presence at two civil airports:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|

Each aircraft also carried a serial number consisting of 2 letters, which identified the service and combat wing, followed by three numbers identifying the squadron and the number of the plane within the squadron, almost graphically resembling the USAF's own [[buzz number]]s of the same period.\n\nThis system was changed in 1968. The large Iron Cross and serial numbers have since been replaced on all aircraft by a four number registration code, appearing somewhat in the manner of the earlier alphanumeric ''Geschwaderkennung'' combat wing code characters [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Remaining units|used by their World War II predecessor]] \u2014 separated by an Iron Cross in the middle: the first two numbers identify the type of aircraft and the second two numbers are a sequential for each type. When writing the registration number the Iron Cross is written as a \"+\". I.e. the [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado IDS]] of the Air Force are numbered from 43+01 to 46+22, while the Tornado ECR of the Air Force are numbered from 46+23 to 46+57. The numbers from 30+01 to 33+99 are being used for the [[Eurofighter]].\n\n=== Uniform ===\nThe [[Rank insignia of the German armed forces|ranks]] of the Air Force are identical to the ranks of the [[German Army]]. The Air Force field dress is the same as the army field dress. The [[dress uniform]] of the Air Force is dark blue with gold-yellow wings as [[Gorget patches|collar patches]]. As headdress a dark blue [[side cap]] or dark blue [[peaked cap]] can be worn. Members of the [[German Air Force Regiment]] wear a dark blue [[Military beret|beret]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Aircraft==\n== Heading text ==\n=== Current inventory ===\n[[File:Eurofighter Luftwaffe

As of March 2020, Dayton is ranked #3 in the AP Top 25 Poll, its highest ranking since the 1955\u201356 season when it was ranked #2.

The school's early teams were informally nicknamed \"The Saints\" by local sportswriters and competed against colleges, high schools, and club teams throughout the [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] region.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\">Collett, R. (1989). The Dayton Flyers: A history of UD basketball. Dayton: Landfall Press.</ref> Early rivalries with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] and [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami (Ohio)]] began in the 1908\u201309 season, and with [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] in the 1913\u201314 season,.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">2013\u201314 University of Dayton Men's Basketball Media Guide (2014).</ref> Fr. William O'Malley is recognized as the first coach of the Saints, but the team had no coach for the first six seasons. Harry Solimano, believed to be a former Saints player, succeeded O'Malley in the 1910 season and coached the team four seasons and again for the 1919\u201320 seasons.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> In 1920 the school changed its name to the University of Dayton and its sports teams gradually became known as the Flyers. Also in 1920, the school began playing nearby [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier University]], a rivalry that has spawned 156 meetings as of 2014. Games were originally played in an on-campus gymnasium, but later (1969) moved to the nearby University of Dayton Arena. [[Harry Baujan]] became both the football and basketball coach in 1923 and later became the school's athletic director. Through the 1920s and 1930s, the basketball program was subordinate to the football program with respect to resources and athletic department focus.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> In 1939, Baujan hired [[James Carter (coach)|James Carter]] as both an assistant football coach and head basketball coach. Carter moved to expand Dayton's national profile by issuing basketball scholarships and scheduling trips to east coast basketball powers such as [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St John's]] and [[Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball|St Joseph's]],.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Carter is also recognized as the first Dayton coach to play an African American student-athlete. [[World War II]] brought a two-year hiatus to the basketball program between 1943 and 1945.\n\n===The Tom Blackburn era\u2014national emergence===\nIn 1947, [[Tom Blackburn (basketball)|Tom Blackburn]] succeeded Carter as the school's first full-time head basketball coach. Blackburn, noted as a strict disciplinarian, recruited many former military men to his early squads and began to shift Dayton's scheduling focus from strictly local Ohio collegiate teams to a more regional focus, starting series with such programs as [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] in 1947\u201348 season.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> Blackburn would recruit future NBA player [[Don Meineke]], along with local standouts Junior Norris & Chuck Grigsby in 1948 to form the nucleus of the school's first nationally recognized teams. The 1950\u201351 Flyers reached #13 in the AP Poll and the finals of the [[National Invitational Tournament|NIT]] before bowing out to [[BYU Cougars men's basketball|Brigham Young]].<ref>2013\u201314 University of Dayton Men's Basketball Media Guide (2014)</ref> The following year, the Flyers also reached the NIT Finals, while also participating in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] for the first time, finishing in the regional semi-final. In light of the school's growing national stature and increasing fan base, the University constructed the 5,800 seat on-campus [[Thomas J. Frericks Center|University of Dayton Fieldhouse]] in 1950. Blackburn established Dayton as a national basketball power, winning the [[National Invitation Tournament]] in 1962, reaching the NIT finals six times during the 1950s and early 1960s, and securing a #2 [[AP Poll|AP]] ranking for most of the 1955\u20131956 season.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The foundation established by Blackburn led to Dayton being the most successful Division I basketball program through the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n===The Don Donoher era\u2014National Runner Up===\nTom Blackburn became ill with terminal lung cancer during the 1963\u201364 season. [[Don Donoher]], a former Dayton player and assistant coach took over for the final three games of the 1963\u201364 season.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> Donoher, with Assistant Coach Chuck Grigsby, guided the Flyers to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in his first two years as coach; they then led the Flyers to the 1967 NCAA Championship game by beating [[WKU Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]], #8 ranked [[Tennessee Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]], [[Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball|Virginia Tech]], and #4 ranked [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], before falling to #1 ranked and eventual champion [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] 79\u201364 in the final.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Donoher's 1967\u201368 squad began the season ranked #6 in the country in the [[AP Poll]], but faltered in early competition and finished with a 17\u20139 record, missing the NCAA tournament. Nonetheless, Donoher's Flyers made a successful run through the 1968 NIT field, besting [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] in the championship to win their second NIT crown. The Flyers would again face UCLA in a pivotal NCAA tournament game in 1974. The 20\u20137 Flyers squared off against the Bruins in the West Regional Sweet Sixteen and took the [[Bill Walton]]-led seven consecutive NCAA Champions to three overtimes before eventually falling 111\u2013100.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Donoher would again lead the Flyers to NCAA success in 1984 as [[Roosevelt Chapman]] led Flyers bested [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU]], #7 ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]], and #15 ranked [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] before falling in the Elite Eight to eventual national champion [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]]. The 24-season Donoher era was arguably Dayton's finest, producing eight [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] invitations, and eight NIT invitations. Following the success of the 1967 National Runner Up squad, the University began planning for a new 13,500 seat facility to house the nationally prominent Flyers. The [[University of Dayton Arena|UD Arena]] became the Flyer's home court at the start of the 1969\u201370 season.\n\nDayton resisted the trend towards league affiliation that began to sweep over college basketball in the 1970s and early 1980s. Instead, Dayton formed an informal home-home scheduling alliance with peer programs such as [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]], [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] during the early-mid 1980s in an effort to fill their schedules with quality opponents,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-05-04/sports/8501270613_1_basketball-conference-forming-notre-dame|title=Midwest Independents Inch Closer To League|author=|date=|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19870228&id=fnFIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iRIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4909,6920890|title=The Milwaukee Sentinel - Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|website=news.google.com}}</ref> Dayton was approached as early as 1978 to join what would eventually become the [[Horizon League]], but avoided league affiliation until the 1987\u201388 season when the school began play in the future Horizon League, then the Midwestern Collegiate Conference,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizonleague.org/aboutus/history.html|title=Horizon League History &#124; Horizon League|website=horizonleague.org|access-date=2014-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324015453/http://www.horizonleague.org/aboutus/history.html|archive-date=2014-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-06-24/sports/8702160392_1_mcc-marquette-midwestern-collegiate-conference|title=Dayton Joins Mcc, Makes Sullivan`s Day|author=|date=|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>\n\n===The Jim O'Brien era===\n[[File:Coach Jim O'Brien Bulls vs Pacers 2009.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Jim O'Brien]]\nFollowing three successive losing seasons, Donoher retired after the 1988-89 season. He was succeeded by [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1952)|Jim O'Brien]], former head basketball coach at [[Wheeling Jesuit Cardinals|Wheeling Jesuit University]]. The Flyers won the MCC conference tournament in 1990, and defeated [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]] in the first round of the NCAA tournament before bowing out to eventual Final Four participant [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] in the second round, 86\u201384. The Flyers moved to the [[Great Midwest Conference]] in 1993, but produced a dismal 1\u201323 conference record over their two seasons of league play. O'Brien was dismissed following the 1993\u201394 season after successive 4\u201326 and 6\u201321 seasons, their worst in modern school history.\n\n===The Oliver Purnell era===\n[[File:Oliver Purnell.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Oliver Purnell]]\nDayton turned to [[Old Dominion Monarchs basketball|Old Dominion]] head basketball coach [[Oliver Purnell]] to resurrect their moribund basketball program. The dissolution of the Great Midwest Conference in 1995 and subsequent snub by former conference mates in joining the new [[Conference USA]] further complicated Purnell's rebuilding task. In 1995 the Flyers accepted an invitation to join the A10, where they remain today. Purnell guided the Flyers to the [[1998 National Invitation Tournament|1998 NIT]], the school's first post-season appearance in eight seasons. Purnell would lead the Flyers back to the NCAA tournament in 2000 following the Co-SIDA Classic Championship, an 11\u20135 conference record and non-conference victories over #12 ranked [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], [[New Mexico Lobos men's basketball|New Mexico]], and rival [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]]. Purnell's 2000\u201301 team earned the program's first national ranking for the school since 1974 following victories over #12 [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]] and #6 [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]] in the 2000 [[Maui Invitational Tournament]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Dayton would go on to reach the quarterfinals of the [[2001 National Invitation Tournament|2001 NIT]]. Dayton would again make the NIT field in 2002. The 2002\u201303 season would mark the completion of Purnell's rebuilding project as the Flyers compiled a 24\u20136 record and reached as high as #16 in the [[AP Poll]] following victories over #21 [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]], #13 Marquette, and two wins over #25 St Joseph's en route to their first Atlantic 10 championship. The Flyers earned a #4 seed in the [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2003 NCAA Tournament]], but fell to Tulsa in the first round. Following the season, Purnell accepted an offer to become the [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson]] head basketball coach.\n\n===The Brian Gregory era===\n[[File:Brian Gregory.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Brian Gregory]]\nOn April 9, 2003, the University of Dayton announced that [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] assistant [[Brian Gregory]] would become the 18th head basketball coach for the Flyers. Gregory enjoyed immediate success with his new team, guiding the senior-laden Flyers to a 24\u20139 record, the [[2003 Maui Invitational Tournament]] Championship and a berth in the [[2004 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] in his inaugural season.<ref>[http://daytonflyers.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/gregory_brian00.html daytonflyers.cstv.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108005428/http://daytonflyers.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/gregory_brian00.html |date=January 8, 2007 }}</ref> The 2006\u201307 team finished the season 19\u201312 with wins over [[2007 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] bound [[2006\u201307 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]], [[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton]], [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]], [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami]], and [[George Washington Colonials men's basketball|George Washington]].<ref>[http://daytonflyers.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/sched/dayt-m-baskbl-sched.html daytonflyers.cstv.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020807/http://daytonflyers.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/sched/dayt-m-baskbl-sched.html |date=October 26, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe Flyers opened the 2007\u201308 campaign with a 14\u20131 record and wins over 12th-ranked [[2007\u201308 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]], sixth-ranked [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pitt]], and 22nd-ranked [[Rhode Island Rams men's basketball|Rhode Island]]. On December 31, 2008, the team was voted into both Top 25 polls for the first time since 2003. The team reached as high as 14th in the AP Poll and 18th in the Coaches Poll. However injuries to [[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1988)|Chris Wright]] and Charles Little derailed Dayton's season. The Flyers finished 9\u201310 in conference play, but 23\u201311 overall and were able to reach the quarterfinals of the [[2008 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]], losing at [[2007\u201308 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]].\n\nThe Flyers built upon the progress of the [[2007\u201308 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team|2007\u201308 season]] by compiling a 27\u20138 overall record (11\u20135 Atlantic-10) and defeating No. 15 Marquette and No. 17 Xavier en route to an [[2008 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] berth. The Flyers stunned higher seeded [[2007\u201308 West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball team|West Virginia]] before bowing out to [[2007\u201308 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] in the Second Round. The [[2009\u201310 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team|2009\u201310 Flyers]] began the season with high expectations, but faltered in league play to miss the NCAA tournament. However, the Flyers regrouped to storm through the NIT bracket, defeating [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]] on their home floors and besting [[Ole Miss Rebels men's basketball|Ole Miss]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in New York to win the [[2010 National Invitation Tournament|2010 NIT Championship]], the school's third NIT title. Gregory compiled a 172\u201394 record with the Flyers through eight seasons, leading them to two NCAAs and three NITs. Gregory also recruited future NBA players [[Brian Roberts (basketball)|Brian Roberts]], [[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1988)|Chris Wright]], and [[Chris Johnson (basketball, born 1990)|Chris Johnson]], Dayton's first NBA players since [[Negele Knight]] in 1990. Gregory accepted the head coaching position at [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech]] following the 2010\u201311 season.\n\n===The Archie Miller era===\n[[File:Archie Miller in 2009.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Archie Miller]]The Dayton Flyers turned to [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]] assistant [[Archie Miller (basketball)|Archie Miller]] in 2011 to lead the program. Miller's [[2011\u201312 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team|first team]] won the 2011 [[AdvoCare Invitational|Old Spice Classic]], shocked No. 16-ranked [[2011\u201312 Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team|Alabama]] and reached the [[2012 National Invitation Tournament|2012 NIT]] as a No. 2 seed, but would lose in the first round.\n\nThe [[2013\u201314 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team]] placed third in the [[2013 Maui Invitational Tournament|2013 Maui Invitational]], beating No. 11-ranked [[2013\u201314 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga]] and [[2013\u201314 California Golden Bears men's basketball team|California]]. The 2013\u201314 team experienced a mid-season swoon due to injuries, but entered [[2013 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament|A-10 Tournament]] play on a 9\u20131 run with victories over league rivals No. 17 [[2013\u201314 Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball team|Saint Louis]], [[2013\u201314 UMass Minutemen basketball team|UMass]] and [[2013\u201314 George Washington Colonials men's basketball team|George Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realtimerpi.com/rpi_110_Men.html|title=RealTimeRPI.com  Dayton Flyers Men's College Basketball Rating Percentage Index (RPI) Ratings - A leading sports ratings and resources community on the Internet|author=|date=|website=www.realtimerpi.com}}</ref>\n\n[[2013\u201314 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team|Dayton]] received a No. 11 seed as an at-large team to the [[2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2014 NCAA Tournament]] South Region.

The school's early teams were informally nicknamed \"The Saints\" by local sportswriters and competed against colleges, high schools, and club teams throughout the [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] region.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\">Collett, R. (1989). The Dayton Flyers: A history of UD basketball. Dayton: Landfall Press.</ref> Early rivalries with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] and [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami (Ohio)]] began in the 1908\u201309 season, and with [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] in the 1913\u201314 season,.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">2013\u201314 University of Dayton Men's Basketball Media Guide (2014).</ref> Fr. William O'Malley is recognized as the first coach of the Saints, but the team had no coach for the first six seasons. Harry Solimano, believed to be a former Saints player, succeeded O'Malley in the 1910 season and coached the team four seasons and again for the 1919\u201320 seasons.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> In 1920 the school changed its name to the University of Dayton and its sports teams gradually became known as the Flyers. Also in 1920, the school began playing nearby [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier University]], a rivalry that has spawned 156 meetings as of 2014. Games were originally played in an on-campus gymnasium, but later (1969) moved to the nearby University of Dayton Arena. [[Harry Baujan]] became both the football and basketball coach in 1923 and later became the school's athletic director. Through the 1920s and 1930s, the basketball program was subordinate to the football program with respect to resources and athletic department focus.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> In 1939, Baujan hired [[James Carter (coach)|James Carter]] as both an assistant football coach and head basketball coach. Carter moved to expand Dayton's national profile by issuing basketball scholarships and scheduling trips to east coast basketball powers such as [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St John's]] and [[Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball|St Joseph's]],.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Carter is also recognized as the first Dayton coach to play an African American student-athlete. [[World War II]] brought a two-year hiatus to the basketball program between 1943 and 1945.\n\n===The Tom Blackburn era\u2014national emergence===\nIn 1947, [[Tom Blackburn (basketball)|Tom Blackburn]] succeeded Carter as the school's first full-time head basketball coach. Blackburn, noted as a strict disciplinarian, recruited many former military men to his early squads and began to shift Dayton's scheduling focus from strictly local Ohio collegiate teams to a more regional focus, starting series with such programs as [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] in 1947\u201348 season.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> Blackburn would recruit future NBA player [[Don Meineke]], along with local standouts Junior Norris & Chuck Grigsby in 1948 to form the nucleus of the school's first nationally recognized teams. The 1950\u201351 Flyers reached #13 in the AP Poll and the finals of the [[National Invitational Tournament|NIT]] before bowing out to [[BYU Cougars men's basketball|Brigham Young]].<ref>2013\u201314 University of Dayton Men's Basketball Media Guide (2014)</ref> The following year, the Flyers also reached the NIT Finals, while also participating in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] for the first time, finishing in the regional semi-final. In light of the school's growing national stature and increasing fan base, the University constructed the 5,800 seat on-campus [[Thomas J. Frericks Center|University of Dayton Fieldhouse]] in 1950. Blackburn established Dayton as a national basketball power, winning the [[National Invitation Tournament]] in 1962, reaching the NIT finals six times during the 1950s and early 1960s, and securing a #2 [[AP Poll|AP]] ranking for most of the 1955\u20131956 season.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The foundation established by Blackburn led to Dayton being the most successful Division I basketball program through the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n===The Don Donoher era\u2014National Runner Up===\nTom Blackburn became ill with terminal lung cancer during the 1963\u201364 season. [[Don Donoher]], a former Dayton player and assistant coach took over for the final three games of the 1963\u201364 season.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> Donoher, with Assistant Coach Chuck Grigsby, guided the Flyers to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in his first two years as coach; they then led the Flyers to the 1967 NCAA Championship game by beating [[WKU Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]], #8 ranked [[Tennessee Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]], [[Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball|Virginia Tech]], and #4 ranked [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], before falling to #1 ranked and eventual champion [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] 79\u201364 in the final.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Donoher's 1967\u201368 squad began the season ranked #6 in the country in the [[AP Poll]], but faltered in early competition and finished with a 17\u20139 record, missing the NCAA tournament. Nonetheless, Donoher's Flyers made a successful run through the 1968 NIT field, besting [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] in the championship to win their second NIT crown. The Flyers would again face UCLA in a pivotal NCAA tournament game in 1974. The 20\u20137 Flyers squared off against the Bruins in the West Regional Sweet Sixteen and took the [[Bill Walton]]-led seven consecutive NCAA Champions to three overtimes before eventually falling 111\u2013100.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Donoher would again lead the Flyers to NCAA success in 1984 as [[Roosevelt Chapman]] led Flyers bested [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU]], #7 ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]], and #15 ranked [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] before falling in the Elite Eight to eventual national champion [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]]. The 24-season Donoher era was arguably Dayton's finest, producing eight [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] invitations, and eight NIT invitations. Following the success of the 1967 National Runner Up squad, the University began planning for a new 13,500 seat facility to house the nationally prominent Flyers. The [[University of Dayton Arena|UD Arena]] became the Flyer's home court at the start of the 1969\u201370 season.\n\nDayton resisted the trend towards league affiliation that began to sweep over college basketball in the 1970s and early 1980s. Instead, Dayton formed an informal home-home scheduling alliance with peer programs such as [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]], [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] during the early-mid 1980s in an effort to fill their schedules with quality opponents,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-05-04/sports/8501270613_1_basketball-conference-forming-notre-dame|title=Midwest Independents Inch Closer To League|author=|date=|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19870228&id=fnFIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iRIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4909,6920890|title=The Milwaukee Sentinel - Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|website=news.google.com}}</ref> Dayton was approached as early as 1978 to join what would eventually become the [[Horizon League]], but avoided league affiliation until the 1987\u201388 season when the school began play in the future Horizon League, then the Midwestern Collegiate Conference,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizonleague.org/aboutus/history.html|title=Horizon League History &#124; Horizon League|website=horizonleague.org|access-date=2014-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324015453/http://www.horizonleague.org/aboutus/history.html|archive-date=2014-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-06-24/sports/8702160392_1_mcc-marquette-midwestern-collegiate-conference|title=Dayton Joins Mcc, Makes Sullivan`s Day|author=|date=|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>\n\n===The Jim O'Brien era===\n[[File:Coach Jim O'Brien Bulls vs Pacers 2009.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Jim O'Brien]]\nFollowing three successive losing seasons, Donoher retired after the 1988-89 season. He was succeeded by [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1952)|Jim O'Brien]], former head basketball coach at [[Wheeling Jesuit Cardinals|Wheeling Jesuit University]]. The Flyers won the MCC conference tournament in 1990, and defeated [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]] in the first round of the NCAA tournament before bowing out to eventual Final Four participant [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] in the second round, 86\u201384. The Flyers moved to the [[Great Midwest Conference]] in 1993, but produced a dismal 1\u201323 conference record over their two seasons of league play. O'Brien was dismissed following the 1993\u201394 season after successive 4\u201326 and 6\u201321 seasons, their worst in modern school history.\n\n===The Oliver Purnell era===\n[[File:Oliver Purnell.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Oliver Purnell]]\nDayton turned to [[Old Dominion Monarchs basketball|Old Dominion]] head basketball coach [[Oliver Purnell]] to resurrect their moribund basketball program. The dissolution of the Great Midwest Conference in 1995 and subsequent snub by former conference mates in joining the new [[Conference USA]] further complicated Purnell's rebuilding task. In 1995 the Flyers accepted an invitation to join the A10, where they remain today. Purnell guided the Flyers to the [[1998 National Invitation Tournament|1998 NIT]], the school's first post-season appearance in eight seasons. Purnell would lead the Flyers back to the NCAA tournament in 2000 following the Co-SIDA Classic Championship, an 11\u20135 conference record and non-conference victories over #12 ranked [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], [[New Mexico Lobos men's basketball|New Mexico]], and rival [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]].

It is part of the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]].<ref>https://www.marc.org/Data-Economy/Metrodataline/General-Information/Statistical-Areas</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nLinwood was founded as '''Journeycake''', being named after [[Charles Journeycake]], the last [[Lenape|Delaware]] chief.  (Sometimes people made fun of the name Journeycake by calling it \"Johnny Cake\".)  The community was platted on both sides of Stranger Creek, near its mouth at the [[Kansas River]].\n\nIn May 1860, a treaty was signed at Sarcoxieville, {{convert|3|mi|km}} northeast of Linwood, by Chief Sarcoxie of the Delaware and by the United States.<ref>[http://lenapedelawarehistory.net/mirror/persN-Z.htm Pers N-Z], Lenape-Delaware History.net, 2006-06-09.  Accessed 2007-08-09.</ref>  After the treaty's signature, each member of the tribe was assigned a parcel of land, and the balance of the tribe's territories were sold to the predecessor of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].  Meanwhile, the U.S. government established a trading post near Stranger Creek until the tribe was moved to the [[Indian Territory]] in 1867.  Located beside the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, the store became the first school in the community.\n\n===Union Pacific Railroad===\nIn September 1863, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] began building the main line westward across the [[Great Plains]] from [[Kansas City, Kansas]], to [[Denver, Colorado]]. This was the long-line railroad in Kansas for 2\u20133 years.  The first {{convert|40|mi|km}} was open in 1864 from Wyandotte (now a suburb of Kansas City) to Lawrence. William A. Harris moved to Kansas in 1865 employed as a civil engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1868 it became the [[Kansas Pacific Railway|Kansas Pacific Railroad]] because it was easier to refer to.\n\n===Name change===\nThe original community of '''Journeycake''' was [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902075740/http://ead.diglib.ku.edu/xml/ksrl.kc.searlad.html officially platted] as '''Stranger''' on July 11, 1867, and recorded at the Leavenworth County Courthouse. When the name Stranger became a problem for the [http://www.kshs.org/genealogists/places/postoffices.htm Postal Service] who confused Stranger with a nearby community also named Stranger (referred to as \"Big\" Stranger), it was renamed '''Linwood''' on December 20, 1877.  Legend has it that one day when the citizens were cutting wood for the church, [[William W. Loring#Antebellum years|Colonel Loring]] suggested they change the name to Linwood, because of the many [[Tilia americana|linden]] trees that grew in the area.  But, according to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902075740/http://ead.diglib.ku.edu/xml/ksrl.kc.searlad.html#IDA0G0P Kansas Historical Collections], the community of Stranger had its name changed to Linwood by Senator William A. Harris because of his great appreciation for the linwood trees that were abundant in the vicinity of Stranger Creek.\n\n===Senator Harris===\n[[William A. Harris (Kansas)|William A. Harris]] moved to Kansas in 1865 employed as a civil engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad until 1868, when he moved to Lawrence, Kansas. He was appointed agent for the railroad companies in the sale of the Delaware Reservation and other lands.  In 1884 Harris became a prominent citizen of Linwood, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits and stock raising.  He bought several {{convert|100|acre|m2}} of land just west of Linwood that bordered the city.  On a high hill within sight of city he built a modest two story mansion with fifteen rooms, the ''Harris House''. Harris was elected as a Democratic Congressman to the Fifty-third Congress (1893\u20131895) and as a [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] to the U.S. Senate (1897\u20131903). He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Kansas in 1906. Harris died in 1909, and is buried in [[Lawrence, Kansas]].\n\n===Relocation===\nMuch of Linwood's commerce came from the saw mills on the river, so the city had grown very near the banks of the [[Kansas River]] (affectionately known as the \u201cKaw\u201d River) that flows eastward to the Missouri.  After the 1903 flood damaged and endangered much of the city, it was relocated about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) north to its present location out of \u201cthe bottoms\u201d (as they are still known today) near the river.\n\n===21st century===\nPresent day Linwood is a small city which is accessed solely off of {{jct|state=KS|KS|32}}, as the Golden Road bridge over Stranger Creek collapsed in the early 2000s and has never been rebuilt.  Currently the city has less than 400 people.  In just the last couple of years numerous new homes have been built drawing new families.  Linwood has several businesses including a gas station, tavern, landscaping company and salsa plant. Linwood is home to one of the Basehor-Linwood Elementary Schools, while the Basehor-Linwood Middle and High Schools are located in [[Basehor, Kansas|Basehor]].\n\n===2019 tornado===\n{{See also|Tornado outbreak sequence of May 2019}}\nOn May 28, 2019 an EF4 [[tornado]] with Doppler windspeed measurements of over 187&nbsp;mph struck the outlying areas of the city and severely damaged homes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massive tornado rips through Linwood, Kansas, destroying homes and keeping KC on edge |url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/weather-news/article230922503.html |website=[[The Kansas City Star]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529063241/https://www.kansascity.com/news/weather-news/article230922503.html |archivedate=May 29, 2019 |date=May 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> [https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/06/06/storm-chaser-reed-timmer-successfully-shot-rocket-into-wedge-tornado-data-he-says-is-incredible/?noredirect=on] At least 13 injuries have been reported due to the storm.

It is part of the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]].<ref>https://www.marc.org/Data-Economy/Metrodataline/General-Information/Statistical-Areas</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nLinwood was founded as '''Journeycake''', being named after [[Charles Journeycake]], the last [[Lenape|Delaware]] chief.  (Sometimes people made fun of the name Journeycake by calling it \"Johnny Cake\".)  The community was platted on both sides of Stranger Creek, near its mouth at the [[Kansas River]].\n\nIn May 1860, a treaty was signed at Sarcoxieville, {{convert|3|mi|km}} northeast of Linwood, by Chief Sarcoxie of the Delaware and by the United States.<ref>[http://lenapedelawarehistory.net/mirror/persN-Z.htm Pers N-Z], Lenape-Delaware History.net, 2006-06-09.  Accessed 2007-08-09.</ref>  After the treaty's signature, each member of the tribe was assigned a parcel of land, and the balance of the tribe's territories were sold to the predecessor of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].  Meanwhile, the U.S. government established a trading post near Stranger Creek until the tribe was moved to the [[Indian Territory]] in 1867.  Located beside the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, the store became the first school in the community.\n\n===Union Pacific Railroad===\nIn September 1863, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] began building the main line westward across the [[Great Plains]] from [[Kansas City, Kansas]], to [[Denver, Colorado]]. This was the long-line railroad in Kansas for 2\u20133 years.  The first {{convert|40|mi|km}} was open in 1864 from Wyandotte (now a suburb of Kansas City) to Lawrence. William A. Harris moved to Kansas in 1865 employed as a civil engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1868 it became the [[Kansas Pacific Railway|Kansas Pacific Railroad]] because it was easier to refer to.\n\n===Name change===\nThe original community of '''Journeycake''' was [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902075740/http://ead.diglib.ku.edu/xml/ksrl.kc.searlad.html officially platted] as '''Stranger''' on July 11, 1867, and recorded at the Leavenworth County Courthouse. When the name Stranger became a problem for the [http://www.kshs.org/genealogists/places/postoffices.htm Postal Service] who confused Stranger with a nearby community also named Stranger (referred to as \"Big\" Stranger), it was renamed '''Linwood''' on December 20, 1877.  Legend has it that one day when the citizens were cutting wood for the church, [[William W. Loring#Antebellum years|Colonel Loring]] suggested they change the name to Linwood, because of the many [[Tilia americana|linden]] trees that grew in the area.  But, according to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902075740/http://ead.diglib.ku.edu/xml/ksrl.kc.searlad.html#IDA0G0P Kansas Historical Collections], the community of Stranger had its name changed to Linwood by Senator William A. Harris because of his great appreciation for the linwood trees that were abundant in the vicinity of Stranger Creek.\n\n===Senator Harris===\n[[William A. Harris (Kansas)|William A. Harris]] moved to Kansas in 1865 employed as a civil engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad until 1868, when he moved to Lawrence, Kansas. He was appointed agent for the railroad companies in the sale of the Delaware Reservation and other lands.  In 1884 Harris became a prominent citizen of Linwood, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits and stock raising.  He bought several {{convert|100|acre|m2}} of land just west of Linwood that bordered the city.  On a high hill within sight of city he built a modest two story mansion with fifteen rooms, the ''Harris House''. Harris was elected as a Democratic Congressman to the Fifty-third Congress (1893\u20131895) and as a [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] to the U.S. Senate (1897\u20131903). He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Kansas in 1906. Harris died in 1909, and is buried in [[Lawrence, Kansas]].\n\n===Relocation===\nMuch of Linwood\u2019s commerce came from the saw mills on the river, so the city had grown very near the banks of the [[Kansas River]] (affectionately known as the \u201cKaw\u201d River) that flows eastward to the Missouri.  After the 1903 flood damaged and endangered much of the city, it was relocated about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) north to its present location out of \u201cthe bottoms\u201d (as they are still known today) near the river.\n\n===21st century===\nPresent day Linwood is a small city which is accessed solely off of {{jct|state=KS|KS|32}}, as the Golden Road bridge over Stranger Creek collapsed in the early 2000s and has never been rebuilt.  Currently the city has less than 400 people.  In just the last couple of years numerous new homes have been built drawing new families.  Linwood has several businesses including a gas station, tavern, landscaping company and salsa plant. Linwood is home to one of the Basehor-Linwood Elementary Schools, while the Basehor-Linwood Middle and High Schools are located in [[Basehor, Kansas|Basehor]].\n\n===2019 tornado===\n{{See also|Tornado outbreak sequence of May 2019}}\nOn May 28, 2019 an EF4 [[tornado]] with Doppler windspeed measurements of over 187&nbsp;mph struck the outlying areas of the city and severely damaged homes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massive tornado rips through Linwood, Kansas, destroying homes and keeping KC on edge |url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/weather-news/article230922503.html |website=[[The Kansas City Star]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529063241/https://www.kansascity.com/news/weather-news/article230922503.html |archivedate=May 29, 2019 |date=May 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> [https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/06/06/storm-chaser-reed-timmer-successfully-shot-rocket-into-wedge-tornado-data-he-says-is-incredible/?noredirect=on] At least 13 injuries have been reported due to the storm.

Linn County's economy relies heavily on the lumber and wood products industry; in 1990, this industry accounted for 40% of the county's manufacturing jobs. The climate and soil conditions provide one of Oregon's most diversified agriculture areas, allowing a wide variety of specialty crops such as common and perennial ryegrass. Linn County is also home to the only [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] mine in the United States, and the production of manufactured and motor homes.\n\n==Natural history==\nA variety of flora and fauna occur in Linn County. Fauna include mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles.

Linn County's economy relies heavily on the lumber and wood products industry; in 1990, this industry accounted for 40% of the county's manufacturing jobs. The climate and soil conditions provide one of Oregon's most diversified agriculture areas, allowing a wide variety of specialty crops such as common and perennial ryegrass. Linn County is also home to the only [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] mine in the United States, and the production of manufactured and motor homes.\n\n==Natural history==\nA variety of flora and fauna occur in Linn County. Fauna include mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. Trees include a variety of oaks and conifers as well as other species such as ''[[Salix sessilifolia]]''.<ref>Charles Vancouver Piper and Rolla Kent Beattie, ''Flora of the Northwest Coast''</ref> The [[Rough-skinned Newt]] is a common amphibian occurring in the oak woodlands of the county.<ref>C.
