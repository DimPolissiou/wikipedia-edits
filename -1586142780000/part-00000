The only sound source was a number of [[effects unit]]s which he had set up to operate in a [[feedback loop]] - there was no original input signal being processed, simply the feedback hum generated by plugging the original chain of pedals back into itself. However, when Stapleton went near the pedals he found the sound changed in accordance with his proximity to the various pedals and units. Stapleton told author [[David Keenan]] (in the book ''England's Hidden Reverse'') that he had created the album by gently moving his fingers above the various units to create the slow, subtle changes in the sound. As this shouldn't happen, Stapleton has put the album down to an electrical fault of some sort in the studio. This was acknowledged on a later reissue with the credit \"''our thanks to Electricity for making this recording possible''\". He remains proud of the album, describing it to Keenan as \"fucking brilliant\". The album title refers to Stapleton and Rogerson's daughter Lilith who was born that year. Lilith would go on to contribute both artwork and vocals to releases by NWW and [[Current 93]].\n\nDespite being a 3-LP set in an embossed box, the album was one of the most successful NWW releases; Stapleton advised Keenan that the sales of the album funded his and his family's move to Cooloorta in [[County Clare]], [[Ireland]] in 1989. Originally issued on the short-lived [[Idle Hole]] label (founded by Stapleton and Rogerson with a government [[Enterprise Allowance Scheme]] grant), a small overrun of the third disc was issued separately as ''Soliloquy For Lilith Parts 5 & 6'' [http://brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/ihm1c.php?site=nww]. The album was reissued as a double CD on [[United Dairies (record label)|United Dairies]] via [[World Serpent Distribution|World Serpent]] in 1993 and then again in 2003, this time as a 3 disc set mirroring the box packaging of the original with the third disc containing two remixes of the original material by Stapleton and Colin Potter. When World Serpent Distribution went out of business in 2004, the 3-CD set was reissued by United Jnana (a hook-up between Stapleton's United Dairies and Mark Logan's [[Jnana Records]]), this present edition being identical in all but catalogue number from its predecessor.\n\nThe album's original six selections follow a strict convention: each is between 17 and 18 minutes in length.  Later editions featured two bonus selections.  Of these, the first (VII) was a remix of the original album's third selection, with additional effects and using the latter as a backing track, each running for the same length.  The later bonus track runs for over 20 minutes.\n\nReleases of the album commonly feature depictions of the [[Burney Relief]] in the album artwork;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nurse-With-Wound-Soliloquy-For-Lilith/release/429811|title=Soliloquy for Lilith (1)|work=Discogs.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nurse-With-Wound-Soliloquy-For-Lilith/release/7223050|title=Soliloquy for Lilith (2)|work=Discogs.com}}</ref> the significance of this is that the central figure depicted has been identified with [[Lilith]].<ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/658/the-queen-of-the-night/ |title=The Queen of the Night |author=Joshua J.

Forbes,''' 2013-present]\n\n==Overview==\nDYS operates more than 80 total residential ''and'' community programs across Massachusetts, including:\n*63 residential programs, ranging from staff secure group homes to small highly-secure locked units, and\n*22 district offices to provide supervision and services to youth who live in the community (residing with a parent, guardian, foster parent or residing in an independent living program).\n\n==Continuum of care==\nThe Department has a dual mandate of rehabilitation and public safety. In keeping with these two objectives, DYS has a system of classifying committed youth according to their offense patterns and other pertinent history. This classification process informs a service delivery plan that places youths in appropriate levels of care according to our Continuum of Care.<ref>http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/consumer/family-services/youth-services/juvenile-justice/services-available-for-clients-continuum-of-care.html</ref> The Continuum of Care includes:\n\n*Bail Detention\n*Assessment\n*Residential Treatment (Hardware Secure or Staff Secure)\n*Community Phase/ Day Reporting\n*Discharge\n\nThe Client Services unit oversees the delivery of a host of clinical and support services. Using an integrated approach, programs address the risk to re-offend by providing a variety of services, including the following:\n\n*Clinical Services\n*Medical and Health Services\n*Substance Abuse Services\n*Assessment and Classification\n*Revocation (the process by which a youth in the community is returned to residential programming)\n\n==DYS treatment programs and services==\n\n===Clinical Services===\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (DYS) provides clinical and rehabilitative services to its detained clients and committed youth based on the Comprehensive Strategy outlined by the Office of Juvenile Delinquency and Prevention.\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):  This system of psychotherapy was adopted to fit the needs of the juvenile justice population by teaching youth skills from DBT skill modules (e.g., skills in emotion regulation and/or interpersonal effectiveness modules) that are basic fundamental skills underlying positive pro-social development.  DBT is used as a behavior management tool in DYS to increase skill development in youth, improve relationships between youth and staff and create a positive pro-social learning environment. While DBT is not the only clinical treatment offered in DYS, it does serve as the structure for therapeutic work and for the behavior management system across all DYS programs in the Commonwealth.\n\nPositive Youth Development:  The Positive Youth Development model focuses on the positive attributes young people need to make a more successful transition to adulthood. The Positive Youth Development framework revolves around the cognitive, emotional and social needs of a young person. A strong focus on three aspects of positive youth development will provide effective guidance for the goals and plans for each youth's successful re-entry into the community. These include a focus on each youth's strengths and personal assets, providing opportunities for youth empowerment and leadership, and cultivating community partnerships and supports that assist youth in moving successfully through the continuum of care.\n\nClinical Assessments: Upon commitment to DYS, youth are given a comprehensive assessment conducted by licensed mental health clinicians, licensed teachers and medical and psychiatric staff.

In keeping with these two objectives, DYS has a system of classifying committed youth according to their offense patterns and other pertinent history. This classification process informs a service delivery plan that places youths in appropriate levels of care according to our Continuum of Care.<ref>http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/consumer/family-services/youth-services/juvenile-justice/services-available-for-clients-continuum-of-care.html</ref> The Continuum of Care includes:\n\n*Bail Detention\n*Assessment\n*Residential Treatment (Hardware Secure or Staff Secure)\n*Community Phase/ Day Reporting\n*Discharge\n\nThe Client Services unit oversees the delivery of a host of clinical and support services. Using an integrated approach, programs address the risk to re-offend by providing a variety of services, including the following:\n\n*Clinical Services\n*Medical and Health Services\n*Substance Abuse Services\n*Assessment and Classification\n*Revocation (the process by which a youth in the community is returned to residential programming)\n\n==DYS treatment programs and services==\n\n===Clinical Services===\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (DYS) provides clinical and rehabilitative services to its detained clients and committed youth based on the Comprehensive Strategy outlined by the Office of Juvenile Delinquency and Prevention.\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):  This system of psychotherapy was adopted to fit the needs of the juvenile justice population by teaching youth skills from DBT skill modules (e.g., skills in emotion regulation and/or interpersonal effectiveness modules) that are basic fundamental skills underlying positive pro-social development.  DBT is used as a behavior management tool in DYS to increase skill development in youth, improve relationships between youth and staff and create a positive pro-social learning environment. While DBT is not the only clinical treatment offered in DYS, it does serve as the structure for therapeutic work and for the behavior management system across all DYS programs in the Commonwealth.\n\nPositive Youth Development:  The Positive Youth Development model focuses on the positive attributes young people need to make a more successful transition to adulthood. The Positive Youth Development framework revolves around the cognitive, emotional and social needs of a young person. A strong focus on three aspects of positive youth development will provide effective guidance for the goals and plans for each youth's successful re-entry into the community. These include a focus on each youth's strengths and personal assets, providing opportunities for youth empowerment and leadership, and cultivating community partnerships and supports that assist youth in moving successfully through the continuum of care.\n\nClinical Assessments: Upon commitment to DYS, youth are given a comprehensive assessment conducted by licensed mental health clinicians, licensed teachers and medical and psychiatric staff. Licensed mental health clinicians provide psychosocial interviews, administer psychological testing, and review prior records that include educational, medical and criminal histories. Screening instruments are used to determine if the youth needs to be referred for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation to aid in treatment planning. Following the assessment phase, an individual treatment and service plan is developed for the youth that focuses interventions on the youth's strengths and risks factors for re-offending.\n\nResidential Support: The clinical focus in the residential treatment programs is to rehabilitate the youth by preparing him or her to rejoin their community by teaching pro-social attitudes and behaviors. This is done through weekly individual counseling and participation in required group therapies which include: Dialectical Behavior Therapy (twice weekly); substance abuse groups (either prevention or substance abuse treatment groups); and violent offender/sex offender groups which focus on relapse prevention planning.  Depending on the individual service needs of the youth, other treatments may be incorporated such as: family counseling, trauma work, teen dating violence prevention, and parenting skills classes for DYS youth with children of their own.\n\nCommunity Continuum: As the DYS youth transitions from residential treatment to the community, the casework team (which includes licensed mental health clinicians) ensures that the youth and family are enrolled in community-based services to support the gains the youth has made in treatment.\n\n(http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/consumer/family-services/youth-services/juvenile-justice/department-of-youth-services-clinical-services.html)\n\n==Facilities==\nJuveniles charged with murder and juveniles with adult sentences are held within a DYS-operated facility inside the [[Plymouth County Correctional Facility]],<ref>\"[http://www.mass.gov/Eeohhs2/docs/dys/public_info_packet.pdf Department of Youth Services Public Information Packet].\" Massachusetts Department of Youth Services. 3 (3/14). 2010.

Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c is situated {{convert|250|km}} west of [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. It takes about six hours to travel by bus from Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n==History==\nThe site of Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c was long in history a territory of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] (Vietnamese: V\u01b0\u01a1ng qu\u1ed1c Ph\u00f9 Nam). The territory became Vietnam's around the 17th century. The town is near the picturesque Sam Mountain where the Sam Mountain Lady (Vietnamese: [[B\u00e0 Ch\u00faa X\u1ee9]] N\u00fai Sam) is worshipped. The Sam Mount Lady Ceremony is held every April of [[lunar calendar]] (May) every year.\n\n\"Mort Chrouk\" (Khmer:\u1798\u17b6\u178f\u17cb\u1787\u17d2\u179a\u17bc\u1780) was the Cambodian name Vietnamized in Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c.\n\nIn 1957 the town was the site of the [[Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c massacre]].<ref>{{cite news |ref=harv|title= Supernatural Awards said promised Viet Nam people for following red dogma|authorlink= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_0AaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4227,5450444&dq=17+chau+doc&hl=en|format= |newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]]|location=Hendersonville, North Carolina|isbn= |issn= |oclc= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=August 17, 1957|at= |accessdate= May 26, 2010 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Cham people|Cham]] and [[Khmer people|Khmer]] live together in harmony. The three main religions in this region are [[Mahayana Buddhism]] (Kinh/Vietnamese); [[Theravada]] Buddhism (Khmer), and [[Sunni Islam]] ([[Chams]]). The total population is around 120,000 [http://www.thixachaudoc.com/] with a vast majority of Kinh (Viet).\n\nAs of 2003 the district had a population of 112,155.<ref name=\"Statoids\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/yvn.html|title=Districts of Vietnam|publisher=Statoids|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> The district covers an area of {{convert|100|km2}}.<ref name=\"Statoids\"/>\n\nIn July 2013, the city had a population of 157,298.\n\n==Economy==\n\nCh\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c is famous for its variety of [[fish sauce]]s (''n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm'') and mainly \"m\u1eafm tai\", a kind of anchovy. The local economy is based on culture of basa [[catfish]] export and on tourism. The town is a busy trading center due to its border position with [[Tak\u00e9o Province|Cambodia]].\n\n==Landmarks==\nThe [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc \u0110i\u1ec1n Temple]] is located in Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c. It is an official historic monument of Vietnam. The Victoria Hotel is the only notable hotel in the area. There are also many hotels in the center near the main market area, where you can get good value for money accommodation. There are other hotels that are situated near Nui Sam. There are a couple of new hotels on the road to Sam mountain. A worthwhile option to consider is a night (or two) on one of the floating hotels (there are 2, one reachable via footbridge, the other via boat).\n\nSam Mountain, being the highest mountain in Mekong

Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c is situated {{convert|250|km}} west of [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. It takes about six hours to travel by bus from Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n==History==\nThe site of Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c was long in history a territory of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] (Vietnamese: V\u01b0\u01a1ng qu\u1ed1c Ph\u00f9 Nam). The territory became Vietnam's around the 17th century. The town is near the picturesque Sam Mountain where the Sam Mountain Lady (Vietnamese: [[B\u00e0 Ch\u00faa X\u1ee9]] N\u00fai Sam) is worshipped. The Sam Mount Lady Ceremony is held every April of [[lunar calendar]] (May) every year.\n\n\"Mort Chrouk\" (Khmer:\u1798\u17b6\u178f\u17cb\u1787\u17d2\u179a\u17bc\u1780) was the Cambodian name Vietnamized in Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c.\n\nIn 1957 the town was the site of the [[Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c massacre]].<ref>{{cite news |ref=harv|title= Supernatural Awards said promised Viet Nam people for following red dogma|authorlink= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_0AaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4227,5450444&dq=17+chau+doc&hl=en|format= |newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]]|location=Hendersonville, North Carolina|isbn= |issn= |oclc= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=August 17, 1957|at= |accessdate= May 26, 2010 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Cham people|Cham]] and [[Khmer people|Khmer]] live together in harmony. The three main religions in this region are [[Mahayana Buddhism]] (Kinh/Vietnamese); [[Theravada]] Buddhism (Khmer), and [[Sunni Islam]] ([[Chams]]). The total population is around 120,000 [http://www.thixachaudoc.com/] with a vast majority of Kinh (Viet).\n\nAs of 2003 the district had a population of 112,155.<ref name=\"Statoids\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/yvn.html|title=Districts of Vietnam|publisher=Statoids|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> The district covers an area of {{convert|100|km2}}.<ref name=\"Statoids\"/>\n\nIn July 2013, the city had a population of 157,298.\n\n==Economy==\n\nCh\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c is famous for its variety of [[fish sauce]]s (''n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm'') and mainly \"m\u1eafm tai\", a kind of anchovy. The local economy is based on culture of basa [[catfish]] export and on tourism. The town is a busy trading center due to its border position with [[Tak\u00e9o Province|Cambodia]].\n\n==Landmarks==\nThe [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc \u0110i\u1ec1n Temple]] is located in Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c. It is an official historic monument of Vietnam. The Victoria Hotel is the only notable hotel in the area. There are also many hotels in the center near the main market area, where you can get good value for money accommodation. There are other hotels that are situated near Nui Sam. There are a couple of new hotels on the road to Sam mountain. A worthwhile option to consider is a night (or two) on one of the floating hotels (there are 2, one reachable via footbridge, the other via boat).\n\nSam Mountain, being the highest mountain in Mekong

Poncins was a French aristocratic [[count]] in his late thirties. Bored with the business world, Poncins became a freelance journalist so that he could travel, selling accounts of his experiences to newspapers and magazines.\n:Curiosity drew him to exotic areas throughout the world \u2014 Tahiti, New Caledonia, and, eventually (in 1938), the Canadian Arctic. What he discovered there, he believed, was a nobler way of life and, perhaps, a means of saving a fallen Western world. Initially, the lure of the Arctic for Poncins stemmed from a general disillusionment with civilization. [The trip resulted in] his popular Arctic travel narrative, ''Kabloona''.... Although Poncins was French, the text was first published in the United States in English in 1941; the French edition followed six years later. In many ways, the book was primarily an American phenomenon. Upon his return from the Arctic, Poncins submitted well over a thousand pages of notes in French and English to an editor at [[Time-Life Books]]. The editor shaped the text into its published form, and Time-Life successfully marketed it to large American audiences. The French edition of ''Kabloona'' is a translation of the English Time-Life edition.<ref name=huhndorf>Shari Michelle Huhndorf, ''Going Native: Indians in the American Cultural Imagination'' (Cornell University Press, 2001: {{ISBN|0-8014-8695-5}},), p. 116.</ref>\n\nIn ''Kabloona'', Poncins explores [[Inuit culture]] and the Inuit world view, leaving the reader with a deeper understanding of such things as wife-swapping, living in an [[igloo]] at {{convert|-40|C|abbr=on}}, why and how Inuit have feasts lasting 20 hours at a stretch, their concepts of time and family life, their perspectives on Europeans and European food and gear, the [[Inuit diet]], hunting techniques, wildlife, [[nomad]]ic life, dogs, [[Climate of the Arctic|weather]], clothing, communal sharing of goods, and notions of private property.<ref name=Canby/>\n\nPoncins was not a scientist and did not study the Inuit from a scientific perspective.<ref name=Canby/> Rather, he provides his own stylized personal points of view and descriptions of Inuit life.<ref name=Canby/> In the book, he is initially disparaging of the Inuit way of life, seeing it as primitive and often using the description \"[[Caveman|cave man]]\". Indeed, a clear theme of [[Supremacism|racial superiority]], described in terms of innate intelligence and physical appearances, and cultural superiority in terms of morals and ethics pervades the first part of his work. As the book progresses and his hardships in the harsh [[Arctic]] environment take their toll (at one point Poncins runs {{convert|1400|mi|abbr=on}} behind a [[dog sled]]), he begins to find a new appreciation for the Inuit way of life, for their intelligence and resourcefulness, and experiences a spiritual awakening, ultimately reaching a point where he discovers that he himself has become so well adapted to the Inuit way of life that he is no longer a \"kabloona\" and has become one of them.\n\n==The term \"kabloona\"==\nThe title ''[[wiktionary:kabloona|Kabloona]]'' is a transcription of the [[Inuktitut]] word nowadays spelled ''[[wiktionary:qallunaaq|qallunaaq]]'' (''qablunaaq'' in [[Inuinnaqtun]]). It is a term originally used to describe white Europeans - a reference to their ''qalluit'', the bushy eyebrows that the Inuit saw as the distinctive feature of Europeans. Nowadays, its use is a bit vaguer. It can mean [[English Canadian|Anglo-Canadian]] in contrast to other ethnolinguistic groups like the ''uiviimiut'' - [[French Canadian]]s. Alternately, it is used to describe non-Inuit Canadian society, or even [[Western world|occidental society]] as a whole. In the 1940s, however, Inuit made fewer of those distinctions, and the term could easily apply to Poncins despite his French ethnicity.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 1941 film ''Never Give A Sucker An Even Break'',<ref>\"Dialog Continuity for ''Never Give A Sucker An Even Break'' (c) 1941 Universal Pictures Corp. , reproduced in ''Three Films of W.C.

Poncins was a French aristocratic [[count]] in his late thirties. Bored with the business world, Poncins became a freelance journalist so that he could travel, selling accounts of his experiences to newspapers and magazines.\n:Curiosity drew him to exotic areas throughout the world \u2014 Tahiti, New Caledonia, and, eventually (in 1938), the Canadian Arctic. What he discovered there, he believed, was a nobler way of life and, perhaps, a means of saving a fallen Western world. Initially, the lure of the Arctic for Poncins stemmed from a general disillusionment with civilization. [The trip resulted in] his popular Arctic travel narrative, ''Kabloona''.... Although Poncins was French, the text was first published in the United States in English in 1941; the French edition followed six years later. In many ways, the book was primarily an American phenomenon. Upon his return from the Arctic, Poncins submitted well over a thousand pages of notes in French and English to an editor at [[Time-Life Books]]. The editor shaped the text into its published form, and Time-Life successfully marketed it to large American audiences. The French edition of ''Kabloona'' is a translation of the English Time-Life edition.<ref name=huhndorf>Shari Michelle Huhndorf, ''Going Native: Indians in the American Cultural Imagination'' (Cornell University Press, 2001: {{ISBN|0-8014-8695-5}},), p. 116.</ref>\n\nIn ''Kabloona'', Poncins explores [[Inuit culture]] and the Inuit world view, leaving the reader with a deeper understanding of such things as wife-swapping, living in an [[igloo]] at {{convert|-40|C|abbr=on}}, why and how Inuit have feasts lasting 20 hours at a stretch, their concepts of time and family life, their perspectives on Europeans and European food and gear, the [[Inuit diet]], hunting techniques, wildlife, [[nomad]]ic life, dogs, [[Climate of the Arctic|weather]], clothing, communal sharing of goods, and notions of private property.<ref name=Canby/>\n\nPoncins was not a scientist and did not study the Inuit from a scientific perspective.<ref name=Canby/> Rather, he provides his own stylized personal points of view and descriptions of Inuit life.<ref name=Canby/> In the book, he is initially disparaging of the Inuit way of life, seeing it as primitive and often using the description \"[[Caveman|cave man]]\". Indeed, a clear theme of [[Supremacism|racial superiority]], described in terms of innate intelligence and physical appearances, and cultural superiority in terms of morals and ethics pervades the first part of his work. As the book progresses and his hardships in the harsh [[Arctic]] environment take their toll (at one point Poncins runs {{convert|1400|mi|abbr=on}} behind a [[dog sled]]), he begins to find a new appreciation for the Inuit way of life, for their intelligence and resourcefulness, and experiences a spiritual awakening, ultimately reaching a point where he discovers that he himself has become so well adapted to the Inuit way of life that he is no longer a \"kabloona\" and has become one of them.\n\n==The term \"kabloona\"==\nThe title ''[[wiktionary:kabloona|Kabloona]]'' is a transcription of the [[Inuktitut]] word nowadays spelled ''[[wiktionary:qallunaaq|qallunaaq]]'' (''qablunaaq'' in [[Inuinnaqtun]]). It is a term originally used to describe white Europeans - a reference to their ''qalluit'', the bushy eyebrows that the Inuit saw as the distinctive feature of Europeans. Nowadays, its use is a bit vaguer. It can mean [[English Canadian|Anglo-Canadian]] in contrast to other ethnolinguistic groups like the ''uiviimiut'' - [[French Canadian]]s. Alternately, it is used to describe non-Inuit Canadian society, or even [[Western world|occidental society]] as a whole. In the 1940s, however, Inuit made fewer of those distinctions, and the term could easily apply to Poncins despite his French ethnicity.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 1941 film ''Never Give A Sucker An Even Break'',<ref>\"Dialog Continuity for ''Never Give A Sucker An Even Break'' (c) 1941 Universal Pictures Corp. , reproduced in ''Three Films of W.C.

These incidents led the U.S. government to develop a full-time counter-terrorism unit.\n\nKey military and government figures had already been briefed on this type of unit in the early 1960s. [[Charles Alvin Beckwith|Charlie Beckwith]], a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] (Green Berets) officer and [[Vietnam War veteran]], served as an [[exchange officer]] with the [[British Army]]'s 22nd [[Special Air Service]] Regiment during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. On his return, Beckwith presented a detailed report highlighting the U.S. Army's vulnerability in not having an SAS-type unit. U.S. Army Special Forces in that period focused on [[unconventional warfare]], but Beckwith recognized the need for \"not only teachers, but doers.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Charlie |title=Delta Force: The Army's Elite Counterterrorist Unit |publisher=[[Avon Books]] |year=2000 |edition=Paperback |origyear=1983 |isbn=978-0-380-80939-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/deltaforcearmyse00beck/page/39 39] |url=https://archive.org/details/deltaforcearmyse00beck|url-access=registration }}\n</ref> He envisioned highly adaptable and completely autonomous small teams with a broad array of special skills for [[direct action (military)|direct action]] and [[counter-terrorism]] missions. He briefed both military and government figures, who were resistant to creating a new unit outside of Special Forces or changing existing methods.\n\nFinally, in the mid-1970s, as the threat of terrorism grew, [[The Pentagon]] and Army senior leadership appointed Beckwith to form the unit.<ref>Beckwith 2000</ref> Beckwith estimated that it would take 24 months to get his new unit mission-ready. Beckwith's estimate came from a conversation he had had earlier with Brigadier [[John Watts (British Army officer)|John Watts]] while in England in 1976. Watts had made it clear to Beckwith that it would take eighteen months to build a [[squadron (army)|squadron]], but advised him to tell the Army leadership that it would take two years, and not to \"let anyone talk (him) out of this.\" To justify why it would take two years to build Delta, Beckwith and his staff drafted what they dubbed the \"Robert Redford Paper.\" In it Delta outlined its necessities and historical precedents for a four-phase selection/assessment process.<ref>Beckwith 2000, pp. 142\u201343</ref>\n\nDelta Force was then established on 19 November 1977, by Beckwith and Colonel Thomas Henry.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goolsby|first1=Denise|title=Palm Springs man was Army Delta Force co-creator|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2016/07/14/palm-springs-col-tom-henry-us-army-delta-force-army-rangers/86963120/|work=[[The Desert Sun]] |location=Palm Springs, Cal. |date=14 July 2016}}</ref> In the meantime, Colonel Bob \"Black Gloves\" Mountel of the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th Special Forces Group]] was tasked with creating a unit \"to breach the short-term gap\" that existed until Delta was ready, dubbed [[Blue Light (counter-terrorist subunit)|Blue Light]].<ref>Beckwith 2000, p. 131</ref> The initial members of the unit were screened from volunteers and put through a specialized selection process in early 1978, involving a series of land navigation problems in mountainous terrain while carrying increasing weight. The purpose was to test candidates' endurance, stamina, willingness to endure and mental resolve. The first training course lasted from April to September 1978. Delta Force was certified as fully mission capable in Fall 1979 right before the [[Iran hostage crisis]].\n\nOn 4 November 1979, 53 American diplomats and citizens were taken captive and held in the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]], Iran. Delta Force was tasked to plan and execute [[Operation Eagle Claw]] and recover the hostages from the embassy by force on the nights of 24 and 25 April in 1980. The operation was aborted due to problems with helicopter failures. The review commission that examined the failure found 23 problems with the operation, among them unexpected weather encountered by the aircraft, command-and-control problems between the multi-service component commanders, a collision between a helicopter and a ground-refueling tanker aircraft, and mechanical problems that reduced the number of available helicopters from eight to five (one fewer than the minimum desired) before the mission contingent could leave the trans-loading/refueling site.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabriel |first=Richard A. |year=1985 |title=Military Incompetence: Why the American Military Doesn't Win |url=https://archive.org/details/militaryincompet00gabr |url-access=registration |publisher=Hill and Wang |isbn=978-0-374-52137-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/militaryincompet00gabr/page/106 106]\u201316}} Overall, the [[Holloway Commission]] blamed the ad hoc nature of the task force and an excessive degree of security, both of which intensified command-and-control problems.</ref>\n\nAfter the failed operation, the U.S. government realized more changes needed to be made. The [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)]], also known as the ''\"Night Stalkers\"'', was created for special operations requiring air support. The Navy's [[SEAL Team Six]], an earlier incarnation of the current [[SEAL Team Six|Naval Special Warfare Development Group]], was created for maritime counter-terrorism operations. The [[Joint Special Operations Command]] was created for command and control of the various counter-terrorism units of the U.S. military.\n\n=== Operations and clandestine operations ===\n{{Main|List of operations conducted by Delta Force}}\n[[File:Delta-force-scud-hunters.jpg|thumb|Delta Force soldiers, pictured deep behind Iraqi lines during the 1991 Gulf War]]\n\nThe majority of the operations assigned to Delta are classified and may never be known to the public. However, details of some operations have become public knowledge. For service during [[Operation Urgent Fury]], Delta was awarded the [[Joint Meritorious Unit Award]]. The unit was awarded the [[Valorous Unit Award]] for extraordinary heroism during the Modelo Prison Hostage Rescue Mission and the capture of [[Manuel Noriega]] in December 1989 during [[Operation Just Cause]] in [[Panama]]. 1st SFOD-D operators from C Squadron were also involved in [[Operation Gothic Serpent]] in Somalia. During [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], the 1st SFOD-D was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] for combat operations in Afghanistan from 4 October 2001 to 15 March 2002 and Iraq from 19 March 2003 to 13 December 2003. On 26 October 2019, Delta operators and Army Rangers raided ISIS leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi|Abu Bakr al\u2013Baghdadi's]] compound, leading to his death.\n\n== Organization and structure ==\nThe unit is under the organization of the [[United States Army Special Operations Command|U.S. Army Special Operations Command]] (USASOC), but is controlled by the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] (JSOC). Command of 1st SFOD-D is a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel's]] [[billet]]. Virtually all information about the unit is highly classified and details about specific missions or operations generally are not available publicly. The unit is headquartered at [[Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]].\n\nDelta Force's structure is similar to the British 22nd SAS Regiment, the unit that inspired Delta's formation. In ''Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda'', ''[[Army Times]]'' staff writer [[Sean Naylor]] describes Delta as having, at the time, nearly 1,000 soldiers, of which approximately 250 to 300 are trained to conduct direct action and hostage rescue operations.

Haney wrote that the selection course began with standard tests including push-ups, sit-ups, and a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} run, an inverted crawl and a 100-meter swim fully dressed. The candidates are then put through a series of land navigation courses to include an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} all-night land navigation course while carrying a {{convert|40|lb|kg|adj=on}} rucksack. The rucksack's weight and the distance of the courses are increased and the time standards to complete the task are shortened with every march. The physical testing ended with a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} march with a {{convert|45|lb|kg|adj=on}} rucksack over rough terrain that had to be completed in an unknown amount of time. Haney wrote that only the senior officer and NCO in charge of selection are allowed to see the set time limits, but all assessment and selection tasks and conditions were set by Delta training cadre.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite book |last=Haney |first=Eric L. |authorlink=Eric Haney |title=[[Inside Delta Force]] |publisher=[[Delacorte Press]] |year=2002 |location=New York |page=325 |isbn=978-0-385-33603-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Beckwith\">{{cite book |title=Delta Force |url=https://archive.org/details/deltaforce00beck |url-access=registration |last=Beckwith |first=Charlie A. |year=1983 |location=San Diego |publisher=Harcourt |isbn=978-0-15-124657-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe mental portion of the testing began with numerous psychological exams. The men then went in front of a board of Delta instructors, unit psychologists, and the Delta commander, who each ask the candidate a barrage of questions and then dissect every response and mannerism of the candidate with the purpose of mentally exhausting the candidate. The unit commander then approaches the candidate and tells him if he has been selected. If an individual is selected for Delta, he undergoes an intense 6-month Operator Training Course (OTC), to learn [[counter-terrorism]] and [[counterintelligence]] techniques, in which the individual maintains little contact with friends and family for the duration. Training includes firearm accuracy and various other weapons training.<ref name=\"Haney\" />\n\nIn an interview, former Delta operator Paul Howe talked about the high attrition rate of the Delta selection course. He said that out of his two classes of 120 applicants each, 12 to 14 completed the selection.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59fL6ej_B-I |title=Delta Force Tryouts |via=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=18 February 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"BHD\"/>\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s highly secretive [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) and more specifically its elite [[Special Activities Division|Special Operations Group]] (SOG), often works with&nbsp;\u2013 and recruits&nbsp;\u2013 operators from Delta Force. <ref>{{cite news|last=Waller |first=Douglas |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1004145-1,00.html |title=The CIA's Secret Army: The CIA's Secret Army |publisher=Time |date=2003-02-03 |accessdate=2015-12-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Training ===\nAccording to [[Eric Haney]], the unit's '''Operator Training Course''' is approximately six months long. While the course is constantly changing, the skills taught broadly include the following:\n* Marksmanship\n** The trainees shoot without aiming at stationary targets at close range until they gain almost complete accuracy, then progress to moving targets.\n** Once these shooting skills are perfected, trainees move to a shooting house and clear rooms of \"enemy\" targets \u2013 first one only, then two at a time, three, and finally four. When all can demonstrate sufficient skill, \"hostages\" are added to the mix.\n* Demolitions and Breaching\n** Trainees learn how to pick many different locks, including those on cars and safes.\n** Advanced demolition, and bomb making using common materials.\n* Combined skills. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], and other agencies were used to advise the training of this portion of OTC.\n** The new Delta operators use demolition and marksmanship at the shoot house and other training facilities to train for hostage and counter-terrorist operations with assault and sniper troops working together. They practice terrorist or hostage situations in buildings, aircraft, and other settings.\n** All trainees learn how to set sniper positions around a building containing hostages. They learn the proper ways to set up a [[Tactical Operations Center|TOC]] and communicate in an organized manner. Although Delta has specialized sniper [[troops]], all members go through this training.\n** The students then go back to the shoot house and the \"hostages\" are replaced with other students and Delta Force members. Live ammunition is known to have been used in these exercises, to test the students, and build trust between one another.\n* [[Tradecraft]]. During the first OTCs and creation of Delta, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] personnel were used to teach this portion.\n** Students learn different espionage-related skills, such as [[dead drop]]s, [[Brush pass|brief encounters]], pickups, load and unload signals, danger and safe signals, surveillance and counter-surveillance.\n* Executive Protection. During the first OTCs and creation of Delta, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s [[Diplomatic Security Service]] and the [[United States Secret Service]] advised Delta.\n** Students take an advanced driving course learning how to use a vehicle or many vehicles as defensive and offensive weapons.\n** They then learn techniques for VIP and diplomatic protection developed by the Secret Service and DSS.\n* Culmination Exercise\n** A final test requires the students to apply and dynamically adapt all of the skills that they have learned.\n\n== Uniform ==\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] tightly controls information about Delta Force and refuses to comment publicly on the highly secretive unit and its activities; usually unless the unit is part of a major operation or a unit member has been killed. Delta operators are granted an enormous amount of flexibility and autonomy during military operations overseas. To conceal their identities, soldiers rarely wear a uniform and usually wear civilian clothing both on and off duty.<ref name=\"Haney\" /> When military uniforms are worn, they lack markings, surnames, or branch names.<ref name=\"Haney\" /> Civilian hair styles and [[Facial_hair_in_the_military#United_States|facial hair]] are allowed to enable the members to blend in and avoid recognition as military personnel.<ref name=\"Haney\" /><ref name=\"BHD\">{{cite book |last=Bowden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Bowden |title=Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War |year=1999 |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |location=[[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] |isbn=978-0-87113-738-8}}</ref> Their Navy counterpart [[SEAL Team Six|DEVGRU]] is also granted the same amount of autonomy and flexibility.\n\n== The term ''operator'' ==\n[[File:Code of the Special Forces Operator.jpg|thumb|Example of the \u201cCode of the Special Forces Operator\u201d dated 1959. This example pre-dates DELTA among other units.]]\n\nThe origin of the term \"operator\" in American special operations comes from the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] (aka the Green Berets). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the [[Navy SEALs]] and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the 'Code of the Special Forces Operator' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\". ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'' (V14/N1), pp. 63-64. </ref> \n\nInside the [[USSOCOM|United States Special Operations]] community, an ''operator'' is a Delta Force member who has completed selection and has graduated OTC (Operators Training Course). ''Operator'' was used by Delta Force to distinguish between operational and non-operational personnel assigned to the unit.<ref name=Haney />  Other [[United States special operations forces|special operations forces]] use specific names for their jobs, such as Army ''Rangers'' and Air Force ''[[Pararescuemen]]''. The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known as ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created \"'''Special Warfare Operator'''\" ('''SO''') as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades [[Uniformed_services_pay_grades_of_the_United_States|E-4]] to [[Uniformed_services_pay_grades_of_the_United_States|E-9]]. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]). ''Operator'' is the specific term for operational personnel, and has become a colloquial term for almost all special operations forces in the U.S. military, as well as around the world.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|War}}\n* [[Special Air Service|22nd SAS Regiment]]\n* [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]]\n* [[1st Marine Infantry Paratroopers Regiment]]\n* [[Delta Force in popular culture]]\n* [[List of Delta Force members]]\n* [[List of special forces units]]\n* [[SEAL Team Six]]\n* [[JW GROM]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Boykin, William (2011).

These incidents led the U.S. government to develop a full-time counter-terrorism unit.\n\nKey military and government figures had already been briefed on this type of unit in the early 1960s. [[Charles Alvin Beckwith|Charlie Beckwith]], a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] (Green Berets) officer and [[Vietnam War veteran]], served as an [[exchange officer]] with the [[British Army]]'s 22nd [[Special Air Service]] Regiment during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. On his return, Beckwith presented a detailed report highlighting the U.S. Army's vulnerability in not having an SAS-type unit. U.S. Army Special Forces in that period focused on [[unconventional warfare]], but Beckwith recognized the need for \"not only teachers, but doers.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Charlie |title=Delta Force: The Army's Elite Counterterrorist Unit |publisher=[[Avon Books]] |year=2000 |edition=Paperback |origyear=1983 |isbn=978-0-380-80939-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/deltaforcearmyse00beck/page/39 39] |url=https://archive.org/details/deltaforcearmyse00beck|url-access=registration }}\n</ref> He envisioned highly adaptable and completely autonomous small teams with a broad array of special skills for [[direct action (military)|direct action]] and [[counter-terrorism]] missions. He briefed both military and government figures, who were resistant to creating a new unit outside of Special Forces or changing existing methods.\n\nFinally, in the mid-1970s, as the threat of terrorism grew, [[The Pentagon]] and Army senior leadership appointed Beckwith to form the unit.<ref>Beckwith 2000</ref> Beckwith estimated that it would take 24 months to get his new unit mission-ready. Beckwith's estimate came from a conversation he had had earlier with Brigadier [[John Watts (British Army officer)|John Watts]] while in England in 1976. Watts had made it clear to Beckwith that it would take eighteen months to build a [[squadron (army)|squadron]], but advised him to tell the Army leadership that it would take two years, and not to \"let anyone talk (him) out of this.\" To justify why it would take two years to build Delta, Beckwith and his staff drafted what they dubbed the \"Robert Redford Paper.\" In it Delta outlined its necessities and historical precedents for a four-phase selection/assessment process.<ref>Beckwith 2000, pp. 142\u201343</ref>\n\nDelta Force was then established on 19 November 1977, by Beckwith and Colonel Thomas Henry.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goolsby|first1=Denise|title=Palm Springs man was Army Delta Force co-creator|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2016/07/14/palm-springs-col-tom-henry-us-army-delta-force-army-rangers/86963120/|work=[[The Desert Sun]] |location=Palm Springs, Cal. |date=14 July 2016}}</ref> In the meantime, Colonel Bob \"Black Gloves\" Mountel of the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th Special Forces Group]] was tasked with creating a unit \"to breach the short-term gap\" that existed until Delta was ready, dubbed [[Blue Light (counter-terrorist subunit)|Blue Light]].<ref>Beckwith 2000, p. 131</ref> The initial members of the unit were screened from volunteers and put through a specialized selection process in early 1978, involving a series of land navigation problems in mountainous terrain while carrying increasing weight. The purpose was to test candidates' endurance, stamina, willingness to endure and mental resolve. The first training course lasted from April to September 1978. Delta Force was certified as fully mission capable in Fall 1979 right before the [[Iran hostage crisis]].\n\nOn 4 November 1979, 53 American diplomats and citizens were taken captive and held in the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]], Iran. Delta Force was tasked to plan and execute [[Operation Eagle Claw]] and recover the hostages from the embassy by force on the nights of 24 and 25 April in 1980. The operation was aborted due to problems with helicopter failures. The review commission that examined the failure found 23 problems with the operation, among them unexpected weather encountered by the aircraft, command-and-control problems between the multi-service component commanders, a collision between a helicopter and a ground-refueling tanker aircraft, and mechanical problems that reduced the number of available helicopters from eight to five (one fewer than the minimum desired) before the mission contingent could leave the trans-loading/refueling site.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabriel |first=Richard A. |year=1985 |title=Military Incompetence: Why the American Military Doesn't Win |url=https://archive.org/details/militaryincompet00gabr |url-access=registration |publisher=Hill and Wang |isbn=978-0-374-52137-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/militaryincompet00gabr/page/106 106]\u201316}} Overall, the [[Holloway Commission]] blamed the ad hoc nature of the task force and an excessive degree of security, both of which intensified command-and-control problems.</ref>\n\nAfter the failed operation, the U.S. government realized more changes needed to be made. The [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)]], also known as the ''\"Night Stalkers\"'', was created for special operations requiring air support. The Navy's [[SEAL Team Six]], an earlier incarnation of the current [[SEAL Team Six|Naval Special Warfare Development Group]], was created for maritime counter-terrorism operations. The [[Joint Special Operations Command]] was created for command and control of the various counter-terrorism units of the U.S. military.\n\n=== Operations and clandestine operations ===\n{{Main|List of operations conducted by Delta Force}}\n[[File:Delta-force-scud-hunters.jpg|thumb|Delta Force soldiers, pictured deep behind Iraqi lines during the 1991 Gulf War]]\n\nThe majority of the operations assigned to Delta are classified and may never be known to the public. However, details of some operations have become public knowledge. For service during [[Operation Urgent Fury]], Delta was awarded the [[Joint Meritorious Unit Award]]. The unit was awarded the [[Valorous Unit Award]] for extraordinary heroism during the Modelo Prison Hostage Rescue Mission and the capture of [[Manuel Noriega]] in December 1989 during [[Operation Just Cause]] in [[Panama]]. 1st SFOD-D operators from C Squadron were also involved in [[Operation Gothic Serpent]] in Somalia. During [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], the 1st SFOD-D was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] for combat operations in Afghanistan from 4 October 2001 to 15 March 2002 and Iraq from 19 March 2003 to 13 December 2003. On 26 October 2019, Delta operators and Army Rangers raided ISIS leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi|Abu Bakr al\u2013Baghdadi's]] compound, leading to his death.\n\n== Organization and structure ==\nThe unit is under the organization of the [[United States Army Special Operations Command|U.S. Army Special Operations Command]] (USASOC), but is controlled by the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] (JSOC). Command of 1st SFOD-D is a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel's]] [[billet]]. Virtually all information about the unit is highly classified and details about specific missions or operations generally are not available publicly. The unit is headquartered at [[Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]].\n\nDelta Force's structure is similar to the British 22nd SAS Regiment, the unit that inspired Delta's formation. In ''Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda'', ''[[Army Times]]'' staff writer [[Sean Naylor]] describes Delta as having, at the time, nearly 1,000 soldiers, of which approximately 250 to 300 are trained to conduct direct action and hostage rescue operations.

[http://www.carson.army.mil/pao/MountaineerArchive/2003%20Archive/01-16-03.pdf SFOD-D seeking new members] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040117090928/http://www.carson.army.mil/pao/MountaineerArchive/2003%20Archive/01-16-03.pdf |date=17 January 2004 }}. Fort Carson, Colorado: ''Mountaineer'' (publication). 16 January 2003.</ref> The Army, however, has never released an official fact sheet for the elite force. The recruitment notices in Fort Bragg's newspaper, ''Paraglide'', refer to Delta Force by name, and label it \"...the U.S. Army's special operations unit organized for the conduct of missions requiring rapid response with surgical application of a wide variety of unique special operations skills...\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Bragg's newspaper Paraglide, recruitment notice for Delta Force |url=http://us2.newsmemory.com/ee/paraglide/default.php |accessdate=17 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611002659/http://us2.newsmemory.com/ee/paraglide/default.php |archivedate=11 June 2009 }}</ref> The notice states that applicants must be male, in the grade of [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades#Enlisted pay grades|E-4 through E-8]], have at least two and a half years of service remaining in their enlistment, be 21 years or older, and score high enough on the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]] to attend a briefing to be considered for admission.

All candidates must be eligible for a security clearance level of \"Secret\" and have not been convicted by court-martial or have disciplinary action noted in their official military personnel file under the provisions of Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nOn 29 June 2006 during a session of the Committee on Armed Services, General [[Wayne Downing]] testified before the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] that 70 percent of all Delta operators had served in the [[75th Ranger Regiment]]. General Downing also testified that while some are directly recruited into Delta Force, others spend time in Army Special Forces before transitioning into Delta Force.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/soc.pdf |title=Assessing U.S. Special Operations Command's Missions and Roles |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date= |accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Selection process ===\n[[Eric Haney]]'s book ''[[Inside Delta Force]]'' described the selection course and its inception in detail. Haney wrote that the selection course began with standard tests including push-ups, sit-ups, and a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} run, an inverted crawl and a 100-meter swim fully dressed. The candidates are then put through a series of land navigation courses to include an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} all-night land navigation course while carrying a {{convert|40|lb|kg|adj=on}} rucksack. The rucksack's weight and the distance of the courses are increased and the time standards to complete the task are shortened with every march. The physical testing ended with a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} march with a {{convert|45|lb|kg|adj=on}} rucksack over rough terrain that had to be completed in an unknown amount of time. Haney wrote that only the senior officer and NCO in charge of selection are allowed to see the set time limits, but all assessment and selection tasks and conditions were set by Delta training cadre.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite book |last=Haney |first=Eric L. |authorlink=Eric Haney |title=[[Inside Delta Force]] |publisher=[[Delacorte Press]] |year=2002 |location=New York |page=325 |isbn=978-0-385-33603-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Beckwith\">{{cite book |title=Delta Force |url=https://archive.org/details/deltaforce00beck |url-access=registration |last=Beckwith |first=Charlie A. |year=1983 |location=San Diego |publisher=Harcourt |isbn=978-0-15-124657-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe mental portion of the testing began with numerous psychological exams. The men then went in front of a board of Delta instructors, unit psychologists, and the Delta commander, who each ask the candidate a barrage of questions and then dissect every response and mannerism of the candidate with the purpose of mentally exhausting the candidate. The unit commander then approaches the candidate and tells him if he has been selected. If an individual is selected for Delta, he undergoes an intense 6-month Operator Training Course (OTC), to learn [[counter-terrorism]] and [[counterintelligence]] techniques, in which the individual maintains little contact with friends and family for the duration. Training includes firearm accuracy and various other weapons training.<ref name=\"Haney\" />\n\nIn an interview, former Delta operator Paul Howe talked about the high attrition rate of the Delta selection course. He said that out of his two classes of 120 applicants each, 12 to 14 completed the selection.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59fL6ej_B-I |title=Delta Force Tryouts |via=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=18 February 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"BHD\"/>\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s highly secretive [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) and more specifically its elite [[Special Activities Division|Special Operations Group]] (SOG), often works with&nbsp;\u2013 and recruits&nbsp;\u2013 operators from Delta Force. <ref>{{cite news|last=Waller |first=Douglas |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1004145-1,00.html |title=The CIA's Secret Army: The CIA's Secret Army |publisher=Time |date=2003-02-03 |accessdate=2015-12-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Training ===\nAccording to [[Eric Haney]], the unit's '''Operator Training Course''' is approximately six months long. While the course is constantly changing, the skills taught broadly include the following:\n* Marksmanship\n** The trainees shoot without aiming at stationary targets at close range until they gain almost complete accuracy, then progress to moving targets.\n** Once these shooting skills are perfected, trainees move to a shooting house and clear rooms of \"enemy\" targets \u2013 first one only, then two at a time, three, and finally four. When all can demonstrate sufficient skill, \"hostages\" are added to the mix.\n* Demolitions and Breaching\n** Trainees learn how to pick many different locks, including those on cars and safes.\n** Advanced demolition, and bomb making using common materials.\n* Combined skills. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], and other agencies were used to advise the training of this portion of OTC.\n** The new Delta operators use demolition and marksmanship at the shoot house and other training facilities to train for hostage and counter-terrorist operations with assault and sniper troops working together. They practice terrorist or hostage situations in buildings, aircraft, and other settings.\n** All trainees learn how to set sniper positions around a building containing hostages. They learn the proper ways to set up a [[Tactical Operations Center|TOC]] and communicate in an organized manner. Although Delta has specialized sniper [[troops]], all members go through this training.\n** The students then go back to the shoot house and the \"hostages\" are replaced with other students and Delta Force members. Live ammunition is known to have been used in these exercises, to test the students, and build trust between one another.\n* [[Tradecraft]]. During the first OTCs and creation of Delta, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] personnel were used to teach this portion.\n** Students learn different espionage-related skills, such as [[dead drop]]s, [[Brush pass|brief encounters]], pickups, load and unload signals, danger and safe signals, surveillance and counter-surveillance.\n* Executive Protection. During the first OTCs and creation of Delta, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s [[Diplomatic Security Service]] and the [[United States Secret Service]] advised Delta.\n** Students take an advanced driving course learning how to use a vehicle or many vehicles as defensive and offensive weapons.\n** They then learn techniques for VIP and diplomatic protection developed by the Secret Service and DSS.\n* Culmination Exercise\n** A final test requires the students to apply and dynamically adapt all of the skills that they have learned.\n\n== Uniform ==\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] tightly controls information about Delta Force and refuses to comment publicly on the highly secretive unit and its activities; usually unless the unit is part of a major operation or a unit member has been killed. Delta operators are granted an enormous amount of flexibility and autonomy during military operations overseas. To conceal their identities, soldiers rarely wear a uniform and usually wear civilian clothing both on and off duty.<ref name=\"Haney\" /> When military uniforms are worn, they lack markings, surnames, or branch names.<ref name=\"Haney\" /> Civilian hair styles and [[Facial_hair_in_the_military#United_States|facial hair]] are allowed to enable the members to blend in and avoid recognition as military personnel.<ref name=\"Haney\" /><ref name=\"BHD\">{{cite book |last=Bowden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Bowden |title=Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War |year=1999 |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |location=[[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] |isbn=978-0-87113-738-8}}</ref> Their Navy counterpart [[SEAL Team Six|DEVGRU]] is also granted the same amount of autonomy and flexibility.\n\n== The term ''operator'' ==\n[[File:Code of the Special Forces Operator.jpg|thumb|Example of the \u201cCode of the Special Forces Operator\u201d dated 1959. This example pre-dates DELTA among other units.]]\n\nThe origin of the term \"operator\" in American special operations comes from the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] (aka the Green Berets). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the [[Navy SEALs]] and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the 'Code of the Special Forces Operator' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\". ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'' (V14/N1), pp. 63-64. </ref> \n\nInside the [[USSOCOM|United States Special Operations]] community, an ''operator'' is a Delta Force member who has completed selection and has graduated OTC (Operators Training Course). ''Operator'' was used by Delta Force to distinguish between operational and non-operational personnel assigned to the unit.<ref name=Haney />  Other [[United States special operations forces|special operations forces]] use specific names for their jobs, such as Army ''Rangers'' and Air Force ''[[Pararescuemen]]''. The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known as ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created \"'''Special Warfare Operator'''\" ('''SO''') as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades [[Uniformed_services_pay_grades_of_the_United_States|E-4]] to [[Uniformed_services_pay_grades_of_the_United_States|E-9]]. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]). ''Operator'' is the specific term for operational personnel, and has become a colloquial term for almost all special operations forces in the U.S. military, as well as around the world.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|War}}\n* [[Special Air Service|22nd SAS Regiment]]\n* [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]]\n* [[1st Marine Infantry Paratroopers Regiment]]\n* [[Delta Force in popular culture]]\n* [[List of Delta Force members]]\n* [[List of special forces units]]\n* [[SEAL Team Six]]\n* [[JW GROM]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Boykin, William (2011).
