All 300 members of the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] were elected, 253 from [[first-past-the-post]] [[_South Korean Legislature Constituencies|constituencies]] and 47 from [[party-list proportional representation|proportional party lists]].\n\nThe election was a landslide victory for the liberal [[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic Party]] which defeated the conservative [[United Future Party]]. The Democratic Party and its satellite party, the [[Together Citizens' Party]], won 180 out of 300 seats, or 60% of seats.

He also mentioned [[Michael Bay]]'s technique \"of shooting a scene against the background light\" but found it difficult to make.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> Another technique inspired by [[Jackie Chan]]'s films he used in the ''Naruto'' manga is the \"double-action\"; in this action, a punch is shown in three different angles in order to give a big impact on the punch's strength. This was first shown in Naruto Uzumaki's battle against [[List of Naruto characters#Haku|Haku]]. Sometimes, Kishimoto draws panels intentionally confusing during fight scenes to add a sense of speed. On the other hand, Kishimoto commented that for the fights between Naruto and Sasuke, he added action from the top of the page to the bottom in order for them to be easier to follow.<ref name=\"koba\">{{Cite AV media |title=\u6f2b\u9053\u30b3\u30d0\u30e4\u30b7\u7b2c13\u53f7\u300cNARUTO\u5b8c\u7d50\uff01\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2SP\u300d |date=December 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fuji Television]] |trans-title=Kobayashi No. 13 'Completion of Naruto!

The changes to his personal life affected the story as he made the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki meet his parents, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father.<ref name=\"alphainter\"/>\n\nWhen drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'', the cover of ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'', or other media.

For example, when introducing Sasuke, the character says he wants to kill a person. By this time, Kishimoto only thought that Sasuke's brother, [[Itachi Uchiha|Itachi]], had done a wrong deed in the past but was not certain of what was exactly. By volume 16 of the series which featured Itachi's actual introduction, Kishimoto decided Itachi was an agent working for Konohagakure to kill all members from the Uchiha clan except Sasuke.

Realizing both had their own style regarding the designs, Kishimoto decided to draw manga while crafting his own images.<ref name=\"inspiration\"/> While attending art school, Kishimoto was also an avid reader of [[Hiroaki Samura]]'s ''[[Blade of the Immortal]]'', and extensively studied Samura's page layouts, action sequences, and anatomical techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plus.shonenjump.com/rensai_detail.html?item_cd=SHSA_JP01PLUS00000792_57|title=\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7BOOK\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\uff01|publisher=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]|access-date=June 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908044137/http://plus.shonenjump.com/rensai_detail.html?item_cd=SHSA_JP01PLUS00000792_57|archive-date=September 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> When Kishimoto was originally creating the ''Naruto'' series, he looked to other ''sh\u014dnen'' manga for influences while attempting to make his characters as unique as possible.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |isbn=1-4215-1407-9 |page=138}}</ref> Kishimoto cites Akira Toriyama's ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series as one of his influences, noting that [[Goku]], the protagonist, was a key factor when creating Naruto Uzumaki due to his energetic and mischievous personality.<ref name=\"ArtBook139\">{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|page=139|isbn=1-4215-1407-9}}</ref> When redesigning three characters for the series, Kishimoto cites ''[[The Matrix]]'', one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for their outfits.<ref name=\"ArtBook127\">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: The Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=127}}</ref> He has also cited [[Yoshihiro Togashi]] as one of his favorite manga authors,<ref name=\"auto\"/> while the manga ''Sasuke'' by [[Sanpei Shirato]], a series which Kishimoto likes, inspired Kishimoto in the development of the character [[Sasuke Uchiha]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 2007 |title=Interview: Tracking Down the Source|journal=Shonen Jump Naruto Collector 3 |publisher=Viz Media}}</ref>\n\nKishimoto has also cited other influences such as [[Takeshi Kitano]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]]. He also mentioned [[Michael Bay]]'s technique \"of shooting a scene against the background light\" but found it difficult to make.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> Another technique inspired by [[Jackie Chan]]'s films he used in the ''Naruto'' manga is the \"double-action\"; in this action, a punch is shown in three different angles in order to give a big impact on the punch's strength. This was first shown in Naruto Uzumaki's battle against [[List of Naruto characters#Haku|Haku]]. Sometimes, Kishimoto draws panels intentionally confusing during fight scenes to add a sense of speed. On the other hand, Kishimoto commented that for the fights between Naruto and Sasuke, he added action from the top of the page to the bottom in order for them to be easier to follow.<ref name=\"koba\">{{Cite AV media |title=\u6f2b\u9053\u30b3\u30d0\u30e4\u30b7\u7b2c13\u53f7\u300cNARUTO\u5b8c\u7d50\uff01\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2SP\u300d |date=December 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fuji Television]] |trans-title=Kobayashi No. 13 'Completion of Naruto!

The changes to his personal life affected the story as he made the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki meet his parents, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father.<ref name=\"alphainter\"/>\n\nWhen drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'', the cover of ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'', or other media.

For example, when introducing Sasuke, the character says he wants to kill a person. By this time, Kishimoto only thought that Sasuke's brother, [[Itachi Uchiha|Itachi]], had done a wrong deed in the past but was not certain of what was exactly. By volume 16 of the series which featured Itachi's actual introduction, Kishimoto decided Itachi was an agent working for Konohagakure to kill all members from the Uchiha clan except Sasuke. This is later revealed in volume 43 of the manga.<ref name=\"koba\"/> Another one was the revelation that the late [[Minato Namikaze]] would be Naruto's father. When Kishimoto had the idea that Minato would be Naruto's father, he started adding hints of that to the reader such as giving the Hokage mountain from Konohagakure spiky hair similar to Naruto's.<ref>{{cite book|title=NARUTO\u2015\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\u2015\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bfBOOK \u79d8\u4f1d\u30fb\u9663\u306e\u66f8|year=2014|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|pages=378\u2013387|isbn=978-4-08-880263-3|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn the making of the film ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' Kishimoto paid tribute to several movies, the most notable being the 1996 film ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' and the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Legendarium]]. It became the heavily fortified [[capital city|capital]] of the kingdom of [[Gondor]] in the second half of the [[Third Age]]. It had originally been built to guard the former capital, [[Osgiliath]], from attack from the west, but became the capital when Osgiliath fell into ruin following the Kin-strife (a civil war) and the [[Gondor#Decline|Great Plague]].\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the city comes under determined attack by the forces of [[Mordor]], culminating in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].\n\n==Names==\n\nThe name ''Minas Tirith'' means \"Tower of the Sun\" in [[Sindarin]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth |last=Noel |first=Ruth S. |year=1974 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |isbn=0-395-29129-1 |page=170 }}</ref> one of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|languages constructed by Tolkien]]. Within the fiction, the city was originally called ''Minas Anor'', in connection with ''Minas Ithil'', \"Tower of the Moon\". {{efn|Minas Anor is the second tower in the history of Middle-earth to be called Minas Tirith; the first was built in [[Beleriand]] by [[Finrod Felagund]] in the [[History of Arda#First Age|First Age]] and was later captured by [[Sauron]] and then finally raised to the ground by [[L\u00fathien|L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel]].<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1977), ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', 'Of [[Beren and L\u00fathien]]'; ISBN 0 04 823139 8</ref>}}  Minas Ithil was later conquered by Sauron's [[Nazg\u00fbl]] from [[Mordor]] and was renamed ''[[Minas Morgul]]''.\n\nThe city was sometimes called \"the [[#White Tower|White Tower]]\", a [[metonym]] referring to the city's most prominent building.\n\nSome other peoples in [[Middle-earth]] had their own names for Minas Tirith. The [[Rohirrim]] called it Mundburg, while the [[Dr\u00faedain]] referred to it as \"Stone-city\" and \"Stone-houses\".\n\n==Description==\nThe city of Minas Tirith covered an entire hill, the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Hill of Guard|Hill of Guard]]. This hill was a shoulder of [[Mindolluin]], the mountain which towered behind the city and which was the easternmost peak of the [[White Mountains (Middle-earth)|White Mountains]]. The city was built on seven levels, culminating in [[#Citadel|the Citadel]] at the summit. Each level was about {{Convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} higher than the one below it, and each surrounded by a high stone wall. These were all white, with the exception of the wall of the First Circle (the lowest level), which was black, built of the same material used for [[Orthanc]]. This outer wall was also the tallest, longest and strongest of the city's seven walls; it was vulnerable only to earthquakes capable of rending the ground where it stood.<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T/> Each wall held a gate, and each gate faced a different direction from the next. The city's main street snaked up the eastern hill-face and through each of the gates. Except for the high [[Saddle (landform)|saddle]] of rock which joined the west of the hill to Mindolluin, the city was surrounded by the [[#Pelennor Fields|Pelennor]], an area of farmlands. Minas Tirith's port was a few miles south of the city at [[Gondor#Harlond|Harlond]], where the great river [[Anduin]] made its closest approach to the city.\n\n===Citadel===\n[[File:Flag of the Kings of Gondor.svg|thumb|right|The heraldry of the Kings of Gondor, also worn by the Guards of the Citadel. The design includes the White Tree, which stood in the Citadel.]]\n\nThe [[Citadel]], located on the summit of the city, was the city's seventh and highest level, and was protected by the city's seventh and innermost wall. At an elevation 700 feet higher than the plain surrounding the city, it had a commanding view of the lower vales of [[Anduin]]. The [[#White Tower|White Tower]] stood in the Citadel, and in the Court of the Fountain in front of the Tower grew the [[White Tree]], the symbol of Gondor. The topmost level also contained lodgings for the [[Steward of Gondor]], the King's House, Merethrond the Hall of Feasts, barracks for the Guard of the Citadel, and other buildings for soldiers.\n\nThe Guard of the Citadel, which consisted of several companies, protected the city's ruler. In ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Beregond was originally a member of the Guard, and later [[Pippin Took]] was appointed to serve with the Guard.\n\nThe east of the Citadel was the top of the great pier of rock which jutted out from the eastern hill-face of Minas Tirith, in line with the Great Gate, which was 700 ft (213 m) below the Citadel. The entrance to the Citadel, the Seventh Gate of the city, was in this eastern part. The gate was a tunnel which ran up through the rock pier from the Sixth Circle, where the keystone of the tunnel's archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. Guards of the Citadel manned the Seventh Gate.\n\n====White Tower====\n\nThe White Tower, later also called the Tower of Ecthelion, was the most prominent building in Minas Tirith, and the seat of the rulers of Gondor: the Kings and [[Stewards of Gondor|the Stewards]]. The phrase \"the White Tower\" was also used as a [[metonym]] for the city and its rulers. The [[tower]] stood {{Convert|300|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall (equivalent to 21 [[storey]]s), so that its pinnacle was {{Convert|1000|ft|m|spell=in}} above the plain. The main doors of the tower faced east, onto the Court of the Fountain. Inside these doors was the Tower Hall, the great [[Throne room|throne-room]] where the Kings (or Stewards) held court. Upper storeys included private apartments for the rulers. The [[Palant\u00edr|Seeing-stone of Minas Anor]] rested in a secret chamber at the top of the Tower. A [[Buttery (room)|buttery]] of the Guards of the Citadel was located in the basement of the tower, accessed by a door and stair at the tower's north feet. The White Tower was built by King Calimehtar; it was extensively re-built by Steward Ecthelion I, giving rise to its alternative name, the Tower of Ecthelion.\n\n===Great Gate===\n\nThe Great Gate was the main gate on the first level of the City of Minas Tirith. It was in the City Wall\u2014or Othram\u2014facing eastward across the Pelennor Fields toward the [[Anduin]].\n\nIn front of the Great Gate was a large paved area called the Gateway. The main roads to Minas Tirith met here: the North-way that became the Great West Road to [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]; the South Road to the southern provinces of Gondor; and the road to Osgiliath, which lay to the north-east of Minas Tirith.\n\nThe Great Gate was constructed of iron and steel and guarded by stone towers and bastions. The doors rolled back to open. Passwords were required to enter each of the city's gates.\n\n====Destruction and renovation====\n\nThe Great Gate was breached during the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Sauron]]'s forces under the command of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] besieged the City on 13th 'March'. Before dawn on 15th 'March', the massive battering-ram [[Grond (Middle-earth)|Grond]] smashed into the Great Gate three times while the Witch-king spoke words of power. \"As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.\"<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Siege of Gondor\"</ref> The Witch-king rode through the Gate where [[Aragorn]] awaited him, but then the [[Rohirrim]] arrived and the Witch-king went to fight them in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where he was killed.\n\nA temporary barricade was erected in place of the Great Gate. After the War, on 1st 'May', [[Aragorn]] received the Crown of Gondor in front of the gate and then entered the City.\n\nThe Great Gate was rebuilt of ''[[mithril]]'' (the hardest of all metals in Tolkien's fiction) and steel by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] and Dwarves of [[Erebor]] from the [[Lonely Mountain]] who had settled in the [[Glittering Caves]].\n\n===Other gates and levels===\n\nThe gates of the Second Level through the Sixth Level were staggered at different points of their walls. The Second Level gate faced south-east, that of the Third north-east, and so forth. This measure was designed to make capture of the already heavily fortified city even more difficult; it also enabled a gentler gradient for the city's main thoroughfare as it snaked up the hillside.\n\nThe two shoulders of the city's hill divided the second through to the fifth levels into two arc-shaped sectors, each almost a semicircle. The two sectors on each of these levels were connected by a tunnel through the eastern shoulder, a great pier of rock jutting out from the face of the hill. The city's main street passed through these tunnels.\n\nThe western (rear) shoulder of the city's hill was a [[Mountain pass|saddle]] between the city and Mount [[Mindolluin]]. The saddle was occupied by the city's necropolis, called Rath D\u00ednen (the Silent Street), where the tombs of the Kings of Gondor and their [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] were built. It was reached by a door in the Sixth Level, which was almost closed and hence called Fen Hollen (the Closed Door). The Sixth Level also contained barracks for soldiers, and the famed Houses of Healing.\n\nThe Seventh Gate led to [[#Citadel|the Citadel]]. It faced eastward in line with the Great Gate, which was {{Convert|700|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} below. The Seventh Gate could be reached through a sloping tunnel delved into the pier of rock that jutted out of the eastern face of the Hill of Guard. The keystone of the tunnel's archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. Guards of the Citadel manned the Seventh Gate.\n\n===Pelennor Fields===\n{{further|Battle of the Pelennor Fields}}\n\nThe Pelennor Fields ringed Minas Tirith, and formed the city's \"townlands\": a fertile area of intensive agriculture. It was about 12 miles across. On its west stood the massive bulwark of Mount [[Mindolluin]], and on its east ran the great river [[Anduin]]; \"many rills\" ran across the Pelennor from the highlands to the river. Minas Tirith stood inside its south-west corner. The name ''Pelennor'' means ''fenced land'' in [[Sindarin]].\n\nAfter Minas Ithil had fallen and been renamed [[Minas Morgul]], the Pelennor Fields were enclosed by a great defensive wall: Rammas Echor. The wall had three main gates: north, north-east and south. The north-east gate and accompanying watch-towers were known as the Causeway Forts and were the strongest section of the entire wall. This wall was in disrepair shortly before the [[War of the Ring]], but was rebuilt in time on the orders of the Steward, [[Denethor II]].\n \nDuring the War of the Ring, the Pelennor Fields were the location that was one of the major battles of the [[Third Age]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], when [[Uruk-hai]] overran the Rammas Echor by blasting through it and besieged the city. The siege was broken by the arrival of the Rohirrim, though their King [[Th\u00e9oden]] was wounded in the battle. After the [[War of the Ring]], the Rammas Echor was rebuilt by the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] of [[Erebor]], led by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]].\n\n===Maps===\nMap #40 in Barbara Strachey's ''[[Journeys of Frodo]]'' is a plan of Minas Tirith. Pages 138&139 in [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]'s revised ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' show a different plan of the city. The only maps by Tolkien are sketches.\n\n==Government==\nThe city of Minas Tirith was administered from its [[#Citadel|Citadel]]. The head of government was the Lord of the City; in the days of the [[Stewards of Gondor]], the Stewards themselves were the Lords of the City.\n\nOther soldiers included the Warden of the Houses of Healing (in charge of the city's hospital) and the Warden of the Keys. The Warden of the Keys was in charge of the city's security, especially its gates, and the safe-keeping of its treasury, notably the Crown of Gondor. During a period in the [[War of the Ring]], the Warden of the Keys (at that time H\u00farin the Tall) was placed in full command of the city, owing to the absence of the as-yet uncrowned King ([[Aragorn]]) and the convalescence of the Steward ([[Faramir]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIn Tolkien's fiction, the city was originally known as Minas Anor. It was founded as a satellite of [[Osgiliath]], the great capital of the nascent kingdom of [[Gondor]], by [[Isildur]]. He and his brother [[An\u00e1rion]] were, jointly, the first rulers of Gondor, on behalf of the King, their father [[Elendil]], who lived in his other kingdom, Arnor. Isildur planted Gondor's second [[White Tree]] in the Citadel of Minas Anor. Thereafter, the city was the home of Gondor's lineage of White Trees. Minas Anor grew in importance when Ostoher rebuilt the city as a summer residence for himself and his successors as the Kings of Gondor.\n\n===Capital of Gondor===\nMinas Anor became the capital of Gondor when King Tarondor moved the King's House from [[Osgiliath]] following the Great Plague, which had devastated the population of the much larger and more populous old capital. [[Minas Morgul|Minas Ithil]], on the borders of [[Mordor]], was captured by the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] and renamed Minas Morgul. Minas Tirith took on the role of guarding Gondor against Mordor; it fulfilled this role for the next thousand years. With the rebuilding of the [[Barad-d\u00fbr|Dark Tower]] and the open return of [[Sauron]], the forces of Mordor gathered their strength to topple Minas Tirith in the upcoming [[War of the Ring]].\n\n{{anchor|Rammas Echor}}\n===The War of the Ring===\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Minas Tirith had lost more than half of its soldier population. Many buildings had fallen into disrepair. The city and its lands were surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a fortified wall encircling the [[Pelennor Fields]] and meeting up with [[Osgiliath]], where the Causeway Forts were built on the west bank of the [[Anduin]] and garrisoned. The Rammas proved an ineffective defence. After less than a day, the Uruk-hai breached in the gate. This proved to the detriment of the Uruk-hai when the forces of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] arrived; for, as noted by King [[Th\u00e9oden]], they could have held the Rammas against Rohan's attack.\n\n====Siege====\n[[Faramir]] and his garrison were unable to hold [[Osgiliath]] and the Causeway Forts against the Uruk-hai and were driven back towards Minas Tirith with heavy loss. Leading the rearguard against the onslaught, Faramir was wounded and nearly slain, but the cavalry charge of Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]] and [[Aragorn]] saved him, and the counter-attack allowed the rest of Gondor's soldiers to reach the safety of the city.\n\nMinas Tirith was now [[Siege|besieged]] by a vast army of Uruk-hai and the land fell under the darkness generated by Mordor. Significant damage was done to the first circle of the city but the enemy was unable to break through its great wall\u2014except in one place. [[#Great Gate|The gate of the city]] was broken by a combination of the massive battering-ram [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Grond|Grond]] and the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king]]'s sorcery; but Aragorn halted the Witch-king at the entrance.\n\nDuring the siege the House of the Stewards in Rath D\u00ednen was destroyed by a fire lit by the Steward [[Denethor II|Denethor]] in suicidal despair at the illness of his son Faramir.<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T/><ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Pyre of Denethor\"</ref>\n\nThe timely arrival of the [[Rohirrim]] led by their king [[Th\u00e9oden]] forced the Uruk-hai to face the newcomers instead of assaulting the city. The resulting [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] took place on 15 'March' 3019 in [[#Pelennor Fields|the fields]] surrounding the city. Despite heavy losses, Minas Tirith itself was not seriously threatened again, and the battle was won by Gondor and its allies from Rohan and Gondor's fiefs.\n\n===Later===\n\nOn 1 'May' 3019 King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] was crowned on [[#Great Gate|the Gateway]], the threshold of Minas Tirith. Minas Tirith stood firm well into the [[Fourth Age]]. [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli the Dwarf]] and some of [[Durin's folk]] used ''[[mithril]]'', a nigh-indestructible metal, to replace [[#Great Gate|the gates]] that had been broken in the [[War of the Ring]]. The Dwarves improved the layout of the city's streets, and the Elves planted trees in the city. The [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagle]] who brought news of Sauron's defeat to Minas Tirith refers to the city as the Tower of Anor.

Jackson's version interprets the top of the rock as flattened and paved, and places the coronation of [[Aragorn]] there. As with most other landmarks in the film, the city is portrayed as isolated and sparsely populated.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The appearance and structure of the city was based upon the inhabited [[tidal island]] and [[abbey]] of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], France.<ref name=\"Morrison 2014\"/>\n\nPortions of Minas Tirith were constructed as full-scale sets, and the whole city as a very large, highly detailed miniature or \"[[bigature]]\" by [[Weta Workshop]]. [[Weta Digital]], a division of Weta Workshop, created a remarkably detailed three-dimensional digital model for [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] shots, along with the whole of its surrounding environment including the Pelennor Fields and Mindolluin (but not the Rammas Echor, which was visually omitted from the films despite being mentioned in the dialogue, where [[Th\u00e9oden]] gave the order to the Rohirrim beginning \"After you pass the Wall...\" quoted directly from the book). The set was built on the foundations of the disassembled Helm's Deep set.\n\nIn the novel, the outermost walls of Minas Tirith were black and virtually indestructible, like the similar black surface of [[Orthanc]], as they were built by the [[D\u00fanedain]] before their craft waned in exile. Tolkien says only an earthquake or similar seismic convulsion could cause them significant damage. Jackson depicted all of the walls as white, and many of them were easily destroyed.\n\nIn the films, the towers of Minas Tirith are equipped with [[trebuchet]]s. However, this superior kind of siege engine is not specifically mentioned in the book.\n\nIn the video game ''[[Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'', players in the evil campaign can destroy the city.<ref name=\"conquest\">{{cite web|date=2009-04-06|author=Irish Amabel Capati|url=http://www.pcmag-mideast.com/productreview.aspx?_reviewID=1484&mode=1&pid=0|title=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest|publisher= PC Magazine Middle and Near East |accessdate=20 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there are maps in ''[[Minecraft]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title='Minecraft' Building Ideas: Word Processor, Coliseum And More Of Our Favorite Builds|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/minecraft-building-ideas-word-processor-coliseum-more-our-favorite-builds-1763063|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=28 December 2016|date=18 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Minecraft: Jeder Herrscher w\u00e4re neidisch!

R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Legendarium]]. It became the heavily fortified [[capital city|capital]] of the kingdom of [[Gondor]] in the second half of the [[Third Age]]. It had originally been built to guard the former capital, [[Osgiliath]], from attack from the west, but became the capital when Osgiliath fell into ruin following the Kin-strife (a civil war) and the [[Gondor#Decline|Great Plague]].\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the city comes under determined attack by the forces of [[Mordor]], culminating in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].\n\n==Names==\n\nThe name ''Minas Tirith'' means \"the Tower of Guard\" (or \"of Watch\") in [[Sindarin]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth |last=Noel |first=Ruth S. |year=1974 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |isbn=0-395-29129-1 |page=170 }}</ref> one of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|languages constructed by Tolkien]]. Within the fiction, the city was originally called ''Minas Anor'', \"the Tower of the Sun\", in connection with ''Minas Ithil'', \"the Tower of the Moon\". {{efn|Minas Anor is the second tower in the history of Middle-earth to be called Minas Tirith; the first was built in [[Beleriand]] by [[Finrod Felagund]] in the [[History of Arda#First Age|First Age]] and was later captured by [[Sauron]] and then finally raised to the ground by [[L\u00fathien|L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel]].<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1977), ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', 'Of [[Beren and L\u00fathien]]'; ISBN 0 04 823139 8</ref>}}  Minas Ithil was later conquered by Sauron's [[Nazg\u00fbl]] from [[Mordor]] and was renamed ''[[Minas Morgul]]'', \"the Tower of Black Sorcery\", while Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith, in constant watch of its now defiled twin city.\n\nThe city was sometimes called \"the [[#White Tower|White Tower]]\", a [[metonym]] referring to the city's most prominent building.\n\nSome other peoples in [[Middle-earth]] had their own names for Minas Tirith. The [[Rohirrim]] called it Mundburg, while the [[Dr\u00faedain]] referred to it as \"Stone-city\" and \"Stone-houses\".\n\n==Description==\nThe city of Minas Tirith covered an entire hill, the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Hill of Guard|Hill of Guard]]. This hill was a shoulder of [[Mindolluin]], the mountain which towered behind the city and which was the easternmost peak of the [[White Mountains (Middle-earth)|White Mountains]]. The city was built on seven levels, culminating in [[#Citadel|the Citadel]] at the summit. Each level was about {{Convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} higher than the one below it, and each surrounded by a high stone wall. These were all white, with the exception of the wall of the First Circle (the lowest level), which was black, built of the same material used for [[Orthanc]]. This outer wall was also the tallest, longest and strongest of the city's seven walls; it was vulnerable only to earthquakes capable of rending the ground where it stood.<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T/> Each wall held a gate, and each gate faced a different direction from the next. The city's main street snaked up the eastern hill-face and through each of the gates. Except for the high [[Saddle (landform)|saddle]] of rock which joined the west of the hill to Mindolluin, the city was surrounded by the [[#Pelennor Fields|Pelennor]], an area of farmlands. Minas Tirith's port was a few miles south of the city at [[Gondor#Harlond|Harlond]], where the great river [[Anduin]] made its closest approach to the city.\n\n===Citadel===\n[[File:Flag of the Kings of Gondor.svg|thumb|right|The heraldry of the Kings of Gondor, also worn by the Guards of the Citadel. The design includes the White Tree, which stood in the Citadel.]]\n\nThe [[Citadel]], located on the summit of the city, was the city's seventh and highest level, and was protected by the city's seventh and innermost wall. At an elevation 700 feet higher than the plain surrounding the city, it had a commanding view of the lower vales of [[Anduin]]. The [[#White Tower|White Tower]] stood in the Citadel, and in the Court of the Fountain in front of the Tower grew the [[White Tree]], the symbol of Gondor. The topmost level also contained lodgings for the [[Steward of Gondor]], the King's House, Merethrond the Hall of Feasts, barracks for the Guard of the Citadel, and other buildings for important officials and guests.\n\nThe Guard of the Citadel, which consisted of several companies, protected the city's ruler. In ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Beregond was originally a member of the Guard, and later [[Pippin Took]] was appointed to serve with the Guard.\n\nThe east of the Citadel was the top of the great pier of rock which jutted out from the eastern hill-face of Minas Tirith, in line with the Great Gate, which was 700 ft (213 m) below the Citadel. The entrance to the Citadel, the Seventh Gate of the city, was in this eastern part. The gate was a tunnel which ran up through the rock pier from the Sixth Circle, where the keystone of the tunnel's archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. Guards of the Citadel manned the Seventh Gate.\n\n====White Tower====\n\nThe White Tower, later also called the Tower of Ecthelion, was the most prominent building in Minas Tirith, and the seat of the rulers of Gondor: the Kings and [[Stewards of Gondor|the Stewards]]. The phrase \"the White Tower\" was also used as a [[metonym]] for the city and its rulers. The [[tower]] stood {{Convert|300|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall (equivalent to 21 [[storey]]s), so that its pinnacle was {{Convert|1000|ft|m|spell=in}} above the plain. The main doors of the tower faced east, onto the Court of the Fountain. Inside these doors was the Tower Hall, the great [[Throne room|throne-room]] where the Kings (or Stewards) held court. Upper storeys included private apartments for the rulers. The [[Palant\u00edr|Seeing-stone of Minas Anor]] rested in a secret chamber at the top of the Tower. A [[Buttery (room)|buttery]] of the Guards of the Citadel was located in the basement of the tower, accessed by a door and stair at the tower's north feet. The White Tower was built by King Calimehtar; it was extensively re-built by Steward Ecthelion I, giving rise to its alternative name, the Tower of Ecthelion.\n\n===Great Gate===\n\nThe Great Gate was the main gate on the first level of the City of Minas Tirith. It was in the City Wall\u2014or Othram\u2014facing eastward across the Pelennor Fields toward the [[Anduin]].\n\nIn front of the Great Gate was a large paved area called the Gateway. The main roads to Minas Tirith met here: the North-way that became the Great West Road to [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]; the South Road to the southern provinces of Gondor; and the road to Osgiliath, which lay to the north-east of Minas Tirith.\n\nThe Great Gate was constructed of iron and steel and guarded by stone towers and bastions. The doors rolled back to open. Passwords were required to enter each of the city's gates.\n\n====Destruction and renovation====\n\nThe Great Gate was breached during the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Sauron]]'s forces under the command of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] besieged the City on 13th 'March'. Before dawn on 15th 'March', the massive battering-ram [[Grond (Middle-earth)|Grond]] smashed into the Great Gate three times while the Witch-king spoke words of power. \"As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.\"<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Siege of Gondor\"</ref> The Witch-king rode through the Gate where [[Gandalf]] awaited him, but then the [[Rohirrim]] arrived and the Witch-king went to fight them in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where he was killed.\n\nA temporary barricade was erected in place of the Great Gate. After the War, on 1st 'May', [[Aragorn]] received the Crown of Gondor in front of the gate and then entered the City.\n\nThe Great Gate was rebuilt of ''[[mithril]]'' (the hardest of all metals in Tolkien's fiction) and steel by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] and Dwarves of [[Erebor]] from the [[Lonely Mountain]] who had settled in the [[Glittering Caves]].\n\n===Other gates and levels===\n\nThe gates of the Second Level through the Sixth Level were staggered at different points of their walls. The Second Level gate faced south-east, that of the Third north-east, and so forth. This measure was designed to make capture of the already heavily fortified city even more difficult; it also enabled a gentler gradient for the city's main thoroughfare as it snaked up the hillside.\n\nThe two shoulders of the city's hill divided the second through to the fifth levels into two arc-shaped sectors, each almost a semicircle. The two sectors on each of these levels were connected by a tunnel through the eastern shoulder, a great pier of rock jutting out from the face of the hill. The city's main street passed through these tunnels.\n\nThe western (rear) shoulder of the city's hill was a [[Mountain pass|saddle]] between the city and Mount [[Mindolluin]]. The saddle was occupied by the city's necropolis, called Rath D\u00ednen (the Silent Street), where the tombs of the Kings of Gondor and their [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] were built. It was reached by a door in the Sixth Level, which was almost always closed and hence called Fen Hollen (the Closed Door). The Sixth Level also contained stables for riders, and the famed Houses of Healing.\n\nThe Seventh Gate led to [[#Citadel|the Citadel]]. It faced eastward in line with the Great Gate, which was {{Convert|700|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} below. The Seventh Gate could be reached through a sloping tunnel delved into the pier of rock that jutted out of the eastern face of the Hill of Guard. The keystone of the tunnel's archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. Guards of the Citadel manned the Seventh Gate.\n\n===Pelennor Fields===\n{{further|Battle of the Pelennor Fields}}\n\nThe Pelennor Fields ringed Minas Tirith, and formed the city's \"townlands\": a fertile area of intensive agriculture. It was about 12 miles across. On its west stood the massive bulwark of Mount [[Mindolluin]], and on its east ran the great river [[Anduin]]; \"many rills\" ran across the Pelennor from the highlands to the river. Minas Tirith stood inside its south-west corner. The name ''Pelennor'' means ''fenced land'' in [[Sindarin]].\n\nAfter Minas Ithil had fallen and been renamed [[Minas Morgul]], the Pelennor Fields were enclosed by a great defensive wall: Rammas Echor. The wall had three main gates: north, north-east and south. The north-east gate and accompanying watch-towers were known as the Causeway Forts and were the strongest section of the entire wall. This wall was in disrepair shortly before the [[War of the Ring]], but was rebuilt in time on the orders of the Steward, [[Denethor II]].\n \nDuring the War of the Ring, the Pelennor Fields were the location of the largest battle of the [[Third Age]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], when [[Uruk-hai]] overran the Rammas Echor by blasting through it and besieged the city. The siege was broken by the arrival of the Rohirrim, though their King [[Th\u00e9oden]] was wounded in the battle. After the [[War of the Ring]], the Rammas Echor was rebuilt by the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] of [[Erebor]], led by [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]].\n\n===Maps===\nMap #40 in Barbara Strachey's ''[[Journeys of Frodo]]'' is a plan of Minas Tirith. Pages 138&139 in [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]'s revised ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' show a different plan of the city. The only maps by Tolkien are sketches.\n\n==Government==\nThe city of Minas Tirith was administered from its [[#Citadel|Citadel]]. The head of government was the Lord of the City; in the days of the [[Stewards of Gondor]], the Stewards themselves were the Lords of the City.\n\nOther officials included the Warden of the Houses of Healing (in charge of the city's hospital) and the Warden of the Keys. The Warden of the Keys was in charge of the city's security, especially its gates, and the safe-keeping of its treasury, notably the Crown of Gondor. During a period in the [[War of the Ring]], the Warden of the Keys (at that time H\u00farin the Tall) was placed in full command of the city, owing to the absence of the as-yet uncrowned King ([[Aragorn]]) and the convalescence of the Steward ([[Faramir]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIn Tolkien's fiction, the city was originally known as Minas Anor, the \"Tower of the Sun\". It was founded  as a satellite of [[Osgiliath]], the great capital of the nascent kingdom of [[Gondor]], by [[An\u00e1rion]]. He and his brother [[Isildur]] were, jointly, the first rulers of Gondor, on behalf of the High King, their father [[Elendil]], who lived in his other kingdom, Arnor. Isildur planted Gondor's second [[White Tree]] in the Citadel of Minas Anor. Forever thereafter, the city was the home of Gondor's lineage of White Trees. Minas Anor grew in importance when Ostoher rebuilt the city as a summer residence for himself and his successors as the Kings of Gondor.\n\n===Capital of Gondor===\nMinas Anor became the capital of Gondor when King Tarondor moved the King's House from [[Osgiliath]] following the Great Plague, which had devastated the population of the much larger and more populous old capital. Minas Anor's sister-city, [[Minas Morgul|Minas Ithil]], the Tower of the Moon, on the borders of [[Mordor]], was captured by the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] and renamed Minas Morgul, the Tower of Black Sorcery. Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith, meaning \"the Tower of Guard\", as it took on the role of guarding Gondor against Mordor; it fulfilled this role for the next thousand years. With the rebuilding of the [[Barad-d\u00fbr|Dark Tower]] and the open return of [[Sauron]], the forces of Mordor gathered their strength to topple Minas Tirith in the upcoming [[War of the Ring]].\n\n{{anchor|Rammas Echor}}\n===The War of the Ring===\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Minas Tirith had lost more than half of its population. Many buildings had fallen into disrepair. The city and its lands were surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a fortified wall encircling the [[Pelennor Fields]] and meeting up with [[Osgiliath]], where the Causeway Forts were built on the west bank of the [[Anduin]] and garrisoned. The Rammas proved an ineffective defence. After less than a day, the orcs breached in the wall. This proved to the detriment of the orcs when the forces of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] arrived; for, as noted by King [[Th\u00e9oden]], they could have held the Rammas against Rohan's attack.\n\n====Siege====\n[[Faramir]] and his garrison were unable to hold [[Osgiliath]] and the Causeway Forts against the forces of [[Mordor]], and were driven back towards Minas Tirith with heavy loss. Leading the rearguard against the onslaught, Faramir was wounded and nearly slain, but the cavalry charge of Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]] and [[Gandalf]] saved him, and the counter-attack allowed the rest of Gondor's soldiers to reach the safety of the city.\n\nMinas Tirith was now [[Siege|besieged]] by a vast army from Mordor, including [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]], and the land fell under the darkness generated by Mordor. Significant damage was done to the first circle of the city but the enemy was unable to break through its great wall\u2014except in one place. [[#Great Gate|The gate of the city]] was broken by a combination of the massive battering-ram [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Grond|Grond]] and the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king]]'s sorcery; but Gandalf halted the Witch-king at the entrance.\n\nDuring the siege the House of the Stewards in Rath D\u00ednen was destroyed by a fire lit by the Steward [[Denethor II|Denethor]] in suicidal despair at the illness of his son Faramir.<ref name=\"Siege of Gondor\" group=T/><ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The Pyre of Denethor\"</ref>\n\nThe timely arrival of the [[Rohirrim]] led by their king [[Th\u00e9oden]] forced the armies of Mordor to face the newcomers instead of assaulting the city. The resulting [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] took place on 15 'March' 3019 in [[#Pelennor Fields|the fields]] surrounding the city. Despite heavy losses, Minas Tirith itself was not seriously threatened again, and the battle was won by Gondor and its allies from Rohan and Gondor's fiefs.\n\n===Later===\n\nOn 1 'May' 3019 King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] was crowned on [[#Great Gate|the Gateway]], the threshold of Minas Tirith. Minas Tirith stood firm well into the [[Fourth Age]]. [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli the Dwarf]] and some of [[Durin's folk]] used ''[[mithril]]'', a nigh-indestructible metal, to replace [[#Great Gate|the gates]] that had been broken in the [[War of the Ring]]. The Dwarves improved the layout of the city's streets, and the Elves planted trees in the city. The [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagle]] who brought news of Sauron's defeat to Minas Tirith refers to the city as the Tower of Anor.

Jackson's version interprets the top of the rock as flattened and paved, and places the coronation of [[Aragorn]] there. As with most other landmarks in the film, the city is portrayed as isolated and sparsely populated.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The appearance and structure of the city was based upon the inhabited [[tidal island]] and [[abbey]] of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], France.<ref name=\"Morrison 2014\"/>\n\nPortions of Minas Tirith were constructed as full-scale sets, and the whole city as a very large, highly detailed miniature or \"[[bigature]]\" by [[Weta Workshop]]. [[Weta Digital]], a division of Weta Workshop, created a remarkably detailed three-dimensional digital model for [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] shots, along with the whole of its surrounding environment including the Pelennor Fields and Mindolluin (but not the Rammas Echor, which was visually omitted from the films despite being mentioned in the dialogue, where [[Th\u00e9oden]] gave the order to the Rohirrim beginning \"After you pass the Wall...\" quoted directly from the book). The set was built on the foundations of the disassembled Helm's Deep set.\n\nIn the novel, the outermost walls of Minas Tirith were black and virtually indestructible, like the similar black surface of [[Orthanc]], as they were built by the [[D\u00fanedain]] before their craft waned in exile. Tolkien says only an earthquake or similar seismic convulsion could cause them significant damage. Jackson depicted all of the walls as white, and many of them were easily destroyed.\n\nIn the films, the towers of Minas Tirith are equipped with [[trebuchet]]s. However, this superior kind of siege engine is not specifically mentioned in the book.\n\nIn the video game ''[[Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'', players in the evil campaign can destroy the city.<ref name=\"conquest\">{{cite web|date=2009-04-06|author=Irish Amabel Capati|url=http://www.pcmag-mideast.com/productreview.aspx?_reviewID=1484&mode=1&pid=0|title=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest|publisher= PC Magazine Middle and Near East |accessdate=20 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there are maps in ''[[Minecraft]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title='Minecraft' Building Ideas: Word Processor, Coliseum And More Of Our Favorite Builds|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/minecraft-building-ideas-word-processor-coliseum-more-our-favorite-builds-1763063|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=28 December 2016|date=18 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Minecraft: Jeder Herrscher w\u00e4re neidisch!

The [[principality]] became part of the scattered holdings of the [[house of Orange-Nassau]] from the time that [[William the Silent]] inherited the title of [[Prince of Orange]] from his [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon|cousin]] in 1544, until it was finally ceded to [[France]] in 1713 under the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]].  Although permanently lost by the Nassaus then, this fief gave its name to the extant [[House of Orange|Royal House of the Netherlands]]. The area of the principality was approximately {{Convert|12|mi}} long by {{Convert|9|mi}} wide, or {{Convert|108|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite book\n  | author=George Ripley And Charles A.

Appleton And Company\n  | year =1873\n  | location =article on Principality of Orange}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Carolingian counts of Orange had their origin in the 8th century, and the fief passed into the family of the [[lords of Baux]]. The Baux counts of Orange became fully independent with the breakup of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] after 1033. In 1163 Orange was raised to a principality, as a [[fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn 1365, Orange university was founded by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] when he was in [[Arles]] for his coronation as [[king of Arles]].\n[[File:Oranje1547.png|thumb|left|Orange within papal [[Comtat Venaissin]] as of 1547]]\nIn 1431 the Count of Provence waived taxation duties for Orange's rulers ([[Mary of Baux-Orange]] and [[John III of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Ch\u00e2lons]] of Burgundy) in exchange for liquid assets to be used for a ransom. The town and principality of Orange was a part of administration and province of [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nIn 1544, [[William the Silent]], count of [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]], with large properties in the Netherlands, inherited the principality. William, 11 years old at the time, was the cousin of [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon]] who died without an heir when he was shot at St. Dizier in 1544 during the Franco-Imperial wars.  Ren\u00e9, it turned out, willed his entire fortune to this very young relative. Among those titles and estates was the Principality of Orange.  Ren\u00e9's mother, Claudia, had held the title prior to it being passed to young William since Philibert de Ch\u00e2lon was her brother.\n\nWhen William inherited the Principality, it was incorporated into the holdings of what became the [[House of Orange]]. This pitched it into the [[Protestant]] side in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], during which the town was badly damaged. In 1568 the [[Eighty Years' War]] began with William as [[Stadtholder]] of Holland leading the bid for independence of the Netherlands from Spain. William the Silent was assassinated in [[Delft]] in 1584. It was his son, [[Maurice of Nassau]] (Prince of Orange after his elder brother died in 1618), with the help of [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who solidified the independence of the Dutch republic.\n\nAs an independent enclave within France, Orange became an attractive destination for Protestants and a [[Huguenot]] stronghold. William III of Orange, who ruled England as [[William III of England]], was the last Prince of Orange to rule the principality. The principality was captured by the forces of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] under Fran\u00e7ois Adh\u00e9mar de Monteil [[Comte de Grignan]], in 1672 during the [[Franco-Dutch War]], and again in August 1682, but William did not concede his claim to rule.  In 1702, William III died childless and the right to the principality became a matter of dispute between [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz]], who both claimed the title 'Prince of Orange'.  In 1702 also, Louis XIV of France enfeoffed [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti]], a relative of the Ch\u00e2lon dynasty, with the Principality of Orange, so that there were three claimants to the title.\n\nFinally in 1713 in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], Frederick I of Prussia ceded the Principality to France (without surrendering the princely title) in which cession the Holy Roman Empire as suzerain concurred, though John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, the other claimant to the principality, did not concur. Only in 1732, with the [[Treaty of Partage]], did John William Friso's successor [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], renounce all his claims to the territory, but again (like Frederick I) he did not renounce his claim to the title. In the same treaty an agreement was made between both claimants, stipulating that both houses be allowed to use the title.\n\nIn 1713, after Orange was officially ceded to France, it became a part of the Province of the [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nFollowing the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, Orange was absorbed into the French ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Dr\u00f4me]] in 1790, then [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], then finally [[Vaucluse]].\n\nIn 1814 after the defeat of Napoleon, the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] was not revived but replaced into the [[Kingdom of the United Netherlands]], under a King of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. In 1815 the [[Congress of Vienna]] took care of a French sensitivity by stipulating that the Kingdom of the Netherlands would be ruled by the [[House of Oranje-Nassau]] \u2013 \"Oranje\", not \"Orange\" as had been the custom until then.

The castle and fortress sat on an outcropping of rock from the '''[[:fr:Colline Saint-Eutrope|Colline Saint-Eutrope]]''' with the town below.  The natural defense provided by the escarpment allowed the princes to control all the approaches to Orange and the surrounding countryside, including the passage up and down the Rhone, and the approaches from the Mediterranean.  It also made the fortress impervious to the military technology of the time until Louis XIV overwhelmed it with his armies in 1672.\n\n[[File:Chateau and city of Orange 17th century.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Chateau of the Princes of Orange and city of Orange 17th century]]\n\n:''\u00ab Du sommet de la colline, s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 une centaine de m\u00e8tres au-dessus de la plaine, et dominant la Ville d\u2019Orange, la vue embrasse l\u2019admirable paysage du Comtat jusqu\u2019au-del\u00e0 d\u2019Avignon, et des C\u00e9vennes au mont Ventoux.\n:''Enfin ses flancs plant\u00e9s d\u2019arbres forment un d\u00e9cor grandiose aux imposants vestiges romains, constituant dans leur ensemble un site dont la protection et la conservation s\u2019imposent au premier chef<ref>Extrait du rapport de la Commission sup\u00e9rieure des sites, mars 1933 (dossier Minist\u00e8re).</ref>. \u00bb''\n\n=== The Ch\u00e2teau ===\nIn the 12th century, [[:fr:Tiburge d'Orange|Tiburge d\u2019Orange]], daughter [[:fr:Raimbaud II d'Orange|Count Raimbaud of Nice]], \nrebuilt the Roman walls of the town and rehabilitated the ancient \"castrum Aurasice\". In the 14th century, the Les Baux princes of Orange consolidated the donjon and rampart of the chateau in order to resist the assaults the \"grandes compagnies\" that were devastating Provence at the time.  The population of the town was concentrated around the fortress in an area much smaller than the ancient Roman town.

The [[principality]] became part of the scattered holdings of the [[house of Orange-Nassau]] from the time that [[William the Silent]] inherited the title of [[Prince of Orange]] from his [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon|cousin]] in 1544, until it was finally ceded to [[France]] in 1713 under the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]].  Although permanently lost by the Nassaus then, this fief gave its name to the extant [[House of Orange|Royal House of the Netherlands]]. The area of the principality was approximately {{Convert|12|mi}} long by {{Convert|9|mi}} wide, or {{Convert|108|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite book\n  | author=George Ripley And Charles A.

The Baux counts of Orange became fully independent with the breakup of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] after 1033. In 1163 Orange was raised to a principality, as a [[fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn 1365, Orange university was founded by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] when he was in [[Arles]] for his coronation as [[king of Arles]].\n[[File:Oranje1547.png|thumb|left|Orange within papal [[Comtat Venaissin]] as of 1547]]\nIn 1431 the Count of Provence waived taxation duties for Orange's rulers ([[Mary of Baux-Orange]] and [[John III of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Ch\u00e2lons]] of Burgundy) in exchange for liquid assets to be used for a ransom. The town and principality of Orange was a part of administration and province of [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nIn 1544, [[William the Silent]], count of [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]], with large properties in the Netherlands, inherited the principality. William, 11 years old at the time, was the cousin of [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon]] who died without an heir when he was shot at St. Dizier in 1544 during the Franco-Imperial wars.  Ren\u00e9, it turned out, willed his entire fortune to this very young relative. Among those titles and estates was the Principality of Orange.  Ren\u00e9's mother, Claudia, had held the title prior to it being passed to young William since Philibert de Ch\u00e2lon was her brother.\n\nWhen William inherited the Principality, it was incorporated into the holdings of what became the [[House of Orange]]. This pitched it into the [[Protestant]] side in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], during which the town was badly damaged. In 1568 the [[Eighty Years' War]] began with William as [[Stadtholder]] of Holland leading the bid for independence of the Netherlands from Spain. William the Silent was assassinated in [[Delft]] in 1584. It was his son, [[Maurice of Nassau]] (Prince of Orange after his elder brother died in 1618), with the help of [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who solidified the independence of the Dutch republic.\n\nAs an independent enclave within France, Orange became an attractive destination for Protestants and a [[Huguenot]] stronghold. William III of Orange, who ruled England as [[William III of England]], was the last Prince of Orange to rule the principality. The principality was captured by the forces of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] under Fran\u00e7ois Adh\u00e9mar de Monteil [[Comte de Grignan]], in 1672 during the [[Franco-Dutch War]], and again in August 1682, but William did not concede his claim to rule.  In 1702, William III died childless and the right to the principality became a matter of dispute between [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz]], who both claimed the title 'Prince of Orange'.  In 1702 also, Louis XIV of France enfeoffed [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti]], a relative of the Ch\u00e2lon dynasty, with the Principality of Orange, so that there were three claimants to the title.\n\nFinally in 1713 in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], Frederick I of Prussia ceded the Principality to France (without surrendering the princely title) in which cession the Holy Roman Empire as suzerain concurred, though John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, the other claimant to the principality, did not concur. Only in 1732, with the [[Treaty of Partage]], did John William Friso's successor [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], renounce all his claims to the territory, but again (like Frederick I) he did not renounce his claim to the title. In the same treaty an agreement was made between both claimants, stipulating that both houses be allowed to use the title.\n\nIn 1713, after Orange was officially ceded to France, it became a part of the Province of the [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nFollowing the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, Orange was absorbed into the French ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Dr\u00f4me]] in 1790, then [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], then finally [[Vaucluse]].\n\nIn 1814 after the defeat of Napoleon, the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] was not revived but replaced into the [[Kingdom of the United Netherlands]], under a King of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. In 1815 the [[Congress of Vienna]] took care of a French sensitivity by stipulating that the Kingdom of the Netherlands would be ruled by the [[House of Oranje-Nassau]] \u2013 \"Oranje\", not \"Orange\" as had been the custom until then.  The English language, however, continues to use the term ''Orange-Nassau''.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Couv\u00e9e\n  | first =D.H.\n  | author2 =G.
