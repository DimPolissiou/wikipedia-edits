Written in 1946 and premiered in Philadelphia that year, ''Street Scene'' is based on the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Street Scene (play)|play of the same name]] by Rice. \n\nIt was Weill who referred to the piece as an \"American opera\", intending it as a groundbreaking synthesis of European traditional opera and American musical theater. He received the first [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for his work, after the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] premiere in 1947.<ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardscategoryinfo.cfm?catname=Score Tony Award for Best Original Score.]</ref> Considered far more an opera than a musical, ''Street Scene'' is regularly produced by professional opera companies and has never been revived on Broadway. Musically and culturally, even dramatically, the work inhabits the mid-ground between Weill's ''[[The Threepenny Opera|Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928) and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957).\n \nThe score contains operatic arias and ensembles, some of them, such as Anna Maurrant's \"Somehow I Never Could Believe\" and Frank Maurrant's \"Let Things Be Like They Always Was,\" with links and references to the style of [[Giacomo Puccini]]. It also has jazz and blues influences, in \"I Got a Marble and a Star\" and \"Lonely House\".<ref name=Thuleen/> Some of the more Broadway-style musical numbers are \"Wrapped In a Ribbon and Tied In a Bow\", \"Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?\" and \"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\", an extended song-and-dance sequence. [[Benny Goodman]] and His Orchestra recorded \"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed\" with [[Johnny Mercer]] on the vocal in 1947. It was also recorded by the jazz vocal group [[The Hi-Lo's]].\n\n==Background==\nIn Germany, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Weill had already begun to use American jazz and popular song elements in his operas.  After fleeing from [[Nazi Germany]] in 1933, he worked in Paris, then England, and then, beginning in 1935, in New York, US. He made a study of American popular and stage music and worked to further adapt his music to new American styles in his writing for Broadway, film and radio.  He strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be successful both commercially and artistically.<ref name=Thuleen>Thuleen, Nancy, [http://www.nthuleen.com/papers/Mus928weill.html#(10) \"Realism in Language and Music: Kurt Weill's Street Scene\"]. May 1997, accessed May 4, 2008.</ref> Weill wrote:\n: \"It's my opinion that we can and will develop a musical-dramatic form in this country (America) but I don't think it will be called 'opera', or that it will grow out of the opera which has become a thing separate from the commercial theater, dependent upon other means than box-office appeal for its continuance.  It will develop from and remain a part of the American theater \u2013 'Broadway' theater, if you like.  More than anything else, I want to be a part in that development.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 253.</ref>\n\nWeill sought to create musical theatre that would \"integrate drama and music, spoken word, song, and movement.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 359.</ref>  He further wrote:\n:\"This form of theater has its special attraction for the composer, because it allows him to use a great variety of musical idioms, to write music that is both serious and light, operatic and popular, emotional and sophisticated, orchestral and vocal. Each show of this type has to create its own style, its own texture, its own relationship between words and music, because music becomes a truly integral part of the play \u2013 it helps deepen the emotions and clarify the structure.<ref>Quoted in Graziano, John. \"Musical Dialects in Down in the Valley\", ''A New Orpheus: Essays on Kurt Weill'', ed. Kim H. Kowalke (1986), New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 299.</ref>\n\nWeill saw Rice's naturalistic play in 1930 and wanted to adapt it.  As he wrote:\n:\"It was a simple story of everyday life in a big city, a story of love and passion and greed and death.  I saw great musical possibilities in its theatrical device \u2013 life in a tenement house between one evening and the next afternoon.  And it seemed like a great challenge to me to find the inherent poetry in these people and to blend my music with the stark realism of the play.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 348.</ref>  \n\nIn 1936, Weill met Rice in New York and suggested the adaptation, but Rice turned him down.  After the successes of Weill's ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'' in 1938, ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'' in 1940, and ''[[One Touch of Venus]]'' in 1943 (and after Weill had composed [[incidental music]] for Rice's ''Two on an Island'' in 1939), Weill asked again, and Rice agreed.  The two chose [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet Langston Hughes to \"lift the everyday language of the people into a simple, unsophisticated poetry\", as Weill put it.<ref>Quoted, in program notes by Jane Vial Jaffe, May 2008, [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[Chautauqua Opera]] production of ''Street Scene''.</ref>\n\nIn order to enhance the realism of the new work, the collaborators utilized dialogue scenes, sometimes underscored by music.  To create music that would portray the ethnic melting pot of characters described in Rice's book, Weill travelled to neighborhoods in New York, watching children at play and observing New Yorkers. Hughes took Weill to [[Harlem]] nightclubs to hear the newest musical idioms of black American jazz and blues. Hughes wrote: \"The resulting song was composed in a national American Negro idiom; but a German, or someone else, could sing it without sounding strange or out of place.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 350.</ref>  Weill and many critics have considered the score to be his masterpiece.<ref name=Thuleen/>\n\n==Production history==\nAfter a tryout in Philadelphia, revisions were made, and ''Street Scene'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Adelphi Theatre (New York City)|Adelphi Theatre]] on January 9, 1947. It closed on May 17, 1947, after 148 performances, experiencing high running costs. The production was directed by Charles Friedman, with choreography by [[Anna Sokolow]], and produced by [[Dwight Deere Wiman]] and the [[Playwrights' Company]] ([[Maxwell Anderson]]; [[S. N. Behrman]]; [[Elmer Rice]]; [[Robert E. Sherwood]]; [[Sidney Howard]]). Scenic and lighting design were by [[Jo Mielziner]]; costume design was by [[Lucinda Ballard]]. The production starred [[Anne Jeffreys]] as Rose Maurrant, Polyna Stoska as Anna Maurrant, [[Norman Cordon]] as Frank Maurrant, Brian Sullivan as Sam Kaplan, [[Hope Emerson]] as Emma Jones, [[Sheila Bond]] as Mae Jones, and [[Danny Daniels]] as Dick McGann. Weill received the first Tony Award for Best Original Score, and Ballard received the 1947 [[Tony Award]] for Best Costume Design, competing with other strong musicals that year, notably ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' by [[Burton Lane]] and ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' by [[Frederick Loewe]]. The [[New York City Opera]] revived ''Street Scene'' several times, notably in 1959, 1979, and 1990, as stated in the ''[[New York Times]]'' review of the 1990 production linked below.\n\nIt was staged by the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based [[Minnesota Opera]] in 2001.<ref>https://www.twincities.com%2F2011%2F07%2F03%2Fgirl-fridays-street-scene-features-26-actors-doing-60-characters%2F&usg=AOvVaw0AFrLrd8k6WY0xdvJO8U1c</ref>\n\nA production by the [[English National Opera]] at the London [[Coliseum Theatre]] in 1989 included [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Mae Jones. \n\nThe Opera Group, [[Young Vic]], and [[Watford Palace Theatre]] gave the first UK production in 20 years in July 2008 [https://www.thestage.co.uk/?s=street+scene], winning the [[Evening Standard Award]] 2008 for Best Musical. Another production was performed in the grounds of the [[Old Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]] on July 19, 2008, with the cast largely drawn from students from [[Trinity College of Music]]. In 2011 ''Street Scene'' was performed by the Opera/Music Theatre Workshop of [[Southeastern Louisiana University]]<ref>The production played to a packed Pottle Music Auditorium on February 4\u20135, 2011.{{cite news \n|first = Jordan\n|last = Whitworth\n|title = 'Street Scene' sees success\n|page = 4\n|date = February 8, 2011\n|url = http://media-newswire.com/release_1139700.html\n|newspaper = Lion's Roar\n|place = Hammond, Louisiana\n|publisher = Southeastern Louisiana University\n}} (Print article differs significantly from online press release.)</ref> and, in German, by the [[Bayerische Theaterakademie August Everding]] and the [[Munich Radio Orchestra]], led by [[Ulf Schirmer]].\n\nThe Opera Group presented the first performance in Austria in October 2011, and the [[Semper Oper]] in [[Dresden]] produced the work to great acclaim earlier in 2011.

The story focuses on two plotlines: the romance between Rose Maurrant and her neighbor Sam Kaplan; and on the extramarital affair of Rose's mother, Anna, which is eventually discovered by Rose's irritable father, Frank.  The show portrays the ordinary romances, squabbles and gossips of the neighbors, as the mounting tensions involving the Maurrant family eventually build into a tragedy of epic proportions.\n\n===Act 1===\nAs the curtain rises, we are introduced to some of the residents of the apartment block where the action takes place. Emma Jones and Greta Fiorentino lament the incredible heatwave that is gripping New York (''Ain't It Awful, The Heat?''). They are joined by another neighbor Olga Olsen, who tells of the stress of dealing with her newborn baby and her husband Carl, and an old man, Abraham Kaplan, who sings of the murders and scandals in the press, whilst joining in with the opening number. Henry Davis, the janitor, enters from the basement and sings of his ambitions to greater things (''I Got A Marble And A Star''). Young Willie Maurrant enters and calls for his mother, who enters at the window and throws him a dime to buy a soda. The three women (Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Fiorentino and Mrs. Olsen) persuade Mrs. Maurrant to come downstairs and be sociable, and as she descends, they gossip about the rumour that Mrs. Maurrant and Steve Sankey, the milkman, have been having an affair (''Get A Load Of That''). Mrs. Maurrant comes down to chat and Mrs. Olsen goes back down to her cellar apartment to tend to her baby. Sam Kaplan comes out of the house and asks after Mrs. Maurrant's daughter, Rose, but she hasn't got back from work yet. He leaves to go to the library. \n\nDaniel Buchanan enters, jittery; he's nervous because his wife is upstairs about to have a baby. He and the women sing of the perils of childbirth in a short Arietta, ''When A Woman Has A Baby''. Just as he runs upstairs to tend to his wife, Mrs. Maurrant's husband Frank comes home. He mentions that he is going on a business trip to New Haven tomorrow, and argues with his wife about Rose not being home yet (''She Shouldn't Be Staying Out Nights''). Fuming, he storms into the house, just as George Jones returns home from work and chats with the ladies for a while. Anna Maurrant sings an aria about the importance of putting your faith in a brighter tomorrow (''Somehow I Never Could Believe''). Steve Sankey enters and a tense scene ensues between him and the suspecting women. Almost immediately after he departs, Mrs. Maurrant heads off in the same direction, under the guise of going to look for her son. Mr. Jones, Mr. Olsen, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Fiorentino sing more about the scandal (''Whatcha Think Of That''). Mrs. Olsen runs in excited and says that she has just seen Sankey and Mrs. Maurrant standing close together around the back of a local warehouse. \n\nLippo Fiorentino returns home from work with an armful of ice cream cones for everybody. The two Fiorentinos, the two Olsens, Mr. Jones and Henry Davis sing a jubilant sextet praising ice cream (''Ice Cream Sextet''). Maurrant has been watching, and when his wife comes back he questions her about where she's been. She tells him she's been looking for Willie, and Maurrant and Abraham Kaplan argue about parenting, and later economics. Kaplan uses the example of the Hildebrand family who live upstairs, who are run by a struggling single mother who is unable to pay the rent, to illustrate his point. Maurrant and Kaplan's argument almost becomes physical, but the neighbors and Kaplan's granddaughter Shirley hold the two men back. Maurrant sings about how he longs for a return to traditional moral values in ''Let Things Be Like They Always Was''. Immediately after, Jennie Hildebrand and other high-school girls enter the street coming home from their graduation ceremony. The ensemble sings a jubilant celebration number, ''Wrapped In A Ribbon And Tied In A Bow''. Steve Sankey's entrance causes an abrupt end to the celebrations. After the awkward silence of the neighbors forces him to leave, Sam  brings Willie Maurrant on in tears. Willie has been fighting with a local kid and Sam stepped in to break it up. Mr. Maurrant leaves to go to the local bar to have a drink, warning that there'll be trouble if Rose isn't home by the time he gets back, whilst Mrs. Maurrant takes Willie upstairs. As soon as they leave, the neighbors all begin gossiping about the Maurrant family. Sam gets passionately upset, chiding the neighbors for gossiping so much behind their backs, and then storms off. \n\nAll the neighbors say goodnight and go to bed, except Mr. Jones, who goes to the bar to shoot some pool. Sam returns onstage and sings of his crippling loneliness (''Lonely House''). Sam goes into the house, then Rose enters with her boss, Harry Easter, who has walked her home. Easter attempts to charm Rose, taking her in his arms and kissing her. He then tries to win her over with a tempting song, promising her that if she were to run away with him he could get her a gig on Broadway (''Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?''). Rose, however, sticks to her convictions, and sings a Cavatina about how she will always choose true love over showy promises (''What Good Would The Moon Be?''). Rose sees her father returning home and tells Easter to leave. Maurrant questions her about who she was talking to, and gets angry when she tells him that they had been out dancing. He goes upstairs to bed, furious. Buchanan rushes out of the house and asks Rose to go and phone the doctor, as his wife's baby is about to be born. He heads back upstairs, and as Rose is leaving, she passes young Mae Jones and her suitor, Dick McGann. The two have been out dancing and are flirting, and they sing a fast-paced jitterbug about their infatuation with one another (''Moon-faced, Starry-eyed''). After they dance on the sidewalk, they passionately run upstairs into the house, after saying a drunken good-night to Rose, who has returned from phoning the doctor. \n\nMae's brutish elder brother Vincent returns home, and begins harassing Rose. Sam sees him hassling her out of the window, and comes outside to confront him, however Vincent violently lays him out on the sidewalk. Vincent is about to continue his attack when his mother, Mrs. Jones, comes outside to see what the commotion is. He immediately seizes up and innocently goes upstairs at his mother's order. Sam and Rose are left alone, and Sam is embarrassed that he was humiliated by Vincent in front of Rose. Sam laments the terrible strife of living in the slums, but Rose calms him down by reminding him of a poem he once read her (''Remember That I Care''). Dr. Wilson arrives and goes upstairs to tend to Mrs. Buchanan, and Mr. Maurrant calls Rose and tells her to go to bed. Sam and Rose share a kiss on the sidewalk, and then Rose runs up to bed, just as Henry Davis comes upstairs and starts sweeping the stoop for the night (''I Got A Marble And A Star (Reprise)''). Rose calls goodnight to Sam from the window and Sam is left alone on the midnight street as the curtain slowly falls to end Act 1.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: Daybreak, the next morning''\n\nMr. Jones drunkenly returns home from the bar and reels into the stinky house. Dr. Wilson leaves the house, telling Buchanan to let his wife get plenty of rest, and Dick McGann and Mae Jones share a much less passionate goodbye in the cold light of day than their energetic exchanges the night before. Willie Maurrant, Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Henry's daughter Grace, and other local children play an energetic game (''Catch Me If You Can''), which ends in a large scuffle. Rose calls for them to stop it from the window, whilst Sam comes outside and physically breaks the fight up. The children all disperse. Sam and Rose have a brief conversation, as Rose tells him that she has to go to the funeral of the head of her  real estate firm this morning. Shirley comes outside and tells Sam to come in for breakfast, as Rose goes back inside to do the dishes. Buchanan comes outside and tells the Fiorentino's that he has had a little baby girl in the night. Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Maurrant enter, and Mrs. Jones asks her about Mrs. Buchanan, who Mrs. Maurrant has been looking after all night. Mrs. Jones leaves to walk her dog, and Mrs. Maurrant leaves to go to the grocery store. Rose and Mr. Maurrant come out of the house and Rose tries to persuade him to be nicer to her mother. Mrs. Maurrant returns and the three have a family argument about Mr. Maurrant's behaviour. Mrs. Maurrant asks him nonchalantly how long he'll be gone on his business trip for, and Mr. Maurrant accuses her of having an affair, which she denies. He leaves in a rage, and Mrs. Maurrant and Rose lament his behaviour (''There'll Be Trouble''). Willie comes on and Rose chides him for looking scruffy. Willie and Rose have a verbal disagreement and Rose quickly storms into the house. Mrs. Maurrant tells him that that is no way to talk to his sister, and that she is relying on him to turn into a good man when he is older (''A Boy Like You''). Willie leaves for school and Mrs. Maurrant goes into the house, as Rose comes out. Shirley Kaplan comes out of the house and asks Rose why she spends so much time with Sam, when he should be concentrating on his work. Shirley leaves for work, and Vincent Jones comes out of the house and starts harassing Rose again, but promptly leaves as Sam comes out of the house. Rose mentions Easter's tempting offer of running away to Sam, and Sam gets upset, saying that she would be better off running away with him, and the two sing of their intention to run away together (''We'll Go Away Together''). Easter arrives to walk Rose to the funeral, and the two leave. Sam goes into the house, as Sankey appears. Mrs. Maurrant appears at her window and tells him to come upstairs, as Mr. Maurrant has gone on his business trip and Rose will be at the funeral all morning. As Sankey hurries upstairs he passes Sam coming out of the house, who looks up at the window and sees Mrs. Maurrant pulling the shades shut. Sam sits on the stoop and reads a book, as James Henry, a city-marshall, and Fred Cullen, his assistant, appear. They call Henry Davis up and tell him that they're here to dispossess the Hildebrand family, and that since she has made no arrangements to have the furniture taken away, they'll have to dump it on the sidewalk. Henry goes back into the cellar as the two men enter the house. Mr. Maurrant returns, having changed his mind about the business trip. He sees the shades pulled shut and becomes furious. Sam pleads with him not to enter the house but he pushes him aside and runs upstairs. Mrs. Maurrant is heard screaming, and then two gunshots. Sankey appears at the window in terror, he tries to escape but Maurrant pulls him back inside and shoots him. Panic ensues, as Maurrant exits the house, covered in blood, and points his revolver at the crowd of gatherers in order to make his escape. Policemen, paramedics, concerned neighbors flood the scene. Rose returns from the funeral and sees the concerned crowd. Sam tries to keep her back but she cannot be restrained. The ensemble sings a tragic chorus number about the killing, ''The Woman Who Lived Up There''. Mrs. Maurrant's body is brought out of the house on a stretcher and taken to the hospital and the citizens rush after the ambulance, as Rose, quietly crying in Sam's arms, follows. The curtain slowly falls as the two city-marshalls continue bringing the Hildebrand furniture out onto the sidewalk.\n\n''Scene 2: Mid-afternoon, the same day''\n\nTwo young nursemaids appear at the house and sing about the scandal of the murder that has already spread around the city, as they try to quiet the children they are looking after (''Lullaby''). As the nursemaids leave, Rose enters, dressed in black. She asks Officer Murphy, the policeman who is still in her apartment, if they have found her father yet, and he tells her that they haven't. Sam enters and tells Rose that he has taken Willie from school round to her aunt's house. Shirley enters and expresses her condolences to Rose, and the two of them go up to Rose's apartment together, as Rose is afraid to go up alone. Sam tells his grandfather that the police are going to make him testify against Maurrant, when two shots are heard in the distance. Buchanan and Olsen run on and tell Sam and Rose (who has run out of the house, alerted by the noise) that the police have found her father hiding in the basement of a house down the street. Two policemen bring on Maurrant, who is covered in blood and dirt. The officers are taking him away when he begs for one minute with his daughter, which they grant him. He and Rose talk about the murder, as the crowd looks on (''He Loved Her Too''). The officers take Maurrant off, and Rose and Sam are left alone onstage. Rose starts to enter the house when Sam asks what she's going to do. She tells him she'll go away, but when he says that he'll go with her as they discussed that morning, Rose says she has to go off alone. Sam finally confesses to Rose that he is in love with her, and that his life is nothing without her. Rose says that her parents have proved that two people do not belong together, and she says goodbye to Sam (''Don't Forget The Lilac Bush''). Shirley comes out of the house and hands Rose a suitcase full of her things. Rose starts walking off, then returns and swiftly kisses Sam, but he breaks away and goes abruptly into the house. Rose stands looking after him, then picks up her bag and walks off. Mrs. Fiorentino, Mrs. Olsen and Mrs. Jones appear and immediately begin gossiping about Rose and Easter hanging around on the street late last night (''Ain't It Awful, The Heat? (Reprise)''), as they once again lament the unbearable heat and the curtain slowly falls.\n\n====Songs====\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Ain't It Awful, The Heat?\" \u2013 Greta Fiorentino, Emma Jones, Olga and Carl Olsen, Abraham Kaplan\n* \"I Got A Marble And A Star\" \u2013 Henry Davis\n* \"Get A Load Of That\" \u2013 Emma Jones, Greta Fiorentino, Olga Olsen\n* \"When A Woman Has A Baby\" \u2013 Daniel Buchanan, Greta Fiorentino, Emma Jones, Anna Maurrant\n* \"She Shouldn't Be Staying Out Nights\" \u2013 Frank and Anna Maurrant, Greta Fiorentino\n* \"Somehow I Never Could Believe\" \u2013 Anna Maurrant\n* \"Whatcha Think Of That?\" \u2013 Emma and George Jones, Carl Olsen, Greta Fiorentino\n* \"Ice Cream Sextet\" \u2013 Lippo and Greta Fiorentino, Carl and Olga Olsen, George Jones, Henry Davis\n* \"Let Things Be Like They Always Was\" \u2013 Frank Maurrant\n* \"Wrapped In A Ribbon And Tied In A Bow\" \u2013 Jennie Hildebrand, Ensemble\n* \"Lonely House\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan\n* \"Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?\" \u2013 Harry Easter\n* \"What Good Would The Moon Be?\" \u2013 Rose Maurrant\n* \"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\" \u2013 Dick McGann, Mae Jones\n* \"Remember That I Care\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan, Rose Maurrant\n* \"I Got A Marble And A Star (Reprise)\" \u2013 Henry Davis\n{{col-break}}\n\n;Act 2\n* \"Catch Me If You Can\" \u2013 Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Willie Maurrant, Grace Davis, Children\n* \"There'll Be Trouble\" \u2013 Frank, Rose and Anna Maurrant\n* \"A Boy Like You\" \u2013 Anna Maurrant\n* \"We'll Go Away Together\" \u2013 Rose Maurrant, Sam Kaplan\n* \"The Woman Who Lived Up There\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Lullaby\" \u2013 Nursemaid #1, Nursemaid #2\n* \"I Loved Her, Too\" \u2013 Frank and Rose Maurrant, Ensemble\n* \"Don't Forget The Lilac Bush\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan, Rose Maurrant\n* \"Ain't It Awful, The Heat?

Written in 1946 and premiered in Philadelphia that year, ''Street Scene'' is based on the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Street Scene (play)|play of the same name]] by Rice. \n\nIt was Weill who referred to the piece as an \"American opera\", intending it as a groundbreaking synthesis of European traditional opera and American musical theater. He received the first [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for his work, after the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] premiere in 1947.<ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardscategoryinfo.cfm?catname=Score Tony Award for Best Original Score.]</ref> Considered far more an opera than a musical, ''Street Scene'' is regularly produced by professional opera companies and has never been revived on Broadway. Musically and culturally, even dramatically, the work inhabits the mid-ground between Weill's ''[[The Threepenny Opera|Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928) and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957).\n \nThe score contains operatic arias and ensembles, some of them, such as Anna Maurrant's \"Somehow I Never Could Believe\" and Frank Maurrant's \"Let Things Be Like They Always Was,\" with links and references to the style of [[Giacomo Puccini]]. It also has jazz and blues influences, in \"I Got a Marble and a Star\" and \"Lonely House\".<ref name=Thuleen/> Some of the more Broadway-style musical numbers are \"Wrapped In a Ribbon and Tied In a Bow\", \"Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?\" and \"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\", an extended song-and-dance sequence. [[Benny Goodman]] and His Orchestra recorded \"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed\" with [[Johnny Mercer]] on the vocal in 1947. It was also recorded by the jazz vocal group [[The Hi-Lo's]].\n\n==Background==\nIn Germany, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Weill had already begun to use American jazz and popular song elements in his operas.  After fleeing from [[Nazi Germany]] in 1933, he worked in Paris, then England, and then, beginning in 1935, in New York, US. He made a study of American popular and stage music and worked to further adapt his music to new American styles in his writing for Broadway, film and radio.  He strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be successful both commercially and artistically.<ref name=Thuleen>Thuleen, Nancy, [http://www.nthuleen.com/papers/Mus928weill.html#(10) \"Realism in Language and Music: Kurt Weill's Street Scene\"]. May 1997, accessed May 4, 2008.</ref> Weill wrote:\n: \"It's my opinion that we can and will develop a musical-dramatic form in this country (America) but I don't think it will be called 'opera', or that it will grow out of the opera which has become a thing separate from the commercial theater, dependent upon other means than box-office appeal for its continuance.  It will develop from and remain a part of the American theater \u2013 'Broadway' theater, if you like.  More than anything else, I want to be a part in that development.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 253.</ref>\n\nWeill sought to create musical theatre that would \"integrate drama and music, spoken word, song, and movement.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 359.</ref>  He further wrote:\n:\"This form of theater has its special attraction for the composer, because it allows him to use a great variety of musical idioms, to write music that is both serious and light, operatic and popular, emotional and sophisticated, orchestral and vocal. Each show of this type has to create its own style, its own texture, its own relationship between words and music, because music becomes a truly integral part of the play \u2013 it helps deepen the emotions and clarify the structure.<ref>Quoted in Graziano, John. \"Musical Dialects in Down in the Valley\", ''A New Orpheus: Essays on Kurt Weill'', ed. Kim H. Kowalke (1986), New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 299.</ref>\n\nWeill saw Rice's naturalistic play in 1930 and wanted to adapt it.  As he wrote:\n:\"It was a simple story of everyday life in a big city, a story of love and passion and greed and death.  I saw great musical possibilities in its theatrical device \u2013 life in a tenement house between one evening and the next afternoon.  And it seemed like a great challenge to me to find the inherent poetry in these people and to blend my music with the stark realism of the play.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 348.</ref>  \n\nIn 1936, Weill met Rice in New York and suggested the adaptation, but Rice turned him down.  After the successes of Weill's ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'' in 1938, ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'' in 1940, and ''[[One Touch of Venus]]'' in 1943 (and after Weill had composed [[incidental music]] for Rice's ''Two on an Island'' in 1939), Weill asked again, and Rice agreed.  The two chose [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet Langston Hughes to \"lift the everyday language of the people into a simple, unsophisticated poetry\", as Weill put it.<ref>Quoted, in program notes by Jane Vial Jaffe, May 2008, [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[Chautauqua Opera]] production of ''Street Scene''.</ref>\n\nIn order to enhance the realism of the new work, the collaborators utilized dialogue scenes, sometimes underscored by music.  To create music that would portray the ethnic melting pot of characters described in Rice's book, Weill travelled to neighborhoods in New York, watching children at play and observing New Yorkers. Hughes took Weill to [[Harlem]] nightclubs to hear the newest musical idioms of black American jazz and blues. Hughes wrote: \"The resulting song was composed in a national American Negro idiom; but a German, or someone else, could sing it without sounding strange or out of place.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 350.</ref>  Weill and many critics have considered the score to be his masterpiece.<ref name=Thuleen/>\n\n==Production history==\nAfter a tryout in Philadelphia, revisions were made, and ''Street Scene'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Adelphi Theatre (New York City)|Adelphi Theatre]] on January 9, 1947. It closed on May 17, 1947, after 148 performances, experiencing high running costs. The production was directed by Charles Friedman, with choreography by [[Anna Sokolow]], and produced by [[Dwight Deere Wiman]] and the [[Playwrights' Company]] ([[Maxwell Anderson]]; [[S. N. Behrman]]; [[Elmer Rice]]; [[Robert E. Sherwood]]; [[Sidney Howard]]). Scenic and lighting design were by [[Jo Mielziner]]; costume design was by [[Lucinda Ballard]]. The production starred [[Anne Jeffreys]] as Rose Maurrant, Polyna Stoska as Anna Maurrant, [[Norman Cordon]] as Frank Maurrant, Brian Sullivan as Sam Kaplan, [[Hope Emerson]] as Emma Jones, [[Sheila Bond]] as Mae Jones, and [[Danny Daniels]] as Dick McGann. Weill received the first Tony Award for Best Original Score, and Ballard received the 1947 [[Tony Award]] for Best Costume Design, competing with other strong musicals that year, notably ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' by [[Burton Lane]] and ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' by [[Frederick Loewe]]. The [[New York City Opera]] revived ''Street Scene'' several times, notably in 1959, 1979, and 1990, as stated in the ''[[New York Times]]'' review of the 1990 production linked below.\n\nIt was staged by the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based [[Minnesota Opera]] in 2001.<ref>https://www.twincities.com%2F2011%2F07%2F03%2Fgirl-fridays-street-scene-features-26-actors-doing-60-characters%2F&usg=AOvVaw0AFrLrd8k6WY0xdvJO8U1c</ref>\n\nA production by the [[English National Opera]] at the London [[Coliseum Theatre]] in 1989 included [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Mae Jones. \n\nThe Opera Group, [[Young Vic]], and [[Watford Palace Theatre]] gave the first UK production in 20 years in July 2008 [https://www.thestage.co.uk/?s=street+scene], winning the [[Evening Standard Award]] 2008 for Best Musical. Another production was performed in the grounds of the [[Old Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]] on July 19, 2008, with the cast largely drawn from students from [[Trinity College of Music]]. In 2011 ''Street Scene'' was performed by the Opera/Music Theatre Workshop of [[Southeastern Louisiana University]]<ref>The production played to a packed Pottle Music Auditorium on February 4\u20135, 2011.{{cite news \n|first = Jordan\n|last = Whitworth\n|title = 'Street Scene' sees success\n|page = 4\n|date = February 8, 2011\n|url = http://media-newswire.com/release_1139700.html\n|newspaper = Lion's Roar\n|place = Hammond, Louisiana\n|publisher = Southeastern Louisiana University\n}} (Print article differs significantly from online press release.)</ref> and, in German, by the [[Bayerische Theaterakademie August Everding]] and the [[Munich Radio Orchestra]], led by [[Ulf Schirmer]].\n\nThe Opera Group presented the first performance in Austria in October 2011, and the [[Semper Oper]] in [[Dresden]] produced the work to great acclaim earlier in 2011.

The story focuses on two plotlines: the romance between Rose Maurrant and her neighbor Sam Kaplan; and on the extramarital affair of Rose's mother, Anna, which is eventually discovered by Rose's irritable father, Frank.  The show portrays the ordinary romances, squabbles and gossips of the neighbors, as the mounting tensions involving the Maurrant family eventually build into a tragedy of epic proportions.\n\n===Act 1===\nAs the curtain rises, we are introduced to some of the residents of the apartment block where the action takes place. Emma Jones and Greta Fiorentino lament the incredible heatwave that is gripping New York (''Ain't It Awful, The Heat?''). They are joined by another neighbor Olga Olsen, who tells of the stress of dealing with her newborn baby and her husband Carl, and an old man, Abraham Kaplan, who sings of the murders and scandals in the press, whilst joining in with the opening number. Henry Davis, the janitor, enters from the basement and sings of his ambitions to greater things (''I Got A Marble And A Star''). Young Willie Maurrant enters and calls for his mother, who enters at the window and throws him a dime to buy a soda. The three women (Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Fiorentino and Mrs. Olsen) persuade Mrs. Maurrant to come downstairs and be sociable, and as she descends, they gossip about the rumour that Mrs. Maurrant and Steve Sankey, the milkman, have been having an affair (''Get A Load Of That''). Mrs. Maurrant comes down to chat and Mrs. Olsen goes back down to her cellar apartment to tend to her baby. Sam Kaplan comes out of the house and asks after Mrs. Maurrant's daughter, Rose, but she hasn't got back from work yet. He leaves to go to the library. \n\nDaniel Buchanan enters, jittery; he's nervous because his wife is upstairs about to have a baby. He and the women sing of the perils of childbirth in a short Arietta, ''When A Woman Has A Baby''. Just as he runs upstairs to tend to his wife, Mrs. Maurrant's husband Frank comes home. He mentions that he is going on a business trip to New Haven tomorrow, and argues with his wife about Rose not being home yet (''She Shouldn't Be Staying Out Nights''). Fuming, he storms into the house, just as George Jones returns home from work and chats with the ladies for a while. Anna Maurrant sings an aria about the importance of putting your faith in a brighter tomorrow (''Somehow I Never Could Believe''). Steve Sankey enters and a tense scene ensues between him and the suspecting women. Almost immediately after he departs, Mrs. Maurrant heads off in the same direction, under the guise of going to look for her son. Mr. Jones, Mr. Olsen, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Fiorentino sing more about the scandal (''Whatcha Think Of That''). Mrs. Olsen runs in excited and says that she has just seen Sankey and Mrs. Maurrant standing close together around the back of a local warehouse. \n\nLippo Fiorentino returns home from work with an armful of ice cream cones for everybody. The two Fiorentinos, the two Olsens, Mr. Jones and Henry Davis sing a jubilant sextet praising ice cream (''Ice Cream Sextet''). Maurrant has been watching, and when his wife comes back he questions her about where she's been. She tells him she's been looking for Willie, and Maurrant and Abraham Kaplan argue about parenting, and later economics. Kaplan uses the example of the Hildebrand family who live upstairs, who are run by a struggling single mother who is unable to pay the rent, to illustrate his point. Maurrant and Kaplan's argument almost becomes physical, but the neighbors and Kaplan's granddaughter Shirley hold the two men back. Maurrant sings about how he longs for a return to traditional moral values in ''Let Things Be Like They Always Was''. Immediately after, Jennie Hildebrand and other high-school girls enter the street coming home from their graduation ceremony. The ensemble sings a jubilant celebration number, ''Wrapped In A Ribbon And Tied In A Bow''. Steve Sankey's entrance causes an abrupt end to the celebrations. After the awkward silence of the neighbors forces him to leave, Sam  brings Willie Maurrant on in tears. Willie has been fighting with a local kid and Sam stepped in to break it up. Mr. Maurrant leaves to go to the local bar to have a drink, warning that there'll be trouble if Rose isn't home by the time he gets back, whilst Mrs. Maurrant takes Willie upstairs. As soon as they leave, the neighbors all begin gossiping about the Maurrant family. Sam gets passionately upset, chiding the neighbors for gossiping so much behind their backs, and then storms off. \n\nAll the neighbors say goodnight and go to bed, except Mr. Jones, who goes to the bar to shoot some pool. Sam returns onstage and sings of his crippling loneliness (''Lonely House''). Sam goes into the house, then Rose enters with her boss, Harry Easter, who has walked her home. Easter attempts to charm Rose, taking her in his arms and kissing her. He then tries to win her over with a tempting song, promising her that if she were to run away with him he could get her a gig on Broadway (''Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?''). Rose, however, sticks to her convictions, and sings a Cavatina about how she will always choose true love over showy promises (''What Good Would The Moon Be?''). Rose sees her father returning home and tells Easter to leave. Maurrant questions her about who she was talking to, and gets angry when she tells him that they had been out dancing. He goes upstairs to bed, furious. Buchanan rushes out of the house and asks Rose to go and phone the doctor, as his wife's baby is about to be born. He heads back upstairs, and as Rose is leaving, she passes young Mae Jones and her suitor, Dick McGann. The two have been out dancing and are flirting, and they sing a fast-paced jitterbug about their infatuation with one another (''Moon-faced, Starry-eyed''). After they dance on the sidewalk, they passionately run upstairs into the house, after saying a drunken good-night to Rose, who has returned from phoning the doctor. \n\nMae's brutish elder brother Vincent returns home, and begins harassing Rose. Sam sees him hassling her out of the window, and comes outside to confront him, however Vincent violently lays him out on the sidewalk. Vincent is about to continue his attack when his mother, Mrs. Jones, comes outside to see what the commotion is. He immediately seizes up and innocently goes upstairs at his mother's order. Sam and Rose are left alone, and Sam is embarrassed that he was humiliated by Vincent in front of Rose. Sam laments the terrible strife of living in the slums, but Rose calms him down by reminding him of a poem he once read her (''Remember That I Care''). Dr. Wilson arrives and goes upstairs to tend to Mrs. Buchanan, and Mr. Maurrant calls Rose and tells her to go to bed. Sam and Rose share a kiss on the sidewalk, and then Rose runs up to bed, just as Henry Davis comes upstairs and starts sweeping the stoop for the night (''I Got A Marble And A Star (Reprise)''). Rose calls goodnight to Sam from the window and Sam is left alone on the midnight street as the curtain slowly falls to end Act 1.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: Daybreak, the next morning''\n\nMr. Jones drunkenly returns home from the bar and reels into the stinky house. Dr. Wilson leaves the house, telling Buchanan to let his wife get plenty of rest, and Dick McGann and Mae Jones share a much less passionate goodbye in the cold light of day than their energetic exchanges the night before. Willie Maurrant, Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Henry's daughter Grace, and other local children play an energetic game (''Catch Me If You Can''), which ends in a large scuffle. Rose calls for them to stop it from the window, whilst Sam comes outside and physically breaks the fight up. The children all disperse. Sam and Rose have a brief conversation, as Rose tells him that she has to go to the funeral of the head of her  real estate firm this morning. Shirley comes outside and tells Sam to come in for breakfast, as Rose goes back inside to do the dishes. Buchanan comes outside and tells the Fiorentino's that he has had a little baby girl in the night. Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Maurrant enter, and Mrs. Jones asks her about Mrs. Buchanan, who Mrs. Maurrant has been looking after all night. Mrs. Jones leaves to walk her dog, and Mrs. Maurrant leaves to go to the grocery store. Rose and Mr. Maurrant come out of the house and Rose tries to persuade him to be nicer to her mother. Mrs. Maurrant returns and the three have a family argument about Mr. Maurrant's behaviour. Mrs. Maurrant asks him nonchalantly how long he'll be gone on his business trip for, and Mr. Maurrant accuses her of having an affair, which she denies. He leaves in a rage, and Mrs. Maurrant and Rose lament his behaviour (''There'll Be Trouble''). Willie comes on and Rose chides him for looking scruffy. Willie and Rose have a verbal disagreement and Rose quickly storms into the house. Mrs. Maurrant tells him that that is no way to talk to his sister, and that she is relying on him to turn into a good man when he is older (''A Boy Like You''). Willie leaves for school and Mrs. Maurrant goes into the house, as Rose comes out. Shirley Kaplan comes out of the house and asks Rose why she spends so much time with Sam, when he should be concentrating on his work. Shirley leaves for work, and Vincent Jones comes out of the house and starts harassing Rose again, but promptly leaves as Sam comes out of the house. Rose mentions Easter's tempting offer of running away to Sam, and Sam gets upset, saying that she would be better off running away with him, and the two sing of their intention to run away together (''We'll Go Away Together''). Easter arrives to walk Rose to the funeral, and the two leave. Sam goes into the house, as Sankey appears. Mrs. Maurrant appears at her window and tells him to come upstairs, as Mr. Maurrant has gone on his business trip and Rose will be at the funeral all morning. As Sankey hurries upstairs he passes Sam coming out of the house, who looks up at the window and sees Mrs. Maurrant pulling the shades shut. Sam sits on the stoop and reads a book, as James Henry, a city-marshall, and Fred Cullen, his assistant, appear. They call Henry Davis up and tell him that they're here to dispossess the Hildebrand family, and that since she has made no arrangements to have the furniture taken away, they'll have to dump it on the sidewalk. Henry goes back into the cellar as the two men enter the house. Mr. Maurrant returns, having changed his mind about the business trip. He sees the shades pulled shut and becomes furious. Sam pleads with him not to enter the house but he pushes him aside and runs upstairs. Mrs. Maurrant is heard screaming, and then two gunshots. Sankey appears at the window in terror, he tries to escape but Maurrant pulls him back inside and shoots him. Panic ensues, as Maurrant exits the house, covered in blood, and points his revolver at the crowd of gatherers in order to make his escape. Policemen, paramedics, concerned neighbors flood the scene. Rose returns from the funeral and sees the concerned crowd. Sam tries to keep her back but she cannot be restrained. The ensemble sings a tragic chorus number about the killing, ''The Woman Who Lived Up There''. Mrs. Maurrant's body is brought out of the house on a stretcher and taken to the hospital and the citizens rush after the ambulance, as Rose, quietly crying in Sam's arms, follows. The curtain slowly falls as the two city-marshalls continue bringing the Hildebrand furniture out onto the sidewalk.\n\n''Scene 2: Mid-afternoon, the same day''\n\nTwo young nursemaids appear at the house and sing about the scandal of the murder that has already spread around the city, as they try to quiet the children they are looking after (''Lullaby''). As the nursemaids leave, Rose enters, dressed in black. She asks Officer Murphy, the policeman who is still in her apartment, if they have found her father yet, and he tells her that they haven't. Sam enters and tells Rose that he has taken Willie from school round to her aunt's house. Shirley enters and expresses her condolences to Rose, and the two of them go up to Rose's apartment together, as Rose is afraid to go up alone. Sam tells his grandfather that the police are going to make him testify against Maurrant, when two shots are heard in the distance. Buchanan and Olsen run on and tell Sam and Rose (who has run out of the house, alerted by the noise) that the police have found her father hiding in the basement of a house down the street. Two policemen bring on Maurrant, who is covered in blood and dirt. The officers are taking him away when he begs for one minute with his daughter, which they grant him. He and Rose talk about the murder, as the crowd looks on (''He Loved Her Too''). The officers take Maurrant off, and Rose and Sam are left alone onstage. Rose starts to enter the house when Sam asks what she's going to do. She tells him she'll go away, but when he says that he'll go with her as they discussed that morning, Rose says she has to go off alone. Sam finally confesses to Rose that he is in love with her, and that his life is nothing without her. Rose says that her parents have proved that two people do not belong together, and she says goodbye to Sam (''Don't Forget The Lilac Bush''). Shirley comes out of the house and hands Rose a suitcase full of her things. Rose starts walking off, then returns and swiftly kisses Sam, but he breaks away and goes abruptly into the house.

The YMCA of the North Shore has owned and operated a children's day camp on it since 1955. The first written record of the island was in 1655 when it was granted to Governor [[John Endecott]]. It was then bought and sold several times until around the Revolutionary War when the [[Essex hospital]] was built as a [[smallpox]] [[inoculation]] site. The hospital was burned down by townspeople of Marblehead. By the end of the 19th century, the [[Lowell island house]] was established as a summer resort. This was run for about 30 years before being converted into a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] for sick and crippled children until 1946. The island then lay unused until bought by the YMCA and converted into a day camp.\n\n==Name==\nThe island has had numerous names including Catta, Cotta, Catt, Cat, Lowell, Pollard, and Children's; for most of history it was Cat Island. Speculation about the origin of its name is that in the 18th century Catta was a corruption of Cotta and referred to an early Marblehead native named Robert Cotta. However, no evidence links Mr. Cotta to the island in any way, as discussed extensively in \"Field Meeting at Lowell Island.\"<ref>Field Meeting at Lowell Island in Bulletin of the Essex Institute. Vol. 12. 1880.</ref> The island's name was officially changed from Cat Island to Children's Island by petition of the Marblehead/Swampscott YMCA in 1996.\n\n==History==\n===Colonial Times===\nWritten reference to Children's Island first appeared in 1655 when \"...the iland called Catta Iland...lying neere to Marble Head [sic]...\"<ref>Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, Vol III, p.389</ref> was granted to Governor [[John Endecott]] at his own request by the [[General Court of Massachusetts]]. Prior to 1655, it is likely that this and other local islands served as a source of smooth rocks for ship ballast, as a site for grazing animals, and as a source of timber for ship building. In June 1629, Reverend [[Francis Higginson]] notes \"we passed the curious and difficult entrance into the large and spacious harbour of Naimkecke, [Salem] and as we passed along it was wonderful to behould so many islands replenished with thicke woods and high trees and many fayre green pastures [sic].\"<ref>Hutchinson's Collection of Papers, p44</ref> Although not specifically named by Higginson, Children's Island is presumably one of these wooded islands.\n\nUpon the Governor's death in 1665 he gave to his wife \"Catta Island, at Salem, which the Generall Court gave mee, during her life, & after her decease to my two sons, John & Zerobabel or to the longest liver of them.[sic]\"<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://archive.org/details/newenglandhisto65unkngoog | page = [https://archive.org/details/newenglandhisto65unkngoog/page/n145 127] | quote = Catta Island, at Salem, which the Generall Court gave mee. | title = The New England Historical and Genealogical Register | publisher = S.G.

With the help of their brother Samuel, they \"assign[ed] all that his Island...lying and being in ye Tounship of Marblehead commonly called and knoune by ye name of Catt Iland graunted to ye late worship John Endicott Esq [sic]....\"<ref name=Searle/> to Richard Reade of Marblehead in March, 1687 for 16 pounds. How or why the name changed from Catta, to Cotta, and then to Catt Island is unexplained. The Reade family had financial difficulties and used the Island as a source of collateral for multiple loans. In February, 1738 the first reference to a house on the island is made when the Reades used it as collateral for a loan: \"...&nbsp;Catt Island together with the house and woods thereon,\"<ref>Southern Essex District Registry of Deeds, vol 78, p.121</ref> though who built it and when is not known. In 1746, Samuel Reade received 75 pounds for \"all one half of that island called and known by the name of Catt Island lying in the harbour of Marblehead with one half of the house thereon\"<ref>Southern Essex District Registry of Deeds, book 78, p.121</ref> from John Oliver. Finally, in 1761 due to an unsatisfied mortgage, Children's Island (Catt Island) was given up to the Wait family of Marblehead in whose possession it remained until 1773.<ref name=Searle>Searle, Richard W. History of Catta Iland Off Marblehead in The Essex Institute Historical Collections. Vol. LXXXIII, Oct. 1947</ref> On September 2, 1773, the Island was sold to four prominent men from Marblehead<ref>Southern Essex District Registry of Deeds, book 138, p178</ref> with the plan to build a smallpox hospital.\n\n===Essex Hospital===\n{{main|Essex Hospital}}\n\nIn June 1773, Marblehead was stricken by an epidemic of [[smallpox]]. Although some in the medical community argued in favor of [[inoculation]] of the disease, most people at the time were terrified of and vehemently opposed to the practice. In August 1773, a Marblehead town meeting was held to debate the construction of a public inoculation hospital on one of the nearby islands. The proposal was rejected, but the majority did agree to allow a private funding of a hospital as long as the Marblehead [[selectmen]] could regulate it.<ref name=Bowen>Smith, Philip Chadwick Foster, ed. The Journals of Ashley Bowen (1728-1813) of Marblehead. 1973. Vol.II</ref> The owners of the future [[Essex Hospital]] were four popular Marblehead political figures: [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]], Jonathan Glover (John Glover's brother), [[Azor Orne]], and [[Elbridge Gerry]]; they purchased Children's Island (Catt Island) on September 2, 1773, although the idea remained contentious.\n\nBy early October, the hospital and a shifting-house were completed, and Dr. [[Hall Jackson]] from Portsmouth was hired as hospital superintendent, and Dr. [[Ananias Randall]] from Long Island as assistant physician.<ref>Hall Jackson and the Purple Foxglove, p. 26</ref>\nOn October 19, the first group of patients arrived at the hospital and were inoculated, and since they were contagious after inoculation, remained on the island until November 9\u201311. On November 15, the second group of patients, numbering around 100, was inoculated at Essex Hospital, while the third group of patients was inoculated at the hospital in December 1773.\n\nIn early January 1774, a boatload of this third class attempted to land at Nick\u2019s Cove, an unsanctioned landing area in Marblehead.<ref>''Essex Gazette'', January 11\u201318, 1774.</ref> Many townspeople were upset and a period of disorder and riots ensued. A few weeks later, four townsmen were caught stealing contaminated clothing from the island while attempting to smuggle them into Marblehead. Presumably, they were hoping to earn condemnation for the hospital by starting an outbreak of smallpox. The following morning, the four were tarred and feathered and paraded through Marblehead into Salem, a source of much entertainment to those witnessing the spectacle.<ref>''Essex Gazette'', January 18\u201325, 1774</ref> Due to ongoing opposition, the hospital proprietors called for a town meeting on January 24 to ask the town to purchase the hospital and supplies, and to decide if the hospital should be kept open. Alternatively, they requested that if the hospital be closed that \"a committee to cleanse the furniture, etc. in the so just and most satisfactory manner to the Town\" be formed. The town refused to buy the hospital and supplies but did form a committee to oversee disinfection.<ref name=Searle/> On the following day, the three committee members and eight members of their family spent the next two days on the island cleaning and disinfecting, when on the second night they were suddenly awakened by fire. During the night, approximately 20 townspeople had sneaked onto the island and set the hospital on fire. Everyone escaped alive but all buildings and property were burned or destroyed.<ref>''Essex Gazette'', January 25 \u2013 February 1, 1774</ref> The owners sued for damages, but those events were quickly forgotten as thoughts turned toward revolution.\n\n===The Revolutionary War and War of 1812===\nAs one of the [[Intolerable Acts]] issued by the British in response to the [[Boston Tea Party]], The [[Boston Port Act]] closed [[Boston Harbor]] on June 1, 1774. Subsequently, much of the ship traffic designated for Boston was diverted to Marblehead and Salem Harbors. Starting in late December, 1774 and for the next seven months British war ships, mostly [[HMS Fowey (1749)|HMS ''Fowey'']], [[HMS Lively (1756)|HMS ''Lively'']], and HMS ''Merlin''<ref name=Bowen/> blockaded Marblehead and Salem Harbors. Children\u2019s Island (at that time still known as Cat Island) served as a common anchorage site for these big ships, whose crews must have embarked on the island at times for ballast stones, wood, and water: \"[[George Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|Captain [George] Montagu]] of the Fowey&nbsp;... had moved from Cat Island to [[Bakers Island]] for water, which fell short at the former place&nbsp;...\" in January, 1776.<ref>Narrative of Vice Admiral Samuel Graves in Naval Documents of the American Revolution, vol 3 1775-1776, p1006</ref> In December 1775, three British ships paraded around Children's Island in war formation threatening to bombard Marblehead. After spending half a day in threatening display, they left without attacking. Most likely hemmed in by the rocky shores of Children's Island and the fort at Gale\u2019s Head (later known as [[Fort Sewall]]), the British surmised they were easy targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendinc.com/Pages/MarbleheadNet/MM/Headers/Headers21.html#anchor331092|title=Marblehead Magazine's The 'Headers In Life And Legend by Russell W. Knight: 21|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn Monday, January 8, 1776, Ashley Bowen notes: \"I find the Fowey's people have cut down all the trees from Cat Island.\"<ref name=Bowen/> However, the Marblehead Register, a local newspaper of the time, has an entry of Dr. Story on January 7, 1776, \"Trees on Cat Island cut down last night, suppose by the Merlin.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://archive.org/details/historicalcolle05instgoog | title = Historical collections of the Essex Institute | publisher = Essex Institute. | author1 = Institute | first1 = Essex | year = 1863}}</ref> Another reference notes: \"1776, January 8 \u2013 The Merlin cut down the trees on Cat Island \u2013 so we hear no more of the Merlin.

As the Merlin passed Point of [the] Neck she fired a shot over the neck,\"<ref name=Bowen/> and he does not indicate that the ''Merlin'' returns to the Marblehead area any time near January 1776. In addition, after the tree-cutting episode Bowen continues to record the actions of the ''Fowey'' and makes no mention of the ''Merlin''; therefore, most likely it was the men of the ''Fowey'' and not the ''Merlin'' who cut down the trees. The amount of trees cut and the purpose of cutting them is not mentioned, though perhaps it allowed a better view of [[Marblehead Harbor]] to prevent the rebels (soon to be Americans) from escaping. Alternatively the lumber could have been used as fuel, though no mention of cutting wood on nearby more heavily wooded islands is mentioned.\n\nThe owners of the former Essex Hospital held the Island throughout the war. Sometime before 1787 both Glovers sold their quarter ownerships to Deacon William Williams of Marblehead. The Deacon then acquired another 16th part to gain majority ownership. After his death in 1787, his wife sold the property to Edward Fettyplace for $43.33 on June 25, 1795.<ref name=Searle/>\n\nSome observations and events concerning the island occurred around this time. On August 18, 1791 Reverend [[William Bentley]] recorded the following in his diary:\n\n{{quote|We arrived at 5 o'clock at Cat Island, & not venturing near the shore on account of the surf we engaged a Marblehead skiff to land us on the beach. The beach is high, not of so large stones as at Baker's Island & not so long, & forms a point. The length of the Island is about N.W. & S.E. It is a very rocky shore, but contains from 15 to 20 acres of good pasture land, of easy access, & not much mixed with rocks. On the N.W. end is the place of the Smoak house [smokehouse], when this Island was used for a hospital for inoculation of the Small Pox about 19 years since. The hospital is towards the other end just before you arrive at the rocky & lofty Head. The cellar is yet whole upon which the hospital was built. The cellar was only under the N. end. This building fell a sacrifice to the popular fury soon after it was erected. It was burnt by the people of Marblehead upon some supposed indiscretions. There is a well open of considerable depth, but there was no water. There is a spring for the cattle at this part & about 10 head now upon it. From the top of the rocky head we had a very extensive prospect of the South Shore, Nahant Head & Rocks, Tinker's Island, Ram Island, the Rock of Marblehead, which I have visited, which is at one third of the distance from Marblehead Neck, the whole above one mile's distance. The rock called Satan was off between us & Half Way Rock. The Gooseberries were well distinguished, Baker's Island, Dry Breakers, & nearest to us Eagle Island, between which & the Gooseberries is the channel into Marblehead, from the entrance between Baker's Island & the Misery. I had not time for a particular examination, but the soil of this Island appeared better than that of any of the islands. The rocks on all sides are above it, & it is rendered rich by this situation. It is said that there are several springs, which I had not time to explore & the present being a dry season. We returned at low ebb, & ran aground & hence were obliged to wade ashore upon the flats. Beyond the S.E. or rocky head, & in the line of the islands, are two other heads of nearly the same projection & trending from the island in the line of the island itself, & form a curious appearance. On the S. side about the middle of the Island, are three other steep rocks & high, tho' not in any proportion to the former. Two of them are connected with the body of the island by the necks, which appear upon the ebb. The other stands bold up, but within these two & south of them. The beach is upon the N.W. side & in a direct course from Peach's Point, & the Black Rock.}}\n\nThe Reverend documented another trip to the Island in his diary on June 24, 1803: \"...&nbsp;fished between grey rock & Cat Island, & as the wind was rising landed on Cat Island. Here we spent the day. The wind was so high that no tent could stand, & we were exposed to the sun without any shelter, & the heat was excessive. We could find no spring & the well was dry. We found three horses & good grass. In the evening we returned.\"\n\nA continuing problem was shipwrecks against the many rocks and islands surrounding [[Marblehead Harbor]]. At the time there were no marine markers, and identifying hazards was difficult especially to those unfamiliar with the area. A temporary solution was to plant trees as landmarks onto large rocks, and using these as a reference points on charts and written navigational directions. As the Reverend notes in his diary on July 23, 1806: \"Marblehead will petition for Marblehead rock, eastern rock of Cat Island, & Tinker\u2019s & Ram island. He says the complaint of want of land marks is universal. He has planted a poplar on Marblehead rock having found a depth of soil in a spot of 5 feet. Eastern rock of Cat Island admits trees also & three have been planted\"<ref>The Diary of William Bentley. Volume 3. p241</ref>\nand again on Jan 29, 1807: \"the Town have had a meeting upon the subject of the petition to the General Court from Marblehead to grant to their marine Society the Islands laying off that Town&nbsp;... They ask for E. Rock of Cat Island, Marblehead rock, Tinker\u2019s & Ram island, as Capt. prince informed me.\"<ref>The Diary of William Bentley. Volume 3. p274</ref>\n\nThe Marblehead Marine Society was formed in 1798 \"for the laudable purposes of promoting the knowledge of Navigation & Seamanship, of giving relief to decayed & disabled Seamen & to the indigent Widows and Orphans of deceased Seamen & of others who may be Members of said Society.\"<ref>Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts. 1798-99. Chapter 44. p 53</ref>\n\nMention of a landmark at these locations is made in the 1817th edition of The American Coast Pilot: \"The Marblehead Marine Society has erected on Cat island rock, a spar 40 feet high, to the top of which is annexed a cask of about 130 gallons measure, which is seen at sea 20 or 30 feet above the land\"<ref>Blunt, Edmund. The American Coast Pilot. 9th Edition. 1817. p131</ref>\n\nA date of 1808 is engraved into the rock at the top of [[Cormorant Rock (Essex County, Massachusetts)|Cormorant Rock]], as the East Rock of Cat Island is now known, but no other evidence of a structure exists. This is the likely date and location of the spar described. No mention of marker is made in the 1806 (5th) edition of the American Coast Pilot, which implies the spar was placed between 1800 and 1817.\n\nIn January 1822 the General Court of Massachusetts ceded a part of Tinker\u2019s Island, Marblehead Rock, and \"also the East Rock of Cat Island\" to the United States \"for the purpose of erecting and preserving land marks thereon...\"<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://archive.org/details/generallawsfrom01massgoog | page = [https://archive.org/details/generallawsfrom01massgoog/page/n570 562] | title = The general laws, from the adoption of the constitution, \\1780] to \\Nov.1835] | author1 = Massachusetts | year = 1823}}</ref>\n\nA popular local myth is that Children's Island provided shelter to [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] during the War of 1812. In fact, Fort Sewall and the difficulties in navigating into [[Marblehead Harbor]] were crucial in protecting ''Old Ironsides''. In April 1814 USS ''Constitution'' had been chased by [[HMS Tenedos (1812)|HMS ''Tenedos'']] and [[HMS Endymion (1797)|HMS ''Endymion'']] for three days. To outrun these ships, the crew of ''Constitution'' jettisoned her provisions, water, and \u201cevery thing movable.\u201d.<ref>American Naval Battles. 1837. p218</ref> About three miles (5&nbsp;km) off Fort Sewall, she was piloted into [[Marblehead Harbor]] by Samuel Green, a Marblehead native.<ref>Roads, Samuel. The History and Traditions of Marblehead. 1881. p250</ref> The British were hesitant to follow, not wanting to venture too close to the protection of Fort Sewall and risk navigation through the unfamiliar channel.\n\nGradually and by 1816, the Fettyplace family acquired full ownership to Children's (Cat) Island, which they sold in 1846 to John Roundy of Marblehead. In February, 1848, Roundy sold the island \u201cwith all the buildings thereon\u201d to Nathaniel Blaney of Marblehead. A year later, Nathaniel sold the property to David Blaney also of Marblehead.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OscAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage#v=onepage&q=&f=false | title = Bulletin of the Essex Institute | author1 = Institute | first1 = Essex | year = 1880}}</ref>\n\n===Lowell Island House===\nSummary. For full article, see [[Lowell island house]]\n\nIn 1850, the [[Salem and Lowell Railroad]] Company opened, and in competition with the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] hoped to increase passenger travel. The owners decided to create a seaside resort near Salem and purchased Children's Island (Cat Island) from David Blaney for $1000. In August 1851, the first trip to the newly named Lowell Island  was a huge success. Flush with this success, the owner's built a hotel on the Northwest section of the island which opened on June 15, 1852, and \"contain[ed] a number of public and private parlors, one hundred sleeping rooms, and a dining hall which will seat two hundred and fifty persons. It is well ventilated and will be neatly furnished.

In 1871 he sold the property, and over the next six years the property was bought and sold several times before being sold to Samuel B. Rindge for $4500 in January, 1878.

The YMCA of the North Shore has owned and operated a children's day camp on it since 1955. The first written record of the island was in 1655 when it was granted to Governor [[John Endecott]]. It was then bought and sold several times until around the Revolutionary War when the [[Essex hospital]] was built as a [[smallpox]] [[inoculation]] site. The hospital was burned down by townspeople of Marblehead. By the end of the 19th century, the [[Lowell island house]] was established as a summer resort. This was run for about 30 years before being converted into a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] for sick and crippled children until 1946. The island then lay unused until bought by the YMCA and converted into a day camp.\n\n==Name==\nThe island has had numerous names including Catta, Cotta, Catt, Cat, Lowell, Pollard, and Children's; for most of history it was Cat Island. Speculation about the origin of its name is that in the 18th century Catta was a corruption of Cotta and referred to an early Marblehead native named Robert Cotta. However, no evidence links Mr. Cotta to the island in any way, as discussed extensively in \"Field Meeting at Lowell Island.\"<ref>Field Meeting at Lowell Island in Bulletin of the Essex Institute. Vol. 12. 1880.</ref> The island's name was officially changed from Cat Island to Children's Island by petition of the Marblehead/Swampscott YMCA in 1996.\n\n==History==\n===Colonial Times===\nWritten reference to Children's Island first appeared in 1655 when \"...the iland called Catta Iland...lying neere to Marble Head [sic]...\"<ref>Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, Vol III, p.389</ref> was granted to Governor [[John Endecott]] at his own request by the [[General Court of Massachusetts]]. Prior to 1655, it is likely that this and other local islands served as a source of smooth rocks for ship ballast, as a site for grazing animals, and as a source of timber for ship building. In June 1629, Reverend [[Francis Higginson]] notes \"we passed the curious and difficult entrance into the large and spacious harbour of Naimkecke, [Salem] and as we passed along it was wonderful to behould so many islands replenished with thicke woods and high trees and many fayre green pastures [sic].\"<ref>Hutchinson's Collection of Papers, p44</ref> Although not specifically named by Higginson, Children's Island is presumably one of these wooded islands.\n\nUpon the Governor's death in 1665 he gave to his wife \"Catta Island, at Salem, which the Generall Court gave mee, during her life, & after her decease to my two sons, John & Zerobabel or to the longest liver of them.[sic]\"<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://archive.org/details/newenglandhisto65unkngoog | page = [https://archive.org/details/newenglandhisto65unkngoog/page/n145 127] | quote = Catta Island, at Salem, which the Generall Court gave mee. | title = The New England Historical and Genealogical Register | publisher = S.G.

How or why the name changed from Catta, to Cotta, and then to Catt Island is unexplained. The Reade family had financial difficulties and used the Island as a source of collateral for multiple loans. In February, 1738 the first reference to a house on the island is made when the Reades used it as collateral for a loan: \"...&nbsp;Catt Island together with the house and woods thereon,\"<ref>Southern Essex District Registry of Deeds, vol 78, p.121</ref> though who built it and when is not known. In 1746, Samuel Reade received 75 pounds for \"all one half of that island called and known by the name of Catt Island lying in the harbour of Marblehead with one half of the house thereon\"<ref>Southern Essex District Registry of Deeds, book 78, p.121</ref> from John Oliver. Finally, in 1761 due to an unsatisfied mortgage, Children's Island (Catt Island) was given up to the Wait family of Marblehead in whose possession it remained until 1773.<ref name=Searle>Searle, Richard W.

Although some in the medical community argued in favor of [[inoculation]] of the disease, most people at the time were terrified of and vehemently opposed to the practice. In August 1773, a Marblehead town meeting was held to debate the construction of a public inoculation hospital on one of the nearby islands. The proposal was rejected, but the majority did agree to allow a private funding of a hospital as long as the Marblehead [[selectmen]] could regulate it.<ref name=Bowen>Smith, Philip Chadwick Foster, ed. The Journals of Ashley Bowen (1728-1813) of Marblehead. 1973. Vol.II</ref> The owners of the future [[Essex Hospital]] were four popular Marblehead political figures: [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]], Jonathan Glover (John Glover's brother), [[Azor Orne]], and [[Elbridge Gerry]]; they purchased Children's Island (Catt Island) on September 2, 1773, although the idea remained contentious.\n\nBy early October, the hospital and a shifting-house were completed, and Dr. [[Hall Jackson]] from Portsmouth was hired as hospital superintendent, and Dr. [[Ananias Randall]] from Long Island as assistant physician.<ref>Hall Jackson and the Purple Foxglove, p. 26</ref>\nOn October 19, the first group of patients arrived at the hospital and were inoculated, and since they were contagious after inoculation, remained on the island until November 9\u201311. On November 15, the second group of patients, numbering around 100, was inoculated at Essex Hospital, while the third group of patients was inoculated at the hospital in December 1773.\n\nIn early January 1774, a boatload of this third class attempted to land at Nick\u2019s Cove, an unsanctioned landing area in Marblehead.<ref>''Essex Gazette'', January 11\u201318, 1774.</ref> Many townspeople were upset and a period of disorder and riots ensued. A few weeks later, four townsmen were caught stealing contaminated clothing from the island while attempting to smuggle them into Marblehead. Presumably, they were hoping to earn condemnation for the hospital by starting an outbreak of smallpox. The following morning, the four were tarred and feathered and paraded through Marblehead into Salem, a source of much entertainment to those witnessing the spectacle.<ref>''Essex Gazette'', January 18\u201325, 1774</ref> Due to ongoing opposition, the hospital proprietors called for a town meeting on January 24 to ask the town to purchase the hospital and supplies, and to decide if the hospital should be kept open. Alternatively, they requested that if the hospital be closed that \"a committee to cleanse the furniture, etc. in the so just and most satisfactory manner to the Town\" be formed. The town refused to buy the hospital and supplies but did form a committee to oversee disinfection.<ref name=Searle/> On the following day, the three committee members and eight members of their family spent the next two days on the island cleaning and disinfecting, when on the second night they were suddenly awakened by fire. During the night, approximately 20 townspeople had sneaked onto the island and set the hospital on fire. Everyone escaped alive but all buildings and property were burned or destroyed.<ref>''Essex Gazette'', January 25 \u2013 February 1, 1774</ref> The owners sued for damages, but those events were quickly forgotten as thoughts turned toward revolution.\n\n===The Revolutionary War and War of 1812===\nAs one of the [[Intolerable Acts]] issued by the British in response to the [[Boston Tea Party]], The [[Boston Port Act]] closed [[Boston Harbor]] on June 1, 1774. Subsequently, much of the ship traffic designated for Boston was diverted to Marblehead and Salem Harbors. Starting in late December, 1774 and for the next seven months British war ships, mostly [[HMS Fowey (1749)|HMS ''Fowey'']], [[HMS Lively (1756)|HMS ''Lively'']], and HMS ''Merlin''<ref name=Bowen/> blockaded Marblehead and Salem Harbors. Children\u2019s Island (at that time still known as Cat Island) served as a common anchorage site for these big ships, whose crews must have embarked on the island at times for ballast stones, wood, and water: \"[[George Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|Captain [George] Montagu]] of the Fowey&nbsp;... had moved from Cat Island to [[Bakers Island]] for water, which fell short at the former place&nbsp;...\" in January, 1776.<ref>Narrative of Vice Admiral Samuel Graves in Naval Documents of the American Revolution, vol 3 1775-1776, p1006</ref> In December 1775, three British ships paraded around Children's Island in war formation threatening to bombard Marblehead. After spending half a day in threatening display, they left without attacking. Most likely hemmed in by the rocky shores of Children's Island and the fort at Gale\u2019s Head (later known as [[Fort Sewall]]), the British surmised they were easy targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendinc.com/Pages/MarbleheadNet/MM/Headers/Headers21.html#anchor331092|title=Marblehead Magazine's The 'Headers In Life And Legend by Russell W.

As the Merlin passed Point of [the] Neck she fired a shot over the neck,\"<ref name=Bowen/> and he does not indicate that the ''Merlin'' returns to the Marblehead area any time near January 1776. In addition, after the tree-cutting episode Bowen continues to record the actions of the ''Fowey'' and makes no mention of the ''Merlin''; therefore, most likely it was the men of the ''Fowey'' and not the ''Merlin'' who cut down the trees. The amount of trees cut and the purpose of cutting them is not mentioned, though perhaps it allowed a better view of [[Marblehead Harbor]] to prevent the rebels (soon to be Americans) from escaping. Alternatively the lumber could have been used as fuel, though no mention of cutting wood on nearby more heavily wooded islands is mentioned.\n\nThe owners of the former Essex Hospital held the Island throughout the war. Sometime before 1787 both Glovers sold their quarter ownerships to Deacon William Williams of Marblehead. The Deacon then acquired another 16th part to gain majority ownership. After his death in 1787, his wife sold the property to Edward Fettyplace for $43.33 on June 25, 1795.<ref name=Searle/>\n\nSome observations and events concerning the island occurred around this time. On August 18, 1791 Reverend [[William Bentley]] recorded the following in his diary:\n\n{{quote|We arrived at 5 o'clock at Cat Island, & not venturing near the shore on account of the surf we engaged a Marblehead skiff to land us on the beach. The beach is high, not of so large stones as at Baker's Island & not so long, & forms a point. The length of the Island is about N.W. & S.E. It is a very rocky shore, but contains from 15 to 20 acres of good pasture land, of easy access, & not much mixed with rocks. On the N.W. end is the place of the Smoak house [smokehouse], when this Island was used for a hospital for inoculation of the Small Pox about 19 years since. The hospital is towards the other end just before you arrive at the rocky & lofty Head. The cellar is yet whole upon which the hospital was built. The cellar was only under the N. end. This building fell a sacrifice to the popular fury soon after it was erected. It was burnt by the people of Marblehead upon some supposed indiscretions. There is a well open of considerable depth, but there was no water. There is a spring for the cattle at this part & about 10 head now upon it. From the top of the rocky head we had a very extensive prospect of the South Shore, Nahant Head & Rocks, Tinker's Island, Ram Island, the Rock of Marblehead, which I have visited, which is at one third of the distance from Marblehead Neck, the whole above one mile's distance. The rock called Satan was off between us & Half Way Rock. The Gooseberries were well distinguished, Baker's Island, Dry Breakers, & nearest to us Eagle Island, between which & the Gooseberries is the channel into Marblehead, from the entrance between Baker's Island & the Misery. I had not time for a particular examination, but the soil of this Island appeared better than that of any of the islands. The rocks on all sides are above it, & it is rendered rich by this situation. It is said that there are several springs, which I had not time to explore & the present being a dry season. We returned at low ebb, & ran aground & hence were obliged to wade ashore upon the flats. Beyond the S.E. or rocky head, & in the line of the islands, are two other heads of nearly the same projection & trending from the island in the line of the island itself, & form a curious appearance. On the S. side about the middle of the Island, are three other steep rocks & high, tho' not in any proportion to the former. Two of them are connected with the body of the island by the necks, which appear upon the ebb. The other stands bold up, but within these two & south of them. The beach is upon the N.W. side & in a direct course from Peach's Point, & the Black Rock.}}\n\nThe Reverend documented another trip to the Island in his diary on June 24, 1803: \"...&nbsp;fished between grey rock & Cat Island, & as the wind was rising landed on Cat Island. Here we spent the day. The wind was so high that no tent could stand, & we were exposed to the sun without any shelter, & the heat was excessive. We could find no spring & the well was dry. We found three horses & good grass. In the evening we returned.\"\n\nA continuing problem was shipwrecks against the many rocks and islands surrounding [[Marblehead Harbor]]. At the time there were no marine markers, and identifying hazards was difficult especially to those unfamiliar with the area. A temporary solution was to plant trees as landmarks onto large rocks, and using these as a reference points on charts and written navigational directions. As the Reverend notes in his diary on July 23, 1806: \"Marblehead will petition for Marblehead rock, eastern rock of Cat Island, & Tinker\u2019s & Ram island. He says the complaint of want of land marks is universal. He has planted a poplar on Marblehead rock having found a depth of soil in a spot of 5 feet. Eastern rock of Cat Island admits trees also & three have been planted\"<ref>The Diary of William Bentley. Volume 3. p241</ref>\nand again on Jan 29, 1807: \"the Town have had a meeting upon the subject of the petition to the General Court from Marblehead to grant to their marine Society the Islands laying off that Town&nbsp;... They ask for E. Rock of Cat Island, Marblehead rock, Tinker\u2019s & Ram island, as Capt. prince informed me.\"<ref>The Diary of William Bentley. Volume 3. p274</ref>\n\nThe Marblehead Marine Society was formed in 1798 \"for the laudable purposes of promoting the knowledge of Navigation & Seamanship, of giving relief to decayed & disabled Seamen & to the indigent Widows and Orphans of deceased Seamen & of others who may be Members of said Society.\"<ref>Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts. 1798-99. Chapter 44. p 53</ref>\n\nMention of a landmark at these locations is made in the 1817th edition of The American Coast Pilot: \"The Marblehead Marine Society has erected on Cat island rock, a spar 40 feet high, to the top of which is annexed a cask of about 130 gallons measure, which is seen at sea 20 or 30 feet above the land\"<ref>Blunt, Edmund. The American Coast Pilot. 9th Edition. 1817. p131</ref>\n\nA date of 1808 is engraved into the rock at the top of [[Cormorant Rock (Essex County, Massachusetts)|Cormorant Rock]], as the East Rock of Cat Island is now known, but no other evidence of a structure exists. This is the likely date and location of the spar described. No mention of marker is made in the 1806 (5th) edition of the American Coast Pilot, which implies the spar was placed between 1800 and 1817.\n\nIn January 1822 the General Court of Massachusetts ceded a part of Tinker\u2019s Island, Marblehead Rock, and \"also the East Rock of Cat Island\" to the United States \"for the purpose of erecting and preserving land marks thereon...\"<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://archive.org/details/generallawsfrom01massgoog | page = [https://archive.org/details/generallawsfrom01massgoog/page/n570 562] | title = The general laws, from the adoption of the constitution, \\1780] to \\Nov.1835] | author1 = Massachusetts | year = 1823}}</ref>\n\nA popular local myth is that Children's Island provided shelter to [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] during the War of 1812. In fact, Fort Sewall and the difficulties in navigating into [[Marblehead Harbor]] were crucial in protecting ''Old Ironsides''. In April 1814 USS ''Constitution'' had been chased by [[HMS Tenedos (1812)|HMS ''Tenedos'']] and [[HMS Endymion (1797)|HMS ''Endymion'']] for three days. To outrun these ships, the crew of ''Constitution'' jettisoned her provisions, water, and \u201cevery thing movable.\u201d.<ref>American Naval Battles. 1837. p218</ref> About three miles (5&nbsp;km) off Fort Sewall, she was piloted into [[Marblehead Harbor]] by Samuel Green, a Marblehead native.<ref>Roads, Samuel. The History and Traditions of Marblehead. 1881. p250</ref> The British were hesitant to follow, not wanting to venture too close to the protection of Fort Sewall and risk navigation through the unfamiliar channel.\n\nGradually and by 1816, the Fettyplace family acquired full ownership to Children's (Cat) Island, which they sold in 1846 to John Roundy of Marblehead. In February, 1848, Roundy sold the island \u201cwith all the buildings thereon\u201d to Nathaniel Blaney of Marblehead. A year later, Nathaniel sold the property to David Blaney also of Marblehead.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OscAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage#v=onepage&q=&f=false | title = Bulletin of the Essex Institute | author1 = Institute | first1 = Essex | year = 1880}}</ref>\n\n===Lowell Island House===\nSummary. For full article, see [[Lowell island house]]\n\nIn 1850, the [[Salem and Lowell Railroad]] Company opened, and in competition with the [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] hoped to increase passenger travel. The owners decided to create a seaside resort near Salem and purchased Children's Island (Cat Island) from David Blaney for $1000. In August 1851, the first trip to the newly named Lowell Island  was a huge success. Flush with this success, the owner's built a hotel on the Northwest section of the island which opened on June 15, 1852, and \"contain[ed] a number of public and private parlors, one hundred sleeping rooms, and a dining hall which will seat two hundred and fifty persons.

In 1871 he sold the property, and over the next six years the property was bought and sold several times before being sold to Samuel B. Rindge for $4500 in January, 1878.

The test results \"show that the water is very hard, has a disagreeable odor and contains an excessive quantity of organic matter.

Jenkins]]. Chloe was a junior at [[Stanford University]] in Palo Alto, California, during the vanishing of millions of people during the [[Rapture]].\n\n==Character overview==\nYears before the [[Rapture]], Chloe's mother, [[Irene Steele]], begins attending a new church and claimed to have become a [[Born again Christianity|born again]] believer in [[Christ]]. Irene tells Chloe she believed that one day soon [[God]] would take His people to Heaven in the \"blink of an eye.\" Chloe often detests going home for this reason, and she and her mother slowly grow apart, though she develops a certain kinship with her father as are both negative about their family's new interest in religion. Irene's obsession is only enhanced when Chloe comes home drunk, as Irene becomes worried about the fate of her daughter's soul. When Chloe goes off to college, she breaks nearly all ties with her family, hardly ever visiting except on holidays.\n\nAfter disappearances of both her mother and younger brother, Chloe Steele was forced to decide for herself what had happened. Chloe and her father, [[Rayford Steele]], soon turned to her mother's church for answers. After discovering most of the congregation had been taken in the vanishings, Chloe and her father meet [[Bruce Barnes (Left Behind)|Bruce Barnes]], an associate pastor who had been left behind. She is also very good friends with Hattie Durham.\n\nChloe eventually strikes up a friendship with legendary magazine writer [[Cameron \"Buck\" Williams]]. They marry and have a son, [[Kenny Bruce Williams|Kenneth Bruce]]. Chloe becomes [[CEO]] of the International Commodity Co-op, arranging for Christians worldwide to be able to purchase food, goods, and services (after [[Nicolae Carpathia]], [[Antichrist]] and potentate of the [[Global Community]], had ordered the application of the [[Mark of the Beast]], it had become impossible for Christians to buy or sell anything since they would not take the Mark).\n\nIn ''[[Armageddon (novel)|Armageddon]]'', Chloe is drawn out of the bunker that she, Buck, Ray, and around 200 other believers are hiding in located in San Diego, California. As she leaves to investigate a GC [[Armoured Personnel Carrier]] she spots 2-3 platoons of GC peacekeepers and takes off away from the bunker. After dropping her ski mask and [[Uzi]] she is caught by Global Community personnel and taken into custody. She is imprisoned in a small cell in the basement of the GCHQ in San Diego. Later, she is taken east via airplane to a large prison and executed by a [[guillotine|loyalty enforcement facilitator]]. She, along with other Tribulation martyrs, returns with Jesus Christ at his [[Glorious Appearing]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nOne critic has argued that the central problem of [[Left Behind (novel)|the first novel]] in the ''[[Left Behind]]'' series is [[Deference|submission]] and that Chloe Steele is a clear example of a submissive woman, both in her role as [[Rayford Steele|Rayford]]'s daughter and in her lack of employment.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Postmodern Belief: American Literature and Religion Since 1960|editor1-link=Amy Hungerford|editor=Amy Hungerford|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-691-14575-X|title=The Literary Practice of Belief|author=Marilynne Robinson|pages=125\u201326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6pxKgj6fyUC&pg=PA125 |accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> Another critic has suggested that the authors' desire for [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], countercultural [[business networking]] is expressed through Chloe's eventual facilitation of an international commodity co-op network that will allow Christians to survive without needing to participate in the [[antichrist]]-run economy that requires the taking of the [[Number of the Beast#Mark of the beast|mark of the beast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marks of the Beast: The ''Left Behind'' Novels and the Struggle for Evangelical Identity|author=Glenn W.

Jenkins]]. Chloe was a junior at [[Stanford University]] in Palo Alto, California, during the vanishing of millions of people during the [[Rapture]].\n\n==Character overview==\nYears before the [[Rapture]], Chloe's mother, [[Irene Steele]], begins attending a new church and claimed to have become a [[Born again Christianity|born again]] believer in [[Christ]]. Irene tells Chloe she believed that one day soon [[God]] would take His people to Heaven in the \"blink of an eye.\" Chloe often detests going home for this reason, and she and her mother slowly grow apart, though she develops a certain kinship with her father as are both negative about their family's new interest in religion. Irene's obsession is only enhanced when Chloe comes home drunk, as Irene becomes worried about the fate of her daughter's soul. When Chloe goes off to college, she breaks nearly all ties with her family, hardly ever visiting except on holidays.\n\nAfter disappearances of both her mother and younger brother, Chloe Steele was forced to decide for herself what had happened. Chloe and her father, [[Rayford Steele]], soon turned to her mother's church for answers. After discovering most of the congregation had been taken in the vanishings, Chloe and her father meet [[Bruce Barnes (Left Behind)|Bruce Barnes]], an associate pastor who had been left behind. She is also very good friends with Hattie Durham.\n\nChloe eventually strikes up a friendship with legendary magazine writer [[Cameron \"Buck\" Williams]]. They marry and have a son, [[Kenny Bruce Williams|Kenneth Bruce]]. Chloe becomes [[CEO]] of the International Commodity Co-op, arranging for Christians worldwide to be able to purchase food, goods, and services (after [[Nicolae Carpathia]], [[Antichrist]] and potentate of the [[Global Community]], had ordered the application of the [[Mark of the Beast]], it had become impossible for Christians to buy or sell anything since they would not take the Mark).\n\nIn ''[[Armageddon (novel)|Armageddon]]'', Chloe is drawn out of the bunker that she, Buck, Ray, and around 200 other believers are hiding in located in San Diego, California. As she leaves to investigate a GC [[Armoured Personnel Carrier]] she spots 2-3 platoons of GC peacekeepers and takes off away from the bunker. After dropping her ski mask and [[Uzi]] she is caught by Global Community personnel and taken into custody. She is imprisoned in a small cell in the basement of the GCHQ in San Diego. Later, she is taken east via airplane to a large prison and executed by a [[guillotine|loyalty enforcement facilitator]]. She, along with other Tribulation martyrs, returns with Jesus Christ at his [[Glorious Appearing]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nOne critic has argued that the central problem of [[Left Behind (novel)|the first novel]] in the ''[[Left Behind]]'' series is [[Deference|submission]] and that Chloe Steele is a clear example of a submissive woman, both in her role as [[Rayford Steele|Rayford]]'s daughter and in her lack of employment.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Postmodern Belief: American Literature and Religion Since 1960|editor1-link=Amy Hungerford|editor=Amy Hungerford|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-691-14575-X|title=The Literary Practice of Belief|author=Marilynne Robinson|pages=125\u201326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6pxKgj6fyUC&pg=PA125 |accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> Another critic has suggested that the authors' desire for [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], countercultural [[business networking]] is expressed through Chloe's eventual facilitation of an international commodity co-op network that will allow Christians to survive without needing to participate in the [[antichrist]]-run economy that requires the taking of the [[Number of the Beast#Mark of the beast|mark of the beast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marks of the Beast: The ''Left Behind'' Novels and the Struggle for Evangelical Identity|author=Glenn W.

In the process, Hope runs into her old friend Landon, who is also Rafael's foster brother, but since the school for the supernatural is deemed to be too dangerous for humans, Landon is turned away. When student vampire MG fails to compel Landon to forget his knowledge of the supernatural, it is assumed that Landon has ingested vervain and he is locked up until it can clear his system. Hope visits Landon in his cell while Alaric's daughters Josie and Lizzie give Rafael a tour of the school. Hope tells Landon the truth about her supernatural origins and, knowing that his mind will be erased, he kisses her. Once Landon leaves, it is revealed that the compulsion has still not worked and that Landon stole a knife from the school. Hope enlists Josie to help her locate the knife and Landon.

When student vampire MG fails to compel Landon to forget his knowledge of the supernatural, it is assumed that Landon has ingested vervain and he is locked up until it can clear his system. Hope visits Landon in his cell while Alaric's daughters Josie and Lizzie give Rafael a tour of the school. Hope tells Landon the truth about her supernatural origins and, knowing that his mind will be erased, he kisses her. Once Landon leaves, it is revealed that the compulsion has still not worked and that Landon stole a knife from the school. Hope enlists Josie to help her locate the knife and Landon.

The search uncovers another survivor of the bus explosion and while Alaric gets her to safety, Hope and Rafael find Landon, who swears he is not responsible for the bus, which Alaric corroborates when the woman starts breathing fire.

Its head is elongated, narrow and relatively small, and its short ears are broad at the base. Its tail is half the length of its body. Its winter fur is very dense, soft and fluffy, with guard hairs reaching 3\u20134&nbsp;cm in length. The underfur is dense and loose fitting. Siberian weasels are monotone in colour, being bright reddish-ocherous or straw-red, though orange or peach tones are sometimes noticeable on the skin. These tones are especially bright on the back, while the flanks and underbelly are paler. A dark, coffee-brown mask is present on the face. Their tails are more brightly coloured than the back, and are fluffier than those of other members of the genus. The lips and chin are white or slightly ochreous. The front of the muzzle is darker than the remaining parts of the head.<ref name=\"s1052\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1052\u20131054}}</ref> Its skull is in several respects intermediate in form between that of the stoat and the [[mink]]; it is longer and larger than that of the stoat, but is somewhat more flattened than the mink's.<ref name=\"s1054\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1054}}</ref> Adult males are {{convert|28-39|cm|abbr=on}} long, while females reach {{convert|25\u201330.5|cm|abbr=on}}. The tail in males reaches {{convert|15.5|-|21|cm|abbr=on}} in length, while that of females reaches {{convert|13.3|-|16.4|cm|abbr=on}}. Males weigh {{convert|650|-|820|g|abbr=on}}, while females weigh {{convert|360|-|430|g|abbr=on}}. Exceptionally large individuals were sighted in the [[Baraba steppe]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1057}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n===Burrows===\nThe Siberian weasel builds its nest inside fallen logs, empty stumps, brushwood piles and exposed tree roots. It also uses and enlarges the dens of other species. The length of its burrows ranges from {{convert|0.6|-|4.2|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|0.2|-|1.3|m|abbr=on}} deep. Adults have a permanent burrow and up to five temporary shelters, which may be separated from each other by several kilometres. They build a nesting chamber in the middle or end of the burrow and line it with bird feathers and rodent hair.<ref name=\"s1074\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1074}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\nIn terms of prey selection, Siberian weasels are midway between small, rodent-eating mustelids and the more polyphagous martens. They rarely eat [[reptile]]s, [[invertebrate]]s and [[plant]]s, preferring instead to prey on rodents of small to moderate size. [[Arvicola|Water voles]] are their most frequent prey in their western range, while [[vole]]s and [[mouse|mice]] are eaten in their eastern range. Moderate sized rodents targeted by Siberian weasels in the east include [[Daurian pika|Daurian]] and [[Alpine pika]]s, and [[Siberian zokor]]s. In local areas, [[chipmunk]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[red squirrel]]s and [[jerboa]]s are eaten. [[Fish]] may be eaten in some areas during certain seasons. In [[Ussuriland]], they scavenge extensively on the kills of [[wolf|wolves]] and [[yellow-throated marten]]s during the winter. Elsewhere, small birds are an important food item. Reptiles and [[amphibian]]s are typically eaten at the periphery of the Siberian weasel's range. Plant foods known to be eaten by Siberian weasels include [[pine nut]]s and [[actinidia]] fruits. They typically eat about 100\u2013120 gm of food daily, and cache excess food.<ref name=\"s1071\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1071\u20131073}}</ref> In urban areas in China, Siberian weasels prey extensively on [[rat]]s. They are capable of killing and dragging the largest [[fowl]]s.<ref name=\"p364\">{{Harvnb|Pocock|1941|p=364}}</ref> Siberian weasels are active hunters and chase prey through snow, logs, water and people's houses.<ref name=\"s1054\"/><ref name=\"a373\">{{Harvnb|Allen|1938|p=373}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Kolonok.JPG|thumb|Exhibit at the [[Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences]]]]\nThe [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] period of the Siberian weasel varies depending on location. In western Siberia, it begins in early February to late March. In [[Primorye]], it begins in early March to late April. Six pairs of Siberian weasels in a fur [[sovkhoz]] near [[Moscow]] were in rut between 25 April and 15 May. They repeatedly mate during 35 minutes.  The [[gestation period]] lasts 38\u201341 days. There is one record of a female giving birth after only 28 days. Litters consist of 4\u201310 kits. They are born blind and are sparsely furred with white hair. They develop light yellow hair after a few days, and open their eyes after a month. They suckle for two months, and become independent by late August. By this time, the young have almost reached adult size, but still have their [[deciduous teeth]] and lighter bones. Their fur is darker than that of adults.<ref name=\"s1076\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1076}}</ref>\n\n==Subspecies==\n{{As of|2005}},<ref>{{MSW3 Wozencraft | pages = | id =14001468}}</ref> 11 subspecies are recognised.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#115a6c\"\n!Subspecies\n!Trinomial authority\n!Description\n!Range\n!Synonyms\n|----\n|'''Siberian kolonok'''<br/>''Mustela sibirica sibirica''\n|Pallas, 1773\n|A small subspecies with light, yellowish-red fur.

Its head is elongated, narrow and relatively small, and its short ears are broad at the base. Its tail is half the length of its body. Its winter fur is very dense, soft and fluffy, with guard hairs reaching 3\u20134&nbsp;cm in length. The underfur is dense and loose fitting. Siberian weasels are monotone in colour, being bright reddish-ocherous or straw-red, though orange or peach tones are sometimes noticeable on the skin. These tones are especially bright on the back, while the flanks and underbelly are paler. A dark, coffee-brown mask is present on the face. Their tails are more brightly coloured than the back, and are fluffier than those of other members of the genus. The lips and chin are white or slightly ochreous. The front of the muzzle is darker than the remaining parts of the head.<ref name=\"s1052\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1052\u20131054}}</ref> Its skull is in several respects intermediate in form between that of the stoat and the [[mink]]; it is longer and larger than that of the stoat, but is somewhat more flattened than the mink's.<ref name=\"s1054\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1054}}</ref> Adult males are {{convert|28-39|cm|abbr=on}} long, while females reach {{convert|25\u201330.5|cm|abbr=on}}. The tail in males reaches {{convert|15.5|-|21|cm|abbr=on}} in length, while that of females reaches {{convert|13.3|-|16.4|cm|abbr=on}}. Males weigh {{convert|650|-|820|g|abbr=on}}, while females weigh {{convert|360|-|430|g|abbr=on}}. Exceptionally large individuals were sighted in the [[Baraba steppe]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1057}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n===Burrows===\nThe Siberian weasel builds its nest inside fallen logs, empty stumps, brushwood piles and exposed tree roots. It also uses and enlarges the dens of other species. The length of its burrows ranges from {{convert|0.6|-|4.2|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|0.2|-|1.3|m|abbr=on}} deep. Adults have a permanent burrow and up to five temporary shelters, which may be separated from each other by several kilometres. They build a nesting chamber in the middle or end of the burrow and line it with bird feathers and rodent hair.<ref name=\"s1074\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1074}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\nIn terms of prey selection, Siberian weasels are midway between small, rodent-eating mustelids and the more polyphagous martens. They rarely eat [[reptile]]s, [[invertebrate]]s and [[plant]]s, preferring instead to prey on rodents of small to moderate size. [[Arvicola|Water voles]] are their most frequent prey in their western range, while [[vole]]s and [[mouse|mice]] are eaten in their eastern range. Moderate sized rodents targeted by Siberian weasels in the east include [[Daurian pika|Daurian]] and [[Alpine pika]]s, and [[Siberian zokor]]s. In local areas, [[chipmunk]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[red squirrel]]s and [[jerboa]]s are eaten. [[Fish]] may be eaten in some areas during certain seasons. In [[Ussuriland]], they scavenge extensively on the kills of [[wolf|wolves]] and [[yellow-throated marten]]s during the winter. Elsewhere, small birds are an important food item. Reptiles and [[amphibian]]s are typically eaten at the periphery of the Siberian weasel's range. Plant foods known to be eaten by Siberian weasels include [[pine nut]]s and [[actinidia]] fruits. They typically eat about 100\u2013120 gm of food daily, and cache excess food.<ref name=\"s1071\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1071\u20131073}}</ref> In urban areas in China, Siberian weasels prey extensively on [[rat]]s. They are capable of killing and dragging the largest [[fowl]]s.<ref name=\"p364\">{{Harvnb|Pocock|1941|p=364}}</ref> Siberian weasels are active hunters and chase prey through snow, logs, water and people's houses.<ref name=\"s1054\"/><ref name=\"a373\">{{Harvnb|Allen|1938|p=373}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Kolonok.JPG|thumb|Exhibit at the [[Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences]]]]\nThe [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] period of the Siberian weasel varies depending on location. In western Siberia, it begins in early February to late March. In [[Primorye]], it begins in early March to late April. Six pairs of Siberian weasels in a fur [[sovkhoz]] near [[Moscow]] were in rut between 25 April and 15 May. They repeatedly mate during 35 minutes.  The [[gestation period]] lasts 38\u201341 days. There is one record of a female giving birth after only 28 days. Litters consist of 4\u201310 kits. They are born blind and are sparsely furred with white hair. They develop light yellow hair after a few days, and open their eyes after a month. They suckle for two months, and become independent by late August. By this time, the young have almost reached adult size, but still have their [[deciduous teeth]] and lighter bones. Their fur is darker than that of adults.<ref name=\"s1076\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=1076}}</ref>\n\n==Subspecies==\n{{As of|2005}},<ref>{{MSW3 Wozencraft | pages = | id =14001468}}</ref> 11 subspecies are recognised.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#115a6c\"\n!Subspecies\n!Trinomial authority\n!Description\n!Range\n!Synonyms\n|----\n|'''Siberian kolonok'''<br/>''Mustela sibirica sibirica''\n|Pallas, 1773\n|A small subspecies with light, yellowish-red fur.
