Volume 96 pp. 23\u201367</ref> known to the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the '''Great Heathen  Army''' ({{lang-ang|mycel h\u00e6\u00feen here}}), was a coalition of [[Norsemen|Norse]] warriors, originating in [[Denmark]] but including warbands from [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], who came together under a unified command to invade the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that constituted England in AD 865.\n\nSince the late 8th century, the Vikings had primarily engaged in \"hit-and-run\" raids on centres of wealth such as monasteries. The Great Heathen Army was distinct from these raids in that it was much larger and formed to occupy and conquer large territories.\n\nThe name Great Heathen Army is derived from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' of 865. Legend has it that the force was led by four of the five sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], including [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bjorn Ironside]] and possibly [[Ubba]].{{efn|name=sons|The Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] gives Ragnar no less than 10 sons; however, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that only three took part in the invasion.

Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind.\n\nThe invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865\u201366 at [[Thetford]], before marching north to capture [[Scandinavian York|York]] in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of [[Eboracum]] and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of [[Scandinavian York|Eoforwic]].\n\nDuring 867, the army marched deep into [[Mercia]] and wintered in [[Nottingham]].  The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868\u201369. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford.\n\nIn 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] paid them to leave.  The army then marched to [[London]] to overwinter in 871-2. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at [[Torksey]], on the Trent close to the Humber.<ref name=hadley23/> The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'a foolish king's thegn' was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at [[Repton]] on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex.<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian D. |author-link=Julian D.

In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time. [[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|The Tale of Ragnar's Sons]], on the other hand, mentions that the invasion of England by the Great Heathen Army was aimed at avenging the death of Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary Viking ruler of Sweden and Denmark.{{efn|name=son2|There is nothing in the annals to suggest that the brothers invaded England to avenge their father's killing.

Evidence for this is the presence of two Viking cemeteries in Derbyshire that are believed to be connected to the Great Army, at Repton and at [[Heath Wood barrow cemetery|Heath Wood]].<ref name=richards2004 />\n\nIn 878, a third Viking army gathered on [[Fulham]] by the Thames. It seems they were partly discouraged by the defeat of Guthrum but also Alfred's success against the Vikings coincided with a period of renewed weakness in Francia. The Frankish emperor, Charles the Bald, died in 877 and his son shortly after, precipitating a period of political instability of which the Vikings were quick to take advantage. The assembled Viking army on the Thames departed in 879 to begin new campaigns on the continent.<ref>{{cite book | author= Peter Sawyer |title = The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings| isbn= 978-0-19-285434-6 | page=57|year = 2001}}</ref><ref name=sawyer91>Sawyer.

Burials of Viking type were made at the east end of the church, and an existing building was cut down and converted into the chamber of a burial mound that revealed the disarticulated remains of at least 249 people, with their long bones pointing towards the centre of the burial. A large stone coffin was found in the middle of the mass grave; however, the remains of this individual did not survive.

The Great Heathen Army was distinct from these raids in that it was much larger and formed to occupy and conquer large territories.\n\nThe name Great Heathen Army is derived from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' of 865. Legend has it that the force was led by four of the five sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], including [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bjorn Ironside]] and possibly [[Ubba]].{{efn|name=sons|The Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] gives Ragnar no less than 10 sons; however, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that only three took part in the invasion.

Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind.\n\nThe invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865\u201366 at [[Thetford]], before marching north to capture [[Scandinavian York|York]] in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of [[Eboracum]] and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of [[Scandinavian York|Eoforwic]].\n\nDuring 867, the army marched deep into [[Mercia]] and wintered in [[Nottingham]].  The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868\u201369. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford.\n\nIn 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] paid them to leave.  The army then marched to [[London]] to overwinter in 871-2. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at [[Torksey]], on the Trent close to the Humber.<ref name=hadley23/> The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'a foolish king's thegn' was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at [[Repton]] on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex.<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian D. |author-link=Julian D.

In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time.

[[Jimmie Foxx]] was the youngest to reach the mark at the time. Since then, [[Alex Rodriguez]] has become the youngest to reach this mark.</ref> On July 31, 1969, Aaron hit his 537th home run, passing [[Mickey Mantle]]'s total; this moved Aaron into third place on the career home run list, after Willie Mays and [[Babe Ruth]]. At the end of the 1969 season, Aaron again finished third in the MVP voting.\n\nIn 1970, Aaron reached two more career milestones. On May 17, Aaron collected his 3,000th hit, in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], the team against which he played in his first major-league game.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=202}}</ref> Aaron established the record for most seasons with thirty or more home runs in the National League. On April 27, 1971, Aaron hit his 600th career home run, the third major league player ever to do so. On July 13, Aaron hit a home run in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] (played at Detroit's [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]]) for the first time. He hit his 40th home run of the season against the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]' [[Jerry Johnson (baseball)|Jerry Johnson]] on August 10, which established a National League record for most seasons with 40 or more home runs (seven). At age 37, he hit a career-high 47 home runs during the season (along with a career-high .669 [[slugging percentage]]) and finished third in MVP voting for the sixth time. During the strike-shortened season of 1972, Aaron tied and then surpassed Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list. Aaron also knocked in the 2,000th run of his career and hit a home run in the first All-Star game played in Atlanta. As the year came to a close, Aaron broke [[Stan Musial]]'s major-league record for total bases (6,134). Aaron finished the season with 673 career home runs.\n\n===Breaking Ruth's record===\n[[File:hank aaron jersey.jpg|thumb|upright|The Braves' jersey Hank Aaron wore when he broke [[Babe Ruth]]'s career home run record in 1974]]\nAaron himself downplayed the \"chase\" to surpass Babe Ruth, while baseball enthusiasts and the national media grew increasingly excited as he closed in on the 714 career home runs record. Aaron received thousands of letters every week during the summer of 1973, including hate mail; the Braves ended up hiring a secretary to help him sort through it.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=62}}</ref>\n\nAaron (then age 39) hit 40 home runs in 392 at-bats, ending the 1973 season one home run short of the record. He hit home run number 713 on September 29, 1973, and with one day remaining in the season, many expected him to tie the record. But in his final game that year, playing against the [[Houston Astros]] (managed by [[Leo Durocher]], who had once roomed with Babe Ruth), he was unable to achieve this. After the game, Aaron said his only fear was that he might not live to see the [[1974 MLB season|1974 season.]] <!-- The following sentence needs to be clarified or removed. Did Aaron speak of Clemente's death in this context?: [That statement wasn't just about the death threats: one year earlier, September 30, 1972 was the last day the legendary [[Roberto Clemente]] ever played, as he perished in the offseason.] --><ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=179}}</ref>\n\nHe was the recipient of [[death threat]]s during the 1973\u20131974 offseason and a large assortment of hate mail from people who did not want to see Aaron break Ruth's nearly [[wikt:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] home run record.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=64}}</ref> The threats extended to those providing positive press coverage of Aaron. [[Lewis Grizzard]], then sports editor of the ''Atlanta Journal'', reported receiving numerous phone calls calling journalists \"nigger lovers\" for covering Aaron's chase. While preparing the massive coverage of the home run record, he quietly had an obituary written, afraid that Aaron might be murdered.<ref>{{harvnb|Grizzard|1990|pp=239\u2013240}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' pointedly summarized the [[racism|racist]] vitriol that Aaron was forced to endure:\n\n<blockquote>Is this to be the year in which Aaron, at the age of thirty-nine, takes a [[Extra-vehicular activity|moon walk]] above one of the most hallowed individual records in American sport{{nbsp}}...? Or will it be remembered as the season in which Aaron, the most dignified of athletes, was besieged with hate mail and trapped by the cobwebs and goblins that lurk in baseball's attic?<ref>{{harvnb|Leggett|1973|p=29}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the end of the 1973 season, Aaron received a plaque from the [[US Postal Service]] for receiving more mail (930,000 pieces) than any person excluding politicians.<ref name=TB/> Aaron received an outpouring of public support in response to the [[bigotry]]. Newspaper cartoonist [[Charles Schulz]] created a series of ''[[Peanuts]]'' strips printed in August 1973 in which Snoopy attempts to break the Ruth record, only to be besieged with hate mail. Lucy says in the August 11 strip, \"Hank Aaron is a great player{{nbsp}}... but you! If you break Babe Ruth's record, it'll be a disgrace!\" Coincidentally, Snoopy was only one home run short of tying the record (and finished the season as such when Charlie Brown got picked off during Snoopy's last at-bat), and as it turned out, Aaron finished the [[1973 MLB season|1973 season]] one home run short of Ruth.<ref>{{harvnb|Schulz|2009|p=95}}</ref> Babe Ruth's widow, [[Claire Merritt Hodgson|Claire Hodgson]], denounced the racism and declared that her husband would have enthusiastically cheered Aaron's attempt at the record.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=25}}</ref> As the 1974 season began, Aaron's pursuit of the record caused a small controversy. The Braves opened the season on the road in [[Cincinnati]] with a three-game series against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Braves management wanted him to break the record in [[Atlanta]], and were therefore going to have Aaron sit out the first three games of the season. But [[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Bowie Kuhn]] ruled that he had to play two games in the first series. He played two out of three, tying Babe Ruth's record, April 4, 1974, in his very first at bat\u2014on his first swing of the season\u2014off Reds pitcher [[Jack Billingham]], but did not hit another home run in the series.<ref>{{harvnb|Minter|2002}}</ref>[[File:Aaron 715.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The fence outside of Turner Field over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists.]]\n\nThe Braves returned to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, a crowd of 53,775 people showed up for the game\u2014a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on [[NBC]]. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]].<ref name=\"greatath\"/> Although Dodgers outfielder [[Bill Buckner]] nearly went over the outfield fence trying to catch it, the ball flew into the Braves' [[bullpen]], where [[relief pitcher]] [[Tom House]] caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students <ref name=\"vdtstudents\">{{harvnb|Poling|2010}}</ref> sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful [[Craig Sager]] actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now [[WWSB]]-Channel 40) in Sarasota.<ref>{{harvnb|Hiestand|2013}}</ref> As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer [[Milo Hamilton]], calling the game on [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: \"Henry Aaron, in the second inning walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee{{nbsp}}... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715!

During the [[2006 in baseball|2006 season]], [[San Francisco Giants]] slugger [[Barry Bonds]] passed Babe Ruth and moved into second place on the all-time home run list, attracting growing media coverage as he drew closer to Aaron's record.

Aaron held the MLB record for [[List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders|career home runs]] for 33 years, and he still holds several MLB offensive records.

He appeared briefly in the [[Negro American League]] and in [[minor league baseball]] before starting his major league career.<ref name=\"angelfire\"/> By his final MLB season, Aaron was the last Negro league baseball player on a major league roster.\n\nAaron played the vast majority of his MLB games in right field, though he appeared at several other infield and outfield positions.

In 1957, he was the NL [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player (MVP)]] when the Milwaukee Braves won the [[1957 World Series|World Series]]. He won the [[MLB Player of the Month|NL Player of the Month award]] in May 1958 and June 1967.

At the time of his retirement, Aaron held most of the game's key career power hitting records.\n\nIn 1982, he was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]]. Since his retirement, Aaron has held front office roles with the Atlanta Braves. In 1999, MLB introduced the [[Hank Aaron Award]] to recognize the top offensive players in each league. He was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2002. He was named a 2010 Georgia Trustee by the [[Georgia Historical Society]] in recognition of accomplishments that reflect the ideals of Georgia's founders.

Aaron grew up in a poor family.<ref name=\"greatath\"/> His family could not afford baseball equipment, so he practiced by hitting bottle caps with sticks.

As a result, in 1949, at the age of 15, Aaron had his first tryout with an MLB franchise, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers#Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]]; however, he did not make the team.<ref name=angelfire>{{harvnb|Johnson|2013}}</ref><ref name=br33/> After this, Aaron returned to school to finish his secondary education, attending the Josephine Allen Institute, a private high school in Alabama.

Years later, Aaron remembered:\n\n<blockquote>I had the Giants' contract in my hand. But the Braves offered fifty dollars a month more. That's the only thing that kept [[Willie Mays]] and me from being teammates&nbsp;\u2013 fifty dollars.<ref>{{harvnb|Honig|2000|p=290}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile with the Clowns he experienced some [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|overt racism]]. His team was in Washington, D.C.\n\n<blockquote>We had breakfast while we were waiting for the rain to stop, and I can still envision sitting with the Clowns in a restaurant behind Griffith Stadium and hearing them break all the plates in the kitchen after we finished eating. What a horrible sound. Even as a kid, the irony of it hit me: here we were in the capital in the land of freedom and equality, and they had to destroy the plates that had touched the forks that had been in the mouths of black men. If dogs had eaten off those plates, they'd have washed them.<ref name=TB>{{harvnb|Schwarz|Thorn|p=819}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Howe Sports Bureau credits Aaron with a .366 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] in 26 official Negro league games, with five [[home run]]s, 33 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBI), 41 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], and nine [[stolen base]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Vascellaro|2005|p=20}}</ref>\n\nThe Braves purchased Aaron from the Clowns for $10,000,<ref>{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=43}}</ref> which GM [[John Quinn (baseball executive)|John Quinn]] thought was a steal, as he stated that he felt that Aaron was a $100,000 property.<ref name=CB/> On June 12, 1952, Aaron signed with Braves' scout Dewey Griggs.<ref name=CB/> During this time, he picked up the nickname \"[[pork chops]]\" because it \"was the only thing I knew to order off the menu\".<ref>{{harvnb|Associated Press|1999}}</ref> A teammate later said, \"the man ate pork chops three meals a day, two for breakfast\".<ref>{{harvnb|Pollock|2006|p=228}}</ref>\n\nThe Braves assigned Aaron to the [[Eau Claire Bears]], the Braves' [[Northern League (baseball, 1902\u201371)|Northern League]] [[Class C (baseball)|Class-C]] [[farm team]].<ref name=\"greatath\"/> The 1952 season proved to be very beneficial for Aaron. Playing in the [[infield]], Aaron continued to develop as a ballplayer and made the Northern League's All-Star team.<ref name=\"greatath\"/> He broke his habit of hitting cross-handed and adopted the standard hitting technique. By the end of the season, he had performed so well that the league made him the unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year.<ref name=angelfire /><ref name=\"greatath\"/> Although he appeared in just 87 games, he scored 89 [[run (baseball)|runs]], had 116 hits, nine home runs, and 61 RBI.<ref name=\"greatath\"/> In addition, Aaron hit for a .336 batting average.<ref name=\"greatath\"/> During his minor league experience, he was very homesick and faced constant racism, but his brother, Herbert Jr., told him not to give up the opportunity.<ref>{{harvnb|Spencer|2002|p=27}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, the Braves promoted him to the [[Jacksonville Braves]], their Class-A affiliate in the [[South Atlantic League]].<ref name=\"greatath\"/> Helped by Aaron's performance, the Braves won the league championship that year. Aaron led the league in runs (115), hits (208), [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (36), RBI (125), total bases (338), and batting average (.362).<ref name=\"greatath\"/> He won the league's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] Award,<ref name=\"greatath\"/><ref name=Allen/> and had such a dominant year that one [[sportswriter]] was prompted to say, \"Henry Aaron led the league in everything except hotel accommodations.\"<ref name=\"Classic\"/> Aaron's time with the Braves did not come without problems. He was one of the first [[African American]]s to play in the league.<ref>{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=50}}</ref> The 1950s were a period of [[racial segregation]] in parts of the United States, especially the southeastern portion of the country. When Aaron traveled around [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the surrounding areas, he was often separated from his team because of [[Jim Crow laws]]. In most circumstances, the team was responsible for arranging housing and meals for its players, but Aaron often had to make his own arrangements.<ref name=blecherreport>{{cite web |title=This Day in Black Sports History: February 5, 1934 |author=Ronald Monestime |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/599197-this-day-in-black-sports-history-february-5-1934 |publisher=bleacherreport.com |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}</ref> The Braves' manager, [[Ben Geraghty]], tried his best to help Aaron on and off the field.

The night they met, Lucas decided to attend the Braves' game. Aaron singled, doubled, and hit a home run in the game. On October 6, Aaron and Lucas married.<ref name=CB2>{{harvnb|Candee|1958|p=4}}</ref> In 1958, Aaron's wife noted that during the offseason he liked \"to sit and watch those shooting westerns\". He also enjoyed cooking and fishing.<ref name=CB2/>\n\nAaron spent the winter of 1953 playing in [[Puerto Rico]]. [[Mickey Owen]], the team's manager, helped Aaron with his batting stance. Until then, Aaron had hit most pitches to left field or center field, but after working with Owen, Aaron was able to hit the ball more effectively all over the [[Baseball field|field]].<ref name=angelfire />{{better source|reason = angelfire.com is not a reliable source|date=May 2014}} During his stay in Puerto Rico, Owen also helped Aaron transition from second base to the outfield.

Though the [[Korean War]] was over, people were still being drafted. The Braves were able to speak to the draft board, making the case that Aaron could be the player to integrate the [[Southern Association]] the following season with the [[Atlanta Crackers]]. The board appears to have been convinced, as Aaron was not drafted.<ref name=Vascellaro/>\n\n==MLB career==\nIn 1954, Aaron attended spring training with the major league club. Although he was on the roster of its farm club, Milwaukee manager [[Charley Grimm]] later stated, \"From the start, he did so well I knew we were going to have to carry him.\"<ref name=CB/> On March 13, 1954, Milwaukee Braves left fielder [[Bobby Thomson]] fractured his [[ankle]] while [[slide (baseball)|sliding]] into [[second base]] during a [[spring training]] game. The next day, Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves' [[Major League Baseball|major league]] team, playing in left field and hitting a home run.<ref name=Allen/> This led Hank Aaron to a major league contract, signed on the final day of spring training, and a Braves uniform with the number five.<ref>{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=80}}</ref> On April 13, Aaron made his major league debut and was hitless in five at-bats against the Cincinnati Reds' left-hander [[Joe Nuxhall]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|Gilbert|1999|p=4}}</ref> In the same game, [[Eddie Mathews]] hit two home runs, the first of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as teammates. On April 15, Aaron collected his first major league hit, a double off Cardinals' pitcher [[Vic Raschi]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2009}}</ref> Aaron hit his first major league home run on April 23, also off Raschi.<ref name=\"greatath\"/> Over the next 122 games, Aaron batted .280 with 13 homers before he suffered a fractured ankle on September 5. He then changed his number to 44, which would turn out to look like a \"lucky number\" for the slugger. Aaron would hit 44 home runs in four different seasons,<ref>{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=541}}</ref> and he hit his record-breaking 715th career home run off Dodgers pitcher [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]], who coincidentally also wore number 44.<ref>{{harvnb|Young|2013}}</ref>\n\nAt this point, Aaron was known to family and friends primarily as \"Henry\". Braves' public relations director Don Davidson, observing Aaron's quiet, reserved nature, began referring to him publicly as \"Hank\" in order to suggest more accessibility. The nickname quickly gained currency, but \"Henry\" continued to be cited frequently in the media, both sometimes appearing in the same article, and Aaron would answer to either one. During his rookie year, his other well-known nicknames, \"Hammerin' Hank\" (by teammates) and \"Bad Henry\" (by opposing pitchers) are reported to have arisen.<ref>{{harvnb|Musick|1974|p=66}}</ref>\n\nConsiderably later in his career, Aaron coined \"Stone-fingers\", which would prove a popular handle for one of baseball's more colorful characters, the famously distance-hitting but defensively challenged first baseman [[Dick Stuart]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediafire.com/view/gxvoz2n1u7ybwuj/.png |title=Stuart Ranks Next to Foxx; Sox' 2nd Best Righty Slugger |last=Kaese |first=Harold |date=1963-08-16 |website=The Boston Globe |language=en-US |access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> reportedly \"delight[ing]\" even its recipient.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediafire.com/view/hnwe0k3obbarmq2/.png |title=Change of Pace |last=Nunn, Jr. |first=Bill |date=1963-11-09 |website=The Pittsburgh Courier |language=en-US |access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref>\n\n===Prime of his career===\n[[File:Hank Aaron 1960.png|thumb|upright|Aaron with the Braves in 1960]]\nAaron hit .314 with 27 home runs and 106 RBI, in 1955.

Since then, [[Alex Rodriguez]] has become the youngest to reach this mark.</ref> On July 31, 1969, Aaron hit his 537th home run, passing [[Mickey Mantle]]'s total; this moved Aaron into third place on the career home run list, after Willie Mays and [[Babe Ruth]]. At the end of the 1969 season, Aaron again finished third in the MVP voting.\n\nIn 1970, Aaron reached two more career milestones. On May 17, Aaron collected his 3,000th hit, in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], the team against which he played in his first major-league game.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=202}}</ref> Aaron established the record for most seasons with thirty or more home runs in the National League. On April 27, 1971, Aaron hit his 600th career home run, the third major league player ever to do so. On July 13, Aaron hit a home run in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] (played at Detroit's [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]]) for the first time. He hit his 40th home run of the season against the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]' [[Jerry Johnson (baseball)|Jerry Johnson]] on August 10, which established a National League record for most seasons with 40 or more home runs (seven). At age 37, he hit a career-high 47 home runs during the season (along with a career-high .669 [[slugging percentage]]) and finished third in MVP voting for the sixth time. During the strike-shortened season of 1972, Aaron tied and then surpassed Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list. Aaron also knocked in the 2,000th run of his career and hit a home run in the first All-Star game played in Atlanta. As the year came to a close, Aaron broke [[Stan Musial]]'s major-league record for total bases (6,134). Aaron finished the season with 673 career home runs.\n\n===Breaking Ruth's record===\n[[File:hank aaron jersey.jpg|thumb|upright|The Braves' jersey Hank Aaron wore when he broke [[Babe Ruth]]'s career home run record in 1974]]\nAaron himself downplayed the \"chase\" to surpass Babe Ruth, while baseball enthusiasts and the national media grew increasingly excited as he closed in on the 714 career home runs record. Aaron received thousands of letters every week during the summer of 1973, including hate mail; the Braves ended up hiring a secretary to help him sort through it.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=62}}</ref>\n\nAaron (then age 39) hit 40 home runs in 392 at-bats, ending the 1973 season one home run short of the record. He hit home run number 713 on September 29, 1973, and with one day remaining in the season, many expected him to tie the record. But in his final game that year, playing against the [[Houston Astros]] (managed by [[Leo Durocher]], who had once roomed with Babe Ruth), he was unable to achieve this. After the game, Aaron said his only fear was that he might not live to see the [[1974 MLB season|1974 season.]] <!-- The following sentence needs to be clarified or removed. Did Aaron speak of Clemente's death in this context?: [That statement wasn't just about the death threats: one year earlier, September 30, 1972 was the last day the legendary [[Roberto Clemente]] ever played, as he perished in the offseason.] --><ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=179}}</ref>\n\nHe was the recipient of [[death threat]]s during the 1973\u20131974 offseason and a large assortment of hate mail from people who did not want to see Aaron break Ruth's nearly [[wikt:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] home run record.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=64}}</ref> The threats extended to those providing positive press coverage of Aaron. [[Lewis Grizzard]], then sports editor of the ''Atlanta Journal'', reported receiving numerous phone calls calling journalists \"nigger lovers\" for covering Aaron's chase. While preparing the massive coverage of the home run record, he quietly had an obituary written, afraid that Aaron might be murdered.<ref>{{harvnb|Grizzard|1990|pp=239\u2013240}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' pointedly summarized the [[racism|racist]] vitriol that Aaron was forced to endure:\n\n<blockquote>Is this to be the year in which Aaron, at the age of thirty-nine, takes a [[Extra-vehicular activity|moon walk]] above one of the most hallowed individual records in American sport{{nbsp}}...? Or will it be remembered as the season in which Aaron, the most dignified of athletes, was besieged with hate mail and trapped by the cobwebs and goblins that lurk in baseball's attic?<ref>{{harvnb|Leggett|1973|p=29}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the end of the 1973 season, Aaron received a plaque from the [[US Postal Service]] for receiving more mail (930,000 pieces) than any person excluding politicians.<ref name=TB/> Aaron received an outpouring of public support in response to the [[bigotry]]. Newspaper cartoonist [[Charles Schulz]] created a series of ''[[Peanuts]]'' strips printed in August 1973 in which Snoopy attempts to break the Ruth record, only to be besieged with hate mail. Lucy says in the August 11 strip, \"Hank Aaron is a great player{{nbsp}}... but you! If you break Babe Ruth's record, it'll be a disgrace!\" Coincidentally, Snoopy was only one home run short of tying the record (and finished the season as such when Charlie Brown got picked off during Snoopy's last at-bat), and as it turned out, Aaron finished the [[1973 MLB season|1973 season]] one home run short of Ruth.<ref>{{harvnb|Schulz|2009|p=95}}</ref> Babe Ruth's widow, [[Claire Merritt Hodgson|Claire Hodgson]], denounced the racism and declared that her husband would have enthusiastically cheered Aaron's attempt at the record.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=25}}</ref> As the 1974 season began, Aaron's pursuit of the record caused a small controversy. The Braves opened the season on the road in [[Cincinnati]] with a three-game series against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Braves management wanted him to break the record in [[Atlanta]], and were therefore going to have Aaron sit out the first three games of the season. But [[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Bowie Kuhn]] ruled that he had to play two games in the first series. He played two out of three, tying Babe Ruth's record, April 4, 1974, in his very first at bat\u2014on his first swing of the season\u2014off Reds pitcher [[Jack Billingham]], but did not hit another home run in the series.<ref>{{harvnb|Minter|2002}}</ref>[[File:Aaron 715.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The fence outside of Turner Field over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists.]]\n\nThe Braves returned to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, a crowd of 53,775 people showed up for the game\u2014a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on [[NBC]]. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]].<ref name=\"greatath\"/> Although Dodgers outfielder [[Bill Buckner]] nearly went over the outfield fence trying to catch it, the ball flew into the Braves' [[bullpen]], where [[relief pitcher]] [[Tom House]] caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students <ref name=\"vdtstudents\">{{harvnb|Poling|2010}}</ref> sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful [[Craig Sager]] actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now [[WWSB]]-Channel 40) in Sarasota.<ref>{{harvnb|Hiestand|2013}}</ref> As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer [[Milo Hamilton]], calling the game on [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: \"Henry Aaron, in the second inning walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee{{nbsp}}... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715!

It is one of the largest secondary schools in Mauritius.  It was founded in 1963 and inaugurated by the then Governor General Sir [[John Shaw Rennie]]. \n\nThe school is named after [[President of the United States|American president]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. Its students are known as \"Kennedians\". The school's emblem is the American bald eagle.\n Kennedians champion the visionary and fierce attitude of the bald eagle. No matter how great you think you are, we are greater than you. Show us respect and you are shown respect, else, we treat you as a nobody.\n\nThe main areas of focus of John Kennedy College are the sciences, technology and economics. Initially the school was more technically oriented but has since diversified.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n==''The Eagles''==\n{{unreferenced-section|date=September 2016}}\n{{relevance-section|date=September 2016}}\n''The Eagles'' is the name of the school magazine published by the school. School magazines have existed since the 1970s. The first school magazines were published monthly but however, it was then published annually. Students could express their ideas and their vision through the magazines. ''The Eagles'' at the time were very successful. One famous part of the magazine was the famous quotes by JKC teachers. The most recent magazine is Eagles 2013, a magazine which commemorated the 50 years of existence of the school. This magazine is the first one to be completely designed by the students themselves.\n\n==JKC Golden Jubilee==\nIn 2013, the John Kennedy College celebrated the 50th anniversary laying of its foundation stone. A souvenir magazine entitled \"Eagles 2013\" covering the history and present of the school was launched. The rector launched a special program for the two years celebration of the 50th anniversary. The official 50th anniversary of the opening of the school will be celebrated in 2015. An official former students association is to be created soon connecting kennedians from all decades together with the actual students in upper six who are the first batch of students to enroll JKC again as from form 1,  soon to be the former students.\n\n\n'''<big><u>''The Image''</u></big>'''\n\nThe John Kennedy College is home to the many students having great potential and intelligence.\n\nSome of them use these two gifts in their education and others as you guess in their mischiefs.\n\nAll of these have contributed to them having notorious nicknames such as \"Kennedians\", \"Soulars\", \"Fumeurs\", \"Metteur Nissa\" and \"Ban Bourzwas la\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://jkc.edu.govmu.org John Kennedy College website]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Kennedy-College/15076389450 John Kennedy College facebook page]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/JkcSchoolMag20122013 JKC School Magazine 2013 Official Facebook Page]\n\n{{Mauritius State Secondary Schools}}\n\n[[Category:Schools in Mauritius]]\n[[Category:Boys' schools in Mauritius]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1964]]\n[[Category:1964 establishments in Mauritius]]\n[[Category:Memorials to John F.

It is one of the largest secondary schools in Mauritius.  It was founded in 1963 and inaugurated by the then Governor General Sir [[John Shaw Rennie]]. \n\nThe school is named after [[President of the United States|American president]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. Its students are known as \"Kennedians\". The school's emblem is the American bald eagle.\n Kennedians champion the visionary and fierce attitude of the bald eagle. No matter how great you think you are, we are greater than you. Show us respect and you are shown respect, else, we treat you as a nobody.\n\nThe main areas of focus of John Kennedy College are the sciences, technology and economics. Initially the school was more technically oriented but has since diversified.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n==''The Eagles''==\n{{unreferenced-section|date=September 2016}}\n{{relevance-section|date=September 2016}}\n''The Eagles'' is the name of the school magazine published by the school. School magazines have existed since the 1970s. The first school magazines were published monthly but however, it was then published annually. Students could express their ideas and their vision through the magazines. ''The Eagles'' at the time were very successful. One famous part of the magazine was the famous quotes by JKC teachers. The most recent magazine is Eagles 2013, a magazine which commemorated the 50 years of existence of the school. This magazine is the first one to be completely designed by the students themselves.\n\n==JKC Golden Jubilee==\nIn 2013, the John Kennedy College celebrated the 50th anniversary laying of its foundation stone. A souvenir magazine entitled \"Eagles 2013\" covering the history and present of the school was launched. The rector launched a special program for the two years celebration of the 50th anniversary. The official 50th anniversary of the opening of the school will be celebrated in 2015. An official former students association is to be created soon connecting kennedians from all decades together with the actual students in upper six who are the first batch of students to enroll JKC again as from form 1,  soon to be the former students.\n\n\n'''<big><u>''The Image''</u></big>'''\n\nThe John Kennedy College is home to the many students having great potential and intelligence.\n\nSome of them use these two gifts in their education and others as you guess in their mischiefs.\n\nAll of these have contributed to them having notorious nicknames such as \"Kennedians\", \"Soulars\", \"Fumeurs\", \"Metteur Nissa\" and \"Ban Bourzwas la\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://jkc.edu.govmu.org John Kennedy College website]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Kennedy-College/15076389450 John Kennedy College facebook page]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/JkcSchoolMag20122013 JKC School Magazine 2013 Official Facebook Page]\n\n{{Mauritius State Secondary Schools}}\n\n[[Category:Schools in Mauritius]]\n[[Category:Boys' schools in Mauritius]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1964]]\n[[Category:1964 establishments in Mauritius]]\n[[Category:Memorials to John F.

He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the [[1660 Restoration]] of the monarchy until his death in 1685.\n\nCharles II was the eldest surviving child of [[Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France]]. After [[Charles I's execution]] at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the [[English Civil War]], the [[Parliament of Scotland]] proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649. However, England entered the period known as the [[English Interregnum]] or the [[English Commonwealth]], and the country was a ''de facto'' republic led by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651, and Charles [[Escape of Charles II|fled to mainland Europe]]. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents stating a [[regnal year]] did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649.\n\n[[Cavalier Parliament|Charles's English parliament]] enacted laws known as the [[Clarendon Code]], designed to shore up the position of the [[Established Church|re-established]] [[Church of England]]. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. In 1670, he entered into the [[Treaty of Dover]], an alliance with his cousin King [[Louis XIV of France]]. Louis agreed to aid him in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce [[religious freedom]] for Catholics and Protestant [[dissenter]]s with his 1672 [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], but the [[English Parliament]] forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, [[Titus Oates]]'s revelations of a supposed [[Popish Plot]] sparked the [[Exclusion Crisis]] when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir presumptive, [[James, Duke of York]], was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and anti-exclusion [[Tory]] parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the [[Rye House Plot]] to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death in 1685. He was received into the [[Catholic Church]] on his deathbed.\n\nCharles was one of the most popular and beloved kings of England,{{sfn|Ogg|1955|p=139}} known as the ''Merry Monarch'', in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the [[Puritans]]. Charles's wife, [[Catherine of Braganza]], bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.\n\n== Early life, civil war and exile ==\n[[File:Charles II Prince of Wales Egmont.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Charles II as an infant in 1630, painting attributed to [[Justus van Egmont]]|alt=Baby in white christening robe]]\n[[File:William Dobson - Charles II, 1630 - 1685.

As he had been required to do so many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the [[Tower of London]], in which he was held for another five years.<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=367\u2013374}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|pp=306\u2013309}}.</ref>\n\n== Later years ==\nCharles faced a political storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being next in line to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]] (previously Baron Ashley and a member of the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the [[Exclusion Bill]], which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]]. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant [[Duke of Monmouth]], the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The ''Abhorrers''\u2014those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent\u2014were named [[Tory|Tories]] (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the ''Petitioners''\u2014those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill\u2014were called [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=373, 377, 391}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|pp=310\u2013320}}.</ref>\n\n===Absolute monarch===\n[[File:King Charles II by John Riley.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[John Riley (painter)|John Riley]], c. 1680\u20131685|alt=Head and shoulders portrait of Charles with heavy jowls. He wears a wig of long black curls and a suit of armour.]]\nFearing that the Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the continuing Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, for a second time that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days.<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=376\u2013401}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|pp=314\u2013345}}.</ref> During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.{{sfn|Hutton|1989|pp=430\u2013441}}\n\nCharles's opposition to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated the [[Rye House Plot]], a plan to murder him and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. A great fire, however, destroyed Charles's lodgings at Newmarket, which forced him to leave the races early, thus inadvertently avoiding the planned attack. News of the failed plot was leaked.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=426}} Protestant politicians such as [[Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex|the Earl of Essex]], [[Algernon Sydney]], [[William Russell, Lord Russell|Lord Russell]] and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot. Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in the Tower of London; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange. Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held in the Tower were released and the king's Catholic brother, James, acquired greater influence at court.<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=420\u2013423}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|pp=366\u2013368}}.</ref> Titus Oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=437}}\n\nThus through the last years of Charles's reign, his approach towards his opponents changed, and he was compared by Whigs to the contemporary [[Louis XIV of France]], with his form of government in those years termed \"slavery\". Many of them were prosecuted and their estates seized, with Charles replacing judges and sheriffs at will and packing juries to achieve conviction. To destroy opposition in London, Charles first disenfranchised many Whigs in the 1682 municipal elections, and in 1683 the [[Ancient borough#Charters of incorporation|London charter]] was forfeited. In retrospect, the use of the judicial system by Charles (and later his brother and heir James) as a tool against opposition, helped establish the idea of [[separation of powers]] between the judiciary and the Crown in Whig thought.<ref>Marshall J.

Mercuric poisoning can produce irreversible kidney damage; however, the case for this being a cause of his death is unproven.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|pp=586\u2013587}} In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including [[bloodletting]], purging and [[Cupping therapy|cupping]] in hopes of effecting a recovery.{{sfn|Roberts|2015}}\n\nOn his deathbed Charles asked his brother, James, to look after his mistresses: \"be well to [[Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth|Portsmouth]], and let not poor [[Nell Gwyn|Nelly]] starve\".{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=456}}<!--This is a paraphrase used by Fraser--> He told his courtiers, \"I am sorry, gentlemen, for being such a time a-dying\",{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=73}} and expressed regret at his treatment of his wife. On the last evening of his life he was received into the Catholic Church in the presence of Father [[John Huddleston]], though the extent to which he was fully conscious or committed, and with whom the idea originated, is unclear.{{sfn|Hutton|1989|pp=443, 456}} He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] \"without any manner of pomp\"{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=73}} on 14 February.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=459}}\n\nCharles was succeeded by his brother, who became [[James II of England]] and Ireland and James VII of Scotland.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Charles II statue. Parliament Square Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Charles II as a Roman Caesar, erected 1685, [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh]]|alt=Lead equestrian statue]]\nThe escapades of Charles after his defeat at the Battle of Worcester remained important to him throughout his life. He delighted and bored listeners with tales of his escape for many years. Numerous accounts of his adventures were published, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the Restoration. Though not averse to his escape being ascribed to divine providence, Charles himself seems to have delighted most in his ability to sustain his disguise as a man of ordinary origins, and to move unrecognised through his realm. Ironic and cynical, Charles took pleasure in retailing stories which demonstrated the undetectable nature of any inherent majesty he possessed.{{sfn|Weber|1988|pages=492\u2013493, 505\u2013506}}\n\nCharles had no legitimate children, but acknowledged a dozen by seven mistresses,{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=411}} including five by [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Villiers, Lady Castlemaine]], for whom the [[Duke of Cleveland|Dukedom of Cleveland]] was created. His other mistresses included [[Moll Davis]], [[Nell Gwyn]], [[Elizabeth Killigrew, Viscountess Shannon|Elizabeth Killigrew]], [[Catherine Pegge]], [[Lucy Walter]] and [[Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth]]. As a result, in his lifetime he was often nicknamed \"[[Old Rowley]]\", the name of his favourite racehorse, notable as a stallion.{{sfn|Pearson|1960|p=147}}\n\nHis subjects resented paying taxes that were spent on his mistresses and their children,{{sfn|Hutton|1989|p=338}} many of whom received dukedoms or earldoms. The present [[Duke of Buccleuch|Dukes of Buccleuch]], [[Duke of Richmond|Richmond]], [[Duke of Grafton|Grafton]] and [[Duke of St Albans|St Albans]] descend from Charles in unbroken male line.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=413}} [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], was descended from two of Charles's illegitimate sons: the [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton|Dukes of Grafton]] and [[Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond|Richmond]]. Diana's son, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], second in line to the British throne, is likely to be the first British monarch descended from Charles II.\n\nCharles's eldest son, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], led a rebellion against James II, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]] on 6 July 1685, captured and executed. James was eventually dethroned in 1688, in the course of the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n[[File:Rhc-charles2.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Charles II (c. 1682) in ancient Roman dress by [[Grinling Gibbons]] at the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]]|alt=Gilt statue]]\nLooking back on Charles's reign, Tories tended to view it as a time of benevolent monarchy whereas Whigs perceived it as a terrible [[despotism]]. Today it is possible to assess him without the taint of partisanship, and he is seen as more of a lovable rogue\u2014in the words of his contemporary [[John Evelyn]], \"a prince of many virtues and many great imperfections, debonair, easy of access, not bloody or cruel\".{{sfn|Miller|1991|pp=382\u2013383}} [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], wrote more lewdly of Charles:\n{{quote|<poem>Restless he rolls from whore to whore\nA merry monarch, scandalous and poor.{{sfn|Miller|1991|p=95}}</poem>}}\n\nProfessor [[Ronald Hutton]] summarises the polarised historiography:\n{{quote|For the past hundred years, books on Charles II have been sharply divided into two categories. Academic historians have concentrated mainly on his activities as a statesman and emphasised his duplicity, self-indulgence, poor judgement and lack of an aptitude for business or for stable and trustworthy government.

He was the personal patron of Sir [[Christopher Wren]], the architect who helped rebuild London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] and who constructed the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], which Charles founded as a home for retired soldiers in 1682. As a patron of education, he founded a number of schools, including the [[Royal Mathematical School]] in London and [[The King's Hospital]] in Dublin, as well as the Erasmus Smith schools in various parts of Ireland.\n\nThe anniversary of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] (which was also Charles's birthday)\u201429 May\u2014was recognised in England until the mid-nineteenth century as [[Oak Apple Day]], after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell.

He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the [[1660 Restoration]] of the monarchy until his death in 1685.\n\nCharles II was the eldest surviving child of [[Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France]]. After [[Charles I's execution]] at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the [[English Civil War]], the [[Parliament of Scotland]] proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649. However, England entered the period known as the [[English Interregnum]] or the [[English Commonwealth]], and the country was a ''de facto'' republic led by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651, and Charles [[Escape of Charles II|fled to mainland Europe]]. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents stating a [[regnal year]] did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649.\n\n[[Cavalier Parliament|Charles's English parliament]] enacted laws known as the [[Clarendon Code]], designed to shore up the position of the [[Established Church|re-established]] [[Church of England]]. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. In 1670, he entered into the [[Treaty of Dover]], an alliance with his cousin King [[Louis XIV of France]]. Louis agreed to aid him in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce [[religious freedom]] for Catholics and Protestant [[dissenter]]s with his 1672 [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], but the [[English Parliament]] forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, [[Titus Oates]]'s revelations of a supposed [[Popish Plot]] sparked the [[Exclusion Crisis]] when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir presumptive, [[James, Duke of York]], was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and anti-exclusion [[Tory]] parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the [[Rye House Plot]] to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death in 1685. He was received into the [[Catholic Church]] on his deathbed.\n\nCharles was one of the most popular and beloved kings of England,{{sfn|Ogg|1955|p=139}} known as the ''Merry Monarch'', in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the [[Puritans]]. Charles's wife, [[Catherine of Braganza]], bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.\n\n== Early life, civil war and exile ==\n[[File:Charles II Prince of Wales Egmont.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Charles II as an infant in 1630, painting attributed to [[Justus van Egmont]]|alt=Baby in white christening robe]]\n[[File:William Dobson - Charles II, 1630 - 1685.

His parents were [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who ruled the three kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Henrietta Maria]], the sister of the French king [[Louis XIII]]. Charles was their second child. Their first son was born about a year before Charles, but died within a day.{{sfn|Weir|1996| pp=255\u2013257}} England, Scotland, and Ireland were respectively predominantly [[Church of England|Anglican]], [[Presbyterian]], and [[Catholic]]. Charles was baptised in the [[Chapel Royal]], on 27 June, by the Anglican [[Bishop of London]], [[William Laud]]. He was brought up in the care of the Protestant [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset#Family|Countess of Dorset]], though his godparents included his maternal uncle Louis XIII and his maternal grandmother, [[Marie de' Medici]], the Dowager Queen of France, both of whom were Catholics.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp= 1\u20134}}.</ref> At birth, Charles automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]], along with several other associated titles. At or around his eighth birthday, he was designated [[Prince of Wales]], though he was never formally invested.{{sfn|Weir|1996| pp=255\u2013257}}\n\nDuring the 1640s, when Charles was still young, his father fought [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] and [[Puritan]] forces in the [[English Civil War]]. Charles accompanied his father during the [[Battle of Edgehill]] and, at the age of fourteen, participated in the campaigns of 1645, when he was made titular commander of the English forces in the [[West Country]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> By spring 1646, his father was losing the war, and Charles left England due to fears for his safety. Setting off from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] after staying at [[Pendennis Castle]], he went first to the [[Isles of Scilly]], then to [[Jersey]], and finally to France, where his mother was already living in exile and his first cousin, eight-year-old [[Louis XIV]], was king.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|pp=38\u201345}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|p=6}}.</ref> Charles I surrendered into captivity in May 1646.\n\nIn 1648, during the [[Second English Civil War]], Charles moved to [[The Hague]], where his sister [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]] and his brother-in-law [[William II, Prince of Orange]], seemed more likely to provide substantial aid to the [[Cavalier|royalist]] cause than his mother's French relations.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|pp=55\u201356}} However, the royalist fleet that came under Charles's control was not used to any advantage, and did not reach Scotland in time to join up with the royalist [[Engager]] army of the [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] before it was defeated at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]] by the Parliamentarians.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|pp=57\u201360}}\n\nAt The Hague, Charles had a brief affair with [[Lucy Walter]], who later falsely claimed that they had secretly married.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|pp=65\u201366, 155}}; {{harvnb|Hutton|1989|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|p=5}}.</ref> Her son, [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|James Crofts]] (afterwards [[Duke of Monmouth]] and [[Duke of Buccleuch]]), was one of Charles's many illegitimate children who became prominent in British society.{{sfn|Weir|1996|pp=255\u2013257}}\n\nDespite his son's diplomatic efforts to save him, King Charles I was beheaded in January 1649, and England became a republic. On 5 February, the [[Covenanter]] [[Parliament of Scotland]] proclaimed Charles II \"King of Great Britain, France and Ireland\" at the [[Mercat Cross, Edinburgh]],{{sfn|RPS|loc=1649/1/71}} but refused to allow him to enter Scotland unless he accepted the imposition of Presbyterianism throughout Britain and Ireland.\n\nWhen negotiations with the Scots stalled, Charles authorised [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|General Montrose]] to land in the [[Orkney Islands]] with a small army to threaten the Scots with invasion, in the hope of forcing an agreement more to his liking. Montrose feared that Charles would accept a compromise, and so chose to invade mainland Scotland anyway. He was captured and executed. Charles reluctantly promised that he would abide by the terms of a [[Treaty of Breda (1650)|treaty agreed between him and the Scots Parliament]] at [[Breda]], and support the [[Solemn League and Covenant]], which authorised [[Presbyterian church governance]] across Britain. Upon his arrival in Scotland on 23 June 1650, he formally agreed to the Covenant; his abandonment of [[Episcopy|Episcopal]] church governance, although winning him support in Scotland, left him unpopular in England. Charles himself soon came to despise the \"villainy\" and \"hypocrisy\" of the Covenanters.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Hutton|1989|p=53}}.</ref>\n[[File:Cast gold medal of Charles II Stuart.jpg|thumb|Cast gold coronation medal of Charles II, dated 1651]]\nOn 3 September 1650, the Covenanters were defeated at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]] by a much smaller force led by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Scots forces were divided into royalist Engagers and Presbyterian Covenanters, who even fought each other. Disillusioned by the Covenanters, in October Charles attempted to escape from them and rode north to join with an Engager force, an event which became known as \"the Start\", but within two days the Presbyterians had caught up with and recovered him.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|pp=96\u201397}}; {{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref> Nevertheless, the Scots remained Charles's best hope of restoration, and he was crowned King of Scotland at [[Scone Abbey]] on 1 January 1651. With Cromwell's forces threatening Charles's position in Scotland, it was decided to mount an attack on England. With many of the Scots (including [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Lord Argyll]] and other leading Covenanters) refusing to participate, and with few English royalists joining the force as it moved south into England, the invasion ended in defeat at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651, after which Charles eluded capture by hiding in the [[Royal Oak (tree)|Royal Oak]] at [[Boscobel House]]. Through six weeks of narrow escapes [[Escape of Charles II|Charles managed to flee England]] in disguise, landing in [[Normandy]] on 16 October, despite a reward of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,000 on his head, risk of death for anyone caught helping him and the difficulty in disguising Charles, who, at over {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}, was unusually tall.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|pp=98\u2013128}}; {{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=53\u201369}}.</ref>{{efn|One thousand pounds was a vast sum at the time, greater than an average workman's lifetime earnings.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=117}} }}\n[[File:Charles II (de Champaigne).jpg|thumb|right|A king in exile: Charles II painted by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], c. 1653]]\nUnder the [[Instrument of Government]] passed by Parliament, Cromwell was appointed [[Lord Protector#Cromwellian Commonwealth|Lord Protector]] of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1653, effectively placing the [[British Isles]] under military rule. Impoverished, Charles could not obtain sufficient support to mount a serious challenge to Cromwell's government. Despite the [[Stuart family]] connections through Henrietta Maria and the Princess of Orange, France and the [[Dutch Republic]] allied themselves with Cromwell's government from 1654, forcing Charles to turn for aid to Spain, which at that time ruled the [[Southern Netherlands]].{{sfn|Hutton|1989|pp=74\u2013112}}\n\nCharles made the [[Treaty of Brussels (1656)|Treaty of Brussels]] with Spain in 1656. This gathered Spanish support for a restoration in return for Charles's contribution to the war against France. Charles raised a ragtag army from his exiled subjects; this small, underpaid, poorly-equipped and ill-disciplined force formed the nucleus of the post-Restoration army.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|pp=156\u2013157}} The Commonwealth made the [[Treaty of Paris (1657)|Treaty of Paris]] with France in 1657 to join them in war against Spain in the Netherlands.

However, the new Lord Protector had little experience of either military or civil administration. In 1659, the [[Rump Parliament]] was recalled and Richard resigned. During the civil and military unrest that followed, [[George Monck]], the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|pp=160\u2013165}} Monck and his army marched into the [[City of London]], and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the [[Long Parliament]] who had been excluded in December 1648, during [[Pride's Purge]]. The Long Parliament dissolved itself and there was a general election for the first time in almost 20 years.<ref>Diary of [[Samuel Pepys]], 16 March 1660.</ref> The outgoing Parliament defined the electoral qualifications intending to bring about the return of a Presbyterian majority.{{sfn|Miller|1991|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe restrictions against royalist candidates and voters were widely ignored, and the elections resulted in a [[Parliament of England|House of Commons]] that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians.{{sfn|Miller|1991|pp=24\u201325}} The new so-called [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the [[Declaration of Breda]], in which Charles promised lenience and tolerance.

Louis made peace with the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], but he continued to maintain his aggressive intentions towards the Netherlands. In 1670, Charles, seeking to solve his financial troubles, agreed to the [[Treaty of Dover]], under which Louis XIV would pay him \u00a3160,000 each year. In exchange, Charles agreed to supply Louis with troops and to announce his conversion to Catholicism \"as soon as the welfare of his kingdom will permit\".{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=275}} Louis was to provide him with 6,000 troops to suppress those who opposed the conversion.

In 1672, Charles issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], in which he purported to suspend all [[penal law (Britain)|penal laws]] against Catholics and other religious dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|pp=305\u2013308}}; {{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=284\u2013285}}.</ref>\n\nThe Cavalier Parliament opposed the Declaration of Indulgence on constitutional grounds by claiming that the king had no right to arbitrarily suspend laws passed by Parliament. Charles withdrew the Declaration, and also agreed to the [[Test Act]], which not only required public officials to receive the [[Eucharist|sacrament]] under the forms prescribed by the Church of England,{{sfn|Raithby|1819|pp=782\u2013785}} but also later forced them to denounce [[transubstantiation]] and the Catholic mass as \"superstitious and idolatrous\".{{sfn|Raithby|1819a| pp=894\u2013896}} Clifford, who had converted to Catholicism, resigned rather than take the oath, and died shortly after, possibly from suicide. By 1674 England had gained nothing from the Anglo-Dutch War, and the Cavalier Parliament refused to provide further funds, forcing Charles to make peace. The power of the Cabal waned and that of Clifford's replacement, [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Lord Danby]], grew.\n\n[[File:Charles-pineapple.jpg|thumb|right|Charles was presented with the first [[pineapple]] grown in England in 1675.

Partly to assuage public fears that the royal family was too Catholic, Charles agreed that James's daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], should marry the Protestant [[William III of England|William of Orange]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1979|pp=347\u2013348}}; {{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=345\u2013346}}.</ref> In 1678, [[Titus Oates]], who had been alternately an Anglican and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, falsely warned of a \"[[Popish Plot]]\" to assassinate the king, even accusing the queen of complicity. Charles did not believe the allegations, but ordered his chief minister Lord Danby to investigate. While Danby seems to have been rightly sceptical about Oates's claims, the Cavalier Parliament took them seriously.{{sfn|Hutton|1989|pp=359\u2013362}} The people were seized with an anti-Catholic hysteria;{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=360}} judges and juries across the land condemned the supposed conspirators; numerous innocent individuals were executed.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=375}}\n\nLater in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on the charge of [[high treason]]. Although much of the nation had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had secretly negotiated with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.{{sfn|Miller|1991|pp=278, 301\u2013304}}\n\nThe new English Parliament, which met in March of the same year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had intended to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of [[Lord High Treasurer]], but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the [[House of Lords]] attempted to impose the punishment of exile\u2014which the Commons thought too mild\u2014the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been required to do so many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the [[Tower of London]], in which he was held for another five years.<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=367\u2013374}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|pp=306\u2013309}}.</ref>\n\n== Later years ==\nCharles faced a political storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being next in line to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]] (previously Baron Ashley and a member of the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the [[Exclusion Bill]], which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]]. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant [[Duke of Monmouth]], the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The ''Abhorrers''\u2014those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent\u2014were named [[Tory|Tories]] (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the ''Petitioners''\u2014those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill\u2014were called [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=373, 377, 391}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|pp=310\u2013320}}.</ref>\n\n===Absolute monarch===\n[[File:King Charles II by John Riley.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[John Riley (painter)|John Riley]], c. 1680\u20131685|alt=Head and shoulders portrait of Charles with heavy jowls.

Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days.<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=376\u2013401}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|pp=314\u2013345}}.</ref> During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.{{sfn|Hutton|1989|pp=430\u2013441}}\n\nCharles's opposition to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated the [[Rye House Plot]], a plan to murder him and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. A great fire, however, destroyed Charles's lodgings at Newmarket, which forced him to leave the races early, thus inadvertently avoiding the planned attack. News of the failed plot was leaked.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=426}} Protestant politicians such as [[Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex|the Earl of Essex]], [[Algernon Sydney]], [[William Russell, Lord Russell|Lord Russell]] and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot. Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in the Tower of London; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange. Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held in the Tower were released and the king's Catholic brother, James, acquired greater influence at court.<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|1989|pp=420\u2013423}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1991|pp=366\u2013368}}.</ref> Titus Oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=437}}\n\nThus through the last years of Charles's reign, his approach towards his opponents changed, and he was compared by Whigs to the contemporary [[Louis XIV of France]], with his form of government in those years termed \"slavery\". Many of them were prosecuted and their estates seized, with Charles replacing judges and sheriffs at will and packing juries to achieve conviction. To destroy opposition in London, Charles first disenfranchised many Whigs in the 1682 municipal elections, and in 1683 the [[Ancient borough#Charters of incorporation|London charter]] was forfeited. In retrospect, the use of the judicial system by Charles (and later his brother and heir James) as a tool against opposition, helped establish the idea of [[separation of powers]] between the judiciary and the Crown in Whig thought.<ref>Marshall J.

He delighted and bored listeners with tales of his escape for many years. Numerous accounts of his adventures were published, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the Restoration. Though not averse to his escape being ascribed to divine providence, Charles himself seems to have delighted most in his ability to sustain his disguise as a man of ordinary origins, and to move unrecognised through his realm. Ironic and cynical, Charles took pleasure in retailing stories which demonstrated the undetectable nature of any inherent majesty he possessed.{{sfn|Weber|1988|pages=492\u2013493, 505\u2013506}}\n\nCharles had no legitimate children, but acknowledged a dozen by seven mistresses,{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=411}} including five by [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Villiers, Lady Castlemaine]], for whom the [[Duke of Cleveland|Dukedom of Cleveland]] was created. His other mistresses included [[Moll Davis]], [[Nell Gwyn]], [[Elizabeth Killigrew, Viscountess Shannon|Elizabeth Killigrew]], [[Catherine Pegge]], [[Lucy Walter]] and [[Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth]]. As a result, in his lifetime he was often nicknamed \"[[Old Rowley]]\", the name of his favourite racehorse, notable as a stallion.{{sfn|Pearson|1960|p=147}}\n\nHis subjects resented paying taxes that were spent on his mistresses and their children,{{sfn|Hutton|1989|p=338}} many of whom received dukedoms or earldoms.
