When they reorganized as a tribe, they had to buy back the land from the US government. The EBCI also own, hold, or maintain additional lands in the vicinity, and as far away as {{Convert|100|miles}} from the Qualla Boundary. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians are primarily the descendants of those persons listed on the Baker Rolls of Cherokee Indians. They gained federal recognition as a tribe in the 20th century. The Qualla Boundary is not a reservation per se because the land is owned by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.\n\nThe Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is one of three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, the others being the [[Cherokee Nation]] and the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]], both based in [[Oklahoma]]. Its headquarters is in the namesake town of [[Cherokee, North Carolina]] in the [[Qualla Boundary]], south of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]].\n\n==History, language and religion==\n[[File:Joel queen e band cwy.jpg|thumb|220px|Joel Queen, award-winning Eastern Band [[sculptor]] and [[ceramic artist]]]]\nThe Eastern Band members are primarily descended from about 800 Cherokee living along the remote [[Oconaluftee River]] who did not participate in the [[Trail of Tears]] to [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]). [[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|Principal Chief]] [[Yonaguska]], with the help of his adopted European-American son, [[William Holland Thomas]], managed to avoid removal. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians have maintained many traditional [[tribe|tribal]] practices. Many prominent Cherokee historians are affiliated with, or are members of the Eastern Band.\n\n[[Tsali]] (pronounced {{IPA-iro|\u02c8tsali|}}) opposed the removal. He remained in the traditional Cherokee lands with a small group who resisted the [[U.S. Army]] and tried to thwart the removal. Tsali was eventually captured. He was executed by the United States in exchange for the lives of the small band he protected. They were allowed to remain in the Cherokee homeland, with the condition that they give up Cherokee tribal citizenship and assimilate as US citizens.\n\nTheir descendants reorganized in the 20th century and gained federal recognition as a tribe known as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (named in reference to the majority of the tribe who moved west to Indian Territory in 1839.) They bought back land in what is known as [[Qualla Boundary]], part of their traditional territory that had been ceded to the US government by other Cherokee leaders prior to removal.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nTheir [[Museum of the Cherokee Indian]] in [[Cherokee, North Carolina ]] exhibits an extensive collection of artifacts and items of historical and cultural interest, from the early [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian Period]], of which there are remains in the area, to the Cherokee Culture brought by their migrants in the 16th and 17th centuries{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. They are an Iroquoian-speaking people related to those nations in the Iroquois Confederacy and other Iroquoian-speaking groups traditionally occupying territory around the Great Lakes. The Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, located near the museum, sells traditional crafts made by its members. Founded in 1946, the [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]] is country\u2019s oldest and foremost Native American crafts cooperative.<ref name=NCsmokymtns>[http://www.visitsmokies.org/index.php?option=com_jumi&fileid=4&ID=748 Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, Inc.], ''Smoky Mountain Host of North Carolina'' (retrieved July 1, 2014)</ref>\n\n==Contemporary language and religion==\n{{further|New Kituwah Academy|Cherokee language|Cherokee syllabary}}\n[[Image:Stickballdance1897eastern.png|thumb|300px|A [[stickball]] dance on the Qualla Boundary. 1897.]]\n\nMore than two dozen Christian churches of various denominations are located within the Qualla Boundary. Many of the traditional religious practices of the Eastern Band have, over time, blended with new age views and customs according to Cherokee traditionalists. They have diverged as the result of cultural isolation of the various factions of [[Cherokee society]]. Many traditional dances and ceremonies are still practiced by the Eastern Band.\n\nThe Eastern Band has begun a [[language immersion]] program requiring all graduating high school seniors to speak the tribal language beginning 2007.

The land is a mere fragment of the extensive original homeland of the Cherokee Nation, which once stretched from Virginia to South Carolina and west to present-day Tennessee and Alabama. The people had to purchase their land in order to regain it after it was taken over by the US government through treaty cessions, which had all been negotiated by a very small percentage of assimilated Cherokees.\n\nToday the tribe earns most of its revenue from a combination of Federal/State funds, tourism, and the [[Harrah's Cherokee|Harrah's Cherokee Casino]], established in the early 1990s.\n\nTourism includes many campgrounds, trails and river adventures, mountain biking, fishing, golfing, spas, [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]], [[Unto These Hills]] Outdoor Historical Drama, [[Oconaluftee Indian Village]], [[Cherokee Botanical Garden and Nature Trail]], the award-winning [[Museum of the Cherokee Indian]], zoos, restaurants and a collection of galleries and shops representing gifted, traditional artists, such as [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]].\n\n===Gaming relations with North Carolina===\n\nIn 1988, the United States Congress passed the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA), which allowed federally recognized tribes to establish casinos on tribal property. Under the act, tribes are limited to offer casino games that correspond to the existing level of gaming allowed under state law. [[North Carolina]] was unique in permitting the Cherokee to establish a casino offering Class III gaming, well before the state allowed a lottery. The typical pattern has been for states to offer a lottery, followed by an agreement between the state and the Indian tribe to allow establishment of a casino or other form of gambling operation.<ref name=\"lib.unc.edu\">Sedgwick, Jessica.

[http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/about.aspx. \"About Us, Introduction and Timeline.\"] Cited October 1, 2008.</ref> The casino was the result of nearly ten years of negotiations among tribal, state, and federal officials. Tribal Chief Jonathan \"Ed\" Taylor, North Carolina Lead Liaison and Chief Negotiator [[David T.

The tribe had previously opened a small casino offering forms of video poker and electronic bingo. This had been challenged by the [[Asheville, North Carolina]] U.S Attorney on the grounds that the tribe was offering a form of gambling that was not legal elsewhere in North Carolina. The tribe wanted to ensure agreements with the state to prevent such problems.<ref name=\"lib.unc.edu\"/>\n\nMany Cherokee leaders opposed the establishment of a casino on tribal lands. The tribe\u2019s spiritual leader, [[Walker Calhoun]], said in 1995 that \"gambling would be the Cherokee\u2019s damnation.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe tribe and Governor Hunt came to agreement: the casino would be allowed to offer electronic games that required \"skill or dexterity\" and with a maximum jackpot of $25,000; table games were to be prohibited; and alcohol was not permitted. One half of the annual casino earnings were to be divided among all members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee tribe as an annual bonus.<ref name=\"lib.unc.edu\"/>\n\nSince the inception of the North Carolina lottery in August 2005, Harrah\u2019s Cherokee casino has been permitted to extend its offered games to include Class II and III gambling. As thousands of people visit Harrah\u2019s each year and the casino\u2019s popularity continues to increase, the economic benefits of the casino have become evident. Annually, at least $5 million of casino profits is given to the Cherokee Preservation Fund; this institution pays for projects that promote non-gambling economic development, protect the environment, and preserve Cherokee heritage and culture.<ref>\"Cherokee casino should be granted the option other tribal casinos enjoy,\" ''Asheville Citizen-Times'', Asheville, North Carolina.

It began to be socially and politically accepted and legislated during the late 19th century, beginning with [[South Australia]] in 1894 and [[Western Australia]] in 1899. In 1902, the newly established [[Australian Parliament]] passed the ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'', which set a uniform law enabling women (except those who were \"aboriginal natives\" of Australia, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands, unless excepted under [[Section 41 of the Constitution of Australia|section 41 of the constitution]]) to vote at federal elections and to stand for the federal Parliament. This removed gender discrimination in relation to electoral rights for federal elections in Australia. By 1911, the remaining [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] had legislated for [[women's suffrage]] for state elections.

In 1902, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the uniform ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'', which enabled women 21 years of age and older to vote at elections for the federal Parliament.

In 1902, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the uniform ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'', which enabled women 21 years of age and older to vote at elections for the federal Parliament.

St Patrick's [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] was built in 1874, and is the oldest known building in the suburb.

The building was originally a private home known as ''Kelvin Grove'', and owned by Mrs Jane Drynan. Much of the exterior of the church is original but none of the internal walls were retained when the building was converted into a church. Following Drynan's death, Kelvin Grove was owned or leased by a succession of different people, including the Haberfield [[Real estate|real-estate]] developer Richard Stanton, Croydon brick-maker William Downton, and two sisters named Freeman (one of whom was a nurse). In the 1920s and 1930s Kelvin Grove may have been used as a nursing home. The first [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] was celebrated in Kelvin Grove on [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's day]] 1946, giving the church its name.<ref name=\"pratten\" />\n\nSt Andrew's Anglican Church has three distinctive internal [[transept]] arches, and was designed by a Presbyterian, Alexander Leckie Elphinstone Junior. The foundation stone was laid in 1883, and the top of the spire completed in 1906. The fast construction period, unusual for that time, was indicative of the area's affluence. Recent Asian influences in Summer Hill have brought about the introduction of non-Christian places of worship. The Wong Tai Sin (or Kwan Yin Kur) temple is located on the corners of Kensington Road and Liverpool Road in a building that was a Masonic temple in the 1920s.<ref name=\"pratten\" /> The same building was converted into the current temple; the lower floor houses the [[Taoism|Taoist]] deity of [[Wong Tai Sin]], and the upper floor houses the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bodhisattva]] of [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]].\n\n==Schools==\n[[Image:1 Trinity Grammar School.jpg|thumb|right|Trinity Grammar School]]\n[[Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales)|Trinity Grammar School]] in Prospect Road is a [[private school]] catering for students from PreK to Year 12.

Some local businesses have offered discounts and support for the rainbow, these display a logo with a stylised image of the rainbow crossing on it.\n\nAt an Ashfield Council meeting on 28 May 2013 the council passed a motion that a permanent outline of a rainbow be painted in Summer Hill Square, with the understanding that this may be periodically 'chalked in' by children, families and community members.\n\nThe Summer Hill Rainbow Crossing has a following on Twitter, [https://twitter.com/SummerHillXing @SummerHillXing], and on [https://www.facebook.com/SummerHillRainbowCrossing Facebook].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Trams in Sydney]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070314002840/http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/mrsid/lgamap/image_jpeg.pl?client=gnb&image=GNB3602.sid&lgamap=Ashfield&x=2400&y=2700&level=1&width=750&height=900 Image of Summer Hill's boundaries], from the [[Geographical Names Board of New South Wales]]\n* [http://www.summerhill-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/ Summer Hill Public School]\n* [http://www.trinity.nsw.edu.au/ Trinity Grammar School], located in Summer Hill\n* [http://acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=74110 Historic postcards of Summer Hill from the State Library of New South Wales]\n* [http://www.summerhillchurch.org.au/ St Andrew's Anglican Church]\n* [http://www.sydney.catholic.org.au/Parishes/pmtDetail.asp?ID=130 St Patricks Church]\n* [https://www.summerhillcommunitycentre.org.au/ Summer Hill Community Centre].\n* [http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/who/profiles/profiles/g/grayndler.htm Profile of the federal seat of Grayndler]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070307111205/http://www.summerhillvillage.net.au/ Summer Hill Village Business Association]\n* [http://www.id.com.au/dosydney/default.asp?pg=30&gid=5540 Demographics for Summer Hill from the Dictionary of Sydney]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Coord|-33.8915|151.1382|format=dms|type:city_region:AU-NSW|display=title}}\n{{Sydney Inner West Council}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1794]]\n[[Category:Suburbs of Sydney]]\n[[Category:1794 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Inner West]]\n[[Category:Hume Highway]]\n[[Category:Summer Hill, New South Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=August 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n<!-- BEGIN Suburb infobox (scroll down to edit main article text) -->\n{{Infobox Australian place \n| type = suburb\n| name     = Summer Hill\n| city     = Sydney\n| state    = nsw\n| image    = Summer_Hill_Post_Office1.jpg\n| caption  = The former Summer Hill Post Office, Smith Street, is heritage-listed<ref>[http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_04_2.cfm?itemid=1020190 State Heritage Website]</ref>\n| image2   ={{maplink\n|frame=yes\n|frame-width=260\n|frame-height=280\n|frame-align=center\n|zoom=13\n|type=shape\n|stroke-colour=#C60C30\n|stroke-width=3\n}}\n| pop      = 7,311 \n| pop_year = {{CensusAU|2016}}\n| pop_footnotes = <ref name=\"Census\">{{Census 2016 AUS|id=SSC13687|name=Summer Hill (State Suburb)|accessdate=26 July 2017|quick=on}}</ref>\n| postcode = 2130\n| area     = 1.1\n| dist1    = 7\n| dir1   = west\n| location1= [[Sydney CBD]]\n| lga      = [[Inner West Council]]\n| stategov = [[Electoral district of Summer Hill|Summer Hill]]\n| fedgov   = [[Division of Grayndler|Grayndler]]\n| near-n   = [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]]\n| near-ne  = [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]]\n| near-e   = [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]]\n| near-se  = [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]]\n| near-s   = [[Hurlstone Park, New South Wales|Hurlstone Park]]\n| near-sw  = [[Ashbury, New South Wales|Ashbury]]\n| near-w   = [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]]\n| near-nw  = [[Croydon, New South Wales|Croydon]]\n| est      = \n}}\n<!-- END suburb infobox -->\n{{mapbox raw data|data= {{Inner West Council suburb map|suburb=yes}} |text=Summer Hill within the Inner West Council area}} \n'''Summer Hill''' is a [[suburb]] of [[Sydney]], in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Summer Hill is located 7 kilometres west of the [[Sydney central business district]], in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[Inner West Council]].\n\nSummer Hill is a primarily residential [[List of Sydney suburbs|suburb]] of Sydney's [[Inner West]], adjoining two of Sydney's major arterial roads, [[Parramatta Road]] and [[Hume Highway|Liverpool Road]]. The first land grant was made in 1794 to former convict and [[jailor]] [[Henry Kable]], and the suburb began growing following the opening of the railway station on the [[Main Suburban railway line]], in 1879.\n\nBy the 1920s, the suburb had become relatively [[upper class]], with large estates and mansions built throughout the suburb. Some of these still exist today. Following a transition to a [[working class|working-class]] suburb in the mid-20th century, when many of the large estates were demolished or subdivided, the suburb today has a \"village\" character and a mix of medium-density apartment blocks and federation houses.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:Summer Hill Smith Street houses1.jpg|Unconventional homes in Smith Street, showing both Victorian and Federation influences|thumb]]\nSummer Hill's boundaries are Parramatta Road and Liverpool Road to the north, the rear of the properties on the west side of Prospect Road (with a detour around [[Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales)|Trinity Grammar School]]) to the West, Old Canterbury Road to the south, and the Inner West Light Rail to the east. North of Summer Hill is the suburb of [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]], to the east is [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]], to the south is [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]], and to the west is [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]].<ref name=\"boundary\">[http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/mrsid/lgamap/show_map.pl?client=gnb&image=GNB3602.sid&lgamap=Ashfield \"Summer Hill boundary map\"]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, [[Geographical Names Board of New South Wales]].

The land in the eastern corner of Summer Hill was an additional grant of {{convert|30|acre|ha|lk=on}} made to Henry Kable in 1804. This eastern corner would subsequently become part of the estate of James Underwood. Underwood died in 1844 and left a will so complicated that it required special legislation before it could be subdivided.<ref name=\"pratten\" />\n\nThe earliest known use of the name \"Summer Hill\" was in 1876, for a land subdivision adjacent to the present-day St Andrew's Anglican Church. The name Summer Hill is thought to be a name chosen by the land sub-divider, presumably based on an attachment for England. Local historians regard the suggestion that the name is a derivation of \"Sunning Hill\" as a dubious story which has no substance.<ref name=\"pratten\" />\n\nSummer Hill's largest mansion, ''Carleton'' (now the Grosvenor Hospital's main building), was built in the early 1880s on Liverpool Road for Charles Carleton Skarrat. The suburb boomed with the opening of the [[Summer Hill railway station|railway station]] in 1879, and was followed by subdivision of much of the surrounding area. Between 1880 and 1910, the area became an [[Upper class|upper-class]] suburb, and was a popular choice for professionals in banking and insurance who worked in the city.<ref name=\"pratten\" /> Subdivision of gardens for housing continued in the 1920s and 1930s, and socioeconomically the suburb changed as some of the wealthier inhabitants moved to the [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]].

Following Drynan's death, Kelvin Grove was owned or leased by a succession of different people, including the Haberfield [[Real estate|real-estate]] developer Richard Stanton, Croydon brick-maker William Downton, and two sisters named Freeman (one of whom was a nurse). In the 1920s and 1930s Kelvin Grove may have been used as a nursing home.

The foundation stone was laid in 1883, and the top of the spire completed in 1906. The fast construction period, unusual for that time, was indicative of the area's affluence.

Growing from 398 to 406 prisoners per 100,000 male adult population.<ref name=\"AusStats\" />\n\nAmong the imprisoned population of Australia, there is a vast overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, accounting for just over a quarter (27%) of the Australian prisoner population. This is despite only accounting for 2% of the Australian population. These incarceration rates regarding male Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals have increased by 22.4% between 2000 and 2010.<ref name=\"AusStats\" />\n\n==== Male Crime ====\n{{Main|Crime in Australia}}\nThe male population of Australia disproportionately commits violence at a much higher rate than the rest of the Australian population.\n\nA report released in Victoria by the Crime Statistics Agency reported that around 80% of all crime in Australia was committed by men.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crime Statistics Agency|date=2017|title=Alleged Offender Incidents|url=https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-crime-data/alleged-offender-incidents-3|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA number of scholars regard male supremacy as a driving force in over-representations of men within instances of violence and crime.

Untreated, the problem snowballs. The combination of that and the notion of having to deal with it alone, is the reason behind high suicide rates.\"<ref name=\"YoungMen\" />\n\n== Issues for Transgender and Non-Binary People ==\n\n=== Work Life and Economics ===\nThe economic life of the gender diverse community in Australia is distinctly inconsistent compared to other populations throughout Australia.\n\nIn study conducted by Beyond Blue into the mental health of transgender Australians, a number of participants identified difficulty in finding employment. This difficulty stemmed directly from their gender identity.<ref name=\"BeyondBlue\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.beyondblue.org.au/docs/default-source/research-project-files/bw0288_the-first-australian-national-trans-mental-health-study---summary-of-results.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title=The First Australian National Trans Mental Health Study: Summary of Results|last=Hyde|first=Z|date=2013}}</ref> Within the same study, contributors also reported instances of loss of employment following the decision to transition, or during their transition process.<ref name=\"BeyondBlue\" />\n\nApart from difficulty in finding and retaining employment, pay rates for gender diverse individuals differ from those of the greater Australian community. Dawn Hough, director of support program \u2018Pride in Diversity\u2019, puts forth that pay equity rates for transgender and intersex individuals may be even lower than others in the LGBTQI community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prideinclusionprograms.com.au/gay-pay-gap-the-impact-of-orientation-on-salary-earnings-growth/|title=Gay Pay Gap: The impact of orientation on salary & earnings growth|last=Hough|first=D|date=2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Societal Discrimination ===\nWithin Australian society, transgender and other gender diverse peoples have experienced dramatic occurrences of harassment and discrimination.\n\nThese examples of harassment and discrimination occur in a variety of ways. Purposely misgendering an individual who identifies as gender diverse is an act of discrimination with severe ramifications for the mental health of transgender peoples. Australia came a close second to the United States of America in stating that they would intentionally misgender a trans person as an act of disrespect.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.finchannel.com/society/71094-global-attitudes-toward-transgender-people|title=Global Attitudes Toward Transgender People|date=2018|website=The Financial}}</ref>\n\nConsidering these statistics, it is unsurprising that this same survey also found that only two in five cisgender individuals were willing to use correct pronouns when referring to transgender peoples.<ref name=\":4\" /> Even smaller, only one in five would use the gender neutral term \u2018they\u2019 when referring to non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nOther occurrences of discrimination include forms of verbal and physical abuse. In terms of verbal abuse, around two in three (66%) of trans and gender diverse people reported that they had experienced verbal abuse based solely on their gender identity (Smith et al., 2014). This harassment was most often expressed by strangers calling out to them on streets, yet also involved abuse delivered by immediate family members in close confines (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nMore than one in five (21%), transgender and gender diverse individuals also stated that they had experienced physical abuse (Smith et al., 2014). These occurrences most often occurred on the street, yet were also closely followed by instances of violence at school and on public transport (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the same study also revealed that 43% of trans and gender non-conforming individuals felt unsafe on public streets, with 32% also feeling unsafe on public transport (Smith et al., 2014).. It was also shown that transgender and gender diverse people actively avoided some public places for their own safety. These places were most often gendered spaces, including bathrooms and public change rooms (Smith et al., 2014).\n\n=== Mental Health ===\nTransgender and gender diverse individuals have been proven to have dramatically reduced mental health outcomes than the greater Australian population.\n\nTrans individuals have been identified as a high-risk group for suicide, with one in five respondents reporting they had thoughts of suicidal ideation or self-harm in at least half the days of the previous fortnight. Within the same survey, over half (57.2%) of respondents reported they had been diagnosed with depression, with younger individuals more likely to report poorer mental health than older respondents (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nAuthors of the study also identified trans women as being over five times more likely to commit suicide than the general population, whilst trans men were more than double (Smith et al., 2014). Authors of the study could not pinpoint the exact reasoning for this discrepancy in mental health outcomes even among trans individuals. However, those analysing this data reported that this might be due to trans women having fewer sources of support, as they more often live alone (Smith et al., 2014).. Authors also noted that trans women might find it more difficult to transition within society, due to the powerful effects of testosterone on bone structure (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nIn regards to factors affecting a positive effect on their mental health, transgender and gender diverse peoples reported that feeling acknowledged and supported in their gender identity along with feeling free to express their identity as they wish had positive repercussions on their mental health outcomes (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nFactors that had distinct negative impacts on mental health included, obviously, discrimination and harassment (Smith et al., 2014). Other negative impacts included dysmorphia, due to being unable to \u2018medically\u2019 transition. This is often a result of excessive medical costs. Feeling unaccepted by friends and family, along with the general public also had distinct negative impacts on mental health outcomes (Smith et al., 2014).\n\n=== Health Disparities ===\nThere are clear disparities in the mental health outcomes for that of the trans and gender diverse populations. However, disparities also arise in the provision of health services, along with experiences of general health outcomes\n\nThere is a distinct underutilisation of a number of medical and clinical health services among transgender and gender diverse individuals. A small Western Australian study conducted in 2006 with 50 transgender and gender diverse adults reported significant underutilisation of cervical pap smears and mammograms (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Health and Wellbeing Ministerial Advisory Committee, 2014).\n\nIt was also discovered that whilst often utilising the services of general practitioners, trans and gender diverse individuals had experienced a breadth of harassment and discrimination when accessing these health services (Riggs & Due, 2013). Feelings of having to educate practitioners on their own gender identify especially led to participants feeling less respected (Riggs & Due, 2013).\n\n=== Issues in Transgender and Non-binary the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population ===\nWestern terminology is often inadequate in discussions regarding the gender identity of Indigenous communities. In an Australian context, the terminology of \u2018sistergirls\u2019 and \u2018brotherboys\u2019 is used to describe gender diverse Indigenous Australians (Toone 2015). It has been proven that these aspects of Indigenous identity existed long before western colonialism (Toone 2015).\nThe organisation Sisters and Brothers NT also state that, \u201cThere is documented evidence and oral history of Sistergirl identity in some communities pre-dating colonisation. A number of historic and contemporary words exist to describe Sistergirls including \u201cKwarte Kwarte\u201d in Arrente, \u201cKungka Kungka\u201d in Pitjantjatjara and Luritja, \u201cYimpininni\u201d in Tiwi, \u201cKarnta Pia\u201d in Warlpiri which can be interpreted as \u201clike a girl\u201d. Whilst \u201cKungka Wati\u201d in Pintipi and \u201cGirriji Kati\u201d in Waramungu literally mean \u201cwoman/man.\u201d (Toone 2015)\n\nDue to this intersection as members of the LGBTQI community and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the discrimination experienced by these individuals is at an extremely significant level, even when compared to the harassment experienced by other members of the transgender and gender diverse community (Kerry, 2015). These additional experiences of racism, even encountered within the LGBTQI community, along with facing transphobia within their traditional communities have led to distinct experiences of oppression unique to this community (Kerry, 2015).\n\n=== References ===\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sda1984209/ Sex Discrimination Act 1984]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002021210/https://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Humanrightsandanti-discrimination_Sexdiscrimination Australian Government overview of Sex discrimination]\n* [http://www.wgea.gov.au/ Workplace Gender Equality Agency]\n\n{{Australia topics}}\n{{Oceania topic|prefix=Gender inequality in|state=expanded|countries_only=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gender Inequality In Australia}}\n[[Category:Australian culture]]\n[[Category:Australian society]]\n[[Category:Gender inequality by country|Australia]]\n[[Category:Sexism in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "[[Gender inequality]] can be defined as the unequal treatment of individuals based on their gender.<ref name=\"MakeTheLink\">{{Cite web|url=https://makethelink.org.au/make-the-link/gender-equality/|title=What is Gender Equality?|last=Make the Link|date=2018}}</ref> Individuals can be marginalised and discriminated from society and be restricted to participate in society due to their gender.<ref name=\"MakeTheLink\" /> In [[Australia]], gender inequality denotes the inconsistencies between individuals due to gender.

These incarceration rates regarding male Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals have increased by 22.4% between 2000 and 2010.<ref name=\"AusStats\" />\n\n==== Male Crime ====\n{{Main|Crime in Australia}}\nThe male population of Australia disproportionately commits violence at a much higher rate than the rest of the Australian population.\n\nA report released in Victoria by the Crime Statistics Agency reported that around 80% of all crime in Australia was committed by men.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crime Statistics Agency|date=2017|title=Alleged Offender Incidents|url=https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-crime-data/alleged-offender-incidents-3|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA number of scholars regard male supremacy as a driving force in over-representations of men within instances of violence and crime.

Untreated, the problem snowballs. The combination of that and the notion of having to deal with it alone, is the reason behind high suicide rates.\"<ref name=\"YoungMen\" />\n\n== Issues for Transgender and Non-Binary People ==\n\n=== Work Life and Economics ===\nThe economic life of the gender diverse community in Australia is distinctly inconsistent compared to other populations throughout Australia.\n\nIn study conducted by Beyond Blue into the mental health of transgender Australians, a number of participants identified difficulty in finding employment. This difficulty stemmed directly from their gender identity.<ref name=\"BeyondBlue\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.beyondblue.org.au/docs/default-source/research-project-files/bw0288_the-first-australian-national-trans-mental-health-study---summary-of-results.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title=The First Australian National Trans Mental Health Study: Summary of Results|last=Hyde|first=Z|date=2013}}</ref> Within the same study, contributors also reported instances of loss of employment following the decision to transition, or during their transition process.<ref name=\"BeyondBlue\" />\n\nApart from difficulty in finding and retaining employment, pay rates for gender diverse individuals differ from those of the greater Australian community. Dawn Hough, director of support program \u2018Pride in Diversity\u2019, puts forth that pay equity rates for transgender and intersex individuals may be even lower than others in the LGBTQI community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prideinclusionprograms.com.au/gay-pay-gap-the-impact-of-orientation-on-salary-earnings-growth/|title=Gay Pay Gap: The impact of orientation on salary & earnings growth|last=Hough|first=D|date=2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Societal Discrimination ===\nWithin Australian society, transgender and other gender diverse peoples have experienced dramatic occurrences of harassment and discrimination.\n\nThese examples of harassment and discrimination occur in a variety of ways. Purposely misgendering an individual who identifies as gender diverse is an act of discrimination with severe ramifications for the mental health of transgender peoples. Australia came a close second to the United States of America in stating that they would intentionally misgender a trans person as an act of disrespect.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.finchannel.com/society/71094-global-attitudes-toward-transgender-people|title=Global Attitudes Toward Transgender People|date=2018|website=The Financial}}</ref>\n\nConsidering these statistics, it is unsurprising that this same survey also found that only two in five cisgender individuals were willing to use correct pronouns when referring to transgender peoples.<ref name=\":4\" /> Even smaller, only one in five would use the gender neutral term \u2018they\u2019 when referring to non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nOther occurrences of discrimination include forms of verbal and physical abuse. In terms of verbal abuse, around two in three (66%) of trans and gender diverse people reported that they had experienced verbal abuse based solely on their gender identity (Smith et al., 2014). This harassment was most often expressed by strangers calling out to them on streets, yet also involved abuse delivered by immediate family members in close confines (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nMore than one in five (21%), transgender and gender diverse individuals also stated that they had experienced physical abuse (Smith et al., 2014). These occurrences most often occurred on the street, yet were also closely followed by instances of violence at school and on public transport (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the same study also revealed that 43% of trans and gender non-conforming individuals felt unsafe on public streets, with 32% also feeling unsafe on public transport (Smith et al., 2014).. It was also shown that transgender and gender diverse people actively avoided some public places for their own safety. These places were most often gendered spaces, including bathrooms and public change rooms (Smith et al., 2014).\n\n=== Mental Health ===\nTransgender and gender diverse individuals have been proven to have dramatically reduced mental health outcomes than the greater Australian population.\n\nTrans individuals have been identified as a high-risk group for suicide, with one in five respondents reporting they had thoughts of suicidal ideation or self-harm in at least half the days of the previous fortnight. Within the same survey, over half (57.2%) of respondents reported they had been diagnosed with depression, with younger individuals more likely to report poorer mental health than older respondents (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nAuthors of the study also identified trans women as being over five times more likely to commit suicide than the general population, whilst trans men were more than double (Smith et al., 2014). Authors of the study could not pinpoint the exact reasoning for this discrepancy in mental health outcomes even among trans individuals. However, those analysing this data reported that this might be due to trans women having fewer sources of support, as they more often live alone (Smith et al., 2014).. Authors also noted that trans women might find it more difficult to transition within society, due to the powerful effects of testosterone on bone structure (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nIn regards to factors affecting a positive effect on their mental health, transgender and gender diverse peoples reported that feeling acknowledged and supported in their gender identity along with feeling free to express their identity as they wish had positive repercussions on their mental health outcomes (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nFactors that had distinct negative impacts on mental health included, obviously, discrimination and harassment (Smith et al., 2014). Other negative impacts included dysmorphia, due to being unable to \u2018medically\u2019 transition. This is often a result of excessive medical costs. Feeling unaccepted by friends and family, along with the general public also had distinct negative impacts on mental health outcomes (Smith et al., 2014).\n\n=== Health Disparities ===\nThere are clear disparities in the mental health outcomes for that of the trans and gender diverse populations. However, disparities also arise in the provision of health services, along with experiences of general health outcomes\n\nThere is a distinct underutilisation of a number of medical and clinical health services among transgender and gender diverse individuals. A small Western Australian study conducted in 2006 with 50 transgender and gender diverse adults reported significant underutilisation of cervical pap smears and mammograms (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Health and Wellbeing Ministerial Advisory Committee, 2014).\n\nIt was also discovered that whilst often utilising the services of general practitioners, trans and gender diverse individuals had experienced a breadth of harassment and discrimination when accessing these health services (Riggs & Due, 2013). Feelings of having to educate practitioners on their own gender identify especially led to participants feeling less respected (Riggs & Due, 2013).\n\n=== Issues in Transgender and Non-binary the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population ===\nWestern terminology is often inadequate in discussions regarding the gender identity of Indigenous communities. In an Australian context, the terminology of \u2018sistergirls\u2019 and \u2018brotherboys\u2019 is used to describe gender diverse Indigenous Australians (Toone 2015). It has been proven that these aspects of Indigenous identity existed long before western colonialism (Toone 2015).\nThe organisation Sisters and Brothers NT also state that, \u201cThere is documented evidence and oral history of Sistergirl identity in some communities pre-dating colonisation. A number of historic and contemporary words exist to describe Sistergirls including \u201cKwarte Kwarte\u201d in Arrente, \u201cKungka Kungka\u201d in Pitjantjatjara and Luritja, \u201cYimpininni\u201d in Tiwi, \u201cKarnta Pia\u201d in Warlpiri which can be interpreted as \u201clike a girl\u201d. Whilst \u201cKungka Wati\u201d in Pintipi and \u201cGirriji Kati\u201d in Waramungu literally mean \u201cwoman/man.\u201d (Toone 2015)\n\nDue to this intersection as members of the LGBTQI community and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the discrimination experienced by these individuals is at an extremely significant level, even when compared to the harassment experienced by other members of the transgender and gender diverse community (Kerry, 2015). These additional experiences of racism, even encountered within the LGBTQI community, along with facing transphobia within their traditional communities have led to distinct experiences of oppression unique to this community (Kerry, 2015).\n\n=== References ===\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sda1984209/ Sex Discrimination Act 1984]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002021210/https://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Humanrightsandanti-discrimination_Sexdiscrimination Australian Government overview of Sex discrimination]\n* [http://www.wgea.gov.au/ Workplace Gender Equality Agency]\n\n{{Australia topics}}\n{{Oceania topic|prefix=Gender inequality in|state=expanded|countries_only=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gender Inequality In Australia}}\n[[Category:Australian culture]]\n[[Category:Australian society]]\n[[Category:Gender inequality by country|Australia]]\n[[Category:Sexism in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "60.227.32.164", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality_in_Australia"}

They compete in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a member of the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. The team was founded during the [[1967 NHL expansion]] as the [[Minnesota North Stars]], based in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. Before the beginning of the [[1978\u201379 NHL season]], the team merged with the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] after the league granted them permission due to each team's respective financial struggles. Ultimately, the franchise relocated to Dallas for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season]]. The Stars played out of [[Reunion Arena]] from their relocation until 2001, when the team moved less than 1.5 miles into the [[American Airlines Center]].\n\nThe Stars have won eight division titles in Dallas, two [[Presidents' Trophy|Presidents' Trophies]] as the top regular season team in the league, the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] championship twice, and in [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], the [[Stanley Cup]]. [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the most valuable player of the playoffs that year.\n\nIn 2000, [[Neal Broten]] was inducted into the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]]. In 2009, [[Brett Hull]] became the first Dallas Stars player inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], followed by [[Ed Belfour]] and Joe Nieuwendyk in 2011 and [[Mike Modano]] in 2014. In 2010, brothers [[Derian Hatcher|Derian]] and [[Kevin Hatcher]] were inducted to the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Minnesota North Stars (1967\u20131993)===\n{{Main|Minnesota North Stars}}\nThe Minnesota North Stars began play in [[1967\u201368 NHL season|1967]] as part of the league's [[1967 NHL Expansion|six-team expansion]]. Home games were played at the newly constructed Metropolitan Sports Center (\"[[Met Center]]\") in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. Initially successful both on the ice and at the gate, the North Stars fell victim to financial problems after several poor seasons in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Minnesota North Stars Logo 1991-1993.svg|thumb|left|The logo of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] from 1991 to 1993. When the team moved to Dallas in 1993, it used a similar logo, usually with the word \"DALLAS\" above \"STARS,\" until 2013.]]\nIn [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1978]], the North Stars merged with the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] (formerly the [[California Golden Seals]]), owned by [[George Gund III|George III]] and [[Gordon Gund]]. With both teams on the verge of folding, the league permitted the two failing franchises to merge. The merged team continued as the Minnesota North Stars, while the Seals/Barons franchise records were retired. However, the Gunds were the merged team's principal owners, and the North Stars assumed the Barons' place in the [[Adams Division]] in order to balance out the divisions. The merger brought with it a number of talented players, and the North Stars were revived\u2014they reached the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals in [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1981]], where they lost in five games to the [[New York Islanders]]. However, by the early 1990s, declining attendance and the inability to secure a new downtown revenue-generating arena led ownership to request permission to move the team to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1990. The league rejected the request and instead agreed to award an [[expansion team|expansion franchise]], the [[San Jose Sharks]], to the Gund brothers. The North Stars were sold to a group of investors that were originally looking to place a team in San Jose, although one of the group's members, former [[Calgary Flames]] part-owner [[Norman Green]], would eventually gain control of the team.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cameron|first=Steve|title=Feeding Frenzy! The Wild New World of the San Jose Sharks|pages=29\u201338|year=1994|publisher=Taylor Publishing Co.}}</ref> In the following season, the North Stars made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, only to lose to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].\n\nAfter the 1990\u201391 season, the North Stars suffered through poor attendance and declining profits. The team's fortunes were further impeded by the terms of the settlement with the Gund brothers, in which they were permitted to take a number of North Stars players to San Jose. Green explored the possibility of moving the team to [[Anaheim]], however the league decided instead to place the expansion [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks]] there in 1993\u201394. In their final two seasons in Minnesota, the team adopted a new logo which omitted the \"North\" from \"North Stars\", leading many fans to anticipate the team heading south.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2010/January/The_35_Biggest_Moments_in_Modern_Dallas_History_11.aspx |title=The 35 Biggest Moments in Modern Dallas History |publisher=Dmagazine.com |accessdate=2011-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520003803/http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2010/January/The_35_Biggest_Moments_in_Modern_Dallas_History_11.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Relocation and early years in Dallas (1993\u20131998)===\n[[File:Reunion Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Reunion Arena]] was the first home for the Stars in Dallas. The arena was the Stars\u2019 home from 1993 to 2001.]]\nIn 1993, amid further attendance woes and bitter personal controversy, Green obtained permission from the league to move the team to Dallas, for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]], with the decision announced on March 10, 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/patrick-plus-thanks-norm-green/265064341/|title=Patrick Plus: Thanks, Norm Green|website=Star Tribune|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref> Green was convinced by former [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] that Dallas would be a suitable market for an NHL team.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\"/> He decided to retain the \"Stars\" nickname, as it matched Texas' official nickname as \"The Lone Star State.\" The Stars would move into [[Reunion Arena]], built in 1980, the downtown arena already occupied by the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Dallas Mavericks]].\n\nTo quell the ensuing controversy, the NHL promised that the Twin Cities would receive an expansion franchise in the future; that promise was fulfilled in 2000 in the form of the [[Minnesota Wild]].\n\nWith the league changing the names of the conferences and divisions that season, the newly relocated Stars were placed in the Central Division of the Western Conference, and played their first game in Dallas on October 5, 1993, a 6\u20134 win against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>[https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL/1994_games.html 1993-94 Dallas Stars Schedule and Results]. hockey-reference.com</ref> In that game, [[Neal Broten]] scored the first Stars goal in Dallas. Dallas was an experiment for the league. At that time, the Stars would be one of the three southern-most teams in the league, along with the newly-created [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and [[Florida Panthers]], as the league's first real ventures into southern non-traditional hockey markets. Though the Stars were relatively still unknown in the area, word of the team spread rapidly, and the immediate success of the team on the ice, as well as [[Mike Modano]]'s career best season (50 goals, 93 points) helped spur the team's popularity in Dallas. The Stars set franchise bests in wins (42) and points (97) in their first season in Texas, qualifying for the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs|1994 playoffs]]. The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the [[St. Louis Blues]] in the first round, but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion [[Vancouver Canucks]] in the second round. The Stars' success in their first season, along with Modano's spectacular on ice performances, would be an integral part of the Stars' eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come.\n\nThe almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by the long legacy of minor-league hockey in the area. Both incarnations of the [[Central Hockey League]] had two teams in the area, the [[Fort Worth Texans]] and the [[Dallas Blackhawks]] for years before the Stars' arrival. These two teams were bitter rivals, and some of the traditions and famous rivalry incidents, including what is thought to be the first known use anywhere at an athletic event of \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Fort Worth and the famous \"10 Cent Beer Night\" near riot in 1978 helped create awareness of hockey. Amateur and youth hockey was also extremely popular because of the long presence of the minor league teams.\n\nGreen, who had run into financial problems stemming from his business ventures outside of hockey, was forced to sell the team to businessman [[Tom Hicks]] in December 1995.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\"/>\n\n====Building for a championship====\nThe 1994\u201395 season was shortened by an [[1994\u201395 NHL lockout|owners' lockout]]. The Stars traded captain [[Mark Tinordi]] along with [[Rick Mrozik]] to the [[Washington Capitals]] before the season began for [[Kevin Hatcher]]. Longtime North Stars hold-over [[Neal Broten]] was named his replacement, although he was traded too after only 17 games to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. Broten was replaced by Kevin's younger brother [[Derian Hatcher]] as team captain, a role he would serve in for the next decade. The Stars played only 48 games that season posting a record of 17\u201323\u20138. Despite the shortened season and the losing record, the Stars again made the playoffs, losing in five games to the Red Wings in the first round.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL/ |title=Dallas Stars Franchise Index |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Sergei Zubov.jpg|thumb|left|The Stars made several moves to revamp the roster in the 1996 off-season, notably making a trade to acquire [[Sergei Zubov]]. He remained on the team until he left the league in 2009.]] \nThe [[1995\u201396 NHL season|1995\u201396 season]] would be the first full season under new owner Tom Hicks. In the off-season, the Stars traded for former [[Montreal Canadiens]]' captain and three-time [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] winner [[Guy Carbonneau]], who was then with the St. Louis Blues. With the Stars struggling to begin the season, general manager and head coach [[Bob Gainey]] traded for center [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] from the [[Calgary Flames]] in exchange for [[Corey Millen]] and [[Jarome Iginla]], then a Stars prospect. The Stars recorded only 11 wins in the first half of the season, and Bob Gainey relinquished his coaching duties in January to be the full-time general manager of the team. The Stars soon hired [[Michigan K-Wings]] head coach [[Ken Hitchcock]] to replace him; it would be his first NHL head coaching position. The Stars then traded for [[Beno\u00eet Hogue|Benoit Hogue]] from the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] late in the season, but ultimately finished in sixth place in the Central Division, missing the playoffs for the first time since moving to Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL |title=Dallas Stars Franchise Index |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 off-season, the Stars continued to revamp their roster, adding defensemen [[Darryl Sydor]] from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] followed by [[Sergei Zubov]] from the Pittsburgh Penguins for Kevin Hatcher. Zubov would serve as the Stars' top defenseman and powerplay quarterback until leaving the league in 2009. On the ice, Ken Hitchcock's first season proved to be a good one. The Stars bested their 1994 totals, posting 48 wins and reaching the 100-point mark for the first time in franchise history. The Stars won the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]], their first division title since 1983\u201384 (when they were still the Minnesota North Stars) and were seeded second in the [[1997 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1997.html |title=1996\u201397 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Despite the regular season success, the youthful Stars were upset in the first round by the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in seven games. Defenseman [[Grant Ledyard]] tripped in overtime of Game 7, allowing [[Todd Marchant]] to score the game- and series-winning goal on a breakaway against goaltender [[Andy Moog]].\n\nIn the 1997 off-season, the Stars signed star goaltender [[Ed Belfour]] as a free agent after a well publicized falling-out with the San Jose Sharks, which had traded a number of players to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] to obtain him in January in the previous season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeygoalies.org/bio/belfour.html |title=Ed Belfour |publisher=Hockeygoalies.org |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Andy Moog was allowed to leave via free agency, but later returned to the Stars as an assistant coach. The [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]] was another banner year for the Stars. The Stars again set franchise records in wins (49) and points (109). Dallas acquired [[Mike Keane]] at the deadline from the [[New York Rangers]]. The Stars won the franchise's first [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the league's best regular season team, as well as the Central Division title for the second season in a row. Belfour set franchise season records for [[goals against average]] (1.88), wins (37) and just missed out on the [[Jennings Trophy]] by one goal to [[Martin Brodeur]] of the [[New Jersey Devils]]. The Stars were the first overall seed for the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]] and defeated the eighth-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round. Notorious enforcer [[Bryan Marchment]] injured Joe Nieuwendyk's right knee, forcing him to miss the rest of the playoffs with torn ligaments. In the second round, they again met the Edmonton Oilers, this time defeating them in five games. However, without Nieuwendyk, the Stars lacked the firepower to overcome the defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals and lost in six games. The Red Wings went on to win their second consecutive Stanley Cup.\n\n===Dominance, a Stanley Cup, and playoff disappointment (1998\u20132004)===\n{{See also|1999 Stanley Cup Finals}}\nIn the 1998 off-season, after falling just short in the Western Conference Finals, the Stars added what they believed was the final piece toward winning a championship: star goalscoring winger [[Brett Hull]]. Hull had already had a magnificent career with the St. Louis Blues, with three consecutive 70-goal seasons and a [[Hart Memorial Trophy]], but a fallout with Blues management led Hull to leave St. Louis via free agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stlouisblueslegends.blogspot.com/2007/01/brett-hull.html |title=St. Louis Blues Legends: Brett Hull |publisher=Stlouisblueslegends.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Additionally, this was the first season for the Stars in the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]] after the 1998 NHL division re-alignment.\n\nThe Stars 1998\u201399 season was excellent. The Stars won 51 games, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also recorded 114 points, which still stands today as a franchise record. They won the Pacific Division by 24 points, their third consecutive division title; a second consecutive Presidents' Trophy; the Jennings Trophy as the league's top defensive team; and were awarded the top seed in the [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999 playoffs]]. Winger [[Jere Lehtinen]] was also awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1999.html |title=1998\u201399 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Joe Nieuwendyk Dallas.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Nieuwendyk]] helped the Stars win their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1999. Nieuwendyk was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] for that year's playoffs.]]\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Dallas faced their playoff arch-rivals, the Edmonton Oilers. The Stars swept the Oilers in four tough games, winning Game 4 in the third overtime on a goal by Joe Nieuwendyk. They then faced the St. Louis Blues in the second round. After taking a 2\u20130 series lead, the Blues stormed back to tie the series. The Stars then won the next two games to beat the Blues in six games. The series again ended on an overtime goal, this time from Mike Modano. In the Conference Finals, they faced the [[Colorado Avalanche]] for the first time in Stars history. This would be the first of four playoff meetings between the Stars and Avalanche in the next seven years. After both the Stars and the Avalanche split the first four games at a 2\u20132 series tie, the Avalanche won Game 5 by a score of 7\u20135, taking a 3\u20132 series lead, The Stars rallied winning game six on the road, and Game 7 at home, both by 4\u20131 scorelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/NHL_1999.html |title=1999 NHL Playoffs Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Stars' first [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] appearance as the Dallas Stars, although they made the finals twice as the Minnesota North Stars. They faced the Eastern Conference champion [[Buffalo Sabres]], who had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4\u20131 in the Eastern Conference Finals. After splitting the first four games, the Stars vaunted defense would hold the Sabres to only one goal in the next two, winning Game 5 2\u20130 and Game 6 2\u20131 on an overtime goal by Brett Hull. Hull's goal at 14:51 of the third overtime was remembered as one of the most controversial goals ever scored. That season, the league still had the infamous \"crease rule\" in effect, which provided that if any player of the attacking team who did not have possession of the puck was in the crease before the puck, then any resulting goal was disallowed. Hull had initially gained possession of the puck outside the crease and had made a shot that was blocked by Buffalo goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]]. One of Hull's skates entered the crease as he corralled the rebound, and Hull's second shot scored the Cup-winning goal, followed by a lengthy official review. The goal was eventually allowed, as having simply blocked Hull's shot rather than catching it, Hasek never took possession of the puck away from Hull. Officials therefore determined that rather than calling it a loose puck, Hull would be considered to have had continuous possession of the puck from before his first shot outside the crease. The complexity of the crease rule, and the attendant difficulties in understanding its application by fans and players alike, combined with the controversy arising out of the disputed Stanley Cup-winning goal, resulted in the crease rule being repealed the following season. Hull's goal marked the 13th time a Stanley Cup-winning goal was scored in overtime, and only the fourth to be scored in multiple overtimes. This was the only time between [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]] and [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]] that a team other than the New Jersey Devils, Colorado Avalanche or Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe team added veterans [[Kirk Muller]], [[Dave Manson]] and [[Sylvain C\u00f4t\u00e9|Sylvain Cote]] in an effort to defend their Stanley Cup championship in {{NHL Year|1999}}. On December 31, 1999, Brett Hull scored his 600 and 601st career goals in a 5\u20134 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Stars ultimately won the Pacific Division for the second year in a row, and were seeded second in the Western Conference. Dallas then defeated the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks in the first and second rounds, both 4\u20131 series victories. The Stars, for the second season in a row, defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals in seven games to reach their second consecutive Stanley Cup Finals, where they met the New Jersey Devils. Because the Devils finished the regular season with one more point than Dallas, the Stars had to play their first playoff series without home ice advantage since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2000.html |title=1999-00 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The Stars lost all three games at the Reunion Arena in the Finals, and lost the series in Game 6 on a double-overtime goal by New Jersey forward [[Jason Arnott]].\n\n====Unsuccessful playoff runs====\nHoping to win back the Stanley Cup, the Stars again captured the Pacific Division, posting a solid 48\u201324\u20138\u20132 record in the [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301 season]]. In the playoffs, the Stars met the Edmonton Oilers in the first round, battling back-and-forth through the first four games, with each game decided by one goal, including three going into overtime. Game 5 would also go to overtime, as the Stars took a 3\u20132 series lead on a goal by Kirk Muller. However, in Game 6 in [[Edmonton]], the Stars did not need overtime, advancing to the second round with a 3\u20131 win. Facing the St. Louis Blues, the Stars would run out of gas, being swept in four straight games. The Game 2 loss would be the last NHL game played in Reunion Arena.\n[[File:MartyTurco.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marty Turco]] was awarded the starting goaltender position in the 2001\u201302 season, with the departure of [[Ed Belfour]] to free agency.]]\nMoving into the brand new [[American Airlines Center]] for the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]], the Stars got off to a slow start to the season, as goaltender Ed Belfour struggled through one of his worst seasons. Head coach Ken Hitchcock was eventually fired, being replaced by [[Rick Wilson (ice hockey)|Rick Wilson]]. Despite the coaching change, the Stars continued to play poor hockey. With the prospect of missing the playoffs, the Stars traded 1999 Conn Smythe winner Joe Nieuwendyk and [[Jamie Langenbrunner]] to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for [[Randy McKay]] and Jason Arnott, who scored the game-winning goal in the 2000 Finals against Dallas. The Stars would eventually go on to post a respectable record of 35\u201328\u201313\u20135. However, it would not be enough for the playoffs, as they fell four points short of the final eighth spot in the Western Conference. Following the season, coach Rick Wilson would return to assistant coaching duties, as the Stars brought in [[Dave Tippett]] as his replacement.\n\nAs in the 2002 off-season, Ed Belfour left via free agency to the Toronto Maple Leafs. To begin the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]], the Stars awarded the starting goaltending position to [[Marty Turco]], who went on to have one of the best seasons in NHL history, posting the lowest goals against average (GAA) since 1940, at 1.76. However, missing 18 games late in the season likely cost him a shot at the [[Vezina Trophy]], awarded to the leagues's top regular season goaltender. Regardless, the Stars posted the best record in the Western Conference at 46\u201317\u201315\u20134, and along the way, two-way star Jere Lehtinen won his third Frank J. Selke Trophy. In the [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], the Stars once again met the Edmonton Oilers, and once again the Oilers would prove a contentious opponent, winning two of the first three games. However, the Stars would prove the better team again by winning the next three games to take the series in six games. The Stars' second round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim got off to an unbelievable start, as the game went deep into overtime tied 3\u20133. However, Mighty Ducks goaltender [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] stopped 60 shots as the Ducks scored early in the fifth overtime. Game 2 would be more of the same, as the Ducks stunned the Stars in overtime. Desperately needing a win, the Stars bounced back to take Game 3 in Anaheim. However, the Ducks would take a 3\u20131 series lead by breaking a scoreless tie late in the third period of Game 4. In Game 5, the Stars finally solved Giguere by scoring four goals to keep their playoff hopes alive. However, the Stars dreams of a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals would end in heartbreaking fashionm as the Ducks broke a 3\u20133 tie with 1:06 left in Game 6 on a goal by defenseman [[Sandis Ozoli\u0146\u0161|Sandis Ozolinsh]].\n\nComing off their disappointing playoff loss, the Stars would get off to a shaky start to the [[2003\u201304 NHL Season|2003\u201304 season]], as they played mediocre hockey through the first three months of the season, posting a sub-.500 record. However, as the calendar turned to 2004, the Stars began to find their game, as they posted a 9\u20134\u20133 record in January. As the season wore on, the Stars would get stronger, climbing up the playoff ladder and eventually reaching second place in the Pacific Division, where they finished with a solid 41\u201326\u201313\u20132 record; Marty Turco had another outstanding season, recording a 1.98 GAA. However, the Stars could not carry their momentum into the playoffs, as they were beaten by the Colorado Avalanche in five games in the first round.\n\n===Post-lockout era (2005\u20132008)===\nComing out of the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|owners' lockout]] that cancelled the entire [[2004\u201305 NHL season|2004\u201305 season]], the Stars remained one of the strongest teams in the Western Conference for the start of [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]], as they won four of their first five games on the way to a solid October. November would be even better for Dallas, as they won 10 of 13 games and took over first place in the Pacific Division, a position they would hold most of the season, as they went on to finish with a terrific record of 53\u201323\u20136. One reason for the Stars success was their strong play in shootouts, as forward [[Jussi Jokinen]] was nearly automatic, making 10-of-13 shot attempts. Also performing strong in shootouts was Sergei Zubov, who used a slow-but-steady backhand to go 7-for-12, as the Stars ultimately won 12 of 13 games that were settled by a shootout. As the number two seed in the Western Conference, the Stars faced the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. The Stars were favorited to win the Western Conference, and some even predicted them to win the Stanley Cup. However, the Stars would stumble right from the start, losing Game 1 by a score of 5\u20132 as the Avalanche scored five unanswered goals after the Stars jumped out to a promising 2\u20130 lead. Game 2 would see the Stars suffer another setback at home, as the Stars lost in overtime 5\u20134 on a goal by [[Joe Sakic]]. On the road in Game 3, the Stars led 3\u20132 in the final minute before the Avalanche forced overtime on a goal by [[Andrew Brunette]], while [[Alex Tanguay]] won the game just 69 seconds into overtime to put the Stars in a 3\u20130 hole. The Stars would avoid the sweep with 4\u20131 win in Game 4, but overtime would doom them again in Game 5, as Andrew Brunette scored the series winner at 6:05, ending the Stars' playoffs hopes after just five games.\n\n====Dallas hosts the All-Star Game (2006\u20132007 season)====\nFollowing the previous season's disappointing first round playoff upset at the hands of the seventh-seeded Avalanche, the Stars made a number of changes during the 2006 off-season. Former Stars goalkeeper Andy Moog was promoted to assistant general manager for player development (he kept his job as goaltending coach) and former player [[Ulf Dahl\u00e9n|Ulf Dahlen]] was hired as an assistant coach. The Stars allowed center Jason Arnott, defenseman [[Willie Mitchell (ice hockey)|Willie Mitchell]] and goaltender [[Johan Hedberg]] to leave as [[free agents]]. Forward [[Niko Kapanen]] was traded to the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] and the remaining two years on fan-favorite [[winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] [[Bill Guerin]]'s contract were bought out. The Stars also received [[Patrik \u0160tefan|Patrik Stefan]] and [[Jaroslav Modr\u00fd|Jaroslav Modry]] in the Atlanta trade, and signed [[Eric Lindros]], [[Jeff Halpern]], [[Matthew Barnaby]] and [[Darryl Sydor]] as free agents. Young goaltender [[Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1982)|Mike Smith]] was promoted to the NHL to serve as Marty Turco's backup. During the season, key future pieces \u2013 center [[Mike Ribeiro]] and defenseman [[Mattias Norstr\u00f6m|Mattias Norstrom]] \u2013 were added through separate trades. Young players [[Joel Lundqvist]], [[Krys Barch]], [[Nicklas Grossmann]] and [[Chris Conner]] all saw significant ice time while other players were out of the lineup with injuries.\n[[File:Modano Record Goal.jpg|thumb|[[Mike Modano]] scoring his 500th goal on November 7, 2007 against the [[San Jose Sharks]].

Defenseman [[Philippe Boucher]] and goaltender Marty Turco would represent the Stars as part of the Western Conference All-Star roster. The Stars qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and squared off against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. Marty Turco delivered three shutout wins in Games 2, 5 and 6, but the Stars' offense failed to capitalize and they lost the series in seven games, the third season in a row that they lost in the first round.\n\n====Return to playoff prominence (2007\u20132008 season)====\nIn the [[2007 NHL Entry Draft]], the Stars drafted the relatively unknown [[Jamie Benn]] 129th overall. After starting a lackluster 7\u20137\u20133 in the [[2007\u201308 Dallas Stars season|2007\u201308 season]], general manager [[Doug Armstrong]] was fired by the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3108257 |title=Armstrong fired after 7\u20137\u20133 start; Hull, Jackson named interim GMs \u2013 NHL|publisher=ESPN |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> He was replaced by an unusual \"co-general manager\" arrangement of former assistant GM [[Les Jackson (ice hockey)|Les Jackson]] and former Stars player Brett Hull.

Off-season free agent acquisition [[Sean Avery]] caused a media uproar over comments he made to a Canadian reporter about ex-girlfriend [[Elisha Cuthbert]] and her relationship with [[Calgary Flames]]' defenseman [[Dion Phaneuf]] before a game in [[Calgary]]. The incident forced the team to suspend Avery for the season; he was later waived by the Stars. That incident, plus injuries to key players Brad Richards and Sergei Zubov, caused the Stars to tailspin to a 12th-place finish and the first missed playoffs for Dallas since 2002.\n\nIn the wake of the season, the Stars hired a new general manager, former player and alternate captain Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull and Jackson remained with the Stars, but were reassigned to new roles within the organization. Less than a week after he was hired, Nieuwendyk fired six-season head coach Dave Tippett on June 10, 2009, and hired [[Marc Crawford]] the next day as his replacement. Other off-season moves included the addition of [[Charlie Huddy]] as assistant coach in charge of defense and the promotions of [[Stu Barnes]] and Andy Moog to assistant coaches.\n\nThe Stars' [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310 season]] was similar to the previous one. Inconsistent play and defensive struggles plagued the team throughout the season, as they failed to adjust to Marc Crawford's new offensively-minded system, and owner Tom Hicks' financial troubles prevented the team from spending more than $45&nbsp;million on payroll, over $11&nbsp;million beneath the league salary cap.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/020910dnspostarshicks.327a05b.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212111804/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/020910dnspostarshicks.327a05b.html |date=February 12, 2010 }}</ref> The Stars failed to win more than three games in a row all season, finished in last in the Pacific Division and repeated their 12th place conference finish from the year before with a record of 37\u201331\u201314 for 88 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/standings |title=2011\u201312 NHL Preseason Conference Standings \u2013 National Hockey League|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> This was the first time that they would miss the playoffs two seasons in a row since the Stars moved to Texas.

Modano subsequently signed with the Detroit Red Wings while Turco joined the Chicago Blackhawks. Winger Jere Lehtinen, who played his entire career with the Stars, announced his retirement in December 2010. The team also made key acquisitions, such as winger [[Adam Burish]] (who was on the 2010 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks) and goaltender [[Andrew Raycroft]]. They also gave [[Jonathan Cheechoo]] a try-out, but he was cut and later signed with division rivals San Jose Sharks.\n\nTo begin the [[2010\u201311 NHL season|2010\u201311 season]], the Stars won their first three games, going on a three-game win streak for the first time since the 2007\u201308 season by beating the New Jersey Devils in overtime, [[New York Islanders]] in a shootout and against Mike Modano and the Red Wings. During the third game against the Red Wings, the Stars crowd gave Modano a standing ovation as he was shown on the [[Jumbotron]].\n\nAfter a hot start to the season, the Stars dominated the first half of the season, staying on the Pacific Division lead and staying in the top three spots of the conference. It seemed like the old Stars were back, as through the first half of the season, they went 30\u201315\u20136. But after the All-Star Game, the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks and blowing games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture.

However, when the second half of the season began, the Stars slumped through the months of January and February, before getting hot again in late February. Throughout March, the Stars regained the lead of the Pacific Division. Beginning on March 26, 2012, the Stars embarked on a western road trip that saw them visit the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks. Going into the road trip, the Stars were in control of their own destiny, having to gain four points on the road trip to win their first Pacific Division title since the 2005\u201306 season. After the Stars lost 5\u20134 in Calgary to the Flames, the Stars beat the Oilers two nights later, 3\u20131. This would be their last win of the season, as the Stars were rolled over by the Canucks and Sharks. Even though they had lost the division crown, the Stars still had a chance to clinch a playoff spot. However, the Stars were eliminated from playoff contention on April 5 in a 2\u20130 loss to the playoff-bound [[Nashville Predators]].

The Stars played at Reunion for eight years, from [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993]]\u2013[[2000\u201301 NHL season|2001]]. Before the [[2001\u201302 NHL season]], both the Stars and the Mavericks moved into the new [[American Airlines Center]], which is in the [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]] neighborhood of Dallas, just north of Reunion Arena.

Television coverage occurs primarily on [[Fox Sports Southwest]] (FSN), with [[KTXA]] (Channel 21) or FSSW+ broadcasting games when FSSW has a conflict.\n\nThe Stars, along with the Buffalo Sabres and [[Carolina Hurricanes]] are one of only three NHL teams to [[simulcast]] the entirety of their games on TV and radio, which the team has done since their 1993 arrival in Dallas. The original broadcast team from 1993 to 1996 was Mike Fornes (play-by-play) and [[Ralph Strangis]] (color). Fornes left the broadcast team after the 1995\u201396 season; Strangis moved to the play-by-play role and color commentator [[Daryl Reaugh|Daryl \"Razor\" Reaugh]] was added. Although both the DFW-area's large media market and the team's fan base could theoretically support separate television and radio broadcast teams, the Stars have continued simulcasting due to the popularity of \"Ralph and Razor\" (as they are known) among local listeners and viewers. Like other NHL teams, the Stars now have a live radio broadcast transmitted inside American Airlines Center on 97.5 FM. This is done because AM radio signals often cannot penetrate concrete and steel building exteriors.\n\nStrangis retired from the booth after the 2014\u201315 season and was replaced by [[Dave Strader]]. In June 2016, Strader was diagnosed with [[cholangiocarcinoma]], a fairly rare and aggressive form of cancer of the [[bile duct]]. To begin the 2016\u201317 season, Reaugh assumed play-by-play duties while Strader underwent treatment. Studio analyst and former Stars defenseman, [[Craig Ludwig]], took over as color commentator. During a break in Strader's treatment, he returned to the broadcast booth on February 18, 2017, a 4\u20133 overtime home win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After the game, the Stars saluted Strader at center ice. On October 1, 2017, Strader died of cancer at age 62, leaving Reaugh and Ludwig to call the 2017\u201318 season. In July 2018, the Stars announced that Reaugh would return to color commentary for the 2018\u201319 season, with former studio host Josh Bogorad taking over the play-by-play.<ref>[https://www.nhl.com/stars/news/dallas-stars-announce-broadcast-team-for-2018-19-season/c-299620262 Stars announce broadcast team for 2018-19 season]</ref>\n\n===Logo and jersey design===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dallas Stars logo.svg|thumb|150px|Former logo used from 1993 to 2013.

Away uniforms were black and home uniforms were white. With minor trim changes, a darker shade of green, and the word 'Dallas' added in the 1994\u201395 season, they kept this design until their [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999 Stanley Cup]]-winning campaign. The black pants have the word \"Dallas\" in gold run through the sides with green stripes.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the Stars introduced an alternate uniform that partly resembled those worn during the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] at the time. The uniform was mostly green on top and black at the bottom, in a star-shaped design. For the 1999\u20132000 season, it became the primary away uniform, and was paired with a new home uniform featuring the same basic design, with white on top and green at the bottom. They kept this design until the 2006\u201307 season, during which the league switched color designations on home and away jerseys in the 2003\u201304 season. The striping was also eliminated on the black pants.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dallas Stars Shoulder Patch.svg|thumb|150px|left|Shoulder patch and alternate logo used by the Stars from 1999 to 2013.]] -->\nThe Stars introduced an alternate jersey for the 2003\u201304 season that proved both embarrassing and unpopular to critics and fans. The uniform, which was black with a green bottom and red trim, featured a modern representation of the [[constellation]] [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] topped by a trailing green star with red trail marks. However, fans and critics derided the uniform crest for its resemblance to a [[uterus]], nicknaming it the \"Mooterus\". The uniform was used until the 2005\u201306 season.\n\nWith the switch to the [[Reebok]] Edge uniform system, the jerseys underwent a complete redesign. The home black jersey, introduced for the 2007\u201308 season, features the player's number on the chest and an arched 'Dallas' in white with gold trim, with the primary logo on the shoulders. The primary away jerseys, which were used from 2007\u201310 and was used as an alternate for its final season, had the Stars logo crest in front and the uniform number on the top right, with the Texas alternate logo on the shoulders. An alternate white jersey based on the home black jersey was introduced for the 2008\u201309 season; they became the regular away uniforms for the 2010\u201311 season. The lettering is in green with gold and black trim. Both uniforms were used until the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nA new logo and uniforms were introduced for the 2013\u201314 season. Silver replaced gold as the tertiary color, while green (in a bright new shade called \"Victory Green\", similar to the old North Stars' shade of green) was reintroduced as a primary uniform color. The new logo features the letter D centering a star, symbolizing Dallas' nickname as \"The Big D\". The home uniforms are in green with black and white striping, while the away uniforms are in white with a green shoulder yoke, and black and green striping. The inner collar features the team name on the home uniforms, and the city name on the away uniforms. The secondary logo, with the primary inside a roundel with the team name, is featured in the shoulders.\n\nThe Stars unveiled a special edition uniform for the [[2020 NHL Winter Classic]], featuring a design inspired from the defunct [[United States Hockey League|USHL]] [[Dallas Texans (USHL)|Dallas Texans]] hockey club. The uniform features the word \"Stars\" (with the star substituting for the letter A) in the middle of the big letter \"D\". Both are in white with silver trim. A silhouette of the state of Texas in silver and green trim with the letter \"D\" inside adorns the left sleeve.\n\n===Minor league affiliates===\n[[File:Texas Stars logo.svg|150px|thumb|The [[Texas Stars]], based in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]], are the Stars current [[American Hockey League]] affiliate.]]\nThe Dallas Stars are presently affiliated with two [[minor league]] teams.

They compete in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a member of the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. The team was founded during the [[1967 NHL expansion]] as the [[Minnesota North Stars]], based in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. Before the beginning of the [[1978\u201379 NHL season]], the team merged with the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] after the league granted them permission due to each team's respective financial struggles. Ultimately, the franchise relocated to Dallas for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season]]. The Stars played out of [[Reunion Arena]] from their relocation until 2001, when the team moved less than 1.5 miles into the [[American Airlines Center]].\n\nThe Stars have won eight division titles in Dallas, two [[Presidents' Trophy|Presidents' Trophies]] as the top regular season team in the league, the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] championship twice, and in [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], the [[Stanley Cup]]. [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the most valuable player of the playoffs that year.\n\nIn 2000, [[Neal Broten]] was inducted into the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]]. In 2009, [[Brett Hull]] became the first Dallas Stars player inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], followed by [[Ed Belfour]] and Joe Nieuwendyk in 2011 and [[Mike Modano]] in 2014. In 2010, brothers [[Derian Hatcher|Derian]] and [[Kevin Hatcher]] were inducted to the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Minnesota North Stars (1967\u20131993)===\n{{Main|Minnesota North Stars}}\nThe Minnesota North Stars began play in [[1967\u201368 NHL season|1967]] as part of the league's [[1967 NHL Expansion|six-team expansion]]. Home games were played at the newly constructed Metropolitan Sports Center (\"[[Met Center]]\") in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. Initially successful both on the ice and at the gate, the North Stars fell victim to financial problems after several poor seasons in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Minnesota North Stars Logo 1991-1993.svg|thumb|left|The logo of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] from 1991 to 1993. When the team moved to Dallas in 1993, it used a similar logo, usually with the word \"DALLAS\" above \"STARS,\" until 2013.]]\nIn [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1978]], the North Stars merged with the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] (formerly the [[California Golden Seals]]), owned by [[George Gund III|George III]] and [[Gordon Gund]]. With both teams on the verge of folding, the league permitted the two failing franchises to merge. The merged team continued as the Minnesota North Stars, while the Seals/Barons franchise records were retired. However, the Gunds were the merged team's principal owners, and the North Stars assumed the Barons' place in the [[Adams Division]] in order to balance out the divisions. The merger brought with it a number of talented players, and the North Stars were revived\u2014they reached the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals in [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1981]], where they lost in five games to the [[New York Islanders]]. However, by the early 1990s, declining attendance and the inability to secure a new downtown revenue-generating arena led ownership to request permission to move the team to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1990. The league rejected the request and instead agreed to award an [[expansion team|expansion franchise]], the [[San Jose Sharks]], to the Gund brothers. The North Stars were sold to a group of investors that were originally looking to place a team in San Jose, although one of the group's members, former [[Calgary Flames]] part-owner [[Norman Green]], would eventually gain control of the team.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cameron|first=Steve|title=Feeding Frenzy! The Wild New World of the San Jose Sharks|pages=29\u201338|year=1994|publisher=Taylor Publishing Co.}}</ref> In the following season, the North Stars made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, only to lose to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].\n\nAfter the 1990\u201391 season, the North Stars suffered through poor attendance and declining profits. The team's fortunes were further impeded by the terms of the settlement with the Gund brothers, in which they were permitted to take a number of North Stars players to San Jose. Green explored the possibility of moving the team to [[Anaheim]], however the league decided instead to place the expansion [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks]] there in 1993\u201394. In their final two seasons in Minnesota, the team adopted a new logo which omitted the \"North\" from \"North Stars\", leading many fans to anticipate the team heading south.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2010/January/The_35_Biggest_Moments_in_Modern_Dallas_History_11.aspx |title=The 35 Biggest Moments in Modern Dallas History |publisher=Dmagazine.com |accessdate=2011-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520003803/http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2010/January/The_35_Biggest_Moments_in_Modern_Dallas_History_11.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Relocation and early years in Dallas (1993\u20131998)===\n[[File:Reunion Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Reunion Arena]] was the first home for the Stars in Dallas. The arena was the Stars\u2019 home from 1993 to 2001.]]\nIn 1993, amid further attendance woes and bitter personal controversy, Green obtained permission from the league to move the team to Dallas, for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]], with the decision announced on March 10, 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/patrick-plus-thanks-norm-green/265064341/|title=Patrick Plus: Thanks, Norm Green|website=Star Tribune|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref> Green was convinced by former [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] that Dallas would be a suitable market for an NHL team.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\"/> He decided to retain the \"Stars\" nickname, as it matched Texas' official nickname as \"The Lone Star State.\" The Stars would move into [[Reunion Arena]], built in 1980, the downtown arena already occupied by the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Dallas Mavericks]].\n\nTo quell the ensuing controversy, the NHL promised that the Twin Cities would receive an expansion franchise in the future; that promise was fulfilled in 2000 in the form of the [[Minnesota Wild]].\n\nWith the league changing the names of the conferences and divisions that season, the newly relocated Stars were placed in the Central Division of the Western Conference, and played their first game in Dallas on October 5, 1993, a 6\u20134 win against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>[https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL/1994_games.html 1993-94 Dallas Stars Schedule and Results]. hockey-reference.com</ref> In that game, [[Neal Broten]] scored the first Stars goal in Dallas. Dallas was an experiment for the league. At that time, the Stars would be one of the three southern-most teams in the league, along with the newly-created [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and [[Florida Panthers]], as the league's first real ventures into southern non-traditional hockey markets. Though the Stars were relatively still unknown in the area, word of the team spread rapidly, and the immediate success of the team on the ice, as well as [[Mike Modano]]'s career best season (50 goals, 93 points) helped spur the team's popularity in Dallas. The Stars set franchise bests in wins (42) and points (97) in their first season in Texas, qualifying for the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs|1994 playoffs]]. The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the [[St. Louis Blues]] in the first round, but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion [[Vancouver Canucks]] in the second round. The Stars' success in their first season, along with Modano's spectacular on ice performances, would be an integral part of the Stars' eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come.\n\nThe almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by the long legacy of minor-league hockey in the area. Both incarnations of the [[Central Hockey League]] had two teams in the area, the [[Fort Worth Texans]] and the [[Dallas Blackhawks]] for years before the Stars' arrival. These two teams were bitter rivals, and some of the traditions and famous rivalry incidents, including what is thought to be the first known use anywhere at an athletic event of \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Fort Worth and the famous \"10 Cent Beer Night\" near riot in 1978 helped create awareness of hockey. Amateur and youth hockey was also extremely popular because of the long presence of the minor league teams.\n\nGreen, who had run into financial problems stemming from his business ventures outside of hockey, was forced to sell the team to businessman [[Tom Hicks]] in December 1995.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\"/>\n\n====Building for a championship====\nThe 1994\u201395 season was shortened by an [[1994\u201395 NHL lockout|owners' lockout]]. The Stars traded captain [[Mark Tinordi]] along with [[Rick Mrozik]] to the [[Washington Capitals]] before the season began for [[Kevin Hatcher]]. Longtime North Stars hold-over [[Neal Broten]] was named his replacement, although he was traded too after only 17 games to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. Broten was replaced by Kevin's younger brother [[Derian Hatcher]] as team captain, a role he would serve in for the next decade. The Stars played only 48 games that season posting a record of 17\u201323\u20138. Despite the shortened season and the losing record, the Stars again made the playoffs, losing in five games to the Red Wings in the first round.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL/ |title=Dallas Stars Franchise Index |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Sergei Zubov.jpg|thumb|left|The Stars made several moves to revamp the roster in the 1996 off-season, notably making a trade to acquire [[Sergei Zubov]]. He remained on the team until he left the league in 2009.]] \nThe [[1995\u201396 NHL season|1995\u201396 season]] would be the first full season under new owner Tom Hicks. In the off-season, the Stars traded for former [[Montreal Canadiens]]' captain and three-time [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] winner [[Guy Carbonneau]], who was then with the St. Louis Blues. With the Stars struggling to begin the season, general manager and head coach [[Bob Gainey]] traded for center [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] from the [[Calgary Flames]] in exchange for [[Corey Millen]] and [[Jarome Iginla]], then a Stars prospect. The Stars recorded only 11 wins in the first half of the season, and Bob Gainey relinquished his coaching duties in January to be the full-time general manager of the team. The Stars soon hired [[Michigan K-Wings]] head coach [[Ken Hitchcock]] to replace him; it would be his first NHL head coaching position. The Stars then traded for [[Beno\u00eet Hogue|Benoit Hogue]] from the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] late in the season, but ultimately finished in sixth place in the Central Division, missing the playoffs for the first time since moving to Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL |title=Dallas Stars Franchise Index |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 off-season, the Stars continued to revamp their roster, adding defensemen [[Darryl Sydor]] from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] followed by [[Sergei Zubov]] from the Pittsburgh Penguins for Kevin Hatcher. Zubov would serve as the Stars' top defenseman and powerplay quarterback until leaving the league in 2009. On the ice, Ken Hitchcock's first season proved to be a good one. The Stars bested their 1994 totals, posting 48 wins and reaching the 100-point mark for the first time in franchise history. The Stars won the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]], their first division title since 1983\u201384 (when they were still the Minnesota North Stars) and were seeded second in the [[1997 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1997.html |title=1996\u201397 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Despite the regular season success, the youthful Stars were upset in the first round by the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in seven games. Defenseman [[Grant Ledyard]] tripped in overtime of Game 7, allowing [[Todd Marchant]] to score the game- and series-winning goal on a breakaway against goaltender [[Andy Moog]].\n\nIn the 1997 off-season, the Stars signed star goaltender [[Ed Belfour]] as a free agent after a well publicized falling-out with the San Jose Sharks, which had traded a number of players to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] to obtain him in January in the previous season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeygoalies.org/bio/belfour.html |title=Ed Belfour |publisher=Hockeygoalies.org |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Andy Moog was allowed to leave via free agency, but later returned to the Stars as an assistant coach. The [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]] was another banner year for the Stars. The Stars again set franchise records in wins (49) and points (109). Dallas acquired [[Mike Keane]] at the deadline from the [[New York Rangers]]. The Stars won the franchise's first [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the league's best regular season team, as well as the Central Division title for the second season in a row. Belfour set franchise season records for [[goals against average]] (1.88), wins (37) and just missed out on the [[Jennings Trophy]] by one goal to [[Martin Brodeur]] of the [[New Jersey Devils]]. The Stars were the first overall seed for the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]] and defeated the eighth-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round. Notorious enforcer [[Bryan Marchment]] injured Joe Nieuwendyk's right knee, forcing him to miss the rest of the playoffs with torn ligaments. In the second round, they again met the Edmonton Oilers, this time defeating them in five games. However, without Nieuwendyk, the Stars lacked the firepower to overcome the defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals and lost in six games. The Red Wings went on to win their second consecutive Stanley Cup.\n\n===Dominance, a Stanley Cup, and playoff disappointment (1998\u20132004)===\n{{See also|1999 Stanley Cup Finals}}\nIn the 1998 off-season, after falling just short in the Western Conference Finals, the Stars added what they believed was the final piece toward winning a championship: star goalscoring winger [[Brett Hull]]. Hull had already had a magnificent career with the St. Louis Blues, with three consecutive 70-goal seasons and a [[Hart Memorial Trophy]], but a fallout with Blues management led Hull to leave St. Louis via free agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stlouisblueslegends.blogspot.com/2007/01/brett-hull.html |title=St. Louis Blues Legends: Brett Hull |publisher=Stlouisblueslegends.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Additionally, this was the first season for the Stars in the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]] after the 1998 NHL division re-alignment.\n\nThe Stars 1998\u201399 season was excellent. The Stars won 51 games, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also recorded 114 points, which still stands today as a franchise record. They won the Pacific Division by 24 points, their third consecutive division title; a second consecutive Presidents' Trophy; the Jennings Trophy as the league's top defensive team; and were awarded the top seed in the [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999 playoffs]]. Winger [[Jere Lehtinen]] was also awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1999.html |title=1998\u201399 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Joe Nieuwendyk Dallas.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Nieuwendyk]] helped the Stars win their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1999. Nieuwendyk was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] for that year's playoffs.]]\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Dallas faced their playoff arch-rivals, the Edmonton Oilers. The Stars swept the Oilers in four tough games, winning Game 4 in the third overtime on a goal by Joe Nieuwendyk. They then faced the St. Louis Blues in the second round. After taking a 2\u20130 series lead, the Blues stormed back to tie the series. The Stars then won the next two games to beat the Blues in six games. The series again ended on an overtime goal, this time from Mike Modano. In the Conference Finals, they faced the [[Colorado Avalanche]] for the first time in Stars history. This would be the first of four playoff meetings between the Stars and Avalanche in the next seven years. After both the Stars and the Avalanche split the first four games at a 2\u20132 series tie, the Avalanche won Game 5 by a score of 7\u20135, taking a 3\u20132 series lead, The Stars rallied winning game six on the road, and Game 7 at home, both by 4\u20131 scorelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/NHL_1999.html |title=1999 NHL Playoffs Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Stars' first [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] appearance as the Dallas Stars, although they made the finals twice as the Minnesota North Stars. They faced the Eastern Conference champion [[Buffalo Sabres]], who had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4\u20131 in the Eastern Conference Finals. After splitting the first four games, the Stars vaunted defense would hold the Sabres to only one goal in the next two, winning Game 5 2\u20130 and Game 6 2\u20131 on an overtime goal by Brett Hull. Hull's goal at 14:51 of the third overtime was remembered as one of the most controversial goals ever scored. That season, the league still had the infamous \"crease rule\" in effect, which provided that if any player of the attacking team who did not have possession of the puck was in the crease before the puck, then any resulting goal was disallowed. Hull had initially gained possession of the puck outside the crease and had made a shot that was blocked by Buffalo goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]]. One of Hull's skates entered the crease as he corralled the rebound, and Hull's second shot scored the Cup-winning goal, followed by a lengthy official review. The goal was eventually allowed, as having simply blocked Hull's shot rather than catching it, Hasek never took possession of the puck away from Hull. Officials therefore determined that rather than calling it a loose puck, Hull would be considered to have had continuous possession of the puck from before his first shot outside the crease. The complexity of the crease rule, and the attendant difficulties in understanding its application by fans and players alike, combined with the controversy arising out of the disputed Stanley Cup-winning goal, resulted in the crease rule being repealed the following season. Hull's goal marked the 13th time a Stanley Cup-winning goal was scored in overtime, and only the fourth to be scored in multiple overtimes. This was the only time between [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]] and [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]] that a team other than the New Jersey Devils, Colorado Avalanche or Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe team added veterans [[Kirk Muller]], [[Dave Manson]] and [[Sylvain C\u00f4t\u00e9|Sylvain Cote]] in an effort to defend their Stanley Cup championship in {{NHL Year|1999}}. On December 31, 1999, Brett Hull scored his 600 and 601st career goals in a 5\u20134 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Stars ultimately won the Pacific Division for the second year in a row, and were seeded second in the Western Conference. Dallas then defeated the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks in the first and second rounds, both 4\u20131 series victories. The Stars, for the second season in a row, defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals in seven games to reach their second consecutive Stanley Cup Finals, where they met the New Jersey Devils. Because the Devils finished the regular season with one more point than Dallas, the Stars had to play their first playoff series without home ice advantage since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2000.html |title=1999-00 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The Stars lost all three games at the Reunion Arena in the Finals, and lost the series in Game 6 on a double-overtime goal by New Jersey forward [[Jason Arnott]].\n\n====Unsuccessful playoff runs====\nHoping to win back the Stanley Cup, the Stars again captured the Pacific Division, posting a solid 48\u201324\u20138\u20132 record in the [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301 season]]. In the playoffs, the Stars met the Edmonton Oilers in the first round, battling back-and-forth through the first four games, with each game decided by one goal, including three going into overtime. Game 5 would also go to overtime, as the Stars took a 3\u20132 series lead on a goal by Kirk Muller. However, in Game 6 in [[Edmonton]], the Stars did not need overtime, advancing to the second round with a 3\u20131 win. Facing the St. Louis Blues, the Stars would run out of gas, being swept in four straight games. The Game 2 loss would be the last NHL game played in Reunion Arena.\n[[File:MartyTurco.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marty Turco]] was awarded the starting goaltender position in the 2001\u201302 season, with the departure of [[Ed Belfour]] to free agency.]]\nMoving into the brand new [[American Airlines Center]] for the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]], the Stars got off to a slow start to the season, as goaltender Ed Belfour struggled through one of his worst seasons. Head coach Ken Hitchcock was eventually fired, being replaced by [[Rick Wilson (ice hockey)|Rick Wilson]]. Despite the coaching change, the Stars continued to play poor hockey. With the prospect of missing the playoffs, the Stars traded 1999 Conn Smythe winner Joe Nieuwendyk and [[Jamie Langenbrunner]] to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for [[Randy McKay]] and Jason Arnott, who scored the game-winning goal in the 2000 Finals against Dallas. The Stars would eventually go on to post a respectable record of 35\u201328\u201313\u20135. However, it would not be enough for the playoffs, as they fell four points short of the final eighth spot in the Western Conference. Following the season, coach Rick Wilson would return to assistant coaching duties, as the Stars brought in [[Dave Tippett]] as his replacement.\n\nAs in the 2002 off-season, Ed Belfour left via free agency to the Toronto Maple Leafs. To begin the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]], the Stars awarded the starting goaltending position to [[Marty Turco]], who went on to have one of the best seasons in NHL history, posting the lowest goals against average (GAA) since 1940, at 1.76. However, missing 18 games late in the season likely cost him a shot at the [[Vezina Trophy]], awarded to the leagues's top regular season goaltender. Regardless, the Stars posted the best record in the Western Conference at 46\u201317\u201315\u20134, and along the way, two-way star Jere Lehtinen won his third Frank J. Selke Trophy. In the [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], the Stars once again met the Edmonton Oilers, and once again the Oilers would prove a contentious opponent, winning two of the first three games. However, the Stars would prove the better team again by winning the next three games to take the series in six games. The Stars' second round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim got off to an unbelievable start, as the game went deep into overtime tied 3\u20133. However, Mighty Ducks goaltender [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] stopped 60 shots as the Ducks scored early in the fifth overtime. Game 2 would be more of the same, as the Ducks stunned the Stars in overtime. Desperately needing a win, the Stars bounced back to take Game 3 in Anaheim. However, the Ducks would take a 3\u20131 series lead by breaking a scoreless tie late in the third period of Game 4. In Game 5, the Stars finally solved Giguere by scoring four goals to keep their playoff hopes alive. However, the Stars dreams of a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals would end in heartbreaking fashionm as the Ducks broke a 3\u20133 tie with 1:06 left in Game 6 on a goal by defenseman [[Sandis Ozoli\u0146\u0161|Sandis Ozolinsh]].\n\nComing off their disappointing playoff loss, the Stars would get off to a shaky start to the [[2003\u201304 NHL Season|2003\u201304 season]], as they played mediocre hockey through the first three months of the season, posting a sub-.500 record. However, as the calendar turned to 2004, the Stars began to find their game, as they posted a 9\u20134\u20133 record in January. As the season wore on, the Stars would get stronger, climbing up the playoff ladder and eventually reaching second place in the Pacific Division, where they finished with a solid 41\u201326\u201313\u20132 record; Marty Turco had another outstanding season, recording a 1.98 GAA. However, the Stars could not carry their momentum into the playoffs, as they were beaten by the Colorado Avalanche in five games in the first round.\n\n===Post-lockout era (2005\u20132008)===\nComing out of the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|owners' lockout]] that cancelled the entire [[2004\u201305 NHL season|2004\u201305 season]], the Stars remained one of the strongest teams in the Western Conference for the start of [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]], as they won four of their first five games on the way to a solid October. November would be even better for Dallas, as they won 10 of 13 games and took over first place in the Pacific Division, a position they would hold most of the season, as they went on to finish with a terrific record of 53\u201323\u20136. One reason for the Stars success was their strong play in shootouts, as forward [[Jussi Jokinen]] was nearly automatic, making 10-of-13 shot attempts. Also performing strong in shootouts was Sergei Zubov, who used a slow-but-steady backhand to go 7-for-12, as the Stars ultimately won 12 of 13 games that were settled by a shootout. As the number two seed in the Western Conference, the Stars faced the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. The Stars were favorited to win the Western Conference, and some even predicted them to win the Stanley Cup. However, the Stars would stumble right from the start, losing Game 1 by a score of 5\u20132 as the Avalanche scored five unanswered goals after the Stars jumped out to a promising 2\u20130 lead. Game 2 would see the Stars suffer another setback at home, as the Stars lost in overtime 5\u20134 on a goal by [[Joe Sakic]]. On the road in Game 3, the Stars led 3\u20132 in the final minute before the Avalanche forced overtime on a goal by [[Andrew Brunette]], while [[Alex Tanguay]] won the game just 69 seconds into overtime to put the Stars in a 3\u20130 hole. The Stars would avoid the sweep with 4\u20131 win in Game 4, but overtime would doom them again in Game 5, as Andrew Brunette scored the series winner at 6:05, ending the Stars' playoffs hopes after just five games.\n\n====Dallas hosts the All-Star Game (2006\u20132007 season)====\nFollowing the previous season's disappointing first round playoff upset at the hands of the seventh-seeded Avalanche, the Stars made a number of changes during the 2006 off-season. Former Stars goalkeeper Andy Moog was promoted to assistant general manager for player development (he kept his job as goaltending coach) and former player [[Ulf Dahl\u00e9n|Ulf Dahlen]] was hired as an assistant coach. The Stars allowed center Jason Arnott, defenseman [[Willie Mitchell (ice hockey)|Willie Mitchell]] and goaltender [[Johan Hedberg]] to leave as [[free agents]]. Forward [[Niko Kapanen]] was traded to the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] and the remaining two years on fan-favorite [[winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] [[Bill Guerin]]'s contract were bought out. The Stars also received [[Patrik \u0160tefan|Patrik Stefan]] and [[Jaroslav Modr\u00fd|Jaroslav Modry]] in the Atlanta trade, and signed [[Eric Lindros]], [[Jeff Halpern]], [[Matthew Barnaby]] and [[Darryl Sydor]] as free agents. Young goaltender [[Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1982)|Mike Smith]] was promoted to the NHL to serve as Marty Turco's backup. During the season, key future pieces \u2013 center [[Mike Ribeiro]] and defenseman [[Mattias Norstr\u00f6m|Mattias Norstrom]] \u2013 were added through separate trades. Young players [[Joel Lundqvist]], [[Krys Barch]], [[Nicklas Grossmann]] and [[Chris Conner]] all saw significant ice time while other players were out of the lineup with injuries.\n[[File:Modano Record Goal.jpg|thumb|[[Mike Modano]] scoring his 500th goal on November 7, 2007 against the [[San Jose Sharks]].

On March 17, Modano scored his 502nd and 503rd NHL goals, breaking the record for an American-born player, previously held by [[Joe Mullen]].\n\nOn January 24, 2007, the [[2007 National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] was held at the [[American Airlines Center]]. Defenseman [[Philippe Boucher]] and goaltender Marty Turco would represent the Stars as part of the Western Conference All-Star roster. The Stars qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and squared off against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. Marty Turco delivered three shutout wins in Games 2, 5 and 6, but the Stars' offense failed to capitalize and they lost the series in seven games, the third season in a row that they lost in the first round.\n\n====Return to playoff prominence (2007\u20132008 season)====\nIn the [[2007 NHL Entry Draft]], the Stars drafted the relatively unknown [[Jamie Benn]] 129th overall. After starting a lackluster 7\u20137\u20133 in the [[2007\u201308 Dallas Stars season|2007\u201308 season]], general manager [[Doug Armstrong]] was fired by the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3108257 |title=Armstrong fired after 7\u20137\u20133 start; Hull, Jackson named interim GMs \u2013 NHL|publisher=ESPN |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> He was replaced by an unusual \"co-general manager\" arrangement of former assistant GM [[Les Jackson (ice hockey)|Les Jackson]] and former Stars player Brett Hull.

Off-season free agent acquisition [[Sean Avery]] caused a media uproar over comments he made to a Canadian reporter about ex-girlfriend [[Elisha Cuthbert]] and her relationship with [[Calgary Flames]]' defenseman [[Dion Phaneuf]] before a game in [[Calgary]]. The incident forced the team to suspend Avery for the season; he was later waived by the Stars. That incident, plus injuries to key players Brad Richards and Sergei Zubov, caused the Stars to tailspin to a 12th-place finish and the first missed playoffs for Dallas since 2002.\n\nIn the wake of the season, the Stars hired a new general manager, former player and alternate captain Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull and Jackson remained with the Stars, but were reassigned to new roles within the organization. Less than a week after he was hired, Nieuwendyk fired six-season head coach Dave Tippett on June 10, 2009, and hired [[Marc Crawford]] the next day as his replacement. Other off-season moves included the addition of [[Charlie Huddy]] as assistant coach in charge of defense and the promotions of [[Stu Barnes]] and Andy Moog to assistant coaches.\n\nThe Stars' [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310 season]] was similar to the previous one. Inconsistent play and defensive struggles plagued the team throughout the season, as they failed to adjust to Marc Crawford's new offensively-minded system, and owner Tom Hicks' financial troubles prevented the team from spending more than $45&nbsp;million on payroll, over $11&nbsp;million beneath the league salary cap.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/020910dnspostarshicks.327a05b.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212111804/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/020910dnspostarshicks.327a05b.html |date=February 12, 2010 }}</ref> The Stars failed to win more than three games in a row all season, finished in last in the Pacific Division and repeated their 12th place conference finish from the year before with a record of 37\u201331\u201314 for 88 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/standings |title=2011\u201312 NHL Preseason Conference Standings \u2013 National Hockey League|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> This was the first time that they would miss the playoffs two seasons in a row since the Stars moved to Texas.

Modano subsequently signed with the Detroit Red Wings while Turco joined the Chicago Blackhawks. Winger Jere Lehtinen, who played his entire career with the Stars, announced his retirement in December 2010. The team also made key acquisitions, such as winger [[Adam Burish]] (who was on the 2010 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks) and goaltender [[Andrew Raycroft]]. They also gave [[Jonathan Cheechoo]] a try-out, but he was cut and later signed with division rivals San Jose Sharks.\n\nTo begin the [[2010\u201311 NHL season|2010\u201311 season]], the Stars won their first three games, going on a three-game win streak for the first time since the 2007\u201308 season by beating the New Jersey Devils in overtime, [[New York Islanders]] in a shootout and against Mike Modano and the Red Wings. During the third game against the Red Wings, the Stars crowd gave Modano a standing ovation as he was shown on the [[Jumbotron]].\n\nAfter a hot start to the season, the Stars dominated the first half of the season, staying on the Pacific Division lead and staying in the top three spots of the conference. It seemed like the old Stars were back, as through the first half of the season, they went 30\u201315\u20136. But after the All-Star Game, the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks and blowing games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture. On the day of the trade deadline, the Stars traded [[James Neal (ice hockey)|James Neal]] and [[Matt Niskanen]] to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for defenseman [[Alex Goligoski]]. After an awful second half, the Stars still had a chance to make the playoffs by winning all their games in April. They won all of them except for last, as they lost to the Minnesota Wild 5\u20133, costing them a playoff spot.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs for the third consecutive season, Dallas fired coach Marc Crawford on April 12, 2011.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nhl/news/story?id=6338807 Stars fire Marc Crawford].

However, when the second half of the season began, the Stars slumped through the months of January and February, before getting hot again in late February. Throughout March, the Stars regained the lead of the Pacific Division. Beginning on March 26, 2012, the Stars embarked on a western road trip that saw them visit the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks. Going into the road trip, the Stars were in control of their own destiny, having to gain four points on the road trip to win their first Pacific Division title since the 2005\u201306 season. After the Stars lost 5\u20134 in Calgary to the Flames, the Stars beat the Oilers two nights later, 3\u20131. This would be their last win of the season, as the Stars were rolled over by the Canucks and Sharks. Even though they had lost the division crown, the Stars still had a chance to clinch a playoff spot.

The lone bright spot of the 2014\u201315 season was Jamie Benn winning the [[Art Ross Trophy]]. On April 11, 2015, Benn scored four points in the Stars' last regular season game to finish with 87 points on the season and win the Art Ross Trophy. His final point, a secondary assist with 8.5 seconds left in the game, allowed him to overtake [[John Tavares]] for the award.<ref>http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/jamie-benn-records-assist-with-9-seconds-to-play-to-win-art-ross-trophy/</ref>\n\nIn the [[2015\u201316 NHL season|2015\u201316 season]], the Stars won their first Central Division title since 1998 and posted the best regular season record in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they defeated the Minnesota Wild in six games. In the second round, they faced the St. Louis Blues, for the first time since 2001, and lost the series in seven games. The Stars finished with a 34\u201337\u201311 record in an injury-plagued [[2016\u201317 NHL season|2016\u201317 season]], missing the playoffs for the seventh time in the past nine seasons. As a result, the team announced that head coach Lindy Ruff's contract would not be renewed. Ken Hitchcock returned as head coach for the [[2017\u201318 NHL season|following season]], and once again, the Stars missed the playoffs. Hitchcock retired after the season and was succeeded at the head coaching spot by [[Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)|Jim Montgomery]]. Montgomery's first season as the Stars coach saw the team make the playoffs, defeating the Nashville Predators in the first round, but falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues in double-overtime of Game 7 of the second round.\n\n==Team information==\n===Arena===\n[[File:American Airlines Center Dallas.JPG|thumb|The [[American Airlines Center]] is the second, and current home arena used by the Dallas Stars.]]\nWhen the Stars first moved from Minnesota, they played in [[Reunion Arena]], which they shared with the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Dallas Mavericks]]. For hockey, Reunion Arena held 17,001 for NHL games. Throughout the hockey history of Reunion Arena, the arena was known for having one of the worst ice surfaces in the league, especially in its final days hosting the Stars. The Stars played at Reunion for eight years, from [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993]]\u2013[[2000\u201301 NHL season|2001]]. Before the [[2001\u201302 NHL season]], both the Stars and the Mavericks moved into the new [[American Airlines Center]], which is in the [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]] neighborhood of Dallas, just north of Reunion Arena. The American Airlines Center holds 18,584 for Stars and NHL games. On January 24, 2007, the AAC hosted the [[2007 National Hockey League All-Star Game]]. The AAC and the Dallas Stars have won several local and NHL awards for \"Best Fan Experience\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-stars/stars/2017/08/17/stars-earn-highest-grade-fan-experience-among-local-sports-teams|title=Stars earn highest grade for 'Fan Experience'}}</ref> After Purchasing the Stars, Doug Dimmadome changed the name of the Arena to The Dimmadome.\n\n===Broadcast===\nAll Dallas Stars games are broadcast on radio on [[KTCK (AM)|KTCK]] under a five-year deal announced in January 2009.<ref>[http://stars.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=404535 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118013701/http://stars.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=404535 |date=January 18, 2009 }}</ref> KTCK replaced [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]], which had broadcast games since the beginning of the 1994 season after [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]] has broadcast the first season in Dallas in 1993. Television coverage occurs primarily on [[Fox Sports Southwest]] (FSN), with [[KTXA]] (Channel 21) or FSSW+ broadcasting games when FSSW has a conflict.\n\nThe Stars, along with the Buffalo Sabres and [[Carolina Hurricanes]] are one of only three NHL teams to [[simulcast]] the entirety of their games on TV and radio, which the team has done since their 1993 arrival in Dallas. The original broadcast team from 1993 to 1996 was Mike Fornes (play-by-play) and [[Ralph Strangis]] (color). Fornes left the broadcast team after the 1995\u201396 season; Strangis moved to the play-by-play role and color commentator [[Daryl Reaugh|Daryl \"Razor\" Reaugh]] was added. Although both the DFW-area's large media market and the team's fan base could theoretically support separate television and radio broadcast teams, the Stars have continued simulcasting due to the popularity of \"Ralph and Razor\" (as they are known) among local listeners and viewers. Like other NHL teams, the Stars now have a live radio broadcast transmitted inside American Airlines Center on 97.5 FM. This is done because AM radio signals often cannot penetrate concrete and steel building exteriors.\n\nStrangis retired from the booth after the 2014\u201315 season and was replaced by [[Dave Strader]]. In June 2016, Strader was diagnosed with [[cholangiocarcinoma]], a fairly rare and aggressive form of cancer of the [[bile duct]]. To begin the 2016\u201317 season, Reaugh assumed play-by-play duties while Strader underwent treatment. Studio analyst and former Stars defenseman, [[Craig Ludwig]], took over as color commentator. During a break in Strader's treatment, he returned to the broadcast booth on February 18, 2017, a 4\u20133 overtime home win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After the game, the Stars saluted Strader at center ice. On October 1, 2017, Strader died of cancer at age 62, leaving Reaugh and Ludwig to call the 2017\u201318 season. In July 2018, the Stars announced that Reaugh would return to color commentary for the 2018\u201319 season, with former studio host Josh Bogorad taking over the play-by-play.<ref>[https://www.nhl.com/stars/news/dallas-stars-announce-broadcast-team-for-2018-19-season/c-299620262 Stars announce broadcast team for 2018-19 season]</ref>\n\n===Logo and jersey design===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dallas Stars logo.svg|thumb|150px|Former logo used from 1993 to 2013. The logo was left largely unchanged from the franchise's relocation to Dallas.]] -->\nWhen they debuted in Dallas for the 1993\u201394 season, they kept the same uniform design from their later Minnesota days, except for the addition of the [[Texas]] logo patch on the shoulders. Away uniforms were black and home uniforms were white. With minor trim changes, a darker shade of green, and the word 'Dallas' added in the 1994\u201395 season, they kept this design until their [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999 Stanley Cup]]-winning campaign. The black pants have the word \"Dallas\" in gold run through the sides with green stripes.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the Stars introduced an alternate uniform that partly resembled those worn during the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] at the time. The uniform was mostly green on top and black at the bottom, in a star-shaped design. For the 1999\u20132000 season, it became the primary away uniform, and was paired with a new home uniform featuring the same basic design, with white on top and green at the bottom. They kept this design until the 2006\u201307 season, during which the league switched color designations on home and away jerseys in the 2003\u201304 season. The striping was also eliminated on the black pants.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dallas Stars Shoulder Patch.svg|thumb|150px|left|Shoulder patch and alternate logo used by the Stars from 1999 to 2013.]] -->\nThe Stars introduced an alternate jersey for the 2003\u201304 season that proved both embarrassing and unpopular to critics and fans. The uniform, which was black with a green bottom and red trim, featured a modern representation of the [[constellation]] [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] topped by a trailing green star with red trail marks. However, fans and critics derided the uniform crest for its resemblance to a [[uterus]], nicknaming it the \"Mooterus\". The uniform was used until the 2005\u201306 season.\n\nWith the switch to the [[Reebok]] Edge uniform system, the jerseys underwent a complete redesign. The home black jersey, introduced for the 2007\u201308 season, features the player's number on the chest and an arched 'Dallas' in white with gold trim, with the primary logo on the shoulders. The primary away jerseys, which were used from 2007\u201310 and was used as an alternate for its final season, had the Stars logo crest in front and the uniform number on the top right, with the Texas alternate logo on the shoulders. An alternate white jersey based on the home black jersey was introduced for the 2008\u201309 season; they became the regular away uniforms for the 2010\u201311 season. The lettering is in green with gold and black trim. Both uniforms were used until the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nA new logo and uniforms were introduced for the 2013\u201314 season. Silver replaced gold as the tertiary color, while green (in a bright new shade called \"Victory Green\", similar to the old North Stars' shade of green) was reintroduced as a primary uniform color. The new logo features the letter D centering a star, symbolizing Dallas' nickname as \"The Big D\". The home uniforms are in green with black and white striping, while the away uniforms are in white with a green shoulder yoke, and black and green striping. The inner collar features the team name on the home uniforms, and the city name on the away uniforms. The secondary logo, with the primary inside a roundel with the team name, is featured in the shoulders.\n\nThe Stars unveiled a special edition uniform for the [[2020 NHL Winter Classic]], featuring a design inspired from the defunct [[United States Hockey League|USHL]] [[Dallas Texans (USHL)|Dallas Texans]] hockey club. The uniform features the word \"Stars\" (with the star substituting for the letter A) in the middle of the big letter \"D\". Both are in white with silver trim. A silhouette of the state of Texas in silver and green trim with the letter \"D\" inside adorns the left sleeve.\n\n===Minor league affiliates===\n[[File:Texas Stars logo.svg|150px|thumb|The [[Texas Stars]], based in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]], are the Stars current [[American Hockey League]] affiliate.]]\nThe Dallas Stars are presently affiliated with two [[minor league]] teams. The [[Texas Stars]] are the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate of the Dallas Stars, who after becoming unaffiliated with the [[Iowa Chops|Iowa Stars]] in 2008, did not have an AHL affiliate for the 2008\u201309 season. The [[Texas Stars]] began play in the AHL in the 2009\u201310 season as an affiliate for Dallas. They are located in [[Cedar Park, Texas]] (northwest of [[Austin]]).\n\nIn addition to their AHL affiliate, the Dallas Stars are also affiliated with the [[Idaho Steelheads]] of the [[ECHL]]. Based in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], the Steelheads have played home games in [[CenturyLink Arena Boise]] since 2003.\n\n===Traditions===\nSince the 2005\u201306 season, the national anthems are performed by Celena Rae, a [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] native and former semi-finalist on ''[[American Idol]]''. During \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the fans yell the word \"stars\" in the lines \"whose broad stripes and bright stars\" and \"O say does that star spangled banner yet wave\".<ref>[http://stars.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=76380 Dallas Stars | Game Personalities - Dallas Stars - Fan Zone].

Members of the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington]] metropolitan area band had become friends with members of the Stars in the 1990s, especially following the team's Stanley Cup win in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hookedonhockeymagazine.com/dallas-stars-and-the-mystery-dent-in-the-stanley-cup/|title=The Dallas Stars and the Mystery Dent in the Stanley Cup|last=Carlton|first=Brendon|website=hookedonhockeymagazine.com|access-date=2017-01-15}}</ref> \"Puck Off\" later also became the team's goal celebration song. During the song, fans chant the only lyrics in the song, \"Dallas! Stars! Dallas! Stars!\" while pumping their fists in the air. After a penalty on the opposing team is announced, Stars public address announcer shouts, \u201cYour Dallas Stars are on...the...\u201d with the fans finishing \u201cpower play!\u201d, immediately after which a clip of the [[Muse (band)|Muse]] song \u201c[[Knights of Cydonia]]\u201d is played. After each Stars win, the [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] (a Dallas native) and [[Double Trouble (band)|Double Trouble]] song \"The House is a Rockin'\" is played. A song of unknown origin called \"The Darkness Music\" is played after nearly every away goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=449894|title=Darkness music a big hit.

The knife has a distinct recurve in the blade. It is used as both a tool and as a weapon in the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the [[Gurkha]]. It is a characteristic weapon of the [[Nepalese Army]], the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] of the [[British Army]], the [[Assam Rifles]], the [[Kumaon Regiment]], the [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garhwal Rifles]], the [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]] of the [[Indian Army]], and of all [[Gurkha]] regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The kukri often appears in [[Nepalese people|Nepalese]] heraldry and is used in many traditional rites such as wedding ceremonies. \n\nA common myth is that a kukri must draw blood before sheathed; in fact they are frequently used as utility tools, extraordinary stories of their use in combat by the Gurkhas may contribute to this misconception<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vcgca.org/our-people/profile/19/rambahadur-limbu|title=The VC and GC Association|last=Association|first=Victoria Cross and George Cross|website=vcgca.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>.

Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in [[Kathmandu]].\n\nThe kukri came to be known to the Western world when the [[East India Company]] came into conflict with the growing [[Gorkha Kingdom]], culminating in the [[Gurkha War]] of 1814\u20131816.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by Irish author [[Bram Stoker]]. Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of a climactic battle between Dracula's bodyguards and the heroes, Mina's narrative describes his throat being sliced through by Jonathan Harker's kukri and his heart pierced by Quincey Morris's [[Bowie knife]].<ref>Stoker, Dacre and Ian Holt (2009).

The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces. Its acclaim was demonstrated in North Africa by one unit's situation report. It reads: \"Enemy losses: ten killed, our nil. Ammunition expenditure nil.\"<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey (1992).

He was reported to have killed three of the bandits, wounded eight more and forced the rest of the band to flee.<ref>[http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=27100 \"Lone Nepali Gorkha who subdued 40 train robbers\"], ''[[Rep\u00fablica (Nepalese newspaper)|Rep\u00fablica]]'', 13 January 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222133313/http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=27100 |date=22 December 2013 }}</ref> A contemporaneous report in the ''[[Times of India]]'', that includes an interview with Shrestha, indicates he was less successful.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata-/Soldier-takes-on-dacoits-on-trainGang-Of-30/articleshow/6488820.cms \"Soldier takes on dacoits on train; Gang Of 30\"], ''[[Times of India]]'', Times News Network, 4 September 2010.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Kukri, karda & chakmak.jpg|thumb|left| A Kukri (Top) with the traditional Karda (middle) and Chakmak (bottom). The Karda and Chakmak are used as a utility knife and a sharpening tool respectively ]]\nThe kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from {{cvt|5|-|10|mm|frac=16}} at the handle, and can taper to {{cvt|2|mm|frac=16}} by the point while the blade lengths can vary from {{cvt|26|-|38|cm}} for general use.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nA kukri designed for general purpose is commonly {{cvt|40|-|45|cm}} in overall length and weighs approximately {{cvt|450|-|900|g|lb|0}}. Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.\n\nAnother factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength, the blade might be hollow forged, or a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including ''tin Chira'' (triple fuller), ''Dui Chira'' (double fuller), ''Ang Khola'' (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large bevelled edge.\n\nKukri blades usually have a notch (''karda'', ''kauda'', ''Gaudi'', ''Kaura'', or ''Cho'') at the base of the blade.

The knife has a distinct recurve in the blade. It is used as both a tool and as a weapon in the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the [[Gurkha]]. It is a characteristic weapon of the [[Nepalese Army]], the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] of the [[British Army]], the [[Assam Rifles]], the [[Kumaon Regiment]], the [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garhwal Rifles]], the [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]] of the [[Indian Army]], and of all [[Gurkha]] regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The kukri often appears in [[Nepalese people|Nepalese]] and [[Indian Gorkha]] heraldry and is used in many traditional rites such as wedding ceremonies. \n\nA common myth is that a kukri must draw blood before sheathed; in fact they are frequently used as utility tools, extraordinary stories of their use in combat by the Gurkhas may contribute to this misconception<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vcgca.org/our-people/profile/19/rambahadur-limbu|title=The VC and GC Association|last=Association|first=Victoria Cross and George Cross|website=vcgca.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>.

The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces.

The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from {{cvt|5|-|10|mm|frac=16}} at the handle, and can taper to {{cvt|2|mm|frac=16}} by the point while the blade lengths can vary from {{cvt|26|-|38|cm}} for general use.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nA kukri designed for general purpose is commonly {{cvt|40|-|45|cm}} in overall length and weighs approximately {{cvt|450|-|900|g|lb|0}}. Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.\n\nAnother factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength, the blade might be hollow forged, or a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including ''tin Chira'' (triple fuller), ''Dui Chira'' (double fuller), ''Ang Khola'' (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large bevelled edge.\n\nKukri blades usually have a notch (''karda'', ''kauda'', ''Gaudi'', ''Kaura'', or ''Cho'') at the base of the blade.

To clarify:\n\n* The chosen rook may be under attack.\n* The rook may move through an attacked square, provided the king does not.  (When castling queenside, the only such square is the one adjacent to the rook.)\n* The king may have been in check earlier in the game, provided the king did not move when resolving the check.\n\nIn [[chess handicap|handicap]] games where odds of a rook are given, the player giving odds may still castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.<ref name=\"Abrahams\">\n{{citation\n | last = Abrahams\n | first = Gerald\n | authorlink = Gerald Abrahams\n | title = Chess\n | publisher = English Universities Press\n | series = Teach Yourself Books\n | year = 1948\n | page = 59\n | isbn =}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\n{{See also|Chess opening|}}\n\nCastling is an important goal in the [[Chess opening|opening]], because it serves two valuable purposes: it often moves the king into a safer position away from the {{chessgloss|center}} of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board. \n\nThe choice as to which side to castle often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer, because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and often all the pawns on the castled side are defended by the king. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and the pawn on the a-{{chessgloss|file}} is undefended; the king is thus often later moved to b1 to defend the a-pawn and to move the king away from the center of the board. In addition, queenside castling requires moving the queen, if not already done; therefore, it may take slightly longer to achieve than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently&nbsp;\u2013 on the central d-file. It is often immediately active, whereas with kingside castling a [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] may be required to move the rook to a more effective square.\n\nIt is common for both players to castle kingside, and rare for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called ''opposite'' (or ''opposite-side'') ''castling''. Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight, as both players' pawns are free to advance to attack the opposing king's castled position without exposing the player's own castled king. An example is the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation, Yugoslav Attack, 9.Bc4|Yugoslav Attack]], in the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defence]].\n\nIf the king is forced to move before it has the opportunity to castle, the player may still wish to maneuver the king towards the edge of the board and the corresponding rook towards the center. When a player takes three or four moves to accomplish what castling would have accomplished in one move, it is sometimes called ''[[artificial castling]]'', or ''castling by hand''.\n\n==Tournament rules==\n{{See also|Rules of chess|Touch-move rule}}\n\nUnder the strict [[touch-move rule]]s enforced in most [[chess tournament|tournaments]], castling is considered a king move. Under current [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules, however, a player who intends to castle and touches the rook first would suffer no penalty, and would be permitted to castle, provided castling is legal in the position. Still, the correct way to castle is to move the king first. As usual, the player may change their mind to another legal destination square for the king until it is released. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player is committed to castling (if it is legal), and the rook must be moved accordingly. A player who performs a forbidden castling must return the king and the rook to their original places and then move the king, if there is another legal king move, including castling on the other side. If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does ''not'' apply to the rook {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13\u201314,17\u201318,23}}.\n\nThe official rules also require that the entire move be completed using only a single hand. Neither of these rules is commonly enforced in casual play, nor commonly known by non-competitive players {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13\u201314,17\u201318,23}}.<ref>[[William Hartston]] notes in ''Teach Yourself Chess'' that \"most chess players refrain from demonstrations of ambidexterity.\"</ref>\n\nThe right to castle must be the same on all three occasions for a valid [[draw (chess)|draw]] claim under the [[threefold repetition]] rule.\n\n==Chess variants and problems==\nSome [[chess variant]]s, for example [[Chess960]], have modified castling rules to handle modified starting positions. Castling can also be adapted to large chess variants, like [[Capablanca Chess]], which is played on a 10\u00d78 board. In [[shogi]], the term ''[[Castle (shogi)|castle]]'' refers to a different concept of building a multi-piece defensive structure that defends the king.\n\nWriting in 2019, former world chess champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] proposed a variation of chess where players wouldn't have the ability to castle.  As the king can no longer castle into safety, this variant would theoretically lead to more dynamic and interesting games as it is much harder to force a draw and your pieces are forced to engage in melee. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/no-castling-chess-kramnik-alphazero|title=Kramnik And AlphaZero: How To Rethink Chess|last=Kramnik (VladimirKramnik)|first=Vladimir|website=Chess.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[chess problem]]s, castling is assumed to be allowed if it appears possible, unless it can be proved by [[retrograde analysis]] that either the king or the chosen rook has previously moved.\n\n==Notable examples==\n* [[Viktor Korchnoi]], in his [[World_Chess_Championship_1975#1974_Candidates_tournament|1974 Candidates final]] match with [[Anatoly Karpov]], famously asked the [[International Arbiter|arbiter]] if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1067831 |title=Korchnoi vs. Karpov, Moscow 1974 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}</ref> The arbiter answered in the affirmative, Korchnoi executed the move, and Karpov resigned shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|title=Castling Confuses Even Grandmasters|date=16 July 1995|author=Larry Evans|authorlink=Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-07-16/entertainment/9507110283_1_rook-anatoly-karpov-castle|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}</ref> <!-- This incident is said to be referenced in Korchnoi's ''Chess is My Life'' -->\n* Three castlings occurred in the game [[Wolfgang Heidenfeld]]\u2013[[Nick Kerins]], Dublin 1973.

There were two forms of the leap: (1) the king would move once like a knight, and (2) the king would move two squares on his first move.  The knight-move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat.  This second form was [[Chess in Europe|played in Europe]] as early as the 13th century.  In North Africa, the king was moved to a safe square by a two-step procedure: (1) the king moved to the second {{chessgloss|rank}}, and (2) the rook moved to the king's original square and the king moved to the rook's original square {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=48}}.\n\nBefore the [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] and [[queen (chess)|queen]] acquired their current moves in the 16th century they were weak pieces and the king was relatively safe in the middle of the board.  When the bishop and queen got their current moves they became very powerful and the king was no longer safe on its original square, since it can be attacked from a distance and from both sides. Castling was added to allow the king to get to a safer location and to allow rooks to get into the game earlier {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=16}}.\n\nThe rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1,<ref>c1, c2, c3, d3, e3, f3, ga, g2, or g3, according to [[H. J. R. Murray]]</ref> if no capture was made, the king was not in check, and did not move over check. (The black king might move similarly.)  In Lombardy, the white king might jump an additional square to b1 or h1 or to a2 (and equivalent squares for the black king). Later in Germany and Italy, the king move was combined with a pawn move.\n\nIn Rome from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king's square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook.

To clarify:\n\n* The chosen rook may be under attack.\n* The rook may move through an attacked square, provided the king does not.  (When castling queenside, the only such square is the one adjacent to the rook.)\n* The king may have been in check earlier in the game, provided the king did not move when resolving the check.\n\nIn [[chess handicap|handicap]] games where odds of a rook are given, the player giving odds may still castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.<ref name=\"Abrahams\">\n{{citation\n | last = Abrahams\n | first = Gerald\n | authorlink = Gerald Abrahams\n | title = Chess\n | publisher = English Universities Press\n | series = Teach Yourself Books\n | year = 1948\n | page = 59\n | isbn =}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\n{{See also|Chess opening|}}\n\nCastling is an important goal in the [[Chess opening|opening]], because it serves two valuable purposes: it often moves the king into a safer position away from the {{chessgloss|center}} of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board. \n\nThe choice as to which side to castle often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer, because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and often all the pawns on the castled side are defended by the king. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and the pawn on the a-{{chessgloss|file}} is undefended; the king is thus often later moved to b1 to defend the a-pawn and to move the king away from the center of the board. In addition, queenside castling requires moving the queen, if not already done; therefore, it may take slightly longer to achieve than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently&nbsp;\u2013 on the central d-file. It is often immediately active, whereas with kingside castling a [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] may be required to move the rook to a more effective square.\n\nIt is common for both players to castle kingside, and rare for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called ''opposite'' (or ''opposite-side'') ''castling''. Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight, as both players' pawns are free to advance to attack the opposing king's castled position without exposing the player's own castled king. An example is the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation, Yugoslav Attack, 9.Bc4|Yugoslav Attack]], in the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defence]].\n\nIf the king is forced to move before it has the opportunity to castle, the player may still wish to maneuver the king towards the edge of the board and the corresponding rook towards the center. When a player takes three or four moves to accomplish what castling would have accomplished in one move, it is sometimes called ''[[artificial castling]]'', or ''castling by hand''.\n\n==Tournament rules==\n{{See also|Rules of chess|Touch-move rule}}\n\nUnder the strict [[touch-move rule]]s enforced in most [[chess tournament|tournaments]], castling is considered a king move. Under current [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules, however, a player who intends to castle and touches the rook first would suffer no penalty, and would be permitted to castle, provided castling is legal in the position. Still, the correct way to castle is to move the king first. As usual, the player may change their mind to another legal destination square for the king until it is released. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player is committed to castling (if it is legal), and the rook must be moved accordingly. A player who performs a forbidden castling must return the king and the rook to their original places and then move the king, if there is another legal king move, including castling on the other side. If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does ''not'' apply to the rook {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13\u201314,17\u201318,23}}.\n\nThe official rules also require that the entire move be completed using only a single hand. Neither of these rules is commonly enforced in casual play, nor commonly known by non-competitive players {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13\u201314,17\u201318,23}}.<ref>[[William Hartston]] notes in ''Teach Yourself Chess'' that \"most chess players refrain from demonstrations of ambidexterity.\"</ref>\n\nThe right to castle must be the same on all three occasions for a valid [[draw (chess)|draw]] claim under the [[threefold repetition]] rule.\n\n==Chess variants and problems==\nSome [[chess variant]]s, for example [[Chess960]], have modified castling rules to handle modified starting positions. Castling can also be adapted to large chess variants, like [[Capablanca Chess]], which is played on a 10\u00d78 board. In [[shogi]], the term ''[[Castle (shogi)|castle]]'' refers to a different concept of building a multi-piece defensive structure that defends the king.\n\nWriting in 2019, former world chess champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] proposed a variation of chess where players wouldn't have the ability to castle.  As the king can no longer castle into safety, this variant would theoretically lead to more dynamic and interesting games as it is much harder to force a draw and your pieces are forced to engage in melee. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/no-castling-chess-kramnik-alphazero|title=Kramnik And AlphaZero: How To Rethink Chess|last=Kramnik (VladimirKramnik)|first=Vladimir|website=Chess.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[chess problem]]s, castling is assumed to be allowed if it appears possible, unless it can be proved by [[retrograde analysis]] that either the king or the chosen rook has previously moved.\n\n==Notable examples==\n* [[Viktor Korchnoi]], in his [[World_Chess_Championship_1975#1974_Candidates_tournament|1974 Candidates final]] match with [[Anatoly Karpov]], famously asked the [[International Arbiter|arbiter]] if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1067831 |title=Korchnoi vs. Karpov, Moscow 1974 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}</ref> The arbiter answered in the affirmative, Korchnoi executed the move, and Karpov resigned shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|title=Castling Confuses Even Grandmasters|date=16 July 1995|author=Larry Evans|authorlink=Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-07-16/entertainment/9507110283_1_rook-anatoly-karpov-castle|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}</ref> <!-- This incident is said to be referenced in Korchnoi's ''Chess is My Life'' -->\n* Three castlings occurred in the game [[Wolfgang Heidenfeld]]\u2013[[Nick Kerins]], Dublin 1973.

There were two forms of the leap: (1) the king would move once like a knight, and (2) the king would move two squares on his first move.  The knight-move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat.  This second form was [[Chess in Europe|played in Europe]] as early as the 13th century.  In North Africa, the king was moved to a safe square by a two-step procedure: (1) the king moved to the second {{chessgloss|rank}}, and (2) the rook moved to the king's original square and the king moved to the rook's original square {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=48}}.\n\nBefore the [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] and [[queen (chess)|queen]] acquired their current moves in the 16th century they were weak pieces and the king was relatively safe in the middle of the board.  When the bishop and queen got their current moves they became very powerful and the king was no longer safe on its original square, since it can be attacked from a distance and from both sides. Castling was added to allow the king to get to a safer location and to allow rooks to get into the game earlier {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=16}}.\n\nThe rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1,<ref>c1, c2, c3, d3, e3, f3, ga, g2, or g3, according to [[H. J. R. Murray]]</ref> if no capture was made, the king was not in check, and did not move over check. (The black king might move similarly.)  In Lombardy, the white king might jump an additional square to b1 or h1 or to a2 (and equivalent squares for the black king). Later in Germany and Italy, the king move was combined with a pawn move.\n\nIn Rome from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king's square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called \"free castling\".\n\nIn the [[G\u00f6ttingen manuscript]] (c. 1500) and a game published by [[Luis Ram\u00edrez de Lucena]] in 1498, castling consisted of two moves: first the rook and then the king.\n\nThe current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and England in 1640 {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=66}}.\n\nIn the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, [[Johann Baptist Allgaier|Johann Allgaier]] introduced the 0-0 notation. He differentiated between \"0-0r\" (r=right) and \"0-0l\" (l=left). The 0-0-0 notation for queenside castling was added in 1837 by [[Aaron Alexandre]].<ref>Stefan B\u00fccker: \"Was bedeutet 0-0?\" (What does 0-0 mean?), in: ''[[Kaissiber]]'', No. 18, 2002, pp.70\u201371</ref> The practice was then accepted in the first edition (1843) of the ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]''.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIn most European languages, castling is known by a derivative from the same root as the English word \"rook\" (e.g. ''rochieren, rochada, enroque''), while the local adjectives meaning \"long\" and \"short\" (or \"big\" and \"small\")  are used in those countries to refer to queenside and kingside castling, respectively.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial castling]]\n* [[Chess notation]]\n** [[Algebraic notation (chess)|Algebraic chess notation]]\n** [[Descriptive chess notation]]\n* [[Outline of chess#Rules of chess|Outline of chess: Rules of chess]]\n* [[Rules of chess]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n|last=Davidson|first=Henry\n|origyear=1949 |year=1981\n|title=A Short History of Chess\n|publisher=McKay\n|isbn= 978-0-679-14550-9}}\n*{{citation\n|last=Evans|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry Evans (chess player)\n|year=1970\n|title=Chess Catechism\n|publisher=Simon and Schuster\n|isbn= 0-671-20491-2}}\n* {{citation\n | last=Hooper | first=David | authorlink=David Vincent Hooper\n | last2=Whyld | first2=Kenneth | authorlink2=Kenneth Whyld\n | year=1992\n | title=[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]\n | edition=2nd\n |contribution=castling\n | publisher=Oxford University Press\n | isbn=0-19-280049-3 }}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Just|first=Tim\n|last2=Burg|first2=Daniel B.\n|year=2003\n|title=U.S. Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess\n|edition=5th\n|publisher=McKay\n|isbn= 0-8129-3559-4}}\n* {{citation\n   | last=Lombardy\n   | first=William\n   | authorlink=William Lombardy\n   | last2=Daniels\n   | first2=David\n   | year=1975\n   | title=Chess Panorama\n   | publisher=Chilton\n   | isbn=0-8019-6078-9\n   | url-access=registration\n   | url=https://archive.org/details/chesspanorama00lomb\n   }}\n*{{citation\n|last=Murray|first=H.
