It encourages the interplay between theorizing and empirical research, in the belief that they should be mutually informative. It is a multidisciplinary peer-reviewed journal which is open to contributions of high quality, from any perspective relevant to the field and from any country. Organization Studies is, in particular, a supranational journal which gives special attention to national and cultural similarities and differences worldwide. This is reflected by its international editorial board and publisher and its collaboration with EGOS, the European Group for Organizational Studies. OS publishes papers that fully or partly draw on empirical data to make their contribution to organization theory and practice.\n\n==Subfields==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Organizational behavior]]\n* [[Organizational culture]]\n* [[Organizational ecology]]\n* [[Organizational learning]]\n* [[Organizational psychology]]\n* [[Organizational theory]]\n\n}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Organizational studies }}\n[[Category:Interdisciplinary subfields of sociology]]\n[[Category:Organizational studies| ]]\n\n{{Sociology-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{About|the discipline|the journal|Organization Studies (journal)}}\n'''Organizational studies''' is \"the examination of how individuals construct [[organizational structure]]s, processes, and practices and how these, in turn, shape social relations and create institutions that ultimately influence people\".<ref>Stewart Clegg, James Russell Bailey, ''International Encyclopedia of Organization Studies'' [http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/organization/d7.xml], Sage Publications, 2008</ref> \n\nOrganizational studies comprise different areas that deal with the different aspects of the organizations, many of the approaches are [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] but [[Critical theory|critical research]] also provide alternative frame for understanding in the field.

His father and mother ran a neighborhood candy store for a brief time, barely getting by. For many years, his father was in the waiters' union and worked as a waiter for weddings and [[bar mitzvahs|''B'nai Mitzvah'']].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nBoth parents were factory workers with limited education when they met and married, and there were no books or magazines in the series of apartments where they raised their children. Zinn's parents introduced him to literature by sending 10 cents plus a coupon to the ''[[New York Post]]'' for each of the 20 volumes of [[Charles Dickens]]' collected works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardzinn.org/about/biography/|title=Biography |website=HowardZinn.org}}</ref> As a young man, Zinn made the acquaintance of several young [[Communists]] from his Brooklyn neighborhood. They invited him to a political rally being held in [[Times Square]]. Despite it being a peaceful rally, mounted police charged the marchers. Zinn was hit and knocked unconscious. This would have a profound effect on his political and social outlook.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHe also studied creative writing at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in a special program established by principal and poet [[Elias Lieberman]].<ref name=\"EdUpdate2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2004/apr04/issue/col_howardzinn.html|title=Education Update - Howard Zinn:-Chronicling Lives from Spelman College to Boston U.|website=Educationupdate.com|accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nZinn initially opposed entry into World War II, influenced by his friends, by the results of the [[Nye Committee]], and by his ongoing reading. However, these feelings shifted as he learned more about fascism and its rise in Europe. The book ''[[Sawdust Caesar]]'' had a particularly large impact through its depiction of Mussolini. Thus, after graduating from high school in 1940, Zinn took the Civil Service exam and became an apprentice [[shipfitter]] in the [[New York Navy Yard]] at the age of 18.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Duberman |first1=Martin |title=Howard Zinn : a life on the left |date=2012 |publisher=New Press |isbn=9781595586780 |pages=9-10 |title-link =Howard Zinn : a life on the left|accessdate=3 April 2020|author-link=Martin Duberman}}</ref> Concerns about low wages and hazardous working conditions compelled Zinn and several other apprentices to form the Apprentice Association. At the time, apprentices were excluded from [[trade unions]] and thus had little bargaining power, to which the Apprentice Association was their answer.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The head organizers of the association, which included Zinn himself, would meet once a week outside of work to discuss strategy and read books that at the time were considered radical. Zinn was the Activities Director for the group.

In 1966, Zinn returned to Royan after which he gave his fullest account of that research in his book, ''The Politics of History''. On the ground, Zinn learned that the aerial bombing attacks in which he participated had killed more than a thousand French civilians as well as some German soldiers hiding near Royan to await the war's end, events that are described \"in all accounts\" he found as ''\"une tragique erreur\"'' that leveled a small but ancient city and \"its population that was, at least officially, friend, not foe.\" In ''The Politics of History'', Zinn described how the bombing was ordered\u2014three weeks before the war in Europe ended\u2014by military officials who were, in part, motivated more by the desire for their own career advancement than in legitimate military objectives. He quotes the official history of the U.S. Army Air Forces' brief reference to the [[Eighth Air Force]] attack on Royan and also, in the same chapter, to the bombing of [[Plze\u0148]] in what was then [[Czechoslovakia]]. The official history stated that the [[\u0160koda Works|Skoda]] works in Pilsen \"received 500 well-placed tons,\" and that \"because of a warning sent out ahead of time the workers were able to escape, except for five persons.\"The Americans received a rapturous welcome when they liberated the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dspace5.zcu.cz/bitstream/11025/11417/1/Misterova.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Reception of the Presence of the U.S. Army in Pilsen in 1945 in Local Periodicals |website=Dspace5.zcu.cz |accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nZinn wrote:<blockquote>I recalled flying on that mission, too, as deputy lead bombardier, and that we did not aim specifically at the 'Skoda works' (which I would have noted, because it was the one target in Czechoslovakia I had read about) but dropped our bombs, without much precision, on the city of Pilsen. Two Czech citizens who lived in Pilsen at the time told me, recently, that several hundred people were killed in that raid (that is, Czechs)\u2014not five.<ref>''The Politics of History'' p. 260.</ref></blockquote>\n\nZinn said his experience as a wartime bombardier, combined with his research into the reasons for, and effects of the bombing of Royan and Pilsen, sensitized him to the ethical dilemmas faced by [[GI (military)|G.I.s]] during wartime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://progressive.org/mag_zinn0106 |title=Interview with Zinn |website=Progressive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> Zinn questioned the justifications for military operations that inflicted massive civilian casualties during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing of cities such as [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]], Royan, [[Bombing of Tokyo|Tokyo]], and [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in World War II, [[Hanoi]] during the [[War in Vietnam]], and [[Baghdad]] during the war in [[Iraq]] and the civilian casualties during bombings in [[Afghanistan]] during the current war there.

The claim was that it was a military target, housing a communications center, but reporters going through the ruins immediately afterward said there was no sign of anything like that. I suggest that the history of bombing\u2014and no one has bombed more than this nation\u2014is a history of endless atrocities, all calmly explained by deceptive and deadly language like 'accident', 'military target', and '[[collateral damage]]'.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zinn |first=Howard |url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/01/28-7 |title=\"A Just Cause, Not a Just War\" ''The Progressive'' December 2001 |website=Commondreams.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Education===\nAfter World War II, Zinn attended [[New York University]] on the [[GI Bill]], graduating with a B.A. in 1951.

His master's thesis examined the [[Ludlow massacre|Colorado coal strikes of 1914]].<ref name=\"EdUpdate2004\"/> His [[doctoral dissertation]] ''LaGuardia in Congress'' was a study of [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s congressional career, and it depicted \"the conscience of the twenties\" as LaGuardia fought for public power, the right to strike, and the redistribution of wealth by taxation. \"His specific legislative program,\" Zinn wrote, \"was an astonishingly accurate preview of the [[New Deal]].\" It was published by the [[Cornell University]] Press for the [[American Historical Association]]. ''LaGuardia in Congress'' was nominated for the [[American Historical Association]]'s [[Beveridge Award|Beveridge Prize]] as the best English-language book on American history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29zinn.html|title=Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87|date=29 January 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nHis professors at Columbia included [[Harry Carman]], [[Henry Steele Commager]], and [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]].<ref name=\"EdUpdate2004\"/> But it was Columbia historian [[Richard Hofstadter]]'s ''[[The American Political Tradition]]'' that made the most lasting impression. Zinn regularly included it in his lists of recommended readings, and, after [[Barack Obama]] was elected [[President of the United States]], Zinn wrote, \"If Richard Hofstadter were adding to his book ''The American Political Tradition'', in which he found both 'conservative' and 'liberal' Presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, maintaining for dear life the two critical characteristics of the American system, nationalism and capitalism, Obama would fit the pattern.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialistworker.org/2008/11/05/what-next-for-the-struggle|title=What next for struggle in the Obama era?|website=SocialistWorker.org|accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960\u201361, Zinn was a [[post-doctoral]] fellow in [[East Asian Studies]] at [[Harvard University]].\n\n===Academic career===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"We were not born critical of existing society.

His classes in [[civil liberties]] were among the most popular at the university with as many as 400 students subscribing each semester to the non-required class. A professor of [[political science]], he taught at BU for 24 years and retired in 1988 at age 66.\n\n\"He had a deep sense of fairness and justice for the underdog. But he always kept his sense of humor. He was a happy warrior,\" said Caryl Rivers, [[journalism]] professor at BU.

Biographer [[Martin Duberman]] noted that when he was asked directly if he was a Marxist, Zinn replied, \"Yes, I'm something of a Marxist.\" He especially was influenced by the liberating vision of the young Marx in overcoming alienation, and disliked what he perceived to be Marx's later dogmatism. In later life he moved more toward [[anarchism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|page=199|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote a history text, ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', to provide other perspectives on American history.

The ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' stated in 2006 that the book \"routinely sells more than 100,000 copies a year.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/books/review/30donadio.html \"Backlist to the Future\"] by Rachel Donadio, July 30, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Zinn published ''[[Voices of a People's History of the United States]]'' with Anthony Arnove. ''Voices'' is a sourcebook of speeches, articles, essays, poetry and song lyrics by the people themselves whose stories are told in ''A People's History.''\n\nIn 2008, the [[Teaching for Change#Zinn Education Project|Zinn Education Project]]<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.zinnedproject.org/|title=Zinn Education Project: Teaching People's History|website=Zinnedproject.org|accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref> was launched to support educators using ''A People's History of the United States'' as a source for middle and high school history. The project was started when a former student of Zinn, who wanted to bring Zinn's lessons to students around the country, provided the financial backing to allow two other organizations, Rethinking Schools and [[Teaching for Change]] to coordinate the project. The project hosts a website with hundreds of free downloadable lesson plans to complement ''A People's History of the United States''.\n\n''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', released in 2010, is a documentary movie based on ''A People's History of the United States'' and inspired by the lives of ordinary people who fought back against oppressive conditions over the course of the history of the United States.

Up until then many of the volunteers had been dropping out of school so they could continue their work with SNCC. Other volunteers had not spent much time in college. The program had been endorsed by SNCC in December 1963 and was envisioned by Zinn as having a curriculum that ranged from novels to books about \"major currents\" in 20th-century world history-such as fascism, communism, and anti-colonial movements. This occurred while Zinn was in Boston.<ref name=\"Martin Duberman 2012 98\">{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|page=98|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>\n\nZinn also attended an assortment of SNCC meetings in 1964, traveling back and forth from Boston. One of those trips was to Hattiesburg, MS, in January, 1964 to participate in a SNCC voter registration drive. The local newspaper the ''''Hattiesburg American'', described the SNCC volunteers in town for the voter registration drive as \"outside agitators\" and told local blacks \"to ignore whatever goes on, and interfere in no way...\"At a mass meeting held during the visit to Hattiesburg, Zinn and another SNCC representative, Ella Baker, emphasized the risks that went along with their efforts, a subject probably in their minds since a well-known civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, had been murdered getting out of his car in the driveway of his home in Jackson, MS only 6 months earlier. Evers had been the state field secretary for the NAACP.<ref name=\"Martin Duberman 2012 98\"/>\n\nZinn was also involved in what became known as \"Freedom Summer\" in Mississippi in the summer of 1964. Freedom Summer involved bringing 1,000 college students to Mississippi to work for the summer in various roles as civil rights activists. Part of the program involved organizing \"Freedom Schools.\"\nZinn's involvement included helping develop the curriculum for the Freedom Schools. Zinn was also concerned that bringing 1,000 college students to Mississippi to work as civil rights activists could lead to violence and killings. As a consequence, Zinn recommended approaching Mississippi Governor, Ross Barnett, and President Lyndon Johnson to request protection for the young civil rights volunteers. Protection was not forthcoming. Planning for the summer went forward under the umbrella of SNCC, the Congress of Racial Equality (\"CORE\") and the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO\").<ref name=\"Martin Duberman 2012 99\u2013100\">{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|pages=99\u2013100|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>\n\nZinn's concerns about violence, etc., during Freedom Summer were proven to be well founded. On June 20, 1964, just as civil rights activists were beginning to arrive in Mississippi, a Neshoba County, MS, sheriff's deputy pulled over a car for a traffic violation and then arrested and took into custody the three young civil rights activists in the car, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner. After being arrested, all three were then released and apparently began heading back to nearby Meridian, only to be pulled over by two carloads of KKK (Ku Klux Klan) members. None of the three was heard from again until their bodies were found in an earthen dam two months later. They had been murdered and the only black among the three, James Chaney, had been mutilated.<ref name=\"Martin Duberman 2012 99\u2013100\"/> Zinn and other representatives of SNCC attended a later memorial service for the three murdered civil rights workers. The service was held at the ruins of the Mount Zion Baptist Church, the burning of which Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner had gone to investigate before they were pulled over and arrested in Neshoba County.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|pages=101\u2013102|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>\n\nZinn collaborated with historian [[Staughton Lynd]] mentoring student activists, among them [[Alice Walker]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/01/31/alice_walker_says_goodbye_to_her_friend_howard_zinn/|title=Alice Walker says goodbye to her friend Howard Zinn - The Boston Globe|website=Boston.com}}</ref> who would later write ''[[The Color Purple]],'' and [[Marian Wright Edelman]], founder and president of the [[Children's Defense Fund]].

Zinn's years at Spelman are recounted in his autobiography ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times''. His seven years at Spelman College, Zinn said, \"are probably the most interesting, exciting, most educational years for me.

In the 2001 film ''[[Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent]]'', Zinn provides a historical context for the 1971 anti-war march by [[Vietnam Veterans against the War]].

In an interview with ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'' he said, <blockquote>We certainly should not be initiating a war, as it's not a clear and present danger to the United States, or in fact, to anyone around it. If it were, then the states around Iraq would be calling for a war on it. The Arab states around Iraq are opposed to the war, and if anyone's in danger from Iraq, they are. At the same time, the U.S. is violating the U.N. charter by initiating a war on Iraq. Bush made a big deal about the number of resolutions Iraq has violated\u2014and it's true, Iraq has not abided by the resolutions of the Security Council. But it's not the first nation to violate Security Council resolutions. Israel has violated Security Council resolutions every year since 1967. Now, however, the U.S. is violating a fundamental principle of the U.N. Charter, which is that nations can't initiate a war\u2014they can only do so after being attacked.

His father and mother ran a neighborhood candy store for a brief time, barely getting by. For many years, his father was in the waiters' union and worked as a waiter for weddings and [[bar mitzvahs|''B'nai Mitzvah'']].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nBoth parents were factory workers with limited education when they met and married, and there were no books or magazines in the series of apartments where they raised their children. Zinn's parents introduced him to literature by sending 10 cents plus a coupon to the ''[[New York Post]]'' for each of the 20 volumes of [[Charles Dickens]]' collected works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardzinn.org/about/biography/|title=Biography |website=HowardZinn.org}}</ref> As a young man, Zinn made the acquaintance of several young [[Communists]] from his Brooklyn neighborhood. They invited him to a political rally being held in [[Times Square]]. Despite it being a peaceful rally, mounted police charged the marchers. Zinn was hit and knocked unconscious. This would have a profound effect on his political and social outlook.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHe also studied creative writing at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in a special program established by principal and poet [[Elias Lieberman]].<ref name=\"EdUpdate2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2004/apr04/issue/col_howardzinn.html|title=Education Update - Howard Zinn:-Chronicling Lives from Spelman College to Boston U.|website=Educationupdate.com|accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nZinn initially opposed entry into World War II, influenced by his friends, by the results of the [[Nye Committee]], and by his ongoing reading. However, these feelings shifted as he learned more about fascism and its rise in Europe. The book ''[[Sawdust Caesar]]'' had a particularly large impact through its depiction of Mussolini. Thus, after graduating from high school in 1940, Zinn took the Civil Service exam and became an apprentice [[shipfitter]] in the [[New York Navy Yard]] at the age of 18.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Duberman |first1=Martin |title=Howard Zinn : a life on the left |date=2012 |publisher=New Press |isbn=9781595586780 |pages=9-10 |title-link =Howard Zinn : a life on the left|accessdate=3 April 2020|author-link=Martin Duberman}}</ref> Concerns about low wages and hazardous working conditions compelled Zinn and several other apprentices to form the Apprentice Association. At the time, apprentices were excluded from [[trade unions]] and thus had little bargaining power, to which the Apprentice Association was their answer.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The head organizers of the association, which included Zinn himself, would meet once a week outside of work to discuss strategy and read books that at the time were considered radical. Zinn was the Activities Director for the group.

In 1966, Zinn returned to Royan after which he gave his fullest account of that research in his book, ''The Politics of History''. On the ground, Zinn learned that the aerial bombing attacks in which he participated had killed more than a thousand French civilians as well as some German soldiers hiding near Royan to await the war's end, events that are described \"in all accounts\" he found as ''\"une tragique erreur\"'' that leveled a small but ancient city and \"its population that was, at least officially, friend, not foe.\" In ''The Politics of History'', Zinn described how the bombing was ordered\u2014three weeks before the war in Europe ended\u2014by military officials who were, in part, motivated more by the desire for their own career advancement than in legitimate military objectives. He quotes the official history of the U.S. Army Air Forces' brief reference to the [[Eighth Air Force]] attack on Royan and also, in the same chapter, to the bombing of [[Plze\u0148]] in what was then [[Czechoslovakia]]. The official history stated that the [[\u0160koda Works|Skoda]] works in Pilsen \"received 500 well-placed tons,\" and that \"because of a warning sent out ahead of time the workers were able to escape, except for five persons.\"The Americans received a rapturous welcome when they liberated the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dspace5.zcu.cz/bitstream/11025/11417/1/Misterova.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Reception of the Presence of the U.S. Army in Pilsen in 1945 in Local Periodicals |website=Dspace5.zcu.cz |accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nZinn wrote:<blockquote>I recalled flying on that mission, too, as deputy lead bombardier, and that we did not aim specifically at the 'Skoda works' (which I would have noted, because it was the one target in Czechoslovakia I had read about) but dropped our bombs, without much precision, on the city of Pilsen. Two Czech citizens who lived in Pilsen at the time told me, recently, that several hundred people were killed in that raid (that is, Czechs)\u2014not five.<ref>''The Politics of History'' p. 260.</ref></blockquote>\n\nZinn said his experience as a wartime bombardier, combined with his research into the reasons for, and effects of the bombing of Royan and Pilsen, sensitized him to the ethical dilemmas faced by [[GI (military)|G.I.s]] during wartime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://progressive.org/mag_zinn0106 |title=Interview with Zinn |website=Progressive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> Zinn questioned the justifications for military operations that inflicted massive civilian casualties during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing of cities such as [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]], Royan, [[Bombing of Tokyo|Tokyo]], and [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in World War II, [[Hanoi]] during the [[War in Vietnam]], and [[Baghdad]] during the war in [[Iraq]] and the civilian casualties during bombings in [[Afghanistan]] during the current war there.

The claim was that it was a military target, housing a communications center, but reporters going through the ruins immediately afterward said there was no sign of anything like that. I suggest that the history of bombing\u2014and no one has bombed more than this nation\u2014is a history of endless atrocities, all calmly explained by deceptive and deadly language like 'accident', 'military target', and '[[collateral damage]]'.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zinn |first=Howard |url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/01/28-7 |title=\"A Just Cause, Not a Just War\" ''The Progressive'' December 2001 |website=Commondreams.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Education===\nAfter World War II, Zinn attended [[New York University]] on the [[GI Bill]], graduating with a B.A. in 1951. At [[Columbia University]], he earned an M.A. (1952) and a Ph.D. in history with a minor in political science (1958). His master's thesis examined the [[Ludlow massacre|Colorado coal strikes of 1914]].<ref name=\"EdUpdate2004\"/> His [[doctoral dissertation]] ''LaGuardia in Congress'' was a study of [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s congressional career, and it depicted \"the conscience of the twenties\" as LaGuardia fought for public power, the right to strike, and the redistribution of wealth by taxation. \"His specific legislative program,\" Zinn wrote, \"was an astonishingly accurate preview of the [[New Deal]].\" It was published by the [[Cornell University]] Press for the [[American Historical Association]]. ''LaGuardia in Congress'' was nominated for the [[American Historical Association]]'s [[Beveridge Award|Beveridge Prize]] as the best English-language book on American history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29zinn.html|title=Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87|date=29 January 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nHis professors at Columbia included [[Harry Carman]], [[Henry Steele Commager]], and [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]].<ref name=\"EdUpdate2004\"/> But it was Columbia historian [[Richard Hofstadter]]'s ''[[The American Political Tradition]]'' that made the most lasting impression. Zinn regularly included it in his lists of recommended readings, and, after [[Barack Obama]] was elected [[President of the United States]], Zinn wrote, \"If Richard Hofstadter were adding to his book ''The American Political Tradition'', in which he found both 'conservative' and 'liberal' Presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, maintaining for dear life the two critical characteristics of the American system, nationalism and capitalism, Obama would fit the pattern.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialistworker.org/2008/11/05/what-next-for-the-struggle|title=What next for struggle in the Obama era?|website=SocialistWorker.org|accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960\u201361, Zinn was a [[post-doctoral]] fellow in [[East Asian Studies]] at [[Harvard University]].\n\n===Academic career===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"We were not born critical of existing society.

Biographer [[Martin Duberman]] noted that when he was asked directly if he was a Marxist, Zinn replied, \"Yes, I'm something of a Marxist.\" He especially was influenced by the liberating vision of the young Marx in overcoming alienation, and disliked what he perceived to be Marx's later dogmatism. In later life he moved more toward [[anarchism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|page=199|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote a history text, ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', to provide other perspectives on American history. The book depicts the struggles of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] against European and U.S. conquest and expansion, slaves against [[slavery]], unionists and other workers against capitalists, women against [[patriarchy]], and African-Americans for [[civil rights]].

''Voices'' is a sourcebook of speeches, articles, essays, poetry and song lyrics by the people themselves whose stories are told in ''A People's History.''\n\nIn 2008, the [[Teaching for Change#Zinn Education Project|Zinn Education Project]]<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.zinnedproject.org/|title=Zinn Education Project: Teaching People's History|website=Zinnedproject.org|accessdate=2020-04-07}}</ref> was launched to support educators using ''A People's History of the United States'' as a source for middle and high school history. The project was started when a former student of Zinn, who wanted to bring Zinn's lessons to students around the country, provided the financial backing to allow two other organizations, Rethinking Schools and [[Teaching for Change]] to coordinate the project. The project hosts a website with hundreds of free downloadable lesson plans to complement ''A People's History of the United States''.\n\n''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', released in 2010, is a documentary movie based on ''A People's History of the United States'' and inspired by the lives of ordinary people who fought back against oppressive conditions over the course of the history of the United States.

Up until then many of the volunteers had been dropping out of school so they could continue their work with SNCC. Other volunteers had not spent much time in college. The program had been endorsed by SNCC in December 1963 and was envisioned by Zinn as having a curriculum that ranged from novels to books about \"major currents\" in 20th-century world history-such as fascism, communism, and anti-colonial movements. This occurred while Zinn was in Boston.<ref name=\"Martin Duberman 2012 98\">{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|page=98|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>\n\nZinn also attended an assortment of SNCC meetings in 1964, traveling back and forth from Boston. One of those trips was to Hattiesburg, MS, in January, 1964 to participate in a SNCC voter registration drive. The local newspaper the ''''Hattiesburg American'', described the SNCC volunteers in town for the voter registration drive as \"outside agitators\" and told local blacks \"to ignore whatever goes on, and interfere in no way...\"At a mass meeting held during the visit to Hattiesburg, Zinn and another SNCC representative, Ella Baker, emphasized the risks that went along with their efforts, a subject probably in their minds since a well-known civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, had been murdered getting out of his car in the driveway of his home in Jackson, MS only 6 months earlier. Evers had been the state field secretary for the NAACP.<ref name=\"Martin Duberman 2012 98\"/>\n\nZinn was also involved in what became known as \"Freedom Summer\" in Mississippi in the summer of 1964. Freedom Summer involved bringing 1,000 college students to Mississippi to work for the summer in various roles as civil rights activists. Part of the program involved organizing \"Freedom Schools.\"\nZinn's involvement included helping develop the curriculum for the Freedom Schools. Zinn was also concerned that bringing 1,000 college students to Mississippi to work as civil rights activists could lead to violence and killings. As a consequence, Zinn recommended approaching Mississippi Governor, Ross Barnett, and President Lyndon Johnson to request protection for the young civil rights volunteers. Protection was not forthcoming. Planning for the summer went forward under the umbrella of SNCC, the Congress of Racial Equality (\"CORE\") and the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO\").<ref name=\"Martin Duberman 2012 99\u2013100\">{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|pages=99\u2013100|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>\n\nZinn's concerns about violence, etc., during Freedom Summer were proven to be well founded. On June 20, 1964, just as civil rights activists were beginning to arrive in Mississippi, a Neshoba County, MS, sheriff's deputy pulled over a car for a traffic violation and then arrested and took into custody the three young civil rights activists in the car, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner. After being arrested, all three were then released and apparently began heading back to nearby Meridian, only to be pulled over by two carloads of KKK (Ku Klux Klan) members. None of the three was heard from again until their bodies were found in an earthen dam two months later. They had been murdered and the only black among the three, James Chaney, had been mutilated.<ref name=\"Martin Duberman 2012 99\u2013100\"/> Zinn and other representatives of SNCC attended a later memorial service for the three murdered civil rights workers. The service was held at the ruins of the Mount Zion Baptist Church, the burning of which Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner had gone to investigate before they were pulled over and arrested in Neshoba County.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|pages=101\u2013102|isbn=9781595588401}}</ref>\n\nZinn collaborated with historian [[Staughton Lynd]] mentoring student activists, among them [[Alice Walker]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/01/31/alice_walker_says_goodbye_to_her_friend_howard_zinn/|title=Alice Walker says goodbye to her friend Howard Zinn - The Boston Globe|website=Boston.com}}</ref> who would later write ''[[The Color Purple]],'' and [[Marian Wright Edelman]], founder and president of the [[Children's Defense Fund]].

Zinn's years at Spelman are recounted in his autobiography ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times''. His seven years at Spelman College, Zinn said, \"are probably the most interesting, exciting, most educational years for me.

If it were, then the states around Iraq would be calling for a war on it. The Arab states around Iraq are opposed to the war, and if anyone's in danger from Iraq, they are.

A contingent of rebels, under Colonel Mariano Santiago, had captured the station.  MBS-4 was put back on the air shortly after noon, with [[Orly Punzalan]] announcing on live television, \"Channel 4 is on the air again to serve the people.\" By this time, the crowds at EDSA had swollen to over a million. (Some estimates placed them at two million.)<ref name=\"peoplepower_eyewitness\" />\n\nThis broadcast was considered the \"return\" of [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] on air because this was the time when former employees of the network were inside the complex after 14 years of closure since Marcos took it over during the Martial Law of 1972. [[DZRJ-AM|\"Radyo Bandido\"]] ended broadcasting that afternoon, while Radio Veritas resumed transmissions, this time from the [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center|Broadcast Plaza]]'s radio studios.\n\nIn the late afternoon, rebel helicopters attacked [[Villamor Airbase]], destroying presidential air assets. Another helicopter went to [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace|Malaca\u00f1ang]], fired a rocket, and caused minor damage. Later, most of the officers who had graduated from the [[Philippine Military Academy]] (PMA) defected.

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]), \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\". The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019.

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]), \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\". The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019. Among the [[List of awards and nominations received by Sia|accolades]] received by Sia are nearly a dozen [[ARIA Awards]], 9 [[Grammy Award]] nominations, and an [[MTV Video Music Award]].<ref name=ARIA2014>{{cite web| url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/40788/Chet-Faker-and-Violent-Soho-lead-20sheeran14-ARIA-nominations|title=Chet Faker and Violent Soholead 2014 ARIA nominations|publisher=fasterlouder|accessdate=5 November 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===1975\u20131997: Early life and career beginnings===\nSia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in [[Adelaide]], South Australia.

They are the first installments in the seventh generation of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]]. First announced in February 2016, ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' were released worldwide on November 18, 2016,<!-- Generalize the release dates in the lead, per WP:VG/DATE. --> commemorating [[Pok\u00e9mon|the franchise]]'s 20th anniversary. Two follow-up games, [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Moon'']], were released for the same consoles on November 17, 2017.\n\nThe titles began development following completion of [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']], with increased emphasis on Pok\u00e9mon interactions. Like previous installments, they follow the journey of a young Pok\u00e9mon trainer, taking place in the Alola region\u2014based on [[Hawaii]]\u2014with the objective of the games being to complete the island challenge and thwart the schemes of Team Skull, and later the Aether Foundation, all while attempting to challenge various Pok\u00e9mon trainers of gradually increasing difficulty. ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' introduced [[List of generation VII Pok\u00e9mon|81 new Pok\u00e9mon]] species, and new features such as Alolan forms of previous generation Pok\u00e9mon, powerful moves known as Z-Moves, alien creatures known as Ultra Beasts, updated battle and training mechanics, and improved [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal 3D graphics]]. While largely independent of one another, the two games follow a similar plot, and while each can be played separately, trading Pok\u00e9mon between the two games is necessary to complete the Pok\u00e9dex, just like in previous installments.\n\nThe games received generally favorable reviews from critics, who welcomed the change from the formula used by prior ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games and praised the gameplay of ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' while criticizing the lack of content beyond the primary plot. Upon release, the games became one of the fastest-selling games in Nintendo's history. To date, ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' have sold over 16 million copies worldwide, making them the third-best-selling Nintendo 3DS titles, after ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'' and their predecessors, [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements, set in the fictional Alola region (loosely based on Hawaii),<ref name=\"weknow\">{{cite news |last1=Alexander |first1=Julia |title=Pok\u00e9mon Moon and Sun: Everything we know |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/6/14/11936306/pokemon-moon-and-sun-everything-we-know |accessdate=5 July 2019 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=14 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705212911/https://www.polygon.com/2016/6/14/11936306/pokemon-moon-and-sun-everything-we-know |archive-date=July 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> presented in a [[Grammatical person#Use of grammatical person in creative media|third-person]], [[overhead perspective]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Minotti |first1=Mike |title=Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon make a good first impression with their formula-shaking tweaks |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/11/17/pokemon-sun-and-moon-make-a-good-first-impression-with-their-formula-shaking-tweaks/ |accessdate=5 July 2019 |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=17 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705212913/https://venturebeat.com/2016/11/17/pokemon-sun-and-moon-make-a-good-first-impression-with-their-formula-shaking-tweaks/ |archive-date=July 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player controls a young trainer who goes on a quest to catch and train creatures known as Pok\u00e9mon, and win battles against other trainers.<ref name=\"weknow\"/> By defeating opposing Pok\u00e9mon in turn-based battles, the player's Pok\u00e9mon gains [[experience points|experience]], allowing them to level up and increase their battle statistics, learn new battle techniques, and in some cases, [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into more powerful Pok\u00e9mon.

After meeting Lillie and rescuing her special Pok\u00e9mon she calls Nebby, the player obtains a starter Pok\u00e9mon from local Professor, Kukui, and embark on the island challenge, a [[coming-of-age]] custom spanning trials across Alola, along with local youngster Hau. Unlike in previous games, trials involve battles with powered-up Pok\u00e9mon followed by battles with each island's Kahuna upon completion of an island's trials. Throughout this the player encounters Team Skull, a gang of people who quit the island trials whose members include their leader Guzma and enforcer Gladion. The player will also encounter the Aether Foundation, an organization aiming to shelter Pok\u00e9mon from various threats.\n\nDuring a visit to Aether Foundation's base, Aether Paradise\u2014a [[very large floating structure]]\u2014, a mysterious creature called an Ultra Beast emerges from a wormhole but retreats before it could be defeated or captured. Later, after the player has defeated Team Skull at their base, Gladion reveals that Team Skull had been working for Aether Foundation, kidnapping Nebby to use its powers in summoning Ultra Beasts. The player then proceeds to battle through Aether Paradise with Hau and Gladion's help, eventually defeating Aether president Lusamine, who is revealed to be Gladion and Lillie's mother. Despite this, Lusamine and Guzma manage to open an Ultra Wormhole, with the former overclocking Nebby's powers, transporting them to Ultra Space (the Ultra Beasts' dimension). This causes Nebby to evolve into a cocoon-like form while Ultra Beasts are unleashed on to Alola's islands, forcing the island Kahunas and [[guardian deity|guardian deities]] to fight them.\n\nProceeding to the final island, the player and Lillie perform a ritual to evolve Nebby into its final form \u2014 Solgaleo or Lunala depending on the version \u2014 at the island's Altar.{{efn|Nebby evolves into Solgaleo at the Altar of the Sunne in ''Sun''; in ''Moon'' it evolves into Lunala at the Altar of the Moone}} With Nebby's newfound power, the player and Lillie travel to Ultra Space and find Lusamine who, not wanting to be rescued, allows herself to be taken over by the Ultra Beast they encountered earlier, forcing the player to battle her in self-defense. After defeating the crazed Lusamine, the player returns to Alola and ascends Mount Lanakila to challenge the newly-formed Alola Pok\u00e9mon League Elite Four. In the last match, they defeat Kukui to become Alola's first Pok\u00e9mon League champion. In the credits, the player battles Melemele's guardian deity [[Tapu Koko]] after a celebration, with Lillie and Lusamine departing Alola for Kanto the following day.\n\nAfter becoming the champion, the player is contacted by two members of the International Police: Anabel (who was head of the Battle Tower in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'') and Looker (a side character from Pok\u00e9mon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum).

They are the first installments in the seventh generation of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]]. First announced in February 2016, ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' were released worldwide on November 18, 2016,<!-- Generalize the release dates in the lead, per WP:VG/DATE. --> commemorating [[Pok\u00e9mon|the franchise]]'s 20th anniversary. Two follow-up games, [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Moon'']], were released for the same consoles on November 17, 2017.\n\nThe titles began development following completion of [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']], with increased emphasis on Pok\u00e9mon interactions. Like previous installments, they follow the journey of a young Pok\u00e9mon trainer, taking place in the Alola region\u2014based on [[Hawaii]]\u2014with the objective of the games being to complete the island challenge and thwart the schemes of Team Skull, and later the Aether Foundation, all while attempting to challenge various Pok\u00e9mon trainers of gradually increasing difficulty. ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' introduced [[List of generation VII Pok\u00e9mon|81 new Pok\u00e9mon]] species, and new features such as Alolan forms of previous generation Pok\u00e9mon, powerful moves known as Z-Moves, alien creatures known as Ultra Beasts, updated battle and training mechanics, and improved [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal 3D graphics]]. While largely independent of one another, the two games follow a similar plot, and while each can be played separately, trading Pok\u00e9mon between the two games is necessary to complete the Pok\u00e9dex, just like in previous installments.\n\nThe games received generally favorable reviews from critics, who welcomed the change from the formula used by prior ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games and praised the gameplay of ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' while criticizing the lack of content beyond the primary plot. Upon release, the games became one of the fastest-selling games in Nintendo's history.

Throughout this the player encounters Team Skull, a gang of people who quit the island trials whose members include their leader Guzma and enforcer Gladion. The player will also encounter the Aether Foundation, an organization aiming to shelter Pok\u00e9mon from various threats.\n\nDuring a visit to Aether Foundation's base, Aether Paradise\u2014a [[very large floating structure]]\u2014, a mysterious creature called an Ultra Beast emerges from a wormhole but retreats before it could be defeated or captured. Later, after the player has defeated Team Skull at their base, Gladion reveals that Team Skull had been working for Aether Foundation, kidnapping Nebby to use its powers in summoning Ultra Beasts. The player then proceeds to battle through Aether Paradise with Hau and Gladion's help, eventually defeating Aether president Lusamine, who is revealed to be Gladion and Lillie's mother. Despite this, Lusamine and Guzma manage to open an Ultra Wormhole, with the former overclocking Nebby's powers, transporting them to Ultra Space (the Ultra Beasts' dimension). This causes Nebby to evolve into a cocoon-like form while Ultra Beasts are unleashed on to Alola's islands, forcing the island Kahunas and [[guardian deity|guardian deities]] to fight them.\n\nProceeding to the final island, the player and Lillie perform a ritual to evolve Nebby into its final form \u2014 Solgaleo or Lunala depending on the version \u2014 at the island's Altar.{{efn|Nebby evolves into Solgaleo at the Altar of the Sunne in ''Sun''; in ''Moon'' it evolves into Lunala at the Altar of the Moone}} With Nebby's newfound power, the player and Lillie travel to Ultra Space and find Lusamine who, not wanting to be rescued, allows herself to be taken over by the Ultra Beast they encountered earlier, forcing the player to battle her in self-defense. After defeating the crazed Lusamine, the player returns to Alola and ascends Mount Lanakila to challenge the newly-formed Alola Pok\u00e9mon League Elite Four. In the last match, they defeat Kukui to become Alola's first Pok\u00e9mon League champion. In the credits, the player battles Melemele's guardian deity [[Tapu Koko]] after a celebration, with Lillie and Lusamine departing Alola for Kanto the following day.\n\nAfter becoming the champion, the player is contacted by two members of the International Police: Anabel (who was head of the Battle Tower in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'') and Looker (a side character from Pok\u00e9mon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum). The player assists the two with handling the wild Ultra Beasts that Lusamine let loose into Alola in a series of quests.{{efn|Ultra Beasts featured are Buzzwole and Kartana in ''Sun'', with Pheromosa and Celesteela in ''Moon''}} Following the final quest, Looker reveals that he saw another Ultra Beast, although Anabel dismisses this. If the player then travels to Ten Carat Hill, they will encounter [[Necrozma]].\n\n==Development==\nGame director Shigeru Ohmori stated that the choice of ''Sun'' and ''Moon'' as title was inspired by the two celestial bodies\u2019 metaphorical representation of human relationships.<ref name=\"timeint\"/> Hawaii was chosen as the basis for the game's region following the title's determination, due to its clear nights and plentiful sunshine.<ref name=\"noeint\">{{cite news|title=Learn all about Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Pok\u00e9mon Moon in our in-depth interview|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/News/2016/October/Learn-all-about-Pokemon-Sun-and-Pokemon-Moon-in-our-in-depth-interview-1149779.html|accessdate=December 27, 2017|work=Nintendo of Europe GmbH}}</ref> Development started immediately after ''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'' was completed and Ohmori kept his game director position.

Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the [[Romantic poetry|poetry]] and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. What he called his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic works]] were said by 20th-century critic [[Northrop Frye]] to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\".<ref>Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D.

The Nonesuch Press, 1927. p. 167.</ref>\n\nAlthough Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as \"Pre-Romantic\".<ref>''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge''. 2004, p. 351.</ref> A committed Christian who was hostile to the [[Church of England]] (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s.<ref>Blake, William.

Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, \"upon which he fell with terrific Violence\".<ref>Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick.

There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691.

Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|left|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' (1786)]]\n\n=== Marriage and early career ===\nBlake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]].

Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

That is how he rationalizes the Book's unusual ending, but notes that he is speculating.<ref>Damon, Samuel Foster (1988). A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings. The Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion but Realities of Intellect from which All the Passions Emanate Uncurbed in their Eternal Glory.

Watercolour on wood.]]\nBlake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul, but sees the body as an extension of the soul, derived from the \"discernment\" of the senses. Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\". Ackroyd, Peter (1995). Blake. London: Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 21-2, {{ISBN|1-85619-278-4}}.</ref> On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.<ref name=bent78 />\n\n[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819\u20131820. Having informed painter-astrologer [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] of his visions of apparitions, Blake was subsequently persuaded to paint one of them.<ref name=langr>Langridge, Irene.

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley's son,<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Haley, ESQ Vol II |last=Johnson |first=John |year=1823 |publisher=S. and R.

Thirteen years ago I lost a brother, and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly in the spirit, and see him in my remembrance, in the region of my imagination. I hear his advice, and even now write from his dictate.}}\n\nIn a letter to John Flaxman, dated 21 September 1800, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|[The town of] Felpham is a sweet place for Study, because it is more spiritual than London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates; her windows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard, & their forms more distinctly seen; & my Cottage is also a Shadow of their houses. My Wife & Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me.

(E565-6)}}\n\nDespite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.<ref name=\"flavorwire1\" />\n\nAware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, \"There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref> In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in ''A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature'' that Blake was \"a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few\", who \"led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English literature |last= Cousin |first=John William |year=1933 |publisher=Plain Label Books |isbn=978-1-60303-696-2 |page=81 |url= }}</ref> Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']], whose entry on Blake comments that \"the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence\".\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n{{Main|William Blake in popular culture}}\n[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|left|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.

Canadian music composer [[Kathleen Yearwood]] is one of many contemporary musicians that have set Blake's poems to music. After World War II, Blake's role in popular culture came to the fore in a variety of areas such as popular music, film, and the [[graphic novel]], leading Edward Larrissy to assert that \"Blake is the Romantic writer who has exerted the most powerful influence on the twentieth century.\"<ref>Edward Larrissy.

Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, \"upon which he fell with terrific Violence\".<ref>Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick.

He [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|saw Christ]] with his [[Apostles]] and a great procession of monks and priests, and heard their chant.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" />\n\n=== Royal Academy ===\nOn 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] in Old Somerset House, near the Strand.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IwnLCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT103|title=Jerusalem!: The Real Life of William Blake|first=Tobias|last=Churton |authorlink=Tobias Churton |date=16 April 2015|publisher=Watkins Media|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781780287881}}</ref> While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691. All quotations from Blake's writings are from {{cite book |author=Erdman, David V |title=The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake |edition=2nd |isbn=0-385-15213-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/completepoetrypr00blak |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} Subsequent references follow the convention of providing plate and line numbers where appropriate, followed by \"E\" and the page number from Erdman, and correspond to Blake's often unconventional spelling and punctuation.</ref> Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable [[oil painting]], Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].\n\nDavid Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held [[history painting]] to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather \"against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice.\"<ref>Bindman, D. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', ed. Morris Eaves. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003, p. 86.</ref> Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.\n\nBlake became a friend of [[John Flaxman]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[George Cumberland]] during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, pp. 69\u201376.</ref>\n\n=== Gordon Riots ===\nBlake's first biographer, [[Alexander Gilchrist]], records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed [[Newgate Prison]].<ref>Gilchrist, A., ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1842, p. 30.</ref> The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|left|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' (1786)]]\n\n=== Marriage and early career ===\nBlake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Blake | title = St. Mary's Church Parish website | quote = St Mary's Modern Stained Glass }}</ref> Later, in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write, Blake trained her as an engraver. Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings.

That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies.\nBut the following Contraries to these are True\n:1.

Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\".

London: Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 21-2, {{ISBN|1-85619-278-4}}.</ref> On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.<ref name=bent78 />\n\n[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819\u20131820.

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley's son,<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Haley, ESQ Vol II |last=Johnson |first=John |year=1823 |publisher=S. and R.

My Wife & Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me.

(E565-6)}}\n\nDespite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.<ref name=\"flavorwire1\" />\n\nAware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, \"There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref> In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in ''A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature'' that Blake was \"a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few\", who \"led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English literature |last= Cousin |first=John William |year=1933 |publisher=Plain Label Books |isbn=978-1-60303-696-2 |page=81 |url= }}</ref> Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']], whose entry on Blake comments that \"the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence\".\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n{{Main|William Blake in popular culture}}\n[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|left|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.
