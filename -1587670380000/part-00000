Wife Bet loves him but longs for the family to go 'straight' and do daft things like pay taxes and put money in the electricity meter instead of always trying to scam it. With eldest daughter Sharon's wedding looming, the docks facing closure, and a switch to the dreaded 'containerisation', which will put thousands of dockers out of work, times are challenging. So, too, are Danny's attempts to get closer to the opposite sex.\n\nWith an accompanying soundtrack combining songs from the era with material from Squeeze's Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, ''Cradle to Grave'' is based on actual events and characters.\n\n==Cast==\n*Laurie Kynaston as [[Danny Baker]] \u2013 Spud and Bet's youngest child and son and Michael and Sharon's younger brother. In the fifth episode, Danny leaves school so he can have a relationship with the school's photography teacher Miss Blondel.\n*[[Peter Kay]] as Fred \"Spud\" Baker \u2013 Bet's husband and Danny, Michael and Sharon's father. He works as a docker but also sells the things he stocks to earn money. He has been described as \"a real life [[Del Boy]]\". In the fifth episode of the series, his middle name is revealed to be Joseph.\n*[[Lucy Speed]] as Bet Baker \u2013 Spud's wife and Danny, Michael and Sharon's mother.\n*Frankie Wilson as Michael Baker \u2013 Spud and Bet's oldest son and middle child, Danny (with whom he shares a bedroom) and Sharon's brother.\n*Alice Sykes as Sharon Baker \u2013 Spud and Bet's eldest child and only daughter and Danny and Michael's sister. In the third episode of the series, she becomes engaged to her boyfriend Roger.\n*[[Julie Dray]] as Miss Blondel \u2013 Danny's French photography teacher.\n*[[Alexa Davies]] as Yvonne \u2013 Danny's girlfriend\n\n==Production==\nThe series is based on Danny Baker's autobiography ''Going to Sea in a Sieve'', covering Baker's life in south London during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/19/cradle-to-grave-trailer-peter-kay-danny-baker | title=Watch Peter Kay play Danny Baker's dad in the trailer for Cradle to Grave | work=The Guardian | date=19 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nSean O'Grady of ''[[The Independent]]'' criticised the cockney accents as \"a load of old pony\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/cradle-to-grave-tv-review-the-cockney-accents-are-a-load-of-pony-in-this-south-london-caper-10485415.html | title=Cradle to Grave, TV review: The cockney accents are a load of pony in this south London caper | work=Independent | date=3 September 2015}}</ref> Jasper Rees of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was more positive, describing it as \"niftily scripted\" and a \"savvy, up-to-the-minute comedy\" despite its 1970s setting, and \"a lot closer to the knuckle \u2013 and far funnier \u2013 than anything in, say, The Liver Birds or The Likely Lads\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11842462/Cradle-to-Grave-BBC-Two-review-savvy-comedy.html |title=Cradle to Grave, BBC Two, review: 'savvy comedy' |last1=Rees |first1=Jasper |date=3 September 2015 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=1 October 2015 }}</ref> ''[[Chortle (website)|Chortle]]'''s Steve Bennett was positive about the cast and soundtrack, and described the first episode as \"frequently funny, with an episodic structure that delivers wry character-led laughs with the regularity of a sketch show\", but noted that it lacked \"a consistent tone or strong narrative\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2015/09/03/23165/cradle_to_grave |title=Cradle To Grave |last1=Bennett |first1=Steve |date=3 September 2015 |website=[[Chortle (website)|Chortle]]|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref> whilst Euan Ferguson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as \"enjoyable, but little more\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/04/danny-human-zoo-trials-jimmy-rose-cradle-grave-enfield-whitehouse-review |title=The week in TV: Danny and the Human Zoo, The Trials of Jimmy Rose, Cradle to Grave, An Evening with Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse |last1=Ferguson |first1=Euan |date=6 September 2015 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Episode list==\n{{Hook|date=May 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!

The first series, which consisted of eight episodes began airing on 3 September 2015.<ref> Reported by the [https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-tv-director-danny-cohen-6626157 Daily Mirror] newspaper.</ref> The sitcom stars [[Lancashire]]-born [[comedian]] [[Peter Kay]], and former [[EastEnders]] actress [[Lucy Speed]] as Danny Baker's parents.\n\n==Plot==\nIt's 1973 and 15-year-old Danny is our guide through the ups and downs of life with the Baker family.\nDad Fred, nicknamed 'Spud', is a proud South London docker with a penchant for schemes. Wife Bet loves him but longs for the family to go 'straight' and do daft things like pay taxes and put money in the electricity meter instead of always trying to scam it. With eldest daughter Sharon's wedding looming, the docks facing closure, and a switch to the dreaded 'containerisation', which will put thousands of dockers out of work, times are challenging. So, too, are Danny's attempts to get closer to the opposite sex.\n\nWith an accompanying soundtrack combining songs from the era with material from Squeeze's Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, ''Cradle to Grave'' is based on actual events and characters.\n\n==Cast==\n*Laurie Kynaston as [[Danny Baker]] \u2013 Spud and Bet's youngest child and son and Michael and Sharon's younger brother. In the fifth episode, Danny leaves school so he can have a relationship with the school's photography teacher Miss Blondel.\n*[[Peter Kay]] as Fred \"Spud\" Baker \u2013 Bet's husband and Danny, Michael and Sharon's father. He works as a docker but also sells the things he stocks to earn money. He has been described as \"a real life [[Del Boy]]\". In the fifth episode of the series, his middle name is revealed to be Joseph.\n*[[Lucy Speed]] as Bet Baker \u2013 Spud's wife and Danny, Michael and Sharon's mother.\n*Frankie Wilson as Michael Baker \u2013 Spud and Bet's oldest son and middle child, Danny (with whom he shares a bedroom) and Sharon's brother.\n*Alice Sykes as Sharon Baker \u2013 Spud and Bet's eldest child and only daughter and Danny and Michael's sister. In the third episode of the series, she becomes engaged to her boyfriend Roger.\n*Julie Dray as Miss Blondel \u2013 Danny's French photography teacher.\n*[[Alexa Davies]] as Yvonne \u2013 Danny's girlfriend\n\n==Production==\nThe series is based on Danny Baker's autobiography ''Going to Sea in a Sieve'', covering Baker's life in south London during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/19/cradle-to-grave-trailer-peter-kay-danny-baker | title=Watch Peter Kay play Danny Baker's dad in the trailer for Cradle to Grave | work=The Guardian | date=19 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nSean O'Grady of ''[[The Independent]]'' criticised the cockney accents as \"a load of old pony\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/cradle-to-grave-tv-review-the-cockney-accents-are-a-load-of-pony-in-this-south-london-caper-10485415.html | title=Cradle to Grave, TV review: The cockney accents are a load of pony in this south London caper | work=Independent | date=3 September 2015}}</ref> Jasper Rees of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was more positive, describing it as \"niftily scripted\" and a \"savvy, up-to-the-minute comedy\" despite its 1970s setting, and \"a lot closer to the knuckle \u2013 and far funnier \u2013 than anything in, say, The Liver Birds or The Likely Lads\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11842462/Cradle-to-Grave-BBC-Two-review-savvy-comedy.html |title=Cradle to Grave, BBC Two, review: 'savvy comedy' |last1=Rees |first1=Jasper |date=3 September 2015 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=1 October 2015 }}</ref> ''[[Chortle (website)|Chortle]]'''s Steve Bennett was positive about the cast and soundtrack, and described the first episode as \"frequently funny, with an episodic structure that delivers wry character-led laughs with the regularity of a sketch show\", but noted that it lacked \"a consistent tone or strong narrative\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2015/09/03/23165/cradle_to_grave |title=Cradle To Grave |last1=Bennett |first1=Steve |date=3 September 2015 |website=[[Chortle (website)|Chortle]]|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref> whilst Euan Ferguson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as \"enjoyable, but little more\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/04/danny-human-zoo-trials-jimmy-rose-cradle-grave-enfield-whitehouse-review |title=The week in TV: Danny and the Human Zoo, The Trials of Jimmy Rose, Cradle to Grave, An Evening with Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse |last1=Ferguson |first1=Euan |date=6 September 2015 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Episode list==\n{{Hook|date=May 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!

One particular scene became a huge hit among young audiences: when his stern grandfather character discovers [[porn]] while browsing through a family member's computer files, then embarrassingly gets caught watching. It went viral, giving rise to numerous parodies in which \"Yadong (Porn) Soon-jae\" is involved in R-rated hijinks. Lee was surprised that even his granddaughter asked for his autograph for her friends, adding, \"Even during my best years, my daughter never asked me for that.\" Despite having no superstars in the cast, the sitcom received high ratings, which Lee attributed to successfully building comic tension. He said, \"For an actor to be funny, he's got to play things straight. [...] It's about finding the comedy in something serious.\"<ref name=\"pretv\" /> But Lee also lamented the recent trend of casting inexperienced actors in leading roles on TV, saying, \"It's important to know the basics, like the language. How can you act, when you don't even know how to pronounce? Acting is not a simple thing, and this I can say from experience.\" He later returned as the family patriarch in ''[[High Kick Through the Roof]]'', which shares the same concept as the previous sitcom, but with a different cast and characters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Network to Bring New Sitcom, Dramas|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/201_51066.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=1 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Experienced Actors Stealing Spotlight|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/201_51915.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=16 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Good Morning President====\nIn 2009, Lee made his big screen comeback after 20 years in television, in [[Jang Jin]]'s comedy ''[[Good Morning President]]''. The movie tells the story of three fictional Korean presidents, and in the first segment, Lee played a well-respected elderly president nearing the end of his term who espouses frugality and charity, but then agonizes whether to take the money when he unexpectedly wins the lottery. Lee said, \"I was impressed with how much times have changed; before it would have been impossible to parody the president. The film tries to show that heads of state are only human, just like you and me, which I think makes the movie distinctive, as well as fresh and fun for viewers.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=Actor Jang Dong-kun Returns as President|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/141_52271.html|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=22 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Park|first=Sun-young|title=Korean stars take turns playing president|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2910496|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=25 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Late Blossom====\nIn 2011, Lee, Yoon So-jung, [[Song Jae-ho]] and [[Kim Soo-mi]] starred in ''[[Late Blossom]]'', a tearjerker romance about two elderly couples, based on the popular [[webtoon]] ''I Love You'' by [[Kang Full]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cha|first=Hyo-jin|title=''I Love You'', The Most Beautiful Confession|url=http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1384|work=Worldyan News|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=14 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214250/http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1384|archive-date=6 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee said the movie was a rare chance for him and other senior actors to play leading roles on the big screen. He added that Korea's senior citizen population had surpassed five million, and \"not understanding their feelings would be a failure of television dramas, movies and even elections.

But it became a [[sleeper hit]], recouping four times its cost in just a few weeks. Lee also won Best Actor under the international film category at the China [[Golden Rooster Awards|Golden Rooster]] and [[Hundred Flowers Awards|Hundred Flowers]] Film Festival, becoming its oldest recipient. Lee said, \"I never thought I'd win. What a surprise. It feels great to know that ''Late Blossom'' has been received well overseas. I thought it would be hard for an actor from television dramas to be awarded a prize at film awards, not to mention the unexpected pleasure of winning at a foreign film festival.

This was his third time to play the character [[Willy Loman]]. Lee said, \"When I first played this role in 1978, some parts were rather incomprehensible. But now, as our society developed, we can finally fully understand what those lines mean. That is the beauty of working on masterpieces like Arthur Miller's.

One particular scene became a huge hit among young audiences: when his stern grandfather character discovers [[porn]] while browsing through a family member's computer files, then embarrassingly gets caught watching. It went viral, giving rise to numerous parodies in which \"Yadong (Porn) Soon-jae\" is involved in R-rated hijinks. Lee was surprised that even his granddaughter asked for his autograph for her friends, adding, \"Even during my best years, my daughter never asked me for that.\" Despite having no superstars in the cast, the sitcom received high ratings, which Lee attributed to successfully building comic tension. He said, \"For an actor to be funny, he's got to play things straight. [...] It's about finding the comedy in something serious.\"<ref name=\"pretv\" /> But Lee also lamented the recent trend of casting inexperienced actors in leading roles on TV, saying, \"It's important to know the basics, like the language. How can you act, when you don't even know how to pronounce? Acting is not a simple thing, and this I can say from experience.\" He later returned as the family patriarch in ''[[High Kick Through the Roof]]'', which shares the same concept as the previous sitcom, but with a different cast and characters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Network to Bring New Sitcom, Dramas|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/201_51066.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=1 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Experienced Actors Stealing Spotlight|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/201_51915.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=16 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Good Morning President====\nIn 2009, Lee made his big screen comeback after 20 years in television, in [[Jang Jin]]'s comedy ''[[Good Morning President]]''. The movie tells the story of three fictional Korean presidents, and in the first segment, Lee played a well-respected elderly president nearing the end of his term who espouses frugality and charity, but then agonizes whether to take the money when he unexpectedly wins the lottery. Lee said, \"I was impressed with how much times have changed; before it would have been impossible to parody the president. The film tries to show that heads of state are only human, just like you and me, which I think makes the movie distinctive, as well as fresh and fun for viewers.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=Actor Jang Dong-kun Returns as President|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/141_52271.html|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=22 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Park|first=Sun-young|title=Korean stars take turns playing president|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2910496|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=25 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Late Blossom====\nIn 2011, Lee, Yoon So-jung, [[Song Jae-ho]] and [[Kim Soo-mi]] starred in ''[[Late Blossom]]'', a tearjerker romance about two elderly couples, based on the popular [[webtoon]] ''I Love You'' by [[Kang Full]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cha|first=Hyo-jin|title=''I Love You'', The Most Beautiful Confession|url=http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1384|work=Worldyan News|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=14 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214250/http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1384|archive-date=6 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee said the movie was a rare chance for him and other senior actors to play leading roles on the big screen. He added that Korea's senior citizen population had surpassed five million, and \"not understanding their feelings would be a failure of television dramas, movies and even elections. Young people might be under the illusion that life is over after turning 60, but the heart doesn't change despite getting old.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kwon|first=Mee-yoo|title=Blossom portrays love in twilight years|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/03/141_80850.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> Initially difficult to finance due to [[ageism]], ''Late Blossom'' had a small shooting and marketing budget compared to most Korean mainstream films. But it became a [[sleeper hit]], recouping four times its cost in just a few weeks. Lee also won Best Actor under the international film category at the China [[Golden Rooster Awards|Golden Rooster]] and [[Hundred Flowers Awards|Hundred Flowers]] Film Festival, becoming its oldest recipient. Lee said, \"I never thought I'd win. What a surprise. It feels great to know that ''Late Blossom'' has been received well overseas. I thought it would be hard for an actor from television dramas to be awarded a prize at film awards, not to mention the unexpected pleasure of winning at a foreign film festival. I have received the best entertainer award and achievement award before, but receiving this makes me happier and more thrilled.\" It was his first best actor award for a film in 34 years since the 1977 [[Baeksang Arts Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Choi|first=Min-ji|title=Lee Soon Jae Wins Best Actor Award at Major Chinese Film Awards|url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/article/1254|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=enewsWorld|date=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hong|first=Lucia|title=Lee Soon-jae wins best actor award at Chinese film fest|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2011102810401935785|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=10Asia|date=28 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Theater====\nLee returned to the stage in 2012 in ''Father'', a Korean adaptation of [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''. This was his third time to play the character [[Willy Loman]]. Lee said, \"When I first played this role in 1978, some parts were rather incomprehensible. But now, as our society developed, we can finally fully understand what those lines mean. That is the beauty of working on masterpieces like Arthur Miller's. I feel a satisfaction and regret at the same time, for I have reached a new comprehension, and for the perspective that I have yet to discover.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=So-young|title=What ''Father'' Means to us|url=http://www.dgupost.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1324|work=The [[Dongguk University|Dongguk]] Post|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=5 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=An interview with Lee Soon Jae, currently headlining the play ''Father''|url=http://lsgfan.wordpress.com/2012/09/08/lee-soon-jae-talks-his-play-father-and-acting-shows-love-for-the-likes-of-kim-myung-min-lee-seung-gi-ha-ji-won/|work=LSGfan|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=6 September 2012}}</ref> He reprised the role in 2013, under the direction of [[Kim Myung-gon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Touching and Healing Drama ''Father''|url=http://www.k-popculture.com/?p=2349|work=K-PopCulture|accessdate=2013-07-08|date=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Grandpas Over Flowers====\nIn 2013, cable channel [[TVN (South Korea)|tvN]] launched the [[travel documentary|travel]]-[[reality show]] ''[[Grandpas Over Flowers]]'' (the title [[parody|parodies]] the [[manga]] ''[[Boys Over Flowers]]'') directed by Na Young-seok (previously of ''[[1 Night 2 Days]]'').<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woo|first1=Jae-yeon|title=Golden Guys Get Good Ratings|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/07/19/golden-guys-get-good-ratings/|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2014-09-11|date=19 July 2014}}</ref> Defying a youth-centered entertainment industry, the hit show stars four veteran actors in their 70s, Lee, [[Shin Goo]], [[Park Geun-hyung]] and [[Baek Il-seob]], as they go on a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking tour]] of [[France]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Senior actors lead TV show, defying youth-centered industry|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130612001034|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=12 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Sun-min|title=Grandpa actors get own show|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2973778|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=29 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Grandpas' Flowery Youth|url=http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/vod/special_list_view.asp?idx=365|work=[[Korean Movie Database]]|accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref>\n\n====Idol School====\nIn 2017, he joined [[Idol School (2017 TV series)|Idol School]] as principal and narrator.

Furthermore, Korean-style chicken is not characterized by the crags and crusty nubs associated with American fried chicken; it was described by Julia Moskin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a \"thin, crackly and almost transparent crust\".<ref name=\"Moskin\" /> The chicken is usually seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, prior to and after being fried. Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small- or medium-sized chickens; these younger chickens result in more tender meat. After frying, the chicken is usually hand-painted with sauce using a brush in order to evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer.
