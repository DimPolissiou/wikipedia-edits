The original books were also made into an [[OVA]], [[animated cartoon|animated feature-length films]], [[anime]], and comic.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Kaiketsu Zorori characters}}\n\nSet in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji'''''|\u304b\u3044\u3051\u3064\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u305f\u3044\u3058||\"The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer\"}} and has published about two issues per year, totaling 50 issues as of December 2011. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] on January 4, 2010. \n\nZorori was originally a villain for the series {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3||\"Spinach Man\"}} written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when H\u014drens\u014d Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u3086\u3046\u308c\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046||\"Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle\"}} (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, \"Zorori Castle Part 2\" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Y\u014dkai Gakk\u014d no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the H\u014drens\u014d Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.\n\nUsing clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult [[kanji]] or any [[furigana]], instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school \"children's book\", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).\n\nAt the time of publication, '''{{nihongo|''The Zorori League''|\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0|Zororiigu}}''' and '''{{nihongo|''Stupid Monster''|\u30dc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Bokeetto Monsutaa}}''' (a play on [[Pok\u00e9mon]]) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.\n\nFurthermore, the Spanish word for fox is \"zorro\", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble [[Zorro]].\n\n==List of volumes==\nThe first Zorori book was released in November 1987 and has seen two releases per year ever since. The first 39 volumes have been used as source material for the anime, while volumes 40 and beyond are book only, due to being printed after the anime's cancellation. \n{{Graphic novel list/header\n |

They run from the police and end up on Money's plane, but partway through the flight the plane has engine trouble and crashes into a snowy mountain. Zorori builds a new plane from the remains and they fly off. They are low on gas when a red plane comes out of nowhere and points them to a nearby city. The red plane quickly vanishes and they get Money back home safely. Zorori is left wondering if the pilot was his father.

The original books were also made into an [[OVA]], [[animated cartoon|animated feature-length films]], [[anime]], and comic.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Kaiketsu Zorori characters}}\n\nSet in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji'''''|\u304b\u3044\u3051\u3064\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u305f\u3044\u3058||\"The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer\"}} and has published about two issues per year, totaling 50 issues as of December 2011. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] on January 4, 2010. \n\nZorori was originally a villain for the series {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3||\"Spinach Man\"}} written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when H\u014drens\u014d Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u3086\u3046\u308c\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046||\"Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle\"}} (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, \"Zorori Castle Part 2\" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Y\u014dkai Gakk\u014d no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the H\u014drens\u014d Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.\n\nUsing clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult [[kanji]] or any [[furigana]], instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school \"children's book\", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).\n\nAt the time of publication, '''{{nihongo|''The Zorori League''|\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0|Zororiigu}}''' and '''{{nihongo|''Stupid Monster''|\u30dc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Bokeetto Monsutaa}}''' (a play on [[Pok\u00e9mon]]) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.\n\nFurthermore, the Spanish word for fox is \"zorro\", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble [[Zorro]].\n\n==List of volumes==\nThe first Zorori book was released in November 1987 and has seen two releases per year ever since. The first 39 volumes have been used as source material for the anime, while volumes 40 and beyond are book only, due to being printed after the anime's cancellation. \n{{Graphic novel list/header\n |

Out of desperation he eats an entire room filled with garlic, leaving him with a terrible smell.

An officer comes by and tells him the toy plane was stolen and the boars said they took it by mistake. They run from the police and end up on Money's plane, but partway through the flight the plane has engine trouble and crashes into a snowy mountain. Zorori builds a new plane from the remains and they fly off. They are low on gas when a red plane comes out of nowhere and points them to a nearby city. The red plane quickly vanishes and they get Money back home safely. Zorori is left wondering if the pilot was his father.

He was [[Prince of Wales]] and [[heir apparent]] to the British throne for almost 60 years. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval, his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.\n\nAs king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the [[British Home Fleet]] and the reorganisation of the [[British Army]] after the [[Second Boer War]]. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], for which he was popularly called \"Peacemaker\", but his relationship with his nephew, the [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II]], was poor. The [[Edwardian era]], which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including [[steam turbine]] propulsion and the rise of [[History of socialism in Great Britain|socialism]]. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which restricted the power of the unelected [[House of Lords]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Edward VII (1841_\u2013_1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter|Winterhalter]], 1846]]\nEdward was born at 10:48 in the morning on 9 November 1841 in [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>{{citation|last=Magnus|first=Philip|authorlink=Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|title=King Edward The Seventh|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1964|page=1}}</ref> He was the eldest son and second child of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

The Queen and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at [[Speyer]] on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, Victoria, who had married the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince of Prussia]] in 1858.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 36\u201338</ref> Edward's sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Alexandra at [[Neustrelitz|Strelitz]] in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression.

They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the [[German Confederation]] took the opportunity to [[Second Schleswig War|invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein]]. The Queen was of two minds as to whether it was a suitable match, given the political climate.<ref>Middlemas, p. 35; Ridley, p. 83</ref> After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.<ref>Ridley, pp. 85, 87, 93, 104</ref>\n\nEdward had [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]] throughout his married life.

While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], Edward contracted [[typhoid fever]], the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests ([[George Stanhope, 7th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]]) died.

Edward doted on his grandchildren, and indulged them, to the consternation of their governesses.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 15</ref> However, there was one relation whom Edward did not like: Wilhelm II.

In a break with precedent, Edward asked Campbell-Bannerman's successor, [[H. H. Asquith]], to travel to Biarritz to [[kiss hands]].

J. Tennant]], to serve on a Royal Commission on reforming divorce law\u2014Edward thought divorce could not be discussed with \"delicacy or even decency\" before ladies. Edward's biographer [[Philip Magnus-Allcroft|Philip Magnus]] suggests that Gladstone may have become a whipping-boy for the King's general irritation with the Liberal government. Gladstone was sacked in the reshuffle the following year and the King agreed, with some reluctance, to appoint him [[Governor-General of South Africa]].<ref>Magnus, p. 541</ref>\n\nEdward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform, the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 91\u201393; Ridley, p. 389</ref> He supported the redesign of army command, the creation of the [[Territorial Force]], and the decision to provide an [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Expeditionary Force]] supporting France in the event of war with Germany.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 130\u2013134</ref> Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the [[Imperial German Navy]] as a new strategic threat.<ref>{{citation|last=Kennedy|first=Paul M.|authorlink=Paul Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|year=2004|pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]], who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]], who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new [[dreadnought]]s.<ref>See, principally, {{citation|last=Lambert|first=Nicholas A.|title=Sir John Fisher's Naval Revolution|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57003-492-3}} For a much shorter summary of Fisher's reforms, see {{citation|last=Grove|first=Eric J.|authorlink=Eric Grove|title=The Royal Navy since 1815|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2005|isbn=978-0-333-72126-1|pages=88\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe King lent support to Fisher, in part because he disliked Beresford, and eventually Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 134\u2013139</ref> The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was [[Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Arthur Wilson]], who had retired in 1907.<ref>Lambert, pp. 200\u2013201.</ref> Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.<ref>{{citation|last=Bradford|first=Admiral Sir Edward E.|authorlink=Edward Eden Bradford|title=Life of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1923|pages=223\u2013225}}</ref>\n\nEdward was rarely interested in politics, although his views on some issues were notably liberal for the time.

In response, Edward stated that he \"could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin\".<ref name=macdonogh/> Although Edward lived a life of luxury often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects, they expected it, and his personal charm with all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.<ref name=\"dnb\" />\n\n==Constitutional crisis==\n[[File:Francis Derwent Wood - Edouard VII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust by [[Francis Derwent Wood]]]]\n[[File:Edward VII Halfpenny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Profile of Edward VII on a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], 1902]]\nIn the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the [[House of Lords]] refused to pass the \"[[People's Budget]]\" proposed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of Prime Minister Asquith. The crisis eventually led\u2014after Edward's death\u2014to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.\n\nThe King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by [[David Lloyd George]] at [[Limehouse]].<ref>Heffer, pp. 276\u2013277; Ridley, p. 437</ref> Cabinet minister [[Winston Churchill]] publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Lord Knollys]] and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare\u2014although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the [[First Home Rule Bill]] in 1886\u2014that he introduced his son to [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Richard Haldane]] as \"the last King of England\".<ref>Heffer, pp. 282\u2013283</ref> After the King's horse [[Minoru (horse)|Minoru]] won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day, and laughed when a man shouted: \"Now, King. You've won the Derby. Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!\"<ref>Magnus, p. 526</ref>\n\nIn vain, the King urged Conservative leaders [[Arthur Balfour]] and Lord Lansdowne to pass the Budget, which [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two Houses over [[Irish disestablishment]] in 1869 and the [[Third Reform Act]] in 1884.<ref>Magnus, p. 534; Ridley, pp. 440\u2013441</ref> On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward for doing so.<ref>Heffer, pp. 281\u2013282</ref>\n\nThe Finance Bill passed the Commons on 5 November 1909, but was rejected by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge<ref>Magnus, p. 536</ref> and had forbidden Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass.<ref>Heffer, pp. 283\u2013284</ref> In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered \"outrageous\" by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.<ref>Ridley, p. 443</ref>\n\nThe [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 election]] was dominated by talk of removing the Lords' veto. During the election campaign Lloyd George talked of \"guarantees\" and Asquith of \"safeguards\" that would be necessary before forming another Liberal government, but the King informed Asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election.<ref name=\"dnb\" /><ref>Hattersley, p. 168</ref> Balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a Conservative government, but advised the King not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change.<ref name=\"Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288\">Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288</ref> During the campaign the leading Conservative [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]] had asked Knollys for permission to state that the King did not favour Irish Home Rule, but Knollys refused on the grounds that it was not appropriate for the monarch's views to be known in public.<ref name=\"Magnus, p. 547\">Magnus, p. 547</ref>\n\nThe election resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Liberal government dependent on the support of the third largest party, the [[Irish nationalists]]. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote, which would also redress the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords' independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked.<ref name=\"Magnus, p. 547\"/> Pressure to remove the Lords' veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Home Rule. They threatened to vote against the Budget unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast the Budget too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no \"guarantees\" for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.<ref>Heffer, pp. 290\u2013293</ref> \n\nThe King's [[Speech from the Throne]] on 21 February made reference to introducing measures restricting the Lords' power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase \"in the opinion of my advisers\" so the King could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation.<ref>Heffer, p. 291</ref> The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April that would form the basis for the [[1911 Parliament Act]]: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have preferred four<ref name=\"Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288\"/>). But in that debate Asquith hinted\u2014to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs\u2014that he would ask the King to break the deadlock \"in that Parliament\" (i.e. contrary to Edward's earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The Budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.<ref>Heffer, p. 293</ref>\n\nBy April the Palace was having secret talks with Balfour and [[Randall Davidson]], Archbishop of Canterbury, who both advised that the Liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers. The King thought the whole proposal \"simply disgusting\" and that the government was \"in the hands of [[John Redmond|Redmond]] & Co\". Lord Crewe announced publicly that the government's wish to create peers should be treated as formal \"ministerial advice\" (which, by convention, the monarch must obey) although Lord Esher argued that the monarch was entitled ''in extremis'' to dismiss the government rather than take their \"advice\".<ref>Heffer, pp. 294\u2013296</ref> Esher's view has been called \"obsolete and unhelpful\".<ref>Magnus, pp. 555\u2013556</ref>\n\n==Death==\n{{main|Funeral of King Edward VII}}\n[[File:King Edward VII on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace in 1910 Wellcome V0042567.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Edward on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace by Sir Luke Fildes, 1910]]\n[[File:4125s2.ogv|thumb|[[Funeral of King Edward VII|Funeral procession of King Edward VII]], London, 1910]]\nEdward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day.

In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, [[George V]], was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son,<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 155</ref> and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his \"best friend and the best of fathers&nbsp;... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief\".<ref>King George V's diary, 6 May 1910. Royal Archives</ref>\n\nEdward has been recognised as the first truly constitutional British sovereign and the last sovereign to wield effective political power.<ref>Ridley, p. 576</ref> Though lauded as \"Peacemaker\",<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 157; Lee, vol. II, p. 738</ref> he had been afraid his nephew, the [[Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]], would tip Europe into war.<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 358, 650, 664; Middlemas, pp. 176, 179; Ridley, p. 474</ref> Four years after Edward's death, World War I broke out. The naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the [[Triple Entente]] between Britain, France, and Russia, as well as his relationships with his extended family, fed the paranoia of the German Emperor, who blamed Edward for the war.<ref>Ridley, p. 474</ref> Publication of the official biography of Edward was delayed until 1927 by its author, [[Sidney Lee]], who feared German propagandists would select material to portray Edward as an anti-German warmonger.<ref>Ridley, p. 487</ref> Lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of Edward's personal papers; Edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death.<ref>Ridley, pp. 482\u2013483</ref> Subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of Edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to Lee.<ref>Ridley, pp. 494\u2013495</ref>\n\nHistorian [[R. C. K. Ensor]], writing in 1936, praised the King's political personality:\n: he had in many respects great natural ability. He knew how to be both dignified and charming; he had an excellent memory; and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional. He had a store of varied, though unsystematized, knowledge gathered at first-hand through talking to all sorts of eminent men. His tastes were not particularly elevated, but they were thoroughly English; and he showed much (though not unfailing) comprehension for the common instincts of the people over whom he reigned. This was not the less remarkable because, though a good linguist in French and German, he never learned to speak English without a German accent.<ref>Ensor, p. 343</ref> \n\nEnsor rejects the widespread notion that the King exerted an important influence on British foreign policy, believing he gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad, with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts. Ensor thought surviving documents showed \"how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were, how little he read, and of what na\u00efve indiscretions he was capable.\"<ref>Ensor, pp. 567\u2013569</ref> Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure, but he received great praise for his affable manners and diplomatic tact. As his grandson Edward VIII wrote, \"his lighter side&nbsp;... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence.\"<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 69</ref> \"He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty\", wrote J. B. Priestley.<ref>Priestley, p. 25</ref> Lord Esher wrote that Edward VII was \"kind and debonair and not undignified\u2014but too human\".<ref>Hattersley, p. 17</ref>\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* 9 November&nbsp;\u2013 8 December 1841: ''His Royal Highness'' The Duke of Cornwall\n* 8 December 1841&nbsp;\u2013 22 January 1901: ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince of Wales\n* 22 January 1901&nbsp;\u2013 6 May 1910: ''His Majesty'' The King\n\n===Honours===\n;British honours<ref name=cp>{{citation|author=Cokayne, G.

He was [[Prince of Wales]] and [[heir apparent]] to the British throne for almost 60 years. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval, his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.\n\nAs king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the [[British Home Fleet]] and the reorganisation of the [[British Army]] after the [[Second Boer War]]. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], for which he was popularly called \"Peacemaker\", but his relationship with his nephew, the [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II]], was poor. The [[Edwardian era]], which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including [[steam turbine]] propulsion and the rise of [[History of socialism in Great Britain|socialism]]. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which restricted the power of the unelected [[House of Lords]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Edward VII (1841_\u2013_1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter|Winterhalter]], 1846]]\nEdward was born at 10:48 in the morning on 9 November 1841 in [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>{{citation|last=Magnus|first=Philip|authorlink=Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|title=King Edward The Seventh|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1964|page=1}}</ref> He was the eldest son and second child of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

The Queen and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at [[Speyer]] on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, Victoria, who had married the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince of Prussia]] in 1858.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 36\u201338</ref> Edward's sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Alexandra at [[Neustrelitz|Strelitz]] in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.<ref>Hough, pp. 64\u201366</ref>\n\nEdward gained a reputation as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, he attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which he spent three nights with an actress, [[Nellie Clifden]], who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers.<ref>Ridley, pp. 54\u201355</ref> Prince Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at [[Cambridge]] to issue a reprimand.

They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the [[German Confederation]] took the opportunity to [[Second Schleswig War|invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein]]. The Queen was of two minds as to whether it was a suitable match, given the political climate.<ref>Middlemas, p. 35; Ridley, p. 83</ref> After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.<ref>Ridley, pp. 85, 87, 93, 104</ref>\n\nEdward had [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]] throughout his married life.

While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], Edward contracted [[typhoid fever]], the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests ([[George Stanhope, 7th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]]) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief.<ref name=\"dnb\" /> Public celebrations included the composition of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s [[Festival Te Deum]]. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 67 and Middlemas, pp. 48\u201352</ref>\n[[File:Edward, Prince of Wales, with elephant, Terai cph.3b08927.jpg|thumb|right|Edward (front centre) in India, 1876]]\n\nOn 26 September 1875, Edward set off for India on an extensive eight-month tour; on the way, he visited Malta, [[Brindisi]] and Greece. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour.

Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. \"To lose our eldest son\", he wrote, \"is one of those calamities one can never really get over\".

Edward doted on his grandchildren, and indulged them, to the consternation of their governesses.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 15</ref> However, there was one relation whom Edward did not like: Wilhelm II.

In a break with precedent, Edward asked Campbell-Bannerman's successor, [[H. H. Asquith]], to travel to Biarritz to [[kiss hands]].

J. Tennant]], to serve on a Royal Commission on reforming divorce law\u2014Edward thought divorce could not be discussed with \"delicacy or even decency\" before ladies. Edward's biographer [[Philip Magnus-Allcroft|Philip Magnus]] suggests that Gladstone may have become a whipping-boy for the King's general irritation with the Liberal government. Gladstone was sacked in the reshuffle the following year and the King agreed, with some reluctance, to appoint him [[Governor-General of South Africa]].<ref>Magnus, p. 541</ref>\n\nEdward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform, the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 91\u201393; Ridley, p. 389</ref> He supported the redesign of army command, the creation of the [[Territorial Force]], and the decision to provide an [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Expeditionary Force]] supporting France in the event of war with Germany.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 130\u2013134</ref> Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the [[Imperial German Navy]] as a new strategic threat.<ref>{{citation|last=Kennedy|first=Paul M.|authorlink=Paul Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|year=2004|pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]], who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]], who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new [[dreadnought]]s.<ref>See, principally, {{citation|last=Lambert|first=Nicholas A.|title=Sir John Fisher's Naval Revolution|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57003-492-3}} For a much shorter summary of Fisher's reforms, see {{citation|last=Grove|first=Eric J.|authorlink=Eric Grove|title=The Royal Navy since 1815|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2005|isbn=978-0-333-72126-1|pages=88\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe King lent support to Fisher, in part because he disliked Beresford, and eventually Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 134\u2013139</ref> The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was [[Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Arthur Wilson]], who had retired in 1907.<ref>Lambert, pp. 200\u2013201.</ref> Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.<ref>{{citation|last=Bradford|first=Admiral Sir Edward E.|authorlink=Edward Eden Bradford|title=Life of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1923|pages=223\u2013225}}</ref>\n\nEdward was rarely interested in politics, although his views on some issues were notably liberal for the time. During his reign he said use of the word \"[[nigger]]\" was \"disgraceful\", despite it then being in common parlance.<ref>{{citation|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|title=King George V|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1983|page=65}}</ref> In 1904, during an Anglo-German summit in [[Kiel]] between Wilhelm II and Edward, Wilhelm with the Russo-Japanese War in mind started to go on about the \"[[Yellow Peril]]\", which he called \"the greatest peril menacing&nbsp;...

In response, Edward stated that he \"could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin\".<ref name=macdonogh/> Although Edward lived a life of luxury often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects, they expected it, and his personal charm with all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.<ref name=\"dnb\" />\n\n==Constitutional crisis==\n[[File:Francis Derwent Wood - Edouard VII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust by [[Francis Derwent Wood]]]]\n[[File:Edward VII Halfpenny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Profile of Edward VII on a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], 1902]]\nIn the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the [[House of Lords]] refused to pass the \"[[People's Budget]]\" proposed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of Prime Minister Asquith. The crisis eventually led\u2014after Edward's death\u2014to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.\n\nThe King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by [[David Lloyd George]] at [[Limehouse]].<ref>Heffer, pp. 276\u2013277; Ridley, p. 437</ref> Cabinet minister [[Winston Churchill]] publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Lord Knollys]] and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare\u2014although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the [[First Home Rule Bill]] in 1886\u2014that he introduced his son to [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Richard Haldane]] as \"the last King of England\".<ref>Heffer, pp. 282\u2013283</ref> After the King's horse [[Minoru (horse)|Minoru]] won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day, and laughed when a man shouted: \"Now, King. You've won the Derby. Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!\"<ref>Magnus, p. 526</ref>\n\nIn vain, the King urged Conservative leaders [[Arthur Balfour]] and Lord Lansdowne to pass the Budget, which [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two Houses over [[Irish disestablishment]] in 1869 and the [[Third Reform Act]] in 1884.<ref>Magnus, p. 534; Ridley, pp. 440\u2013441</ref> On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward for doing so.<ref>Heffer, pp. 281\u2013282</ref>\n\nThe Finance Bill passed the Commons on 5 November 1909, but was rejected by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge<ref>Magnus, p. 536</ref> and had forbidden Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass.<ref>Heffer, pp. 283\u2013284</ref> In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered \"outrageous\" by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.<ref>Ridley, p. 443</ref>\n\nThe [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 election]] was dominated by talk of removing the Lords' veto. During the election campaign Lloyd George talked of \"guarantees\" and Asquith of \"safeguards\" that would be necessary before forming another Liberal government, but the King informed Asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election.<ref name=\"dnb\" /><ref>Hattersley, p. 168</ref> Balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a Conservative government, but advised the King not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change.<ref name=\"Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288\">Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288</ref> During the campaign the leading Conservative [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]] had asked Knollys for permission to state that the King did not favour Irish Home Rule, but Knollys refused on the grounds that it was not appropriate for the monarch's views to be known in public.<ref name=\"Magnus, p. 547\">Magnus, p. 547</ref>\n\nThe election resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Liberal government dependent on the support of the third largest party, the [[Irish nationalists]]. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote, which would also redress the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords' independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked.<ref name=\"Magnus, p. 547\"/> Pressure to remove the Lords' veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Home Rule. They threatened to vote against the Budget unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast the Budget too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no \"guarantees\" for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.<ref>Heffer, pp. 290\u2013293</ref> \n\nThe King's [[Speech from the Throne]] on 21 February made reference to introducing measures restricting the Lords' power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase \"in the opinion of my advisers\" so the King could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation.<ref>Heffer, p. 291</ref> The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April that would form the basis for the [[1911 Parliament Act]]: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have preferred four<ref name=\"Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288\"/>). But in that debate Asquith hinted\u2014to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs\u2014that he would ask the King to break the deadlock \"in that Parliament\" (i.e. contrary to Edward's earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The Budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.<ref>Heffer, p. 293</ref>\n\nBy April the Palace was having secret talks with Balfour and [[Randall Davidson]], Archbishop of Canterbury, who both advised that the Liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers. The King thought the whole proposal \"simply disgusting\" and that the government was \"in the hands of [[John Redmond|Redmond]] & Co\". Lord Crewe announced publicly that the government's wish to create peers should be treated as formal \"ministerial advice\" (which, by convention, the monarch must obey) although Lord Esher argued that the monarch was entitled ''in extremis'' to dismiss the government rather than take their \"advice\".<ref>Heffer, pp. 294\u2013296</ref> Esher's view has been called \"obsolete and unhelpful\".<ref>Magnus, pp. 555\u2013556</ref>\n\n==Death==\n{{main|Funeral of King Edward VII}}\n[[File:King Edward VII on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace in 1910 Wellcome V0042567.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Edward on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace by Sir Luke Fildes, 1910]]\n[[File:4125s2.ogv|thumb|[[Funeral of King Edward VII|Funeral procession of King Edward VII]], London, 1910]]\nEdward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day.

In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, [[George V]], was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son,<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 155</ref> and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his \"best friend and the best of fathers&nbsp;... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief\".<ref>King George V's diary, 6 May 1910. Royal Archives</ref>\n\nEdward has been recognised as the first truly constitutional British sovereign and the last sovereign to wield effective political power.<ref>Ridley, p. 576</ref> Though lauded as \"Peacemaker\",<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 157; Lee, vol. II, p. 738</ref> he had been afraid his nephew, the [[Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]], would tip Europe into war.<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 358, 650, 664; Middlemas, pp. 176, 179; Ridley, p. 474</ref> Four years after Edward's death, World War I broke out. The naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the [[Triple Entente]] between Britain, France, and Russia, as well as his relationships with his extended family, fed the paranoia of the German Emperor, who blamed Edward for the war.<ref>Ridley, p. 474</ref> Publication of the official biography of Edward was delayed until 1927 by its author, [[Sidney Lee]], who feared German propagandists would select material to portray Edward as an anti-German warmonger.<ref>Ridley, p. 487</ref> Lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of Edward's personal papers; Edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death.<ref>Ridley, pp. 482\u2013483</ref> Subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of Edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to Lee.<ref>Ridley, pp. 494\u2013495</ref>\n\nHistorian [[R. C. K. Ensor]], writing in 1936, praised the King's political personality:\n: he had in many respects great natural ability. He knew how to be both dignified and charming; he had an excellent memory; and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional. He had a store of varied, though unsystematized, knowledge gathered at first-hand through talking to all sorts of eminent men. His tastes were not particularly elevated, but they were thoroughly English; and he showed much (though not unfailing) comprehension for the common instincts of the people over whom he reigned. This was not the less remarkable because, though a good linguist in French and German, he never learned to speak English without a German accent.<ref>Ensor, p. 343</ref> \n\nEnsor rejects the widespread notion that the King exerted an important influence on British foreign policy, believing he gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad, with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts. Ensor thought surviving documents showed \"how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were, how little he read, and of what na\u00efve indiscretions he was capable.\"<ref>Ensor, pp. 567\u2013569</ref> Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure, but he received great praise for his affable manners and diplomatic tact. As his grandson Edward VIII wrote, \"his lighter side&nbsp;... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence.\"<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 69</ref> \"He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty\", wrote J. B. Priestley.<ref>Priestley, p. 25</ref> Lord Esher wrote that Edward VII was \"kind and debonair and not undignified\u2014but too human\".<ref>Hattersley, p. 17</ref>\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* 9 November&nbsp;\u2013 8 December 1841: ''His Royal Highness'' The Duke of Cornwall\n* 8 December 1841&nbsp;\u2013 22 January 1901: ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince of Wales\n* 22 January 1901&nbsp;\u2013 6 May 1910: ''His Majesty'' The King\n\n===Honours===\n;British honours<ref name=cp>{{citation|author=Cokayne, G.

More reliable counts would not begin until the mid-1960s with the first successful operation of the [[weather satellite]].|group=\"nb\"}} with 18 named storms and 20 tropical cyclones in total, although many were weak and short-lived, especially towards the end of the season. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin and are adopted by convention. However, [[tropical cyclogenesis]] is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the formation of Subtropical Storm Andrea on May 20, marking the record fifth year in a row where a tropical or subtropical cyclone developed before the official start of the season, breaking the previous record of four consecutive years set in 1951\u20131954.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Klotzbach, Philip |user=philklotzbach |number=1130594068851900418 |title=The Atlantic has now had named storms form prior to 1 June in five consecutive years: 2015\u20132019.

After five weeks of inactivity, the tropics began to ramp up in late August with a few storms developing, including [[Hurricane Dorian]], which struck the [[Windward Islands]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]] as a strengthening tropical cyclone and then rapidly intensified into a Category 5 hurricane on approach to [[the Bahamas]], where it devastated the northwesternmost islands before proceeding up the Eastern Seaboard, where it also caused considerable damage.\n\nIn September, [[Tropical Storm Fernand (2019)|Tropical Storm Fernand]] quickly formed near the Mexican coast and proceeded to make landfall in Tamaulipas, Mexico, causing severe flash flooding across the state. [[Hurricane Humberto (2019)|Hurricane Humberto]] brought heavy rains and hurricane-force winds to [[Bermuda]] for the first time since [[Hurricane Nicole (2016)|Hurricane Nicole]] in 2016. [[Tropical Storm Imelda]] quickly formed over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] before it made [[landfall]] in [[Texas]], causing catastrophic flooding as it slowed to a crawl over the state. [[Hurricane Lorenzo (2019)|Lorenzo]] became the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, and the French ship ''Bourbon Rhode'' sank after sailing through it. Additionally, [[Tropical Storm Nestor (2019)|Tropical Storm Nestor]] caused a tornado outbreak across west Florida in mid-October, causing moderate damage to the area affected by [[Hurricane Michael]] the previous year. [[Tropical Storm Olga (2019)|Tropical Storm Olga]] also caused moderate damage and heavy flooding over the Western [[Gulf Coast]]. Hurricane Pablo became the easternmost hurricane formation on record, besting [[Hurricane Vince]]. The season concluded with Tropical Storm Sebastien, a persistent November cyclone. Since [[Hurricane Dorian|Dorian]] and [[Hurricane Lorenzo (2019)|Lorenzo]] both became Category 5 hurricanes, 2019 became the fourth consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane ([[Hurricane Matthew|Matthew]] in 2016; [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] and [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]] in 2017 and [[Hurricane Michael|Michael]] in 2018).

These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of [[University College London]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and [[Colorado State University]] (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the state of the [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, with an [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|accumulated cyclone

As the trough weakened, a [[shortwave (meteorology)|shortwave]] moved into the western side of the trough over the [[Gulf of Mexico]], resulting in the formation of a broad area of low pressure on August 22. The low drifted northwestward, moving over southeastern [[Florida]] on August 24 and degenerating into a trough of low pressure. However, deep convection increased along the trough early on August 26, and a new low developed. This marked the formation of a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on August 26. The depression moved southwestward in response to a mid-level [[High-pressure area|high]] near Florida, although it was poorly-organized due to northwesterly wind shear. Early on August 27, however, a large burst of convection developed, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Erin at 18:00 UTC that day.

Interaction with an upper-level low further compounded negative environmental factors, causing the system to lose a majority of its convection for nearly a day. As the steering regime transitioned to be dictated by a break in the subtropical ridge, Gabrielle curved west-northwest and then north. A decrease in upper-level winds led to the formation of a well-defined inner core, and Gabrielle attained peak winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) on September&nbsp;8. Thereafter, the influence of mid-latitude westerlies caused the cyclone to turn northeast and begin extratropical transition, a process it completed by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;10 well northwest of the Azores.

Moving eastwards, the cyclone quickly gained hurricane-force winds, before weakening as it turned north and west in a large counterclockwise loop, making another smaller loop on its way. On October&nbsp;29, a smaller low-pressure area formed near the center of the original extratropical cyclone, possessing a small wind field more characteristic of a tropical cyclone. Deep convection formed around the center of the new low on October&nbsp;30 due to increased [[atmospheric instability]] despite sea surface temperatures of only {{convert|21|C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. This led to the designation of Subtropical Storm Rebekah by the NHC at 12:00&nbsp;UTC. The system was designated as a subtropical storm due to a lack of both separation with the parent [[Upper-level low]] and significant outflow, which are common characteristic of tropical cyclones. At this time, Rebekah possessed sustained winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h), representing the system's peak intensity. On October&nbsp;31, Rebekah turned to the east then east-northeast, entering a region of low relative humidity, increasing wind shear, and even colder sea surface temperatures. The system rapidly weakened as a result of these unfavorable environmental factors. Rebekah became extratropical once again on November&nbsp;1 at 06:00&nbsp;UTC and dissipated later that day about 115&nbsp;mi (185&nbsp;km) north of the [[Azores]].<ref name=\"RTCR\">{{cite report|author=Stacy R.

Enhanced by a convectively-coupled kelvin wave, the disturbance coalesced over the next few days and was designated as Tropical Storm Sebastien around 06:00&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;19 to the northeast of the Leeward Islands. The system, initially moving west-northwest, curved toward the east-northeast ahead of an approaching upper-level trough. At the same time, Sebastien gradually intensified despite an impinging cold front and moderate wind shear. The cyclone attained peak winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) early on November&nbsp;23, when it exhibited a mid-level eye feature. Significantly colder waters and strong shear soon took their toll on Sebastien, causing it to become an extratropical cyclone by 00:00&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;25. The post-tropical cyclone continued northeast, crossing southwestern Ireland before turning southeast into the Irish Sea and across western England by November&nbsp;27.

[[Tropical Storm Imelda]] quickly formed over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] before it made [[landfall]] in [[Texas]], causing catastrophic flooding as it slowed to a crawl over the state. [[Hurricane Lorenzo (2019)|Lorenzo]] became the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, and the French ship ''Bourbon Rhode'' sank after sailing through it. Additionally, [[Tropical Storm Nestor (2019)|Tropical Storm Nestor]] caused a tornado outbreak across west Florida in mid-October, causing moderate damage to the area affected by [[Hurricane Michael]] the previous year.

These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of [[University College London]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and [[Colorado State University]] (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the state of the [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, with an [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|accumulated cyclone

The low moved eastward over the western Atlantic during the next day as a large area of cloudiness and showers developed to its east, and on May 19, it began to interact with low-level vorticity along the western edge of a dissipating [[cold front]]. The two systems had coalesced into a broad area of low pressure by 12:00 UTC on May 20, and convection associated with the low became better organized throughout that day as the system moved northward. By 22:00 UTC, an [[53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron|Air Force reconnaissance]] flight found that the system had acquired a well-defined center of circulation, and was producing gale-force winds well away from the center. Based on the aircraft data and the structure of the system, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the system became Subtropical Storm Andrea at 18:00 UTC on May 20. However, the cyclone soon began to [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrain]] dry air into its circulation while southwesterly wind shear increased, resulting in a rapid waning of the convection. By 12:00 UTC on May 21, Andrea's convection had dissipated, and the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low.

Kim, who grew up reading Japanese [[manga]] and Korean superhero comics, was looking for a way to get new comics created because he found that there were very few new comics coming out. Kim theorized that [[infinite canvas|tall, scrollable comics]] would work well on the World Wide Web, as users were already used to scrolling through web pages. Because of this unusual layout, Kim initially had difficulty finding artists to create webtoons on his service, but he found that manhwa were willing to do something different because of the poor state of the local manhwa industry.<ref name=BusinessInsider>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/what-is-webtoons-2016-2|work=[[Business Insider]]|title=Millions in Korea are obsessed with these revolutionary comics -- now they're going global|last=Acuna|first=Kristen|date=2016-02-12}}</ref>\n\n===Global launch===\nOn July 2, 2014, the LINE Webtoon website and mobile app were launched worldwide, allowing international artists to upload their own works to the service.

2004. The service gained a large amount of traction during the late 2000s and early 2010s. The service first launched in Korea as '''Naver Webtoon''' and then globally as '''LINE Webtoon''' in July 2014 as the Naver brand is not well known outside the country and some of its services are also not available outside of Korea. In 2016, Naver's webtoon service entered the Japanese market as '''XOY''' and the Chinese market as '''Dongman Manhua'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ametorico.com/manga/xoy/|title=\u7121\u6599\u6f2b\u753b\u30a2\u30d7\u30eaXOY \u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u304c\u6700\u5f37\u306a3\u3064\u306e\u7406\u7531\u3068\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u6f2b\u753b3\u4f5c\u54c1|date=October 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dongmanmanhua.cn.ipaddress.com/|title=\u25b7 Dongmanmanhua.cn Website statistics and traffic analysis &#124; Dongmanmanhua|website=dongmanmanhua.cn.ipaddress.com}}</ref> On December 18, 2018, Naver closed down XOY service in Japan and migrated all of its translated and original webtoons to '''LINE Manga''', its manga service that offers licensed manga.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://xoy.webtoons.com/ja/notice/detail?noticeNo=918|title=\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b :: XOY|website=xoy.webtoons.com}}</ref> In 2019, LINE Webtoon was changed to Webtoons (only in English) and was brought over to the Spanish and French Version.\n\nLINE Webtoon comics can be discovered through the \"daily system\" function, along with being read and downloaded for free on computers and both iOS and Android devices.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://comicbastards.com/comics/an-interview-with-junkoo-kim-creator-of-line-webtoon|title=An Interview With JunKoo Kim Creator of LINE Webtoon|website=Comic Bastards|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/en/2014/773|title=[LINE] LINE Webtoon Released First on Android, Offers Free Comic Content on Smartphones {{!}} LINE Corporation {{!}} News|website=LINE Corporation|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nLINE Webtoon was founded by JunKoo Kim in 2005, under the name \"WEBTOON,\" after he watched the [[manhwa]] industry crash in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Kim, who grew up reading Japanese [[manga]] and Korean superhero comics, was looking for a way to get new comics created because he found that there were very few new comics coming out. Kim theorized that [[infinite canvas|tall, scrollable comics]] would work well on the World Wide Web, as users were already used to scrolling through web pages. Because of this unusual layout, Kim initially had difficulty finding artists to create webtoons on his service, but he found that manhwa were willing to do something different because of the poor state of the local manhwa industry.<ref name=BusinessInsider>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/what-is-webtoons-2016-2|work=[[Business Insider]]|title=Millions in Korea are obsessed with these revolutionary comics -- now they're going global|last=Acuna|first=Kristen|date=2016-02-12}}</ref>\n\n===Global launch===\nOn July 2, 2014, the LINE Webtoon website and mobile app were launched worldwide, allowing international artists to upload their own works to the service.
