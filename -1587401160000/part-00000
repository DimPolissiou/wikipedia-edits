Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces like ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', she always played the boys' roles due to being the tallest in the group and the absence of males in the class. Eventually, she had a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]''; while warming up backstage, she broke her ankle, but then tightened the ribbons on her toe shoes and proceeded to dance the role all the way through before calling for an ambulance. Ultimately she decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and was unable to acquire perfect technique. She explained that she didn't have the ideal body type, lacking the requisite \"beautifully constructed feet\" of high arches, high insteps and a flexible ankle.<ref name=\"MacLaine1996\">{{cite book|last=MacLaine|first=Shirley| title=My Lucky Stars: A Hollywood Memoir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSKjB8WWKoIC |accessdate=April 11, 2011|date=November 1, 1996|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-553-57233-9}}</ref> Also slowly realizing ballet's propensity to be too all-consuming, and ultimately limiting, she moved on to other forms of dancing, acting and musical theater.\n\nShe attended [[Washington-Lee High School]], where she was on the cheerleading squad and acted in school theatrical productions.\n\n==Career==\n===1955\u20131979===\n[[Image:Shirley MacLaine in The Trouble With Harry trailer.jpg|thumb|MacLaine in her debut film ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955)]]\nThe summer before her senior year of high school, MacLaine went to New York City to try acting on Broadway, having minor success in the chorus of ''[[Oklahoma!]]''<ref name=\"sm biography\">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/shirley-maclaine-9393367| title=Shirley MacLaine Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=December 4, 2018}}</ref>   After she graduated, she returned and was in the dancing ensemble of the Broadway production of ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953\u20131954).<ref>{{IBDB name}}</ref> Afterwards she became an understudy to actress [[Carol Haney]] in ''[[The Pajama Game]]''; in May 1954 Haney injured her ankle during a Wednesday matinee, and MacLaine replaced her.<ref>Finstad, Suzanne, ''Warren Beatty: A Private Man'' (2005, NY, Random House) page 106.

Wallis]] saw MacLaine's performance, and signed her to work for [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nMacLaine made her film debut in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955), for which she won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress]]. This was quickly followed by her role in the Martin and Lewis film ''[[Artists and Models]]'' (also 1955). Soon afterwards, she had a role in ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956). This was followed by ''[[Hot Spell (film)|Hot Spell]]'' and a leading role in ''[[Some Came Running (film)|Some Came Running]]'' (both 1958); for the latter film, she gained her first Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination. Her second Oscar nomination came two years later for ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), starring with [[Jack Lemmon]]. The film won five Oscars, including Best Director for [[Billy Wilder]]. She later said, \"I thought I would win for ''The Apartment'', but then, [[Elizabeth Taylor]] had a tracheotomy.\" She starred in ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1961), also starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[James Garner]], based on the play by [[Lillian Hellman]], and directed by [[William Wyler]]. She was again nominated, this time for ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon. [[Don Siegel]], her director on ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), said of her: \"It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine, and has too much balls. She's very, very hard.\"<ref>Patrick McGilligan, ''Clint: The Life and Legend'' (1999), p. 182</ref> At the peak of her success, she replaced [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964).

She also announced the start up of her label titled MusicLife Recordings and also her ghostwriting for other artist's.\n<!--\"My parents died in \u201999, \u201cMy parents died five months apart shortly after I dropped ''[[Mama Drama]]''. And, my mom was the care-provider for my children. That allowed me to tour and to do the music thing. And my children were relatively young when she died in a car accident. And on top of being extremely devastated and heartbroken, I had to also make the choice to fill my mom\u2019s shoes because she was mom to all of us. So I had to raise the children. That meant I had to go to the P.T.A. meetings and you know, be more proactive in the children\u2019s lives and their extracurricular activities. My mom was also like my biggest fan. I also lost 14 family members in that 18-month period after my parents passed. And I had more personal tragedy before that. Thirty days before my mom was killed, my brother\u2019s father was killed. I had a lot of things going on, a lot of things that I had to deal with. Master P decided to play basketball, clarifying of the origin of the tank\u2019s decline once the [[No Limit Records]] CEO decided to play in the [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]] and tryout for teams in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. \"There was a breakdown in the family unit at No Limit as well as my own personal tragedy. I never had a contract with P\" Mia would reveal. \"We really & truly were brothers and sisters in the game. And at that time you know, he was pursuing basketball anyway. And he was totally understanding to what had happened. He had a close relationship with my mom. So he understood the pain that I was in. He understood that I really wasn\u2019t gonna be able to just come in and record and go on tour. And he wasn\u2019t really doing much of that himself anyway. He had decided to pursue a whole thing in basketball. And, No Limit, we was used to being just together. It was a family unit. We were very close. And when he decided to play basketball he had to bring in an unfamiliar staff. And so a lot of things just started to like breakdown. So, it wasn\u2019t a situation where he was feeling like, you\u2019re at the height of your career and I can\u2019t let you go. He was like, damn, her whole family is dead. I signed a couple of confidentiality clauses and I still continued to write for other artists,\" she revealed. I just didn\u2019t make any music for myself\u2026 I never stopped writing, I just had to fall back to be a mom. It wasn\u2019t No Limit artists, it was all\u2026high-profile artists. I was focused on my little sister \u2013 it\u2019s two of us,\u201d explained Mia. She had just graduated from university when my mom died and entered her master\u2019s program. And then she went on to medical school. I\u2019m happy to say that today she is a doctor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics. o, you know, I had to be Mama Mia for real. I had to really, really walk it like I talk it. That\u2019s what was going on with me. Now, Ashley\u2019s a doctor. And my children, my son Sean & my daughter Tye are grownups, 22 and 20\u2026 I had always put in the back of my mind that when the kids were grown and stable that I definitely was gonna throw my hat back in the ring. My love is Hip Hop. I fell in love with Hip Hop in \u201979. I started rockin\u2019 mics in \u201984. I put out my first record in \u201992, hooked up with [[Master P]] when he came back home from Richmond, California for a visit to New Orleans in \u201994\u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted to be a rapper, ever since I heard Angie Stone [of the group] Sequence [who scored a hit in] 'Funk You Up.' When I heard Sha Rock of [[Funky 4 + 1]] spit, I wanted to be a rapper. I realized girls could do it. And, this is my heart. This is truly my heart. And so now I\u2019m able to freely record music and put it out and just do the damn thing. I\u2019m a cook, breaking down her unique album title, \u201cand most people in the game they know me for cooking just like they know me for music. My family had a catering company [for] 50 years. We are known in New Orleans for being a long line of great cooks\u2026 So, okay you know Betty Crocker is a popular baker and original recipe creator. So I am Betty Rocka, because I can cook and at the same time I spit that crack. And on the streets, when people get into the street game they aspire to have keys. So as far as this game goes, I\u2019m the locksmith. I\u2019m also linking up with my old road member from 1984, [[Mannie Fresh]], and he is blessing me with a beat. I\u2019m gon\u2019 be working with [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]]. He\u2019s blessing me with a verse. [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]] is blessing me with a verse. So, I\u2019m very happy with the way that ''Betty Rocka Locksmith'' is coming together. Unladylike is not about being uncoof, it\u2019s about having an unladylike flow,\u201d Mia explained. It\u2019s about going against all odds, and when people hear you they have to respect you for the contribution you making to the game. And not just because you\u2019re cute, or not just because you like to pose and you like to shop. Unladylike is a representation of the real pitbulls of the game\u2026 Unladylike is a state of mind, and that\u2019s what the mixtape is all about.\"--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10197/title.mia-x-talks-her-hiatus-and-new-music|title=Mia X Talks Her Hiatus And New Music|author=|date=November 28, 2009|work=HipHopDX|accessdate=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606224639/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10197/title.mia-x-talks-her-hiatus-and-new-music|archive-date=June 6, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2010/04/mia-x-been-through-the-storm/ |title=Mia X, Been Through the Storm - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-16}}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2014, Mia X released a new single titled \"Mr. Right\" featuring artist Ms. Tasha via her label Mama Mia Muzic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mr.-right-feat.-ms.-tasha/id889998996 |title=Mr. Right (feat.

And, my mom was the care-provider for my children. That allowed me to tour and to do the music thing. And my children were relatively young when she died in a car accident. And on top of being extremely devastated and heartbroken, I had to also make the choice to fill my mom\u2019s shoes because she was mom to all of us. So I had to raise the children. That meant I had to go to the P.T.A. meetings and you know, be more proactive in the children\u2019s lives and their extracurricular activities. My mom was also like my biggest fan. I also lost 14 family members in that 18-month period after my parents passed. And I had more personal tragedy before that. Thirty days before my mom was killed, my brother\u2019s father was killed. I had a lot of things going on, a lot of things that I had to deal with. Master P decided to play basketball, clarifying of the origin of the tank\u2019s decline once the [[No Limit Records]] CEO decided to play in the [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]] and tryout for teams in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. \"There was a breakdown in the family unit at No Limit as well as my own personal tragedy. I never had a contract with P\" Mia would reveal. \"We really & truly were brothers and sisters in the game. And at that time you know, he was pursuing basketball anyway. And he was totally understanding to what had happened. He had a close relationship with my mom. So he understood the pain that I was in. He understood that I really wasn\u2019t gonna be able to just come in and record and go on tour. And he wasn\u2019t really doing much of that himself anyway. He had decided to pursue a whole thing in basketball. And, No Limit, we was used to being just together. It was a family unit. We were very close. And when he decided to play basketball he had to bring in an unfamiliar staff. And so a lot of things just started to like breakdown. So, it wasn\u2019t a situation where he was feeling like, you\u2019re at the height of your career and I can\u2019t let you go. He was like, damn, her whole family is dead. I signed a couple of confidentiality clauses and I still continued to write for other artists,\" she revealed. I just didn\u2019t make any music for myself\u2026 I never stopped writing, I just had to fall back to be a mom. It wasn\u2019t No Limit artists, it was all\u2026high-profile artists. I was focused on my little sister \u2013 it\u2019s two of us,\u201d explained Mia. She had just graduated from university when my mom died and entered her master\u2019s program. And then she went on to medical school. I\u2019m happy to say that today she is a doctor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics. o, you know, I had to be Mama Mia for real. I had to really, really walk it like I talk it. That\u2019s what was going on with me. Now, Ashley\u2019s a doctor. And my children, my son Sean & my daughter Tye are grownups, 22 and 20\u2026 I had always put in the back of my mind that when the kids were grown and stable that I definitely was gonna throw my hat back in the ring. My love is Hip Hop. I fell in love with Hip Hop in \u201979. I started rockin\u2019 mics in \u201984. I put out my first record in \u201992, hooked up with [[Master P]] when he came back home from Richmond, California for a visit to New Orleans in \u201994\u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted to be a rapper, ever since I heard Angie Stone [of the group] Sequence [who scored a hit in] 'Funk You Up.' When I heard Sha Rock of [[Funky 4 + 1]] spit, I wanted to be a rapper. I realized girls could do it. And, this is my heart. This is truly my heart. And so now I\u2019m able to freely record music and put it out and just do the damn thing. I\u2019m a cook, breaking down her unique album title, \u201cand most people in the game they know me for cooking just like they know me for music. My family had a catering company [for] 50 years. We are known in New Orleans for being a long line of great cooks\u2026 So, okay you know Betty Crocker is a popular baker and original recipe creator. So I am Betty Rocka, because I can cook and at the same time I spit that crack. And on the streets, when people get into the street game they aspire to have keys. So as far as this game goes, I\u2019m the locksmith. I\u2019m also linking up with my old road member from 1984, [[Mannie Fresh]], and he is blessing me with a beat.

It was also his first album to be released under a slight change to his stage name \"Snoop Dogg\" for contractual reasons.\n\n== Background ==\n{{more sources needed|section|date=August 2019}}\nIn September 1996, shortly before the release of Snoop's second album ''Tha Doggfather'', his friend and label-mate at Death Row Records, [[Tupac Shakur]], was [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murdered in a drive-by shooting]] that many fans and other rappers believed to be a part of [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry|rising tensions between the East and West Coast hip hop scenes]].\n\nIn March 1997, noted East Coast rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], who was popularly known as \"Biggie\", was [[Murder of The Notorious B.I.G.|also murdered in a drive-by shooting]] which was also attributed by fans to the tensions between the coastal hip hop scenes.\n\nSnoop Dogg began to fear for his own safety due to the murders of Tupac and Biggie and also because Death Row Records was acknowledged by its artists in retrospect to be an unprofessional place during this time, with label founder [[Suge Knight]] incarcerated and many people with criminal pasts associated with the label.\n\nIn 1997, No Limit rapper [[Mystikal]] invited Snoop to be on his record ''[[Unpredictable (Mystikal album)|Unpredictable]]'' on a song called \"Gangstas\" with label head [[Master P]].\n\nSnoop developed a good relationship with the No Limit rappers and after another guest appearance on No Limit artist [[Silkk the Shocker]]'s LP, Snoop was reported to have been signed to No Limit by Master P in March 1998.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/14/arts/label-reports-signing-snoop-doggy-dogg.html|title=Label Reports Signing Snoop Doggy Dogg|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=1998-03-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Snoop said at the time that: \"Snoop Dogg is universal so he can fit into any camp-especially a camp that knows how to handmake shit[;] [a]nd, No Limit hand makes material.
