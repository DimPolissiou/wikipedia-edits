Music in the store is in the [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC) format, which is the MPEG-4-specified successor to MP3. Originally, songs were only available with DRM and were encoded at 128 kbit/s. At the January 2009 Macworld Expo, Apple announced that all iTunes music would be made available without DRM, and encoded at the higher-quality rate of 256&nbsp;kbit/s. Previously, this model, known as \"iTunes Plus\", had been available only for music from EMI and some independent labels. Users can sample songs by listening to previews, ninety seconds in length, or thirty seconds for short tracks.\n\nIn addition, the iTunes Store offers apps, which are applications used for various purposes (games, productivity, news, etc.) that are compatible with the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad, although some apps are specifically for the iPhone or iPad only. Some Apps cost money (called \"Paid Apps\") and some are free (called \"Free Apps\"). Developers can decide which prices they want to charge for apps, from a pre-set list of pricing tiers, from free to several hundred dollars. When someone downloads an App, 70 percent of the purchase goes to the developer(s), and 30 percent goes to Apple.<ref name=\"appleiosprogram\">[https://developer.apple.com/programs/whats-included/ iOS Developer Program Website], Retrieved October 22, 2017 ''[[Apple Inc.]]''</ref>\n\nAt the Macworld 2008 keynote, [[Steve Jobs]], who was Apple's CEO at the time, announced iTunes movie rentals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipod.about.com/b/2008/01/15/macworld-keynote-coverage.htm|title=Macworld: New iPhone Software, iTunes Video Rentals, Updated AppleTV|accessdate=April 28, 2009|work=[[About.com]]}}</ref> Movies are available for rent in the iTunes Store on the same day they are released on DVD,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/05/01/apple_expected_to_announce_new_movie_sales_in_itunes.html|title=AppleInsider, Apple Announces same day as DVD release iTunes movies sales|accessdate=June 12, 2009|work=AppleInsider}}</ref> though the iTunes Store also offers for rental some movies that are still in theaters.

Free content can vary from a preview of a show to bonus content to pilot episodes and entire seasons of TV shows (examples of free seasons include HBO's ''The Weight of the Nation'' and ABC's ''Pan-Am''). Some networks, such as ABC and NBC, have their own pages of \"Free Season Premieres\".\n\nWhile previously the US iTunes Store has offered as many as three free songs each week (the single of the week, Discovery Download, and Canci\u00f3n de la Semana) in recent years, the store has instead replaced the three aforementioned categories with a unified \"Single of the Week\" banner, with the week's single being from a new up and coming artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1517419 |title=Free iTunes 2013 \u2013 MacRumors Forums |publisher=MacRumors |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref>  In 2015, Apple discontinued the \"Single of the Week\" program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ends-single-of-the-week-2015-1|title=It Seems Apple Has Ended Its 'Single of the Week' Promotion After 11 Years|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Current model====\n\n=====Music=====\n\n*A song usually costs 99\u00a2; however, for songs with high popularity, the price is usually raised to $1.29.

Artwork can be obtained for songs not purchased from the store for free if the user has an iTunes Store account. Purchased songs do not come with lyrics, nor does iTunes provide a service for acquiring the missing lyrics. However, several third-party applications exist to locate and automatically add lyrics to the user's music.\n\n====\"Album Only\" songs====\nSome songs are available from the store by \"Album Only\", meaning the song can only be acquired through the purchase of the entire album, whereas most songs can be downloaded separately from the album they belong to.\n\nSongs above 10 minutes in length are by default Album Only songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/06/the-itunes-download-model-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it/|title=The iTunes Download Model Is Broken\u2014Here's How to Fix It|author=Allan Ripp|work=[[The New York Observer]]|publisher=Observer Media|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> However, this is not universally true; for example, ''Living in the Heart of the Beast'' by Henry Cow is 16 minutes and 18 seconds, yet is available for individual purchase as of December 24, 2013. Soundtracks also often have many Album Only tracks.\n\nSometimes, the 10-minute restriction works in an artist's favor. Examples of this include Prince's ''Lovesexy'' and the deluxe version of Phoenix's ''Bankrupt!'', which both have an album as a single track instead of being separate, (in Prince's case, the track ''was'' the album, while in Phoenix's case, it was a collection of demos and outtakes) forcing the buyer to buy the album itself.\n\nMovie soundtracks normally include songs owned by many different labels, making licensing more complex. For example, ''[[Forrest Gump (soundtrack)|Forrest Gump: The Soundtrack]]'' includes songs from [[Peacock Records]], [[Argo Records]], and [[Capitol Records]], among many others. ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|Greatest Hits]]'' by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] has only one song, \"[[Higher Ground (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Higher Ground]]\", that is not available for download on a per song basis, whilst ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' ([[Britney Spears]]' 2008 album) has two songs that are available for album download only, ''Rock Me In'' and ''Phonography''.\n\n==== Partial Albums ====\nSome albums area available from the store by \"Partial Album\", meaning that albums cannot be entirely purchased, but that one or more of the tracks that can be purchased on the physical CD version of them aren't included, e.g. possible due to licensing issues.\n\n====\"Work Only\" songs====\nSome tracks are listed as \"Work Only\", which means they can only be obtained by purchasing the entire piece of work (within the album); the tracks cannot be bought as singles. Works are generally pieces of classical music: symphonies, string quartets, etc., in multiple movements.\n\n====\"LP\" format====\nIn September 2009, Apple introduced the [[iTunes LP]] format (known pre-launch by the code name \"Cocktail\")<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosoff |first=Matt |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-10347849-27.html |title=New iTunes LP format is live |publisher=CNET |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref> which features visual, interactive content alongside album tracks and lyrics.\n\n====Store Sections====\nWhen entering the US music store, there are multiple sections one can visit. Music is divided into genres (Alternative, Classical, Jazz, Soundtrack, etc.), and there are a number of links to other sections of the store under the Quick Links header. These include Recommended for You, Complete My Album, iTunes LP, as well as thematic sections, such as iTunes Festival sections.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, Apple created a category for Latino and Hispanic content, \"iTunes Latino\". Telemundo and Mun2 made some of their popular programs available for purchase, becoming the first Hispanic television content in the store. It offers music, music videos, audiobooks, podcasts and television shows in Spanish in a single concentrated area. The brief descriptions given to the content are in Spanish as well as several subcategories.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/11/01/apple-announces-itunes-latino-telemundo-and-mun2-in-itunes-stor/|title=Apple Announces iTunes Latino, Telemundo and mun2 in iTunes Store|author=David Chartier|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 1, 2006|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref> [[Gibraltar]]ian [[Flamenco]] [[Heavy metal music|Metal]] band [[Breed 77]], released an exclusive album called [[Un Encuentro]] to coincide with the launch of \"iTunes Latino\". It features 11 songs, all from previous albums, but all sung in Spanish.\n\nIn 2012, Apple created Mastered for iTunes. When iTunes launched, the decision was made to standardize on AAC instead of the more popular MP3 format on the supposition that it offers better quality compared to other codecs at similar bit rates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mastered for iTunes: Music as the Artist and Sound Engineer Intended |url=https://images.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/docs/mastered_for_itunes.pdf |website=Apple |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}</ref> Mastered for iTunes (MFiT) is a procedure developed by Apple specifically for Mastering Engineers to follow. This set of tools allows Mastering Engineers to audition Apple's proprietary encoding during the mastering process to take into account how music will eventually interact with Apple's encoding. In addition to auditioning the encoder, there is also a tool (called afclip) that processes the audio file and creates a text file for audio clips. Because of this special encoding process, extra attention must be paid to headroom and inter-sample peaking while mastering.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hybrid Studios Mastering \u2013 Online Mastering Services \u2013 Free Sample of Services |url=https://www.hybridstudiosca.com/mastering/ |website=Hybrid Studios |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}</ref> In August 2019 it was announced that the Mastered for iTunes program would be rebranded as Apple Digital Masters. With the rebranding the high resolution masters are now available with Apple Music through streaming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/|title=iTunes - Apple Digital Masters - Apple|website=www.apple.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> It is speculated that the rebranded came because the functionality of iTunes would be changing in MacOS Catalina and there for the Mastered for iTunes name no longer made sense.\n\n=== Digital rights management ===\nWhile most downloaded files initially included usage restrictions enforced by [[FairPlay]], Apple's implementation of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), iTunes later initiated a shift into selling [[DRM-free]] music in most countries, marketed as iTunes Plus. On January 6, 2009, Apple announced that DRM had been removed from 80% of its music catalog in the US.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7813527.stm|title=Apple to end music restrictions|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=January 5, 2010|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Full iTunes Plus availability was achieved in the US on April 7, 2009, coinciding with the introduction of a three-tiered pricing model;<ref name=\"eng-pricing\">{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/07/itunes-store-now-infected-with-variable-pricing-amazon-still-0/|title=iTunes Store now infected with variable pricing, Amazon still $0.99|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref> however, television episodes, many books, and films are still [[FairPlay]]-protected.\n\n==Censorship==\n{{main|Censorship by Apple|Censorship of the iTunes Store}}\n\nThere is a policy of censoring [[profanity]] in titles on iTunes.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/27/itunes-swear-words-censorship The songs that are too rude for iTunes], Michael Cragg, ''[[The Guardian]]'' October 27, 2008 .

Often there will be a \"clean\" mark next to the title of some songs, meaning the lyrics have been censored, and is available to purchase on all accounts. Generally if a song is marked \"clean\" there is an explicit version available as well.\n\n==Reception and commercial success==\n[[File:ITunes Store Songs Sales.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sales of iTunes songs, 2003\u20132010.]]\nIn the first 18 hours, the iTunes store sold about 275,000 tracks,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/itunes-store-history-2438593|title=Looking Back at the History of Apple's iTunes Store|newspaper=Lifewire|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxuXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA158|title=Modern Trends Surrounding Information Technology Standards and Standardization within Organizations|last=Kai|first=Jakobs|date=2014-07-31|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6333-6|language=en}}</ref> and more than 1 million tracks were sold in its first 5 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB105214495077652700|title=Apple's Online Music Store Makes Strong Debut|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|date=May 5, 2003|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> When released for Windows in October 2003, iTunes was downloaded more than 1 million times in the first 3 days, selling more than 1 million songs in that period.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} On December 15, 2003, Apple announced that it had sold 25 million songs.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/12/15iTunes-Music-Store-Downloads-Top-25-Million-Songs.html|title=iTunes Music Store Downloads Top 25 Million Songs|website=Newsroom|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=December 15, 2003|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004 at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo]] in San Francisco, Steve Jobs announced (Sellers, 2004) that an unnamed person had purchased US$29,500 worth of music. On March 15, 2004, Apple announced that iTunes Music Store customers had purchased and downloaded 50 million songs from iTunes Music Store. A song sold on iTunes gives the artist 9 cents in profit. They also reported that customers were purchasing 2.5 million songs a week which translates to a projected annual run rate of 130 million songs a year. The 50 millionth song was \"The Path of Thorns\" by [[Sarah McLachlan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=iTunes Music Store Downloads Top 50 Million Songs|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/mar/15itunes.html|date=March 15, 2004|access-date=February 17, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218113843/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/mar/15itunes.html|archive-date=February 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 2004, iTunes Music Store marked its first anniversary with 70 million songs sold, clear dominance in the paid online music market and a slight profit.<ref>{{cite news|author=Markoff, John |date=April 29, 2004 |title=Apple Sells 70 Million Songs in First Year of ITunes Service |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/29/technology/29apple.html |access-date=February 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722054122/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/29/technology/29apple.html |archive-date=July 22, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The store also offers hundreds of movie trailers and music videos, in an attempt to boost soundtrack sales. In the conference, [[Steve Jobs]] reiterated that a subscription service is still not in the interest of customers and reported that only 5 million of the 100 million songs offered in the [[Pepsi]] giveaway campaign were redeemed, which he blamed on technical problems in Pepsi distribution. According to an Apple [[News release|press release]] dated August 10, 2004, iTunes Music Store was the first store to have a catalog of more than one million songs.<ref>{{cite web|title=iTunes Music Store Catalog Tops One Million Songs|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/aug/10itms.html|date=August 10, 2004|access-date=February 17, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209114047/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/aug/10itms.html|archive-date=February 9, 2006}}</ref> Also, iTunes Music Store at that point maintained a 70 percent market share of legal music downloads.\n\nThe emerging monopoly of the store was criticized in 2011 by [[Mike Lang (film executive)|Mike Lang]] of [[Miramax]] for \"effectively strangling the industry\".

Music in the store is in the [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC) format, which is the MPEG-4-specified successor to MP3. Originally, songs were only available with DRM and were encoded at 128 kbit/s. At the January 2009 Macworld Expo, Apple announced that all iTunes music would be made available without DRM, and encoded at the higher-quality rate of 256&nbsp;kbit/s. Previously, this model, known as \"iTunes Plus\", had been available only for music from EMI and some independent labels. Users can sample songs by listening to previews, ninety seconds in length, or thirty seconds for short tracks.\n\nIn addition, the iTunes Store offers apps, which are applications used for various purposes (games, productivity, news, etc.) that are compatible with the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad, although some apps are specifically for the iPhone or iPad only. Some Apps cost money (called \"Paid Apps\") and some are free (called \"Free Apps\"). Developers can decide which prices they want to charge for apps, from a pre-set list of pricing tiers, from free to several hundred dollars. When someone downloads an App, 70 percent of the purchase goes to the developer(s), and 30 percent goes to Apple.<ref name=\"appleiosprogram\">[https://developer.apple.com/programs/whats-included/ iOS Developer Program Website], Retrieved October 22, 2017 ''[[Apple Inc.]]''</ref>\n\nAt the Macworld 2008 keynote, [[Steve Jobs]], who was Apple's CEO at the time, announced iTunes movie rentals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipod.about.com/b/2008/01/15/macworld-keynote-coverage.htm|title=Macworld: New iPhone Software, iTunes Video Rentals, Updated AppleTV|accessdate=April 28, 2009|work=[[About.com]]}}</ref> Movies are available for rent in the iTunes Store on the same day they are released on DVD,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/05/01/apple_expected_to_announce_new_movie_sales_in_itunes.html|title=AppleInsider, Apple Announces same day as DVD release iTunes movies sales|accessdate=June 12, 2009|work=AppleInsider}}</ref> though the iTunes Store also offers for rental some movies that are still in theaters.

Free content can vary from a preview of a show to bonus content to pilot episodes and entire seasons of TV shows (examples of free seasons include HBO's ''The Weight of the Nation'' and ABC's ''Pan-Am'').

However, at Macworld 2009, Apple issued a software update which automatically allowed 3G and EDGE users to access the store's full functionality for files smaller than 10 megabytes (MB).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipod.about.com/b/2009/01/06/apple-ditches-itunes-drm-adds-variable-prices-3g-downloads.htm|title=Apple Ditches iTunes DRM, Adds Variable Prices, 3G Downloads|access-date=April 28, 2009|work=[[About.com]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202162358/http://ipod.about.com/b/2009/01/06/apple-ditches-itunes-drm-adds-variable-prices-3g-downloads.htm|archive-date=December 2, 2009}}</ref> The [[iOS version history#3.0|iOS 3.0 update]] added the ability to download movies, TV shows, audiobooks, iTunes U, and ringtones on mobile devices, in addition to the previously available songs and podcasts.

Songs from more than 2,000 [[independent record label|independent labels]] were added later, the first being from [[The Orchard (music label)|The Orchard]] on June 24, 2003.\n\nAs of 2017, the iTunes Store offers over 43 million songs,<ref name=37Million>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/12Apple-Unveils-New-iTunes.html|title=Apple Unveils New iTunes |publisher=Apple|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"itunesstoremainpage\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/lae/itunes/music/|title=Apple \u2013 iTunes|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2017-09-13}}</ref> including exclusive tracks from numerous artists. Not all artists are available on iTunes, but many holdouts, such as Led Zeppelin and Radiohead, have allowed their music to be sold on the iTunes Store in recent years. New songs are added to iTunes catalog on a daily basis, and the iTunes Store is updated each Tuesday.\n\nDownloaded songs come with song information (name, artist, album) already filled out, though iTunes provides a free service by [[Gracenote]] to do this for songs not purchased from the store, although they must be imported with iTunes. Songs that have an entry in the iTunes Store also come with album artwork (Artwork is embedded in the metadata). Artwork can be obtained for songs not purchased from the store for free if the user has an iTunes Store account. Purchased songs do not come with lyrics, nor does iTunes provide a service for acquiring the missing lyrics. However, several third-party applications exist to locate and automatically add lyrics to the user's music.\n\n====\"Album Only\" songs====\nSome songs are available from the store by \"Album Only\", meaning the song can only be acquired through the purchase of the entire album, whereas most songs can be downloaded separately from the album they belong to.\n\nSongs above 10 minutes in length are by default Album Only songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/06/the-itunes-download-model-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it/|title=The iTunes Download Model Is Broken\u2014Here's How to Fix It|author=Allan Ripp|work=[[The New York Observer]]|publisher=Observer Media|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> However, this is not universally true; for example, ''Living in the Heart of the Beast'' by Henry Cow is 16 minutes and 18 seconds, yet is available for individual purchase as of December 24, 2013. Soundtracks also often have many Album Only tracks.\n\nSometimes, the 10-minute restriction works in an artist's favor. Examples of this include Prince's ''Lovesexy'' and the deluxe version of Phoenix's ''Bankrupt!'', which both have an album as a single track instead of being separate, (in Prince's case, the track ''was'' the album, while in Phoenix's case, it was a collection of demos and outtakes) forcing the buyer to buy the album itself.\n\nMovie soundtracks normally include songs owned by many different labels, making licensing more complex. For example, ''[[Forrest Gump (soundtrack)|Forrest Gump: The Soundtrack]]'' includes songs from [[Peacock Records]], [[Argo Records]], and [[Capitol Records]], among many others. ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|Greatest Hits]]'' by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] has only one song, \"[[Higher Ground (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Higher Ground]]\", that is not available for download on a per song basis, whilst ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' ([[Britney Spears]]' 2008 album) has two songs that are available for album download only, ''Rock Me In'' and ''Phonography''.\n\n==== Partial Albums ====\nSome albums area available from the store by \"Partial Album\", meaning that albums cannot be entirely purchased, but that one or more of the tracks that can be purchased on the physical CD version of them aren't included, e.g. possible due to licensing issues.\n\n====\"Work Only\" songs====\nSome tracks are listed as \"Work Only\", which means they can only be obtained by purchasing the entire piece of work (within the album); the tracks cannot be bought as singles. Works are generally pieces of classical music: symphonies, string quartets, etc., in multiple movements.\n\n====\"LP\" format====\nIn September 2009, Apple introduced the [[iTunes LP]] format (known pre-launch by the code name \"Cocktail\")<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosoff |first=Matt |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-10347849-27.html |title=New iTunes LP format is live |publisher=CNET |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref> which features visual, interactive content alongside album tracks and lyrics.\n\n====Store Sections====\nWhen entering the US music store, there are multiple sections one can visit. Music is divided into genres (Alternative, Classical, Jazz, Soundtrack, etc.), and there are a number of links to other sections of the store under the Quick Links header. These include Recommended for You, Complete My Album, iTunes LP, as well as thematic sections, such as iTunes Festival sections.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, Apple created a category for Latino and Hispanic content, \"iTunes Latino\". Telemundo and Mun2 made some of their popular programs available for purchase, becoming the first Hispanic television content in the store. It offers music, music videos, audiobooks, podcasts and television shows in Spanish in a single concentrated area. The brief descriptions given to the content are in Spanish as well as several subcategories.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/11/01/apple-announces-itunes-latino-telemundo-and-mun2-in-itunes-stor/|title=Apple Announces iTunes Latino, Telemundo and mun2 in iTunes Store|author=David Chartier|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 1, 2006|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref> [[Gibraltar]]ian [[Flamenco]] [[Heavy metal music|Metal]] band [[Breed 77]], released an exclusive album called [[Un Encuentro]] to coincide with the launch of \"iTunes Latino\". It features 11 songs, all from previous albums, but all sung in Spanish.\n\nIn 2012, Apple created Mastered for iTunes. When iTunes launched, the decision was made to standardize on AAC instead of the more popular MP3 format on the supposition that it offers better quality compared to other codecs at similar bit rates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mastered for iTunes: Music as the Artist and Sound Engineer Intended |url=https://images.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/docs/mastered_for_itunes.pdf |website=Apple |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}</ref> Mastered for iTunes (MFiT) is a procedure developed by Apple specifically for Mastering Engineers to follow. This set of tools allows Mastering Engineers to audition Apple's proprietary encoding during the mastering process to take into account how music will eventually interact with Apple's encoding. In addition to auditioning the encoder, there is also a tool (called afclip) that processes the audio file and creates a text file for audio clips. Because of this special encoding process, extra attention must be paid to headroom and inter-sample peaking while mastering.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hybrid Studios Mastering \u2013 Online Mastering Services \u2013 Free Sample of Services |url=https://www.hybridstudiosca.com/mastering/ |website=Hybrid Studios |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}</ref> In August 2019 it was announced that the Mastered for iTunes program would be rebranded as Apple Digital Masters. With the rebranding the high resolution masters are now available with Apple Music through streaming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/|title=iTunes - Apple Digital Masters - Apple|website=www.apple.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> It is speculated that the rebranded came because the functionality of iTunes would be changing in MacOS Catalina and there for the Mastered for iTunes name no longer made sense.\n\n=== Digital rights management ===\nWhile most downloaded files initially included usage restrictions enforced by [[FairPlay]], Apple's implementation of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), iTunes later initiated a shift into selling [[DRM-free]] music in most countries, marketed as iTunes Plus. On January 6, 2009, Apple announced that DRM had been removed from 80% of its music catalog in the US.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7813527.stm|title=Apple to end music restrictions|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=January 5, 2010|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Full iTunes Plus availability was achieved in the US on April 7, 2009, coinciding with the introduction of a three-tiered pricing model;<ref name=\"eng-pricing\">{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/07/itunes-store-now-infected-with-variable-pricing-amazon-still-0/|title=iTunes Store now infected with variable pricing, Amazon still $0.99|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref> however, television episodes, many books, and films are still [[FairPlay]]-protected.\n\n==Censorship==\n{{main|Censorship by Apple|Censorship of the iTunes Store}}\n\nThere is a policy of censoring [[profanity]] in titles on iTunes.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/27/itunes-swear-words-censorship The songs that are too rude for iTunes], Michael Cragg, ''[[The Guardian]]'' October 27, 2008 .

Often there will be a \"clean\" mark next to the title of some songs, meaning the lyrics have been censored, and is available to purchase on all accounts. Generally if a song is marked \"clean\" there is an explicit version available as well.\n\n==Reception and commercial success==\n[[File:ITunes Store Songs Sales.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sales of iTunes songs, 2003\u20132010.]]\nIn the first 18 hours, the iTunes store sold about 275,000 tracks,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/itunes-store-history-2438593|title=Looking Back at the History of Apple's iTunes Store|newspaper=Lifewire|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxuXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA158|title=Modern Trends Surrounding Information Technology Standards and Standardization within Organizations|last=Kai|first=Jakobs|date=2014-07-31|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6333-6|language=en}}</ref> and more than 1 million tracks were sold in its first 5 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB105214495077652700|title=Apple's Online Music Store Makes Strong Debut|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|date=May 5, 2003|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> When released for Windows in October 2003, iTunes was downloaded more than 1 million times in the first 3 days, selling more than 1 million songs in that period.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} On December 15, 2003, Apple announced that it had sold 25 million songs.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/12/15iTunes-Music-Store-Downloads-Top-25-Million-Songs.html|title=iTunes Music Store Downloads Top 25 Million Songs|website=Newsroom|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=December 15, 2003|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004 at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo]] in San Francisco, Steve Jobs announced (Sellers, 2004) that an unnamed person had purchased US$29,500 worth of music.

They also reported that customers were purchasing 2.5 million songs a week which translates to a projected annual run rate of 130 million songs a year.

The weak party also enjoys protection from exploitation according to Norwegian consumer laws.\n*The iTunes Store's use of [[Digital rights management]] limits the number of devices purchased songs can be played on.\n*iTunes' contract entitles the company to at any time change the terms of the contract without notice, including the selection of players or software that must be used for iTunes files, and also the number of times a customer can change or copy already purchased files.\n*The EULA is both vague and hard to understand for the customers.\n*The EULA states that the legal relationship between the company and customers is regulated by English contract law. It is unreasonable to expect Norwegian consumers to have comprehensive knowledge of [[English law]]. Products marketed to Norwegian consumers in Norway are subject to [[Law of Norway|Norwegian law]]\u2014a right that cannot be waived by a clause in a company's standard customer contract.\n*The EULA removes iTunes' responsibility regarding damage to the consumer's computer caused by software errors even though responsibility cannot be waived in Scandinavian Law.\n\nApple responded July 31, 2006.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060813083037/http://www.forbrukerombudet.no/asset/2445/1/2445_1.pdf Apple response], Simonsen Advokatfirma DA ([[PDF]])</ref>\n\nOn January 22, 2007, German and French consumer groups joined forces with Norway and Finland.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070125230229/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/01/23/europe.itunes.ap/index.html European consumer organisations join forces in legal dispute over iTunes Music Store].

The group has released six full-length studio albums and are currently a five piece with lead vocalist Brook Reeves as one of the two original remaining members along with Manny Contreras who left the band in 2010 but returned in 2012. The band refers to their style of music as \"Gorship\", which is described by Reeves as \"Worshiping [[God]] through our gore-sounding music\".\n\n== History ==\nGuitarist Manny Contreras and vocalist Brook Reeves started Impending Doom together on October 31, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/impendingdoom/about/?ref=page_internal|title=Impending Doom \u2014 About|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}</ref> The band practiced with their sound before writing enough songs to record their demo, ''The Sin and Doom of Godless Men''. After this release, Greg Pewthers joined as a third guitarist after also leaving Oblige. Later that year, bassist Jon Alfaro left the band and David Sittig was added to the line-up in his replacement. Chris Forno also left and was never replaced. Andy Hegg later took the place of Bueno and the band recorded the album ''[[Nailed. Dead. Risen.]]'' after getting signed to [[Facedown Records]]. Due to drummer Andy Hegg's dedication to his soccer scholarship, Impending Doom was forced to employ substitute drummers for the tours that supported the album. Since then touring drummer Chad Blackwell became the official drummer for the band, during which Greg Pewthers returned to Oblige (a band later known as The Devastated), and was replaced by Cory Johnson, formerly of [[Sleeping Giant (band)|Sleeping Giant]].\n\nThe group signed to Facedown Records in January 2007,<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=65797]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and their debut release for the label, ''Nailed.

Sometime after the release, drummer Chad Blackwell, a native of Pensacola, Florida, left the band to attend the Atlanta Institute of Music, to which Impending Doom asked former member Isaac Bueno to rejoin.\n\nThe band refers to its style of [[Christian metal]] as \"Gorship\" \u2013 a [[portmanteau]] of [[Graphic violence|gore]] and [[worship]].<ref>[http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/nov2007/impendingdoom.aspx Impending Doom: Brutal Death Metallers Will Scare the Devil Out of You]. [[Decibel Magazine]]. Accessed December 19, 2007.</ref> The band also clarify on their [[MySpace]] [[blog]] that \"Gorship\" is their way of worshiping God through their gore sounding music; not worshiping \"gore\" as some are led to believe. Impending Doom released their second album, ''The Serpent Servant'', on March 31, 2009 which has hit number 3 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref name=\"Billboard Chart Positions\"/> Their third album, ''[[There Will Be Violence]]'', was released on July 20, 2010. Sometime during the recording of the new album, both Manny Contreras and Isaac Bueno left the band for unknown reasons. Since then the band brought Brandon Trahan (formerly of Mirror of Dead Faces, [[xDEATHSTARx]]) into the line-up but have yet to find another permanent guitarist. The band has been on the Thrash and Burn tour 2010 with [[Through the Eyes of the Dead]], [[Kittie (band)|Kittie]], [[Born of Osiris]], [[Asking Alexandria]] and more. They've toured with [[MyChildren MyBride]], [[The Crimson Armada]], [[Chimaira]], and other bands.\n\nThe band also created their own symbol called the \"Repentagram\" combining the words repent and [[pentagram]]. The band explained the Repentagram with the following:\n<blockquote>We\u2019ve gotten a lot of mail questioning the Repentagram Logo, I would like to take time right now to explain it to you all. First off we are a Christian band and a real one at that, we would never put something out that had satanic meaning or anything negative. We thought up the word \"REPENTAGRAM\" basically putting two words together. 1. REPENT (meaning: to feel such sorrow for sin or fault as to be disposed to change one\u2019s life for the better; be penitent.) 2. PENTAGRAM (which in the dark metal world is a satanic symbol.) Since we are a Christian death metal band we wanted to think up something clever; thus the Repentagram came into thought. It is not the same amount of sides as a pentagram, we are going for making a Christian death metal symbol. Just like we created the word \"GORSHIP\" (which as you all should know, does NOT mean worship gore, it means worshiping God through our Gore sounding music) the Repentagram is just the new word. Please pass this information along to anyone you may know that thinks anything more than it really is.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}</blockquote>\n\n''[[Baptized in Filth]]'' was produced by Andreas Magnusson who produced [[Oh, Sleeper]]'s album ''[[Children of Fire]]'' and was mixed by Machine. The album is focused in [[God]], [[Satan]] and [[Number of the Beast|the Number of the Beast; 666]]. The first single is \"For the Wicked\" and the first video is \"Murderer\". A few months after the release of \"Baptized in Filth\", Cory Johnson was fired from the band and was replaced by former founding member Manny Contreras, who had become a member of Oblige (later known as The Devastated) during his time off from Impending Doom. Johnson soon after being fired join fellow [[Christian metal]] band, [[Mychildren Mybride]].\n\nLead vocalist, Brook Reeves, was one of the many vocalists that performed at the Mitch Lucker Memorial Show on December 21, 2012 with [[Suicide Silence]] in honor of their deceased vocalist, Mitch Lucker, who died on November 1, 2012. Reeves performed the song \"Ending Is the Beginning\", off the 2005 ''[[Suicide Silence EP]]''.

The group has released six full-length studio albums and are currently a five piece with lead vocalist Brook Reeves as one of the two original remaining members along with Manny Contreras who left the band in 2010 but returned in 2012. The band refers to their style of music as \"Gorship\", which is described by Reeves as \"Worshiping [[God]] through our gore-sounding music\".\n\n== History ==\nGuitarist Manny Contreras and vocalist Brook Reeves started Impending Doom together on October 31, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/impendingdoom/about/?ref=page_internal|title=Impending Doom \u2014 About|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}</ref> The band practiced with their sound before writing enough songs to record their demo, ''The Sin and Doom of Godless Men''. After this release, Greg Pewthers joined as a third guitarist after also leaving Oblige. Later that year, bassist Jon Alfaro left the band and David Sittig was added to the line-up in his replacement. Chris Forno also left and was never replaced. Andy Hegg later took the place of Bueno and the band recorded the album ''[[Nailed. Dead. Risen.]]'' after getting signed to [[Facedown Records]]. Due to drummer Andy Hegg's dedication to his soccer scholarship, Impending Doom was forced to employ substitute drummers for the tours that supported the album. Since then touring drummer Chad Blackwell became the official drummer for the band, during which Greg Pewthers returned to Oblige (a band later known as The Devastated), and was replaced by Cory Johnson, formerly of [[Sleeping Giant (band)|Sleeping Giant]].\n\nThe group signed to Facedown Records in January 2007,<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=65797]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and their debut release for the label, ''Nailed.

Sometime after the release, drummer Chad Blackwell, a native of Pensacola, Florida, left the band to attend the Atlanta Institute of Music, to which Impending Doom asked former member Isaac Bueno to rejoin.\n\nThe band refers to its style of [[Christian metal]] as \"Gorship\" \u2013 a [[portmanteau]] of [[Graphic violence|gore]] and [[worship]].<ref>[http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/nov2007/impendingdoom.aspx Impending Doom: Brutal Death Metallers Will Scare the Devil Out of You]. [[Decibel Magazine]]. Accessed December 19, 2007.</ref> The band also clarify on their [[MySpace]] [[blog]] that \"Gorship\" is their way of worshiping God through their gore sounding music; not worshiping \"gore\" as some are led to believe. Impending Doom released their second album, ''The Serpent Servant'', on March 31, 2009 which has hit number 3 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref name=\"Billboard Chart Positions\"/> Their third album, ''[[There Will Be Violence]]'', was released on July 20, 2010. Sometime during the recording of the new album, both Manny Contreras and Isaac Bueno left the band for unknown reasons. Since then the band brought Brandon Trahan (formerly of Mirror of Dead Faces, [[xDEATHSTARx]]) into the line-up but have yet to find another permanent guitarist. The band has been on the Thrash and Burn tour 2010 with [[Through the Eyes of the Dead]], [[Kittie (band)|Kittie]], [[Born of Osiris]], [[Asking Alexandria]] and more. They've toured with [[MyChildren MyBride]], [[The Crimson Armada]], [[Chimaira]], and other bands.\n\nThe band also created their own symbol called the \"Repentagram\" combining the words repent and [[pentagram]]. The band explained the Repentagram with the following:\n<blockquote>We\u2019ve gotten a lot of mail questioning the Repentagram Logo, I would like to take time right now to explain it to you all. First off we are a Christian band and a real one at that, we would never put something out that had satanic meaning or anything negative. We thought up the word \"REPENTAGRAM\" basically putting two words together. 1. REPENT (meaning: to feel such sorrow for sin or fault as to be disposed to change one\u2019s life for the better; be penitent.) 2. PENTAGRAM (which in the dark metal world is a satanic symbol.) Since we are a Christian death metal band we wanted to think up something clever; thus the Repentagram came into thought. It is not the same amount of sides as a pentagram, we are going for making a Christian death metal symbol. Just like we created the word \"GORSHIP\" (which as you all should know, does NOT mean worship gore, it means worshiping God through our Gore sounding music) the Repentagram is just the new word. Please pass this information along to anyone you may know that thinks anything more than it really is.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}</blockquote>\n\n''[[Baptized in Filth]]'' was produced by Andreas Magnusson who produced [[Oh, Sleeper]]'s album ''[[Children of Fire]]'' and was mixed by Machine. The album is focused in [[God]], [[Satan]] and [[Number of the Beast|the Number of the Beast; 666]]. The first single is \"For the Wicked\" and the first video is \"Murderer\". A few months after the release of \"Baptized in Filth\", Cory Johnson was fired from the band and was replaced by former founding member Manny Contreras, who had become a member of Oblige (later known as The Devastated) during his time off from Impending Doom. Johnson soon after being fired join fellow [[Christian metal]] band, [[Mychildren Mybride]].\n\nLead vocalist, Brook Reeves, was one of the many vocalists that performed at the Mitch Lucker Memorial Show on December 21, 2012 with [[Suicide Silence]] in honor of their deceased vocalist, Mitch Lucker, who died on November 1, 2012. Reeves performed the song \"Ending Is the Beginning\", off the 2005 ''[[Suicide Silence EP]]''.

The diaspora is concentrated in places that were part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Countries such as [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Brazil]], [[Belize]], [[Haiti]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the rest of [[Europe]].\n\n==Origins (1402\u20131521)==\n[[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], under the reign of [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]], began the colonization of the [[Canary Islands]] in 1402, authorizing under feudal agreement to [[Normandy|Norman]] noblemen [[Jean de B\u00e9thencourt]]. The conquest of the Canary Islands, inhabited by [[guanches|Guanche]] people, was only finished when the armies of the [[Crown of Castille]] won, in long and bloody wars, the islands of [[Gran Canaria]] (1478\u20131483), La Palma (1492\u20131493) and [[Tenerife]] (1494\u20131496).\n\nThe marriage of the ''{{lang|es|[[Catholic Monarchs|Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]}}'' ([[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]]) created a [[personal union|confederation of reigns]], each with their own administrations, but ruled by a common monarchy. According to [[Henry Kamen]], it was only after centuries of a common rule that these separated realms formed a fully unified state.\n\nIn 1492, Spain drove out the last Moorish king of Granada. After their victory, the [[Catholic monarchs]] negotiated with [[Christopher Columbus]], a [[Genoa|Genoese]] sailor attempting to reach [[Cipangu]] by sailing west. Castile was already engaged in a [[Age of Exploration|race of exploration]] with Portugal to reach the [[Far East]] by sea when Columbus made his bold proposal to Isabella. Columbus instead inadvertently \"discovered\" the [[Americas]], inaugurating the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of the continents]]. The [[Indies]] were reserved for Castile.\n\n[[File:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and his Spanish crew arriving in the [[New World]].]]\n\n==Age of Discovery==\nAfter the [[Age of Discovery]], the Spanish were the earliest and one of the largest communities to emigrate out of Europe, and the [[Spanish Empire]]'s expansion during the first half of the 16th century saw an \"extraordinary dispersion of the Spanish people\", with particular concentrations \"in North and South America\".\n\nThe Spanish Empire was \"built on waves of migration overseas by Spanish people\" who left Spain and \"reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures\" in the Americas. As a result of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, what became Latin America was \"easily the greatest single destination of emigrant Spanish\".\n\n== List of countries by population of Spanish descent==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"r|-\n! style=\"width:23%;\"|Country || Hispanic population || % of country||Reference || Criterion\n|-\n| [[Spanish Argentine|Argentina]] || 25,000,000 || The majority of Argentines have at least partial Spanish ancestry. || {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} ||\n|-\n| [[Spanish Mexican|Mexico]] || 110,700,000 || 90 + ||<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico |title=Mexico \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=10 July 2010}}</ref> || estimated: 17% as ''[[White Mexican|White]]'' and 70-75% as ''[[mestizo]]s''.\n|-\n| [[Spanish Chilean|Chile]] || 15,623,289 || 88.9 || <ref name=CIA>{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Chile |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |location=Langley, Virginia |year=2016 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> || (''White''/''Spanish+mestizo'')\n|-\n| [[Spanish Brazilian|Brazil]] || 8,000,000\u201320,000,000 || 4.2\u20138 || <ref>[http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Brasilia/es/MenuPpal/NotaPaisBrasil/Paginas/notapais_brasil.aspx Embassy's Country Note on Brazil mentioning that 20 million Brazilians are of Spanish descent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426050456/http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Brasilia/es/MenuPpal/NotaPaisBrasil/Paginas/notapais_brasil.aspx |date=2009-04-26 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.schwartzman.org.br/simon/pdf/origem.pdf www.schwartzman.org.br]</ref> ||\n|-\n| [[White Colombian|Colombia]] || 39,000,000 || 86 || {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} || \n|-\n| [[Spanish immigration to Cuba|Cuba]] || 10,050,849 || 88.9 ||<ref name=census>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubagob.cu/otras_info/censo/tablas_html/ii_3.htm|title=Census of population and homes|publisher=Government of Cuba|date=16 September 2002|language=Spanish|accessdate=7 September 2009}}</ref>|| self-description as ''white'', ''mulatto'' and ''mestizo''\n|-\n| [[Spanish Peruvian|Peru]] || 18,600,000 || 60 ||  {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} || \n|-\n| [[Spanish Guatemalan|Guatemala]] || 9,341,517 || 58 || {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} || ''[[Ladino people|Ladinos]]'' (non-indigenous)\n|-\n| [[Spanish Salvadoran|Salvador]] || 6,170,769 || 99 || {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} ||  \n|-\n| [[Nicaraguans#Ethnic groups|Nicaragua]] || 5,056,114 -

Their motives were basically economic: Bethencourt possessed textile factories and dye works and the Canaries offered a source of dyes such as the [[orchil]] lichen.\nThe treaty settled disputes between Castile and Portucalense County over the control of the Atlantic, in which Castilian control of the Canary islands was recognized but which also confirmed Portuguese possession of the Azores, Madeira, the Cape Verde islands and gave them rights to lands discovered and to be discovered...and any other island which might be found and conquered from the Canary islands beyond toward Guinea.\n\nThe [[Castilians]] continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native [[Guanches]], complete pacification was not achieved until 1495, when [[Tenerife]] and [[La Palma]] were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]]. After that, the Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].\n\nThe islands were conquered by mostly [[Andalusia]]ns and some [[Crown of Castile|Castilians]] at the beginnings of the 15th century.

Between the 15th and 19th centuries, the [[Spanish Empire]] was the sole colonial power in the territories that became Argentina after the 1816 [[Argentine declaration of independence]]. Thus, before 1816, a great part of the [[European peoples|European]] settlers in Argentina were from Spain, and they carried the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial]] administration, including religious affairs, government, and commercial business. A substantial Spanish-descended [[Criollo people|Criollo]] population gradually built up in the new cities, while some mixed with the [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|indigenous populations]] (''[[Mestizos]]''), with the [[African immigration to Latin America|black slave population]] (''[[Mulattoes]]''), or with other European immigrants.\nSince a great part of the immigrants to Argentina before the mid-19th century were of Spanish descent, and the fact that a significative part of the late-19th century/early-20th century immigrants to Argentina were Spaniards, the vast majority of [[Argentinian people|Argentinians]] are of mostly Spanish ancestry. However, this prevalence and the numerous shared cultural aspects between Argentina and Spain (the [[Spanish language]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Criollo people|Criollo]]/[[Hispanic]] traditions), massive [[Immigration to Argentina]] at the turn of the 20th century involved a majority of non-Spanish peoples from all over Europe.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{main|Spanish Brazilians|Spanish immigration to Brazil}}\nSpanish immigration was the third largest among immigrant groups in Brazil; about 750,000 immigrants entered Brazil from Spanish ports (a number smaller only than that of Argentina and Cuba after the independence of Latin American countries).<ref name=\"Entrada de estrangeiros no Brasil\">[http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/rsp/v8s0/03t2.gif Entrada de estrangeiros no Brasil]</ref> Numbers of Spaniards coming to Brazil before independence are unknown, but they had a presence, particularly more significant during the [[Iberian Union]] period and in [[S\u00e3o Paulo state]]. During the dynastic union between Portugal and Spain (1580\u20131640), many Spaniards settled in Brazil, particularly in S\u00e3o Paulo. As a consequence, there is a large number of Brazilian descendants of these early settlers, especially since the early inhabitants of S\u00e3o Paulo explored and settled in other parts of Brazil. The descendants of Bartolomeu Bueno de Ribeira, born in Seville around 1555, who settled in S\u00e3o Paulo around 1583, marrying Maria Pires, are an example of it.<ref>GeneAll.net [http://www.geneall.net/H/per_page.php?id=338361 Bartolomeu Bueno de Ribeira]</ref> Afonso Taunay, in his book dealing with early S\u00e3o Paulo, ''[[S\u00e3o Paulo in the XVI century]]'', mentions also Baltazar de Godoy, Francisco de Saavedra, Jusepe de Camargo, Martin Fernandes Ten\u00f3rio de Aguilar, Bartolomeu de Quadros, among others. In his genealogical account of the settling of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Pedro Taques de Almeida Paes Leme, also mentions the three Rendon brothers, Juan Matheus Rendon, Francisco Rendon de Quebedo and Pedro Matheus Rendon Cabeza de Vaca, as well as Diogo Lara, form [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]].

[[Silva Leme]], in his work ''Genealogia Paulistana'' (\"Paulistana Genealogy\"), addresses several of these families.<ref>http://buratto.org/paulistana/</ref> Brazilian censuses do not research \"ethnic origins\" or ancestry, which makes it very difficult to give accurate numbers of Brazilians of Spanish descent.

In 1510, there were 10,000 Spaniards in the colony of Santo Domingo, and it rose to over 20,000 in 1520.  During the eighteenth century, there were French colonists that settled in many Spanish towns, particularly in [[Santiago de los Caballeros]]; by 1730 they accounted for 25% of the population. In 1718 a Royal Decree ordered the expel of the French people from Santo Domingo. The Grand Mayor of Santiago, Antonio Pichardo Vinuesta, refused to obey the decree arguing that most of the Frenchmen had married local Spanish women and therefore, their expulsion would damage the economy of the [[Cibao|Cibao Region]]. The Grand Mayor Pichardo was tried and imprisoned in the city of Santo Domingo, but in the next year, the [[Council of the Indies]] reasoned in favor of Pichardo and decided a pardon to the Frenchmen. In 1720-1721, a revolt in Santiago against a new tax on [[beef]] exports to the Saint Domingue, arose [[Francization|Frenchification]] fears in the [[Santo Domingo]] elite; Captain-General Fernando Constanzo, governor of the Santo Domingo, accused the Cibaenian elite of seeking to annex their province to France. After the failed plans of the Spanish Monarchy to expel the French colonists, the Monarchy decided to actively encourage the mass settlement of Spanish families in the colony. Over the nineteenth century, the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo was the subject of a mass migration of Spaniards, most of whom came from the Canary Islands.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=James J.|date=1983/04|title=The Migration of Canary Islanders to the Americas: An Unbroken Current Since Columbus|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/americas/article/migration-of-canary-islanders-to-the-americas-an-unbroken-current-since-columbus/B99EF224555F9873BF2015BE4C42747F|journal=The Americas|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=447\u2013481|doi=10.1017/S0003161500050173|issn=0003-1615}}</ref> Due to this migration, it decreased the amount of non-whites in the colony with the black population dropping to 12%, the mulatto population to 8%, and the quadroons to 31%\n\nIn present times the majority of the descendants of these Spaniards can be found in the North or Cibao Region of Dominican Republic, representing a significant portion of the population in Provinces such as Valverde, Espaillat, Hermanas Mirabal, La Vega and specially in Santiago; but other places with important white minorities include Distrito Nacional, La Romana, Bonao, San Felipe de Puerto Plata, Punta Cana Village and Santa Cruz de Barahona.

The main component responsible was the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]] which led to immigrants from some 74 countries arriving. Included were hundreds of [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|Corsican]], [[French immigration to Puerto Rico|French]], [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Irish]], [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|German]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Maltese people|Maltese]] and Portuguese families moving to the island. Some countries were represented by only a few (51 [[Chinese immigration to Puerto Rico|Chinese]] individuals for example). The country that still sent the most people was Spain.\n\nFrom the start of colonization, other groups from [[Catalonia]], [[Asturias]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Majorca]] had also immigrated, although the [[Canarian people]] formed the basis. Once the 19th century came, things changed drastically. According to Puerto Rican authors such as Cifre de Loubriel who researched the immigration wave patterns made to the island, during the 19th century the greatest number of Spaniards that came to the island with their families were Catalans and Mallorcans from the nearby [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean regions]].\n\nThe second most common Spanish region with the largest numbers were the Galicians and Asturians, and the third regions were Canary Islanders, Basques and [[Andalusians]]. The [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Galicians]], [[Majorcans]] and [[Asturians]] would come with whole families most of the time. There were regions of the island that attracted some immigrants more than others which was mainly for political or economic reasons.\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Spanish Americans}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|+\n|-----\n!colspan=6|Immigration to the United States<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VNCX6UsdZYkC&pg=PA393&lpg=PA393&dq=spanish+immigration+to+united+states+68,611+20,433&source=bl&ots=2mzTjLeR41&sig=FZGWMNssdCC-0w5wUcC9bnDKbpE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GEmdVcyWJovcUYHVroAJ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=spanish%20immigration%20to%20united%20states%2068%2C611%2020%2C433&f=false Encyclopedia of North American Immigration By John Powell]</ref>\n|-----\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Years\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Arrivals\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Years\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Arrivals\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Years\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Arrivals\n|-----\n| 1820&ndash;1830||2,616||1891&ndash;1900||8,731||1961&ndash;1970||44,659\n|-----\n|1831&ndash;1840||2,125||1901&ndash;1910||27,935||1971&ndash;1980||39,141\n|-----\n|1841&ndash;1850||2,209||1911&ndash;1920||68,611||1981&ndash;1990||20,433\n|-----\n|1851&ndash;1860||9,298||1921&ndash;1930||28,958||1991&ndash;2000||17,157\n|-----\n|1861&ndash;1870||6,697||1931&ndash;1940||3,258||2001&ndash;2005||6,052\n|-----\n|1871&ndash;1880||5,266||1941&ndash;1950||2,898|||||\n|-----\n|1881&ndash;1890||4,419||1951&ndash;1960||7,894||||\n|-----\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:right;\"| Total number of arrivals (183 years): '''305,797'''\n|}\nThe Spanish are one of the longest-established [[European Americans|European-American]] groups with a continuous presence in [[Florida]] since 1565<ref name=loc>{{cite web |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/colonial/jb_colonial_augustin_1.html |title=A Spanish Expedition Established St. Augustine in Florida |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> and are the eighth-largest (choosing the term \"Spaniard\") [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] group in the United States of America. In addition, a substantial proportion of Americans are also of Spanish descent indirectly via a Latin American country due to Spanish colonialism, although the term \"Spanish-American\" is used only to refer to Americans whose ancestry originates entirely or partially from [[Spain]].\nThey are found in large concentrations in five major states from 1940 through the early twenty-first century. In 1940, the highest concentration of Spaniards were in [[New York (state)|New York]] (primarily [[New York City]]), followed by [[California]], [[Florida]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nImmigration to the United States from Spain was minimal but steady during the first half of the nineteenth century, with an increase during the 1850s and 1860s resulting from the social disruption of the Carlist civil wars. Much larger numbers of Spanish immigrants entered the country in the first quarter of the twentieth century\u201427,000 in the first decade and 68,000 in the second\u2014due to the same circumstances of rural poverty and urban congestion that led other Europeans to emigrate in that period, as well as unpopular wars. The Spanish presence in the United States declined sharply between 1930 and 1940 from a total of 110,000 to 85,000. Many immigrants moved either back to Spain or to another country.\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|caption_align=center\n| image1 =  Mabel Alvarez.jpg|width1=144| caption1 = [[Mabel Alvarez]] Prominent American artist\n| image2 = Rita Hayworth - 1940.JPG|width2=136| caption2 = Actress [[Rita Hayworth]]\n| image3 = Adele Mara (The Tiger Women-1945).jpg|width3=154| caption3 = Actress [[Adele Mara]]\n| image4 =  Martin Sheen 1987.jpg|width4=126|caption4 = Actor [[Martin Sheen]]\n| image5 =  George Santayana.jpg|width5=145|caption5 = Philosopher [[George Santayana]] \n| image6 =  Admiral Farragut2.jpg|width6=120|caption6 = Union Admiral [[David Farragut]]\n}}\n\n====Number of Spanish Americans====\nIn the 2013 [[American Community Survey]], 759,781 people that reported \"Spaniard\", 652,884 were native USA-born and 106,897 were foreign-born. 65.3% of the foreign-born were born in Europe, 25.1% were born in [[Latin America]], 8.3% from [[Asia]], 0.6% in [[Northern America]], 0.5% in [[Africa]] and 0.1% in [[Oceania]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Spaniard: POPULATION PROFILE IN THE UNITED STATES - 2013 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |access-date=2015-07-12 }}</ref>\n* Spanish \u2013 505,254<ref name=\"factfinder.census.gov\"/>\n* Spanish American \u2013 21,540<ref name=\"factfinder.census.gov\"/>\n\n====2010 Census====\nThe [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]] is the 23rd and most recent United States [[United States Census|national census]].

However, this prevalence and the numerous shared cultural aspects between Uruguay and Spain (the [[Spanish language]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Criollo people|Criollo]]/[[Hispanic]] traditions), massive [[Immigration to Uruguay]] at the turn of the 20th century involved a majority of non-Spanish peoples from all over Europe.\n\n===Venezuela===\n{{main|Spanish immigration to Venezuela}}\nSpanish immigration to Venezuela began with the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], and continued during [[Colonial Venezuela]] and, after independence in 1830, during the nineteenth century.

After their victory, the [[Catholic monarchs]] negotiated with [[Christopher Columbus]], a [[Genoa|Genoese]] sailor attempting to reach [[Cipangu]] by sailing west. Castile was already engaged in a [[Age of Exploration|race of exploration]] with Portugal to reach the [[Far East]] by sea when Columbus made his bold proposal to Isabella. Columbus instead inadvertently \"discovered\" the [[Americas]], inaugurating the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of the continents]]. The [[Indies]] were reserved for Castile.\n\n[[File:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and his Spanish crew arriving in the [[New World]].]]\n\n==Age of Discovery==\nAfter the [[Age of Discovery]], the Spanish were the earliest and one of the largest communities to emigrate out of Europe, and the [[Spanish Empire]]'s expansion during the first half of the 16th century saw an \"extraordinary dispersion of the Spanish people\", with particular concentrations \"in North and South America\".\n\nThe Spanish Empire was \"built on waves of migration overseas by Spanish people\" who left Spain and \"reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures\" in the Americas.

Their motives were basically economic: Bethencourt possessed textile factories and dye works and the Canaries offered a source of dyes such as the [[orchil]] lichen.\nThe treaty settled disputes between Castile and Portucalense County over the control of the Atlantic, in which Castilian control of the Canary islands was recognized but which also confirmed Portuguese possession of the Azores, Madeira, the Cape Verde islands and gave them rights to lands discovered and to be discovered...and any other island which might be found and conquered from the Canary islands beyond toward Guinea.\n\nThe [[Castilians]] continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native [[Guanches]], complete pacification was not achieved until 1495, when [[Tenerife]] and [[La Palma]] were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]]. After that, the Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].\n\nThe islands were conquered by mostly [[Andalusia]]ns and some [[Crown of Castile|Castilians]] at the beginnings of the 15th century. In 1402, they began to subdue the native [[Guanches|Guanche]] population and the Guanches were initially enslaved and gradually absorbed by the Spanish colonizers.\n\nAfter subsequent settlement by Spaniards and other [[European ethnic groups|European peoples]], mainly [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], the remaining Guanches were gradually diluted by the settlers and their culture largely vanished. [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]], conqueror of Tenerife and La Palma, oversaw extensive immigration to these islands during a short period from the late 1490s to the 1520s from mainland Europe, and immigrants included [[Galicians]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castilians]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Italy|Italians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Basque people|Basques]] and [[Flanders|Flemings]]. At subsequent judicial enquiries, Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo was accused of favoring [[Genoa|Genoese]] and Portuguese immigrants over Castilians.<ref>[http://www.ing.iac.es/PR/lapalma/history.html History of La Palma<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Equatorial Guinea===\n{{main|Spanish Equatoguineans}}\n{{Section empty|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Americas==\n===Argentina===\n{{main|Spanish Argentines}}\n[[File:Argentina - Misiones - Ober\u00e1 - Fiesta del Inmigrante 2014 - Desfile Inaugural 26.JPG|thumb|[[Immigrant's Festival]] in [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], Argentina]]\nSpanish settlement in Argentina, that is the arrival of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] emigrants in [[Argentina]], took place firstly in the period before Argentina's independence from Spain, and again in large numbers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Between the 15th and 19th centuries, the [[Spanish Empire]] was the sole colonial power in the territories that became Argentina after the 1816 [[Argentine declaration of independence]]. Thus, before 1816, a great part of the [[European peoples|European]] settlers in Argentina were from Spain, and they carried the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial]] administration, including religious affairs, government, and commercial business. A substantial Spanish-descended [[Criollo people|Criollo]] population gradually built up in the new cities, while some mixed with the [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|indigenous populations]] (''[[Mestizos]]''), with the [[African immigration to Latin America|black slave population]] (''[[Mulattoes]]''), or with other European immigrants.\nSince a great part of the immigrants to Argentina before the mid-19th century were of Spanish descent, and the fact that a significative part of the late-19th century/early-20th century immigrants to Argentina were Spaniards, the vast majority of [[Argentinian people|Argentinians]] are of mostly Spanish ancestry. However, this prevalence and the numerous shared cultural aspects between Argentina and Spain (the [[Spanish language]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Criollo people|Criollo]]/[[Hispanic]] traditions), massive [[Immigration to Argentina]] at the turn of the 20th century involved a majority of non-Spanish peoples from all over Europe.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{main|Spanish Brazilians|Spanish immigration to Brazil}}\nSpanish immigration was the third largest among immigrant groups in Brazil; about 750,000 immigrants entered Brazil from Spanish ports (a number smaller only than that of Argentina and Cuba after the independence of Latin American countries).<ref name=\"Entrada de estrangeiros no Brasil\">[http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/rsp/v8s0/03t2.gif Entrada de estrangeiros no Brasil]</ref> Numbers of Spaniards coming to Brazil before independence are unknown, but they had a presence, particularly more significant during the [[Iberian Union]] period and in [[S\u00e3o Paulo state]]. During the dynastic union between Portugal and Spain (1580\u20131640), many Spaniards settled in Brazil, particularly in S\u00e3o Paulo. As a consequence, there is a large number of Brazilian descendants of these early settlers, especially since the early inhabitants of S\u00e3o Paulo explored and settled in other parts of Brazil. The descendants of Bartolomeu Bueno de Ribeira, born in Seville around 1555, who settled in S\u00e3o Paulo around 1583, marrying Maria Pires, are an example of it.<ref>GeneAll.net [http://www.geneall.net/H/per_page.php?id=338361 Bartolomeu Bueno de Ribeira]</ref> Afonso Taunay, in his book dealing with early S\u00e3o Paulo, ''[[S\u00e3o Paulo in the XVI century]]'', mentions also Baltazar de Godoy, Francisco de Saavedra, Jusepe de Camargo, Martin Fernandes Ten\u00f3rio de Aguilar, Bartolomeu de Quadros, among others. In his genealogical account of the settling of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Pedro Taques de Almeida Paes Leme, also mentions the three Rendon brothers, Juan Matheus Rendon, Francisco Rendon de Quebedo and Pedro Matheus Rendon Cabeza de Vaca, as well as Diogo Lara, form [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]]. Spaniards from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] also settled in Brazil during that time, like [[Jorge de Barros]], for example.<ref>http://www.projetocompartilhar.org/SAESPp/jorgedebarros1615.htm</ref> The family names Bueno, Godoy, Lara, Saavedra, Camargo, etc., tracing back to these early settlers, are quite popular throughout [[Southeast Brazil]], [[Southern Brazil]] and the [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]]. [[Silva Leme]], in his work ''Genealogia Paulistana'' (\"Paulistana Genealogy\"), addresses several of these families.<ref>http://buratto.org/paulistana/</ref> Brazilian censuses do not research \"ethnic origins\" or ancestry, which makes it very difficult to give accurate numbers of Brazilians of Spanish descent. The only reliable research available is the 1998 July PME, the scope of which, however, is limited (it covers only six metropolitan regions), resulting in probably skewed results, as it includes the metropolitan regions of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, and Salvador, probably the most important concentrations of Brazilians of Spanish descent.<ref>Elda Evangelina Gonz\u00e1les Mart\u00ednez.

In 1510, there were 10,000 Spaniards in the colony of Santo Domingo, and it rose to over 20,000 in 1520.  During the eighteenth century, there were French colonists that settled in many Spanish towns, particularly in [[Santiago de los Caballeros]]; by 1730 they accounted for 25% of the population. In 1718 a Royal Decree ordered the expel of the French people from Santo Domingo. The Grand Mayor of Santiago, Antonio Pichardo Vinuesta, refused to obey the decree arguing that most of the Frenchmen had married local Spanish women and therefore, their expulsion would damage the economy of the [[Cibao|Cibao Region]]. The Grand Mayor Pichardo was tried and imprisoned in the city of Santo Domingo, but in the next year, the [[Council of the Indies]] reasoned in favor of Pichardo and decided a pardon to the Frenchmen.

The main component responsible was the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]] which led to immigrants from some 74 countries arriving. Included were hundreds of [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|Corsican]], [[French immigration to Puerto Rico|French]], [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Irish]], [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|German]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Maltese people|Maltese]] and Portuguese families moving to the island.

The [[Presidency of Harry S. Truman|Truman Administration]] promulgated the [[Tripartite Declaration of 1950]] for these reasons, as well as to guarantee the territorial ''status quo'' determined by [[1949 Armistice Agreements]]. Israel's main military patron at the time was [[France]], which supported Israel by providing it with advanced military equipment and technology, such as the [[Dassault Myst\u00e8re]] [[fighter-bomber]] aircraft. Initially, the U.S. government resisted pressure by Israel and [[Arab]] countries in the region to sell them advanced weapons. In response to the supply of advanced fighter aircraft by the [[USSR]] to [[Iraq]] and the [[United Arab Republic]], the U.S. government agreed to sell [[MIM-23 Hawk]] anti-aircraft missiles to Israel in 1962, as a \"specific action designed to meet a specific situation\" which \"by no means constitutes change in U.S. policy in area.\". The Hawk system was approved on the grounds that it was a \"purely defensive\" weapon.<ref name=\"FRU_9_14_62\"/> Later, when [[Jordan]] threatened to turn to the [[USSR]] for weapons, the U.S. agreed to sell tanks and jet aircraft to Jordan in order to prevent the spread of Soviet influence, and in return, agreed to sell similar systems to Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/arms4.html |title=U.S. Promises Arms Sale To Israel That Balances Sale to Jordan (March 1965) |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date=1965-03-11 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1960s, the U.S. government sought to establish a regional arms limitation agreement in the Middle East. The initiative lost steam in early 1965 after it was disclosed that the U.S. had been indirectly supplying weapons to Israel via [[West Germany]] since 1962, under the terms of a 1960 secret agreement to supply Israel with $80 million worth of armaments. The remainder of the agreement was fulfilled publicly, following its disclosure by the U.S., with Israel receiving shipments of [[M48 Patton]] tanks in 1965 and [[A-4E Skyhawk]] attack aircraft in 1968.<ref>Mitchell Geoffrey Bard, ''The Water's Edge and Beyond: defining the limits to domestic influence on U.S. Middle East policy''.

In 1968, with strong support from [[United States Congress|Congress]], U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] approved the sale of [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighters to Israel, establishing the precedent for U.S. support for Israel's [[Qualitative Military Edge|qualitative military edge]] over its neighbors.

Over 22,000 tons of [[tank]]s, [[artillery]], [[ammunition]], and other [[materiel]] were delivered to aid the Israeli military in response to a large-scale Soviet resupply effort of the Arab states. The operation was paralleled by a large-scale sealift of some 33,000 tons of materiel and the transfer of 40 F-4 Phantoms, 36 A-4 Skyhawks and twelve [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft to replace Israeli war losses.<ref>Simon Dunstan, ''The Yom Kippur War 1973: The Sinai'', p. 67.

The [[Presidency of Harry S.

Israel's main military patron at the time was [[France]], which supported Israel by providing it with advanced military equipment and technology, such as the [[Dassault Myst\u00e8re]] [[fighter-bomber]] aircraft. Initially, the U.S. government resisted pressure by Israel and [[Arab]] countries in the region to sell them advanced weapons. In response to the supply of advanced fighter aircraft by the [[USSR]] to [[Iraq]] and the [[United Arab Republic]], the U.S. government agreed to sell [[MIM-23 Hawk]] anti-aircraft missiles to Israel in 1962, as a \"specific action designed to meet a specific situation\" which \"by no means constitutes change in U.S. policy in area.\".

The remainder of the agreement was fulfilled publicly, following its disclosure by the U.S., with Israel receiving shipments of [[M48 Patton]] tanks in 1965 and [[A-4E Skyhawk]] attack aircraft in 1968.<ref>Mitchell Geoffrey Bard, ''The Water's Edge and Beyond: defining the limits to domestic influence on U.S. Middle East policy''.
