The leucine zipper is formed by [[amphipathic]] interaction between two ZIP domains. The ZIP domain is found in the alpha-helix of each monomer, and contains leucines, or leucine-like amino acids. These amino acids are spaced out in each region's polypeptide sequence in such a way that when the sequence is coiled in a 3D alpha-helix, the leucine residues line up on the same side of the helix. This region of the alpha-helix- containing the leucines which line up- is called a ZIP domain, and leucines from each ZIP domain can weakly interact with leucines from other ZIP domains, reversibly holding their alpha-helices together (dimerization). When these alpha helices dimerize, the zipper is formed. The [[hydrophobic]] side of the helix forms a dimer with itself or another similar helix, burying  the non-polar amino acids away from the [[solvent]]. The [[hydrophilic]] side of the helix interacts with the water in the solvent.\n \nLeucine zipper motifs are considered a subtype of [[coiled coil]]s, which are built by two or more alpha helices that are wound around each other to form a [[supercoil]].

This suggests that, as heterodimers, bZIP transcription factors are able to change their preferences for which location they target in the DNA.

If they are overproduced or mutated in a vital area, they may cause [[cancer]].\n\n=== BZIP containing transcription factors regulate various biological processes ===\nThe bZIP-containing Nuclear factor interleukin 3 regulated protein ([[NFIL3]]) is a transcription repressor which play multiple roles in regulating various biological processes. The NFIL3 protein has 462 amino acids including a b-ZIP domain . The N-terminal portion of the domain contains the basic motif, which directly binds to DNA. The C-terminal portion of the b-ZIP domain contains an amphipathic leucine zipper region, which mediates homo- and hetero- dimerization.\n\nThe expression of the ''Nfil3'' gene changes along with the [[circadian cycle]] and the NFIL3, as a repression factor, regulates circadian rhythm. NFIL3 competes with the transcription activator D site albumin promoter binding protein ([[DBP (gene)|DBP]]) in binding with the D box elements in the DNA, which is one of the circadian transcription factor consensus sites. DBP is another bZIP protein and shows an opposite portfolio of expression level to that of NFIL3. When NFIL3 level is high, genes under control of the D box elements will be repressed. Overexpression of ''Nfil3'' shortens the circadian cycle.\n\nNFIL3 influences cell survival and involves in oncogenesis. NFIL3 is shown to be a survival factor that hinders [[apoptotic]] cell death in numerous cell types and leads to oncogenesis. High expression level of NFIL3 is shown associate with breast cancer. In cancer cells, NFIL3 associates with Histone deacetylase2 ([[Histone deacetylase 2|HDAC2]]) and represses pro-apoptotic genes such as Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 10 ([[TRAIL]]) and TNF receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS) to prevent apoptosis. NFIL3 can also hinder apoptosis in cancer cells by binding to DNA and block the access of transcription factor Forkhead box O1 ([[FOXO1]]) to cell death genes, which undermines cell cycle and promotes oncogenesis. In colon cancer, NFIL3 may also block the recruitment of another type of transcription factors, Proline Acid Rich (PAR) proteins.\n\nNFIL3 functions as a repressor to neuron regeneration associated genes. ''Nfil3'' is expressed in neuron cells with regeneration potential to keep cell growth under control. Expression of ''Nfil3'' is induced by phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein ([[CREB]]), and the NFIL3 protein in turn competes for binding sites shared with CREB and CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein ([[CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins|CEBP]]), which downregulates target genes of CREB and CEBP to counteract the effect of cAMP signaling. Meanwhile, NFIL3 binds to its own promoter to repress its own expression, creating a negative feedback regulation of neuron regeneration.\n\nNFIL3 is also found to be important in immunology. It is required for [[natural killer cells]] and vital for the development and function of other immune cells, including but not limited to anti-inflammatory response in [[helper T cells]], production of IgE from B cells, maturation of CD8a dendritic cells and priming of CD8+ T cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keniry|first=Megan|last2=Dearth|first2=Robert K.|last3=Persans|first3=Michael|last4=Parsons|first4=Ramon|date=2014-06-30|title=New Frontiers for the NFIL3 bZIP Transcription Factor in Cancer, Metabolism and Beyond|journal=Discoveries|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e15|doi=10.15190/d.2014.7|pmid=26539561|pmc=4629104}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Glick\">{{cite book| first = David M. | last = Glick | name-list-format = vanc |title=Glossary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofbioche0000glic| url-access = registration |year=1997|publisher=Portland Press|isbn=978-1-85578-088-0}} \"hair cutting scissors\"</ref>\n\n<!-- original encyclopedia template citation citation - I can't find the page number for above:\n{{Cite encyclopedia | editor = David M.

Most bZIP proteins show high binding affinity for the ACGT motifs, which include CACGTG (G box), GACGTC (C box), TACGTA (A box), AACGTT (T box), and a GCN4 motif, namely TGA(G/C)TCA.<ref name=\"Landschulz et al., 1988\" /><ref name=\"Zhang et al., 2014\" /><ref name=\"Nijhawan et al., 2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nijhawan A, Jain M, Tyagi AK, Khurana JP | title = Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 333\u201350 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18065552 | pmc = 2245831 | doi = 10.1104/pp.107.112821 }}</ref> The bZIP heterodimers exist in a variety of eukaryotes and are more common in organisms with higher evolution complexity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reinke AW, Baek J, Ashenberg O, Keating AE | title = Networks of bZIP protein-protein interactions diversified over a billion years of evolution | journal = Science | volume = 340 | issue = 6133 | pages = 730\u20134 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23661758 | pmc = 4115154 | doi = 10.1126/science.1233465 | bibcode = 2013Sci...340..730R }}</ref> Heterodimeric bZIP proteins differ from homodimeric bZIP and from each other in protein-protein interaction affinity.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00ednez JA, Reinke AW, Bhimsaria D, Keating AE, Ansari AZ | title = Combinatorial bZIP dimers display complex DNA-binding specificity landscapes | journal = eLife | volume = 6 | pages = e19272 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28186491 | pmc = 5349851 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.19272 }}</ref> These heterodimers exhibit complex DNA binding specificity. When combined with a different partner, most of the bZIP pairs bind to DNA sequences that each individual partner prefers. In some cases, dimerization of different bZIP partners can change the DNA sequence that the pair targets in a manner that could not have been predicted based on the preferences of each partner alone. This suggests that, as heterodimers, bZIP transcription factors are able to change their preferences for which location they target in the DNA. The ability of bZIP domain forming dimers with different partners greatly expands the locations on the genome to which bZIP transcription factors can bind and from which they can regulate gene expression.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA small number of bZIP factors such as OsOBF1 can also recognize [[palindromic sequence]]s.<ref name=\"Shimizu et al., 2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shimizu H, Sato K, Berberich T, Miyazaki A, Ozaki R, Imai R, Kusano T | title = LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants | journal = Plant & Cell Physiology | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 1623\u201334 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16051676 | doi = 10.1093/pcp/pci178 }}</ref> However, the others, including LIP19, OsZIP-2a, and OsZIP-2b, do not bind to DNA sequences.

If they are overproduced or mutated in a vital area, they may generate [[cancer]].\n\n=== BZIP containing transcription factors regulate various biological processes ===\nThe bZIP-containing Nuclear factor interleukin 3 regulated protein (NFIL3) is a transcription repressor which play multiple roles in regulating various biological processes. The NFIL3 protein has 462 amino acids including a b-ZIP domain . The N-terminal portion of the domain contains the basic motif, which directly binds to DNA. The C-terminal portion of the b-ZIP domain contains an amphipathic leucine zipper region, which mediates homo- and hetero- dimerization.\n\nThe expression of the ''Nfil3'' gene changes along with the circadian cycle and the NFIL3, as a repression factor, regulates circadian rhythm. NFIL3 competes with the transcription activator D site albumin promoter binding protein (DBP) in binding with the D box elements in the DNA, which is one of the circadian transcription factor consensus sites. DBP is another bZIP protein and shows an opposite portfolio of expression level to that of NFIL3. When NFIL3 level is high, genes under control of the D box elements will be repressed. Overexpression of ''Nfil3'' shortens the circadian cycle.\n\nNFIL3 influences cell survival and involves in oncogenesis. NFIL3 is shown to be a survival factor that hinders apoptotic cell death in numerous cell types and leads to oncogenesis. High expression level of NFIL3 is shown associate with breast cancer. In cancer cells, NFIL3 associates with Histone deacetylase2 ([[Histone deacetylase 2|HDAC2]]) and represses pro-apoptotic genes such as Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 10 ([[TRAIL]]) and TNF receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS) to prevent apoptosis. NFIL3 can also hinder apoptosis in cancer cells by binding to DNA and block the access of transcription factor Forkhead box O1 ([[FOXO1]]) to cell death genes, which undermines cell cycle and promotes oncogenesis. In colon cancer, NFIL3 may also block the recruitment of another type of transcription factors, Proline Acid Rich (PAR) proteins.\n\nNFIL3 functions as a repressor to neuron regeneration associated genes. ''Nfil3'' is expressed in neuron cells with regeneration potential to keep cell growth under control. Expression of ''Nfil3'' is induced by phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein ([[CREB]]), and the NFIL3 protein in turn competes for binding sites shared with CREB and CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein ([[CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins|CEBP]]), which downregulates target genes of CREB and CEBP to counteract the effect of cAMP signaling. Meanwhile, NFIL3 binds to its own promoter to repress its own expression, creating a negative feedback regulation of neuron regeneration.\n\nNFIL3 is also found to be important in immunology. It is required for natural killer cells and vital for the development and function of other immune cells, including but not limited to: anti-inflammatory response in helper T cells, production of IgE from B cells, maturation of CD8a dendritic cells and priming of CD8+ T cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keniry|first=Megan|last2=Dearth|first2=Robert K.|last3=Persans|first3=Michael|last4=Parsons|first4=Ramon|date=2014-06-30|title=New Frontiers for the NFIL3 bZIP Transcription Factor in Cancer, Metabolism and Beyond|journal=Discoveries|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e15|doi=10.15190/d.2014.7|pmid=26539561|pmc=4629104}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Glick\">{{cite book| first = David M. | last = Glick | name-list-format = vanc |title=Glossary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofbioche0000glic| url-access = registration |year=1997|publisher=Portland Press|isbn=978-1-85578-088-0}} \"hair cutting scissors\"</ref>\n\n<!-- original encyclopedia template citation citation - I can't find the page number for above:\n{{Cite encyclopedia | editor = David M.
