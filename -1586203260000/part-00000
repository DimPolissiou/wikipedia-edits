The numbers refer not to the number of steps in the mechanism, but rather to the kinetics of the reaction: E2 is bimolecular (second-order) while E1 is unimolecular (first-order). In cases where the molecule is able to stabilize an anion but possesses  a poor leaving group, a third type of reaction, [[E1cB-elimination reaction|E1<sub>CB</sub>]],  exists.  Finally, the pyrolysis of xanthate and acetate esters proceed through an \"internal\" elimination mechanism, the [[Ei mechanism|E<sub>i</sub> mechanism]].\n\n==Loss of hydron (H<sup>+</sup>)==\n{{see also|Deprotonation}}\n\nIn most organic elimination reactions, at least one hydron (H<sup>+</sup>) is lost to form the double bond: the [[saturated compound|unsaturation]] of the molecule increases.  It is also possible that a molecule undergoes [[reductive elimination]], by which the valence of an atom in the molecule decreases by two, though this is more common in inorganic chemistry.  \nAn important class of elimination reactions is those involving [[alkyl halide]]s, with good [[leaving group]]s, reacting with a [[Lewis base]] to form an [[alkene]].  Elimination may be considered the reverse of an [[addition reaction]]. When the substrate is asymmetric, [[regioselectivity]] is determined by [[Zaitsev's rule]] or through [[Hofmann elimination]] if the carbon with the most substituted hydrogen is inaccessible.\n\n== E2 mechanism ==<!-- This section is linked from [[E2]] -->\nDuring the 1920s,  [[Christopher Kelk Ingold|Sir Christopher Ingold]] proposed a model to explain a peculiar type of chemical reaction: the E2 mechanism. E2 stands for '''bimolecular elimination.'''  The reaction involves a one-step mechanism in which ''carbon-hydrogen'' and ''carbon-halogen'' bonds break to form a double bond (''C=C [[molecular geometry|Pi bond]]'').\n\nThe specifics of the reaction are as follows:\n* E2 is a single step elimination, with a single [[transition state]].\n* It is typically undergone by primary substituted alkyl halides, but is possible with some secondary alkyl halides and other compounds.\n* The [[reaction rate]] is [[second order reaction|second order]], because it's influenced by both the alkyl halide and the base (bimolecular).\n* Because the E2 mechanism results in the formation of a pi bond, the two leaving groups (often a hydrogen and a [[halogen]]) need to be [[antiperiplanar]].  An [[antiperiplanar]] [[transition state]] has [[staggered conformation|staggered]] conformation with lower energy than a [[synperiplanar]] transition state which is in [[eclipsed]] conformation with higher energy. The reaction mechanism involving staggered conformation is more favorable for E2 reactions (unlike E1 reactions).\n* E2 typically uses a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]]. It must be strong enough to remove a weakly acidic hydrogen.\n* In order for the pi bond to be created, the [[orbital hybridization|hybridization]] of carbons needs to be lowered from ''sp<sup>3</sup>'' to ''sp<sup>2</sup>''.\n* The C-H bond is weakened in the [[rate determining step]] and therefore a primary [[deuterium isotope effect]]  much larger than 1 (commonly 2-6) is observed.\n* E2 competes with the [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction]] mechanism if the base can also act as a nucleophile (true for many common bases).\n\n[[File:E2 Elimination Reaction.png|center|500px|Scheme 1. E2 reaction mechanism]]\n\nAn example of this type of reaction in ''scheme 1'' is the reaction of [[isobutyl]]bromide with [[potassium]] [[alkoxide|ethoxide]] in [[ethanol]]. The reaction products are [[isobutylene]], [[ethanol]] and [[potassium bromide]].\n\n== E1 mechanism ==<!-- This section is linked from [[E1]] -->\nE1 is a model to explain a particular type of chemical elimination reaction. E1 stands for '''unimolecular elimination''' and has the following specifications\n\n* It is a two-step process of elimination: ''ionization and deprotonation''.\n** [[Ionization]]: the carbon-halogen bond breaks to give a [[carbocation]] intermediate.\n** [[deprotonation]] of the carbocation.\n* E1 typically takes place with [[tertiary carbon atom|tertiary]] alkyl halides, but is possible with some secondary alkyl halides.\n* The [[reaction rate]] is influenced only by the concentration of the alkyl halide because carbocation formation is the slowest step, as known as the [[rate-determining step]]. Therefore, [[Rate equation#First-order reactions|first-order kinetics]] apply (unimolecular).\n* The reaction usually occurs in the complete absence of a base or the presence of only a weak base (acidic conditions and high temperature).\n* E1 reactions are in competition with [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction]]s because they share a common carbocationic intermediate.\n* A secondary [[deuterium isotope effect]] of slightly larger than 1 (commonly 1 - 1.5) is observed.\n* There is no antiperiplanar requirement. An example is the [[pyrolysis]] of a certain [[sulfonate ester]] of [[menthol]]:\n\n[[Image:E1-eliminationNash2008.svg|center|500px|E1 elimination Nash 2008, antiperiplanar relationship in blue]]\n\n:Only reaction product '''A''' results from antiperiplanar elimination.

It aims to revive the historical [[gold dinar]] which was a leading coin of early Islam. The currency might consist of minted [[gold coin]]s ([[dinar]]s) or of [[silver coin]]s ([[dirham]]s).\n\n==Dinar history==\n{{Main|Gold Dinar}}\n[[File:Dinar of Abd al-Malik, AH 75.jpg|thumb|[[Gold dinar]] of [[Abd al-Malik]], AH 75, [[Umayyad Caliphate]].]]\n\nAccording to Islamic law, the Islamic dinar is a coin of pure [[gold]] weighing 72 grains of average [[barley]]. Modern determinations of weight for the \"full solidus\" weigh 4.44 grams at the time of Heraclius and a \"light solidus\" equivalent to the weight of the [[mithqal]] weighing 4.25 grams. With the silver Dirham being created to the weight ratio of 7:10, yielded coins of 2.975 grams of pure silver.\n\n[[Umar|Umar Ibn al-Khattab]] established the known standard relationship between them based on their weights: 7 dinars must be equivalent (in weight) to 10 dirhams.\n\n{{cquote|The Revelation undertook to mention them and attached many judgements to them, for example ''[[zakat]]'', marriage, and ''[[hudud]]'', etc., therefore within the Revelation they have to have a reality and specific measure for assessment of zakat, etc. upon which its judgements may be based rather than on the non-shari'i other coins.<br /> <br />Know that there is [[Ijma|consensus]] since the beginning of Islam and the age of the Companions and the Followers that the dirham of the shari'ah is that of which ten weigh seven [[Mithqal]]s weight of the dinar of gold... The weight of a [[Mithqal]] of gold is seventy-two grains of barley, so that the dirham which is seven-tenths of it is fifty and two-fifths grains.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20.

The background consists of art works including ''The Birth of Venus'', which inspired the singer's music video for \"Applause\" and the VMA performance of the song. Koons explained the meaning of the cover to MTV:\n\n{{blockquote|\"With the cover, I wanted to have Gaga there as a sculpture, as a three-dimensional type of form and with the gazing ball, because the gazing ball really does become kind of the symbol for everything \u2014 and this aspect of reflection that when you come across something like a gazing ball, it affirms you, it affirms your existence and then from that affirmation, you start to want more. There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2014|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014.

The background consists of art works including ''The Birth of Venus'', which inspired the singer's music video for \"Applause\" and the VMA performance of the song. Koons explained the meaning of the cover to MTV:\n\n{{blockquote|\"With the cover, I wanted to have Gaga there as a sculpture, as a three-dimensional type of form and with the gazing ball, because the gazing ball really does become kind of the symbol for everything \u2014 and this aspect of reflection that when you come across something like a gazing ball, it affirms you, it affirms your existence and then from that affirmation, you start to want more. There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

It is the continental portion of the province and constitutes  71% of the province's area but is home to only 6% of the province's population. It is separated from the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Strait of Belle Isle]]. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\nLabrador occupies most of the eastern part of the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of [[Nunavut]] on [[Killiniq Island]].\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern [[Inuit]] of [[Nunatsiavut]], the Southern [[Inuit]]-[[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] of [[NunatuKavut]], and the [[Innu]] of [[Nitassinan]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Nitassinan: The Innu Struggle to Reclaim Their Homeland |publisher=[[Douglas & McIntyre]] |year=December 1991 |page=240 |last=Wadden |first=Marie |author-link=Marie Wadden |isbn=978-1-55365-731-6 |url=http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121161501/http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-21 |access-date=2012-11-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nLabrador is named after [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], a Portuguese explorer who sailed along the coasts of the [[Labrador Peninsula|Peninsula]] in 1498\u201399. ''Lavrador'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means \"farmer\", as does its [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent ''labrador''.\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Image:Labrador fullmap.gif|thumb|left|Map of Labrador.]]\n\nLabrador has a roughly triangular shape that encompasses the easternmost section of the [[Canadian Shield]], a sweeping geographical region of thin soil and abundant mineral resources. Its western border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands that drain into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are part of Labrador, while lands that drain into [[Hudson Bay]] are part of Quebec. Northern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Polar climate|polar]], while Southern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]].\n\nLabrador can be divided into four geographical regions: the North Coast, Central Labrador, Western Labrador, and the South Coast. Each of those regions is described below.\n\n===North Coast===\n\nFrom Cape Chidley to Hamilton Inlet, the long, thin, northern tip of Labrador holds the [[Torngat Mountains]], named after an Inuit spirit believed to inhabit them. The mountains stretch along the coast from Port Manvers to [[Cape Chidley]], the northernmost point of Labrador. The Torngat Mountain range is also home to [[Mount Caubvick]], the highest point in the province. This area is predominantly Inuit, with the exception of a small Innu community, [[Natuashish]]. The North Coast is the most isolated region of Labrador, with [[snowmobile]]s, boats, and planes being the only modern modes of transportation. The largest community in this region is [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]].\n\n==== Nunatsiavut ====\n[[Nunatsiavut]] is an Inuit self-government region in Labrador created on June 23, 2000. The Settlement area comprises the majority of Labrador's North Coast, while the land-use area also includes land farther to the interior and in Central Labrador. Nain is the administrative centre.\n[[File:Kiglapait Mountains, Labrador.jpg|thumb|Icy Labrador coast and [[Kiglapait Mountains]] on the north coast of Labrador]]\n\n===Central Labrador===\n\n[[Central Labrador]] extends from the shores of [[Lake Melville]] into the interior. It contains the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]], the largest river in Labrador and one of the largest in Canada. The hydroelectric dam at [[Churchill Falls]] is the second-largest underground power station in the world. Most of the supply is bought by [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] under a long-term contract. The [[Lower Churchill Project]] will develop the remaining potential of the river and supply it to provincial consumers. Known as \"the heart of the Big Land\", the area's population comprises people from all groups and regions of Labrador.\n\nCentral Labrador is also home to [[Happy Valley \u2013 Goose Bay]]. Once a refuelling point for plane convoys to Europe during [[World War II]], [[CFB Goose Bay]] is now operated as a [[NATO]] tactical flight training site. It was an alternate landing zone for the United States' [[Space Shuttle]]. Other major communities in the area are [[North West River, Newfoundland and Labrador|North West River]] and the large [[Indian reserve|reserve]] known as [[Sheshatshiu]].\n\n===Western Labrador===\n[[File:Open_pit_iron_mine,_Labrador.jpg|right|thumb|Open pit  [[Iron Ore Company of Canada|iron mine]] in Labrador West]]\nThe highlands above the Churchill Falls were once an ancient hunting ground for the [[Innu]] First Nations and settled trappers of Labrador. After the construction of the hydroelectric dam at Churchill Falls in 1970, the [[Smallwood Reservoir]] has flooded much of the old hunting land\u2014submerging several grave sites and trapping cabins in the process.\n\nWestern Labrador is also home to the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], which operates a large iron ore mine in [[Labrador City]]. Together with the small community of [[Wabush]], the two towns are known as \"Labrador West\".\n\n=== South Coast ===\n\n====NunatuKavut====\nFrom [[Hamilton Inlet]] to [[Cape St. Charles]]/[[St. Lewis, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Lewis]], [[NunatuKavut]] is the territory of the NunatuKavummiut or Central-Southern Labrador Inuit (formerly known as the Labrador [[M\u00e9tis]]). It includes portions of Central and Western Labrador, but more NunatuKavummiut reside in its South Coast portion: it is peppered with tiny Inuit fishing communities, of which [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] is the largest.\n\n====The Labrador Straits====\nFrom Cape Charles to the Quebec/Labrador coastal border, the Straits is known for its Labrador sea grass (as is NunatuKavut) and the multitude of icebergs that pass by the coast via the [[Labrador Current]].\n\n[[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] is known as one of the best examples of a preserved 16th-century [[Basque people|Basque]] whaling station. It is also the location of four 16th-century Spanish galleons. The [[lighthouse]] at [[Point Amour Lighthouse|Point Amour]] is the second-largest lighthouse in Canada. [[MV Kamutik]], a passenger ferry between the mainland and [[St. Barbe, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Barbe]] on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], is based in [[Blanc Sablon, Quebec]], near the Labrador border. [[L'Anse-au-Loup]] is the largest town on the Labrador Straits. [[L'Anse-au-Clair]] is a small town on the Labrador side of the border.\n\n===Time zones of Labrador===\n\nMost of Labrador (from [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] north and west) uses [[Atlantic Standard Time Zone|Atlantic Time]] (UTC\u22124 in winter, UTC\u22123 in summer). The southeastern tip nearest Newfoundland uses [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|Newfoundland Time]] (UTC\u22123:30 in winter, UTC\u22122:30 in summer) to stay co-ordinated with the more populous part of the province.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Innu making canoes near Sheshatshiu, ca. 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Innu making canoes ca. 1920]]\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Fours de fonte d'huile de baleine.jpg|thumb|right|Model of [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|Basque]] whale oil melting factory at [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]]]]\nEarly settlement in Labrador was tied to the sea as demonstrated by the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] (or [[Innu]]) and [[Inuit]], although these peoples also made significant forays throughout the interior.\n\nIt is believed that the [[Norsemen]] were the first Europeans to sight Labrador around 1000 AD, but no Norse remains have been found on the North American mainland. The area was known as ''[[Markland]]'' in [[Greenlandic Norse]] and its inhabitants were known as ''[[skr\u00e6lingjar]]''.\n\nIn 1499 and 1500, Portuguese explorers [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] and [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] reached what was probably Labrador today and that is believed to be the origin of the name Labrador.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&pg=PA464 |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |author=Bailey W.

On the extreme northeast promontory of North America, Maggiolo place-names include ''Terra de los Ingres'' (Land of the English), and ''Terra de Lavorador de rey de portugall'' (Land of Lavrador of the King of Portugal). Further south, we notice ''Terra de corte real e de rey de portugall'' (Land of \"Corte-Real\" and of the King of Portugal) and ''terra de pescaria'' (Land for Fishing). In the 1532 Wolfenb\u00fcttel map, believed to be the work of [[Diogo Ribeiro]], along the coast of Greenland, the following legend was added: ''As he who first sighted it was a farmer from the Azores Islands, this name remains attached to that country.'' This is believed to be Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. For the first seven decades or so of the sixteenth century, the name Labrador was sometimes also applied to what we know as Greenland.<ref>See James A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (London, 1962), pp. 98, 120\u20131, 312\u201317.</ref> Labrador (\"lavrador\" in Portuguese) means husbandman or farmer of a tract of land (from \"labour\" in Latin) \u2014the land of the labourer. European settlement was largely concentrated in coastal communities, particularly those south of St. Lewis and Cape Charles, and are among Canada's oldest European settlements.\n\nIn 1542 Basque mariners came ashore at a natural harbour on the northeast coast of the Strait of Belle Isle. They gave this \"new land\" its Latin name ''Terranova''. A whaling station was set up around the bay, which they called ''Butus'' and is now named Red Bay after the red terracotta roof tiles they brought with them. A whaling ship, the ''San Juan'', sank there in 1565 and was raised in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/canada/articles/Red-Bay-a-corner-of-Canada-that-is-forever-Basque|last=Richardson|first=Nigel|title=A corner of Canada that is forever Basque|date=1 June 2015|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moravian Brethren]] of [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]], first came to the Labrador Coast in 1760 to minister to the migratory Inuit tribes there. They founded Nain, Okak, Hebron, Hopedale and Makkovik. Quite poor, both European and First Nations settlements along coastal Labrador came to benefit from cargo and relief vessels that were operated as part of the [[Grenfell Mission]] (see [[Wilfred Grenfell]]). Throughout the 20th century, coastal freighters and ferries operated initially by the [[Newfoundland Railway]] and later [[Canadian National Railway]]/[[CN Marine]]/[[Marine Atlantic]] became a critical lifeline for communities on the coast, which for the majority of that century did not have any road connection with the rest of North America.\n\nLabrador was within [[New France]] mostly by 1748. However, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] that ended the [[French and Indian War]] transferred New France (including Labrador though excluding the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] southwest of Newfoundland) to the British, which administered the area as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] until splitting it in two in 1791, with Labrador located in [[Lower Canada]]. However, in 1809 the British Imperial government detached Labrador from Lower Canada for transfer to the separate, self-governing [[Newfoundland Colony]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n{{Further|Newfoundland National Convention|1948 Newfoundland referendums|Canadian Confederation#Joining Confederation|selfref=|label1=|label3=}}\nAs part of [[Newfoundland]] since 1809, Labrador was still being disputed by [[Quebec]] until the British resolved their border in 1927. In 1949, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|entered into confederation]], becoming part of Canada (see above artices for full information).\n\n[[File:Moravian Church, Nain, NL, exterior.JPG|thumb|[[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was established in 1771 by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries]]\nLabrador played strategic roles during both [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. In October 1943, a German [[U-boat]] crew installed an automated weather station on the northern tip of Labrador near Cape Chidley, code-named [[Weather Station Kurt]]; the installation of the equipment was the only (known) armed, German military operation on the North American mainland during the war. The station broadcast weather observations to the German navy for only a few days, but was not discovered until the 1980s when a historian, working with the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], identified its location and mounted an expedition to recover it. The station is now exhibited in the [[Canadian War Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/ops/weather_stations.htm |title=Weather station Kurt erected in Labrador in 1943 | accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government built a major air force base at [[Goose Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Goose Bay]], at the head of [[Lake Melville]] during the Second World War, a site selected because of its topography, access to the sea, defensible location, and minimal fog. During the Second World War and the Cold War, the base was also home to American, British, and later German, Dutch, and Italian detachments. Today, Serco, the company contracted to operate [[CFB Goose Bay]] is one of the largest employers for the community of [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay]].\n\nAdditionally, both the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]] built and operated a number of radar stations along coastal Labrador as part of the [[Pinetree Line]], [[Mid-Canada Line]] and [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]] systems. Today the remaining stations are automated as part of the [[North Warning System]], however the military settlements during the early part of the Cold War surrounding these stations have largely continued as local Innu and Inuit populations have clustered near their port and airfield facilities.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, some of the largest [[iron ore]] deposits in the world were discovered in the western part of Labrador and adjacent areas of Quebec. Deposits at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright]], [[Schefferville, Quebec|Schefferville]], Labrador City, and Wabush drove industrial development and human settlement in the area during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe present community of [[Labrador West, Newfoundland and Labrador|Labrador West]] is entirely a result of the iron ore mining activities in the region. The Iron Ore Company of Canada operates the [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway]] to transport ore concentrate 578 kilometres (359 miles) south to the port of [[Sept-\u00celes, Quebec]], for shipment to steel mills in North America and elsewhere.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] (Labrador name: Grand River) was diverted at Churchill Falls, resulting in the flooding of an enormous area \u2013 today named the Smallwood Reservoir after Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland. The flooding of the reservoir destroyed large areas of habitat for the threatened Woodland Caribou. A hydroelectric generating station was built in Labrador and a transmission line to the neighbouring province of Quebec.\n\nConstruction of a large hydroelectric dam project at Muskrat Falls began in 2012 by Nalcor Energy and the Province of Newfoundland. Muskrat Falls is 45&nbsp;km west of Happy Valley-Goose Bay on the Grand River (Newfoundland name: Churchill River). A transmission line began construction in October 2014 and was completed in 2016 that will deliver power down to the southern tip of Labrador and underwater across the strait of Belle Isle to the Province of Newfoundland in 2018.<ref>http://muskratfalls.nalcorenergy.com/team-work-and-dedication-brings-the-link-to-completion/</ref>\n\nFrom the 1970s to early 2000s, the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]] was built in stages to connect various inland communities with the North American highway network at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright, Quebec]] (which in turn is connected by a highway running north from [[Baie-Comeau]], [[Quebec]]). A southern extension of this highway has opened in stages during the early 2000s and is resulting in significant changes to the coastal ferry system in the Strait of Belle Isle and southeastern Labrador. These \"highways\" are so called only because of their importance to the region; they would be better described as roads, and are not completely paved.\n\nA study on a [[Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link|fixed link]] to Newfoundland, in 2004, recommended that a tunnel under the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], being a single railway that would carry cars, buses and trucks, was technologically the best option for such a link. However, the study also concluded that a fixed link was not economically viable. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union would be amended to remove ferry service from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Channel \u2013 Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAlthough a [[Trans-Labrador Highway|highway link]] has, as of 16 December 2009, been completed across Labrador, this route is somewhat longer than a proposed [[Quebec Route 138|Quebec North Shore highway]] that presently does not exist. Part of the \"highway\", [[Quebec Route 389|Route 389]], starting approximately {{convert|212|km|mi}} from Baie-Comeau to {{convert|482|km|mi}}, is of an inferior alignment, and from there to {{convert|570|km|mi}}, the provincial border, is an accident-prone section notorious for its poor surface and sharp curves. Quebec in April 2009 announced major upgrades to Route 389 to be carried out.\n\nRoute 389 and the Trans-Labrador Highway were added to Canada's [[National Highway System (Canada)|National Highway System]] in September 2005.\n\n[[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]] constitutes a federal electoral district electing one member to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Due to its size, distinct nature, and large Aboriginal population, Labrador has one seat despite having the smallest population of any electoral district in Canada. Formerly, Labrador was part of a riding that included part of the Island of Newfoundland. Labrador is divided into four provincial electoral districts in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly]].\n\n==Boundary dispute==\n[[Image:Labrador boundary dispute.png|thumb|Line A: the boundary decided by the Privy Council; the current legal boundary.

In 1809 Labrador had been transferred from [[Lower Canada]] to [[Newfoundland Colony]] but the inland boundary of Labrador had never been precisely stated.<ref name=\"marianopolis\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/NFLDHistory/Quebec-NewfoundlandLabradorBoundaryIssue.htm|title = Labrador-Canada boundary|publisher = marianopolis| accessdate = 2008-03-20 | last= |quote=Labrador Act, 1809. \u2013 An imperial act (49 Geo.

It is the continental portion of the province and constitutes  71% of the province's area but is home to only 6% of the province's population. It is separated from the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Strait of Belle Isle]]. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\nLabrador occupies most of the eastern part of the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of [[Nunavut]] on [[Killiniq Island]].\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern [[Inuit]] of [[Nunatsiavut]], the Southern [[Inuit]]-[[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] of [[NunatuKavut]], and the [[Innu]] of [[Nitassinan]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Nitassinan: The Innu Struggle to Reclaim Their Homeland |publisher=[[Douglas & McIntyre]] |year=December 1991 |page=240 |last=Wadden |first=Marie |author-link=Marie Wadden |isbn=978-1-55365-731-6 |url=http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121161501/http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-21 |access-date=2012-11-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nLabrador is named after [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], a Portuguese explorer who sailed along the coasts of the [[Labrador Peninsula|Peninsula]] in 1498\u201399. ''Lavrador'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means \"farmer\", as does its [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent ''labrador''.\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Image:Labrador fullmap.gif|thumb|left|Map of Labrador.]]\n\nLabrador has a roughly triangular shape that encompasses the easternmost section of the [[Canadian Shield]], a sweeping geographical region of thin soil and abundant mineral resources. Its western border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands that drain into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are part of Labrador, while lands that drain into [[Hudson Bay]] are part of Quebec. Northern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Polar climate|polar]], while Southern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]].\n\nLabrador can be divided into four geographical regions: the North Coast, Central Labrador, Western Labrador, and the South Coast. Each of those regions is described below.\n\n===North Coast===\n\nFrom Cape Chidley to Hamilton Inlet, the long, thin, northern tip of Labrador holds the [[Torngat Mountains]], named after an Inuit spirit believed to inhabit them. The mountains stretch along the coast from Port Manvers to [[Cape Chidley]], the northernmost point of Labrador. The Torngat Mountain range is also home to [[Mount Caubvick]], the highest point in the province. This area is predominantly Inuit, with the exception of a small Innu community, [[Natuashish]]. The North Coast is the most isolated region of Labrador, with [[snowmobile]]s, boats, and planes being the only modern modes of transportation. The largest community in this region is [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]].\n\n==== Nunatsiavut ====\n[[Nunatsiavut]] is an Inuit self-government region in Labrador created on June 23, 2000. The Settlement area comprises the majority of Labrador's North Coast, while the land-use area also includes land farther to the interior and in Central Labrador. Nain is the administrative centre.\n[[File:Kiglapait Mountains, Labrador.jpg|thumb|Icy Labrador coast and [[Kiglapait Mountains]] on the north coast of Labrador]]\n\n===Central Labrador===\n\n[[Central Labrador]] extends from the shores of [[Lake Melville]] into the interior. It contains the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]], the largest river in Labrador and one of the largest in Canada. The hydroelectric dam at [[Churchill Falls]] is the second-largest underground power station in the world. Most of the supply is bought by [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] under a long-term contract. The [[Lower Churchill Project]] will develop the remaining potential of the river and supply it to provincial consumers. Known as \"the heart of the Big Land\", the area's population comprises people from all groups and regions of Labrador.\n\nCentral Labrador is also home to [[Happy Valley \u2013 Goose Bay]]. Once a refuelling point for plane convoys to Europe during [[World War II]], [[CFB Goose Bay]] is now operated as a [[NATO]] tactical flight training site. It was an alternate landing zone for the United States' [[Space Shuttle]]. Other major communities in the area are [[North West River, Newfoundland and Labrador|North West River]] and the large [[Indian reserve|reserve]] known as [[Sheshatshiu]].\n\n===Western Labrador===\n[[File:Open_pit_iron_mine,_Labrador.jpg|right|thumb|Open pit  [[Iron Ore Company of Canada|iron mine]] in Labrador West]]\nThe highlands above the Churchill Falls were once an ancient hunting ground for the [[Innu]] First Nations and settled trappers of Labrador. After the construction of the hydroelectric dam at Churchill Falls in 1970, the [[Smallwood Reservoir]] has flooded much of the old hunting land\u2014submerging several grave sites and trapping cabins in the process.\n\nWestern Labrador is also home to the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], which operates a large iron ore mine in [[Labrador City]]. Together with the small community of [[Wabush]], the two towns are known as \"Labrador West\".\n\n=== South Coast ===\n\n====NunatuKavut====\nFrom [[Hamilton Inlet]] to [[Cape St. Charles]]/[[St. Lewis, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Lewis]], [[NunatuKavut]] is the territory of the NunatuKavummiut or Central-Southern Labrador Inuit (formerly known as the Labrador [[M\u00e9tis]]). It includes portions of Central and Western Labrador, but more NunatuKavummiut reside in its South Coast portion: it is peppered with tiny Inuit fishing communities, of which [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] is the largest.\n\n====The Labrador Straits====\nFrom Cape Charles to the Quebec/Labrador coastal border, the Straits is known for its Labrador sea grass (as is NunatuKavut) and the multitude of icebergs that pass by the coast via the [[Labrador Current]].\n\n[[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] is known as one of the best examples of a preserved 16th-century [[Basque people|Basque]] whaling station. It is also the location of four 16th-century Spanish galleons. The [[lighthouse]] at [[Point Amour Lighthouse|Point Amour]] is the second-largest lighthouse in Canada. [[MV Kamutik]], a passenger ferry between the mainland and [[St. Barbe, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Barbe]] on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], is based in [[Blanc Sablon, Quebec]], near the Labrador border. [[L'Anse-au-Loup]] is the largest town on the Labrador Straits. [[L'Anse-au-Clair]] is a small town on the Labrador side of the border.\n\n===Time zones of Labrador===\n\nMost of Labrador (from [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] north and west) uses [[Atlantic Standard Time Zone|Atlantic Time]] (UTC\u22124 in winter, UTC\u22123 in summer). The southeastern tip nearest Newfoundland uses [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|Newfoundland Time]] (UTC\u22123:30 in winter, UTC\u22122:30 in summer) to stay co-ordinated with the more populous part of the province.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Innu making canoes near Sheshatshiu, ca. 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Innu making canoes ca. 1920]]\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Fours de fonte d'huile de baleine.jpg|thumb|right|Model of [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|Basque]] whale oil melting factory at [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]]]]\nEarly settlement in Labrador was tied to the sea as demonstrated by the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] (or [[Innu]]) and [[Inuit]], although these peoples also made significant forays throughout the interior.\n\nIt is believed that the [[Norsemen]] were the first Europeans to sight Labrador around 1000 AD, but no Norse remains have been found on the North American mainland. The area was known as ''[[Markland]]'' in [[Greenlandic Norse]] and its inhabitants were known as ''[[skr\u00e6lingjar]]''.\n\nIn 1499 and 1500, Portuguese explorers [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] and [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] reached what was probably Labrador today and that is believed to be the origin of the name Labrador.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&pg=PA464 |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |author=Bailey W.

On the extreme northeast promontory of North America, Maggiolo place-names include ''Terra de los Ingres'' (Land of the English), and ''Terra de Lavorador de rey de portugall'' (Land of Lavrador of the King of Portugal). Further south, we notice ''Terra de corte real e de rey de portugall'' (Land of \"Corte-Real\" and of the King of Portugal) and ''terra de pescaria'' (Land for Fishing). In the 1532 Wolfenb\u00fcttel map, believed to be the work of [[Diogo Ribeiro]], along the coast of Greenland, the following legend was added: ''As he who first sighted it was a farmer from the Azores Islands, this name remains attached to that country.'' This is believed to be Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. For the first seven decades or so of the sixteenth century, the name Labrador was sometimes also applied to what we know as Greenland.<ref>See James A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (London, 1962), pp. 98, 120\u20131, 312\u201317.</ref> Labrador (\"lavrador\" in Portuguese) means husbandman or farmer of a tract of land (from \"labour\" in Latin) \u2014the land of the labourer. European settlement was largely concentrated in coastal communities, particularly those south of St. Lewis and Cape Charles, and are among Canada's oldest European settlements.\n\nIn 1542 Basque mariners came ashore at a natural harbour on the northeast coast of the Strait of Belle Isle. They gave this \"new land\" its Latin name ''Terranova''. A whaling station was set up around the bay, which they called ''Butus'' and is now named Red Bay after the red terracotta roof tiles they brought with them. A whaling ship, the ''San Juan'', sank there in 1565 and was raised in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/canada/articles/Red-Bay-a-corner-of-Canada-that-is-forever-Basque|last=Richardson|first=Nigel|title=A corner of Canada that is forever Basque|date=1 June 2015|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moravian Brethren]] of [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]], first came to the Labrador Coast in 1760 to minister to the migratory Inuit tribes there. They founded Nain, Okak, Hebron, Hopedale and Makkovik. Quite poor, both European and First Nations settlements along coastal Labrador came to benefit from cargo and relief vessels that were operated as part of the [[Grenfell Mission]] (see [[Wilfred Grenfell]]). Throughout the 20th century, coastal freighters and ferries operated initially by the [[Newfoundland Railway]] and later [[Canadian National Railway]]/[[CN Marine]]/[[Marine Atlantic]] became a critical lifeline for communities on the coast, which for the majority of that century did not have any road connection with the rest of North America.\n\nLabrador was within [[New France]] mostly by 1748. However, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] that ended the [[French and Indian War]] transferred New France (including Labrador though excluding the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] southwest of Newfoundland) to the British, which administered the area as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] until splitting it in two in 1791, with Labrador located in [[Lower Canada]]. However, in 1809 the British Imperial government detached Labrador from Lower Canada for transfer to the separate, self-governing [[Newfoundland Colony]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n{{Further|Newfoundland National Convention|1948 Newfoundland referendums|Canadian Confederation#Joining Confederation|selfref=|label1=|label3=}}\nAs part of [[Newfoundland]] since 1809, Labrador was still being disputed by [[Quebec]] until the British resolved their border in 1927. In 1949, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|entered into confederation]], becoming part of Canada (see above artices for full information).\n\n[[File:Moravian Church, Nain, NL, exterior.JPG|thumb|[[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was established in 1771 by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries]]\nLabrador played strategic roles during both [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. In October 1943, a German [[U-boat]] crew installed an automated weather station on the northern tip of Labrador near Cape Chidley, code-named [[Weather Station Kurt]]; the installation of the equipment was the only (known) armed, German military operation on the North American mainland during the war. The station broadcast weather observations to the German navy for only a few days, but was not discovered until the 1980s when a historian, working with the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], identified its location and mounted an expedition to recover it. The station is now exhibited in the [[Canadian War Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/ops/weather_stations.htm |title=Weather station Kurt erected in Labrador in 1943 | accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government built a major air force base at [[Goose Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Goose Bay]], at the head of [[Lake Melville]] during the Second World War, a site selected because of its topography, access to the sea, defensible location, and minimal fog. During the Second World War and the Cold War, the base was also home to American, British, and later German, Dutch, and Italian detachments. Today, Serco, the company contracted to operate [[CFB Goose Bay]] is one of the largest employers for the community of [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay]].\n\nAdditionally, both the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]] built and operated a number of radar stations along coastal Labrador as part of the [[Pinetree Line]], [[Mid-Canada Line]] and [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]] systems. Today the remaining stations are automated as part of the [[North Warning System]], however the military settlements during the early part of the Cold War surrounding these stations have largely continued as local Innu and Inuit populations have clustered near their port and airfield facilities.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, some of the largest [[iron ore]] deposits in the world were discovered in the western part of Labrador and adjacent areas of Quebec. Deposits at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright]], [[Schefferville, Quebec|Schefferville]], Labrador City, and Wabush drove industrial development and human settlement in the area during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe present community of [[Labrador West, Newfoundland and Labrador|Labrador West]] is entirely a result of the iron ore mining activities in the region. The Iron Ore Company of Canada operates the [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway]] to transport ore concentrate 578 kilometres (359 miles) south to the port of [[Sept-\u00celes, Quebec]], for shipment to steel mills in North America and elsewhere.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] (Labrador name: Grand River) was diverted at Churchill Falls, resulting in the flooding of an enormous area \u2013 today named the Smallwood Reservoir after Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland. The flooding of the reservoir destroyed large areas of habitat for the threatened Woodland Caribou. A hydroelectric generating station was built in Labrador and a transmission line to the neighbouring province of Quebec.\n\nConstruction of a large hydroelectric dam project at Muskrat Falls began in 2012 by Nalcor Energy and the Province of Newfoundland. Muskrat Falls is 45&nbsp;km west of Happy Valley-Goose Bay on the Grand River (Newfoundland name: Churchill River). A transmission line began construction in October 2014 and was completed in 2016 that will deliver power down to the southern tip of Labrador and underwater across the strait of Belle Isle to the Province of Newfoundland in 2018.<ref>http://muskratfalls.nalcorenergy.com/team-work-and-dedication-brings-the-link-to-completion/</ref>\n\nFrom the 1970s to early 2000s, the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]] was built in stages to connect various inland communities with the North American highway network at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright, Quebec]] (which in turn is connected by a highway running north from [[Baie-Comeau]], [[Quebec]]). A southern extension of this highway has opened in stages during the early 2000s and is resulting in significant changes to the coastal ferry system in the Strait of Belle Isle and southeastern Labrador. These \"highways\" are so called only because of their importance to the region; they would be better described as roads, and are not completely paved.\n\nA study on a [[Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link|fixed link]] to Newfoundland, in 2004, recommended that a tunnel under the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], being a single railway that would carry cars, buses and trucks, was technologically the best option for such a link. However, the study also concluded that a fixed link was not economically viable. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union would be amended to remove ferry service from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Channel \u2013 Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAlthough a [[Trans-Labrador Highway|highway link]] has, as of 16 December 2009, been completed across Labrador, this route is somewhat longer than a proposed [[Quebec Route 138|Quebec North Shore highway]] that presently does not exist. Part of the \"highway\", [[Quebec Route 389|Route 389]], starting approximately {{convert|212|km|mi}} from Baie-Comeau to {{convert|482|km|mi}}, is of an inferior alignment, and from there to {{convert|570|km|mi}}, the provincial border, is an accident-prone section notorious for its poor surface and sharp curves. Quebec in April 2009 announced major upgrades to Route 389 to be carried out.\n\nRoute 389 and the Trans-Labrador Highway were added to Canada's [[National Highway System (Canada)|National Highway System]] in September 2005.\n\n[[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]] constitutes a federal electoral district electing one member to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Due to its size, distinct nature, and large Aboriginal population, Labrador has one seat despite having the smallest population of any electoral district in Canada. Formerly, Labrador was part of a riding that included part of the Island of Newfoundland. Labrador is divided into four provincial electoral districts in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly]].\n\n==Boundary dispute==\n[[Image:Labrador boundary dispute.png|thumb|Line A: the boundary decided by the Privy Council; the current legal boundary. Line B: the boundary as it is often portrayed by Quebec today (for example: [http://www.quebec511.info/images/fr/carte_routiere/PDF/c06_carton_Duplessis_4M.pdf Duplessis])]]\n\nThe border between Labrador and Canada was set March 2, 1927, after a tortuous five-year trial.
