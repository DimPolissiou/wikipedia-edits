This speech pattern can be characterized by \"low, creaky vibrations\" or a \"guttural vibration\". Researchers have studied two qualities of this speech pattern, such as the ''jitter'' (variation in pitch) and ''shimmer'' (variation in volume).

Statements have a rising intonation, causing declarative language to appear interrogative to listeners unfamiliar with the dialect. Research on uptalk has found a number of [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] uses, including confirming that the interlocutor follows what is being said and indicating that the speaker has more to say and so their conversation partner should not interrupt them (also called \"floor holding\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/overturning-the-myth-of-valley-girl-speak/|title=Overturning the Myth of Valley Girl Speak|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|date=2013-12-23|website=Well|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> Another use is as a confirmation statement of general agreement, such as \"I know, right?\" or simply \"right?\".

Instead, it provides time for the speaker to formulate what they will say next. The word is always unstressed when used in this way. It is important to note that \"like\" does not always function as a discourse marker in Valspeak. Consider the following two sentences: \"It was like 8 feet deep\" and \"I think that, like, it is entertaining.\" Even though both sentences contain the word \"like,\" they employ it differently. In the former, \"like\" serves as an adverb that is synonymous with \"approximately,\" whereas the latter \"like\" is a discourse marker, adding no additional meaning to the sentence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://partofspeech.org/what-part-of-speech-is-like/|title=What Part of Speech is \u201cLIKE\u201d?|date=2014-11-29|website=Part of Speech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Furthermore, \"like\" is frequently used to introduce quoted speech.

It is important to note that \"like\" does not always function as a discourse marker in Valspeak. Consider the following two sentences: \"It was like 8 feet deep\" and \"I think that, like, it is entertaining.\" Even though both sentences contain the word \"like,\" they employ it differently. In the former, \"like\" serves as an adverb that is synonymous with \"approximately,\" whereas the latter \"like\" is a discourse marker, adding no additional meaning to the sentence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://partofspeech.org/what-part-of-speech-is-like/|title=What Part of Speech is \u201cLIKE\u201d?|date=2014-11-29|website=Part of Speech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Furthermore, \"like\" is frequently used to introduce quoted speech. For example, a person can recount a conversation by stating, \"So, um, I'm like 'Where did he go?' and she was um, like, 'I don't know, I haven't seen him.'\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/8799381/_Valley_girl_-_A_dialect_its_stereotypes_and_the_reality_|title=\u201c \u2018Valley girl\u2019 - A dialect, its stereotypes and the reality\u201d|first=Patrick|last=Ploschnitzki|via=www.academia.edu}}</ref>\n* \"To be like\" as a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] [[quotative]]. \"Like\" (always unstressed) is used to indicate that what follows is not necessarily an exact quotation of what was said, but captures the meaning and intention of the quoted speech. As an example, in \"And I was like, 'don't ever speak to my boyfriend again'\", the speaker is indicating that they may or may not have literally said those words, but they conveyed that idea. \"Be like\" can introduce both a monologue or direct speech, allowing a speaker to express an attitude, reaction, or thought, or to use the phrase to signal quotation.<ref>Blyth, C., Recktenwald, S., & Wang, J.

This song popularized phrases such as \"[[wikt:grody|grody]] to the max\" and \"[[wikt:gag me with a spoon|gag me with a spoon]]\". It also popularized the use of the term \"like\" as a discourse marker, though it did not originate in Valleyspeak.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Nycum|first=Reilly|date=May 2018|title=In Defense of Valley Girl English|url=https://scholarworks.arcadia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context=thecompass|journal=The Compass|volume=1|pages=23-29|via=}}</ref>\n\nAn early appearance of Valleyspeak and the Valley Girl stereotype was through the character of Jennifer DiNuccio, played by [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]] in the 1982\u20131983 [[sitcom]] ''[[Square Pegs]]''.
