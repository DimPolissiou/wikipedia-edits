Production was initially halted in 1993 after 65 episodes spanning three seasons, with the last episode airing on May 22, 1994. From 1995 to 1996, the only new episodes broadcast were \"[[A Rugrats Passover]]\" and \"[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]\", two [[Judaism|Jewish]]-themed episodes that received critical acclaim; during this time, after the end of the show's production run, ''Rugrats'' began to receive a boost in ratings and popularity due to constant [[reruns]] on Nickelodeon.\n\nOn the 5th or April, 2021 Gordon Ramsey was lost as sea after running away after his friends wouldn\u2019t wait for him to get his rock out of his shoe.\n\nIn 1996, [[Klasky Csupo|Klasky Csupo Animation]] began producing new episodes, and the show's fourth season began in 1997. As a result of the show's popularity, a [[Rugrats (film series)|series of theatrical films]] were released over the next five years: ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'', which introduced Tommy's younger brother [[Dil Pickles|Dil]], was released in 1998;  ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]],'' which introduced [[List of Rugrats characters|Kimi, Kira, and Fifi]], was released in 2000; and ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'', a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film with another Klasky Csupo series, ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'', was released in 2003.

The 13-year run (with the 2-year break) ties ''Rugrats'' with ''[[King of the Hill]]'' as one of the [[List of longest-running United States television series|eighth longest-running American animated television series]].\n\nOn July 21, 2001, Nickelodeon broadcast the [[Made for TV|made-for-TV]] special \"[[All Growed Up]]\" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the series premiere. The special was a [[Pilot Episode|pilot]] for the ''Rugrats'' [[sequel]] series ''[[All Grown Up!]]'', which aired from 2003 to 2008 as it chronicles the lives of the babies and their parents after they age 10 years. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Rugrats Pre-School Daze]]'', aired on TV in 2008 but had only four episodes after Nickelodeon decided to focus on the sequel series. Two [[direct-to-video]] specials were released in 2005 and 2006 under the title ''[[Rugrats: Tales From The Crib|Rugrats: Tales from the Crib]]''. [[Tie-in]] media for the series include [[video games]], [[comics]], [[toys]], and various other [[merchandise]].\n\n''Rugrats'' gained over 20 awards during its 13-year run, including 4 [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, 6 [[Kids' Choice Awards]], and its own star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. The series garnered high ratings on Nickelodeon and was the network's top-rated show from 1995 to 2001. It was Nickelodeon's longest-running cartoon for 8 years, until ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' aired its 173rd episode in 2012. The show is Nickelodeon's third longest-running animated series, behind ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]''.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, Nickelodeon announced a revival of the series to be [[Executive producer|executive produced]] by the original creative team of Klasky, Csup\u00f3, and Germain.

Their address is revealed on an invoice in \"[[Tommy's First Birthday]]\" ([[Rugrats (season 1)|season one]], 1991) as 1258 N.

Several indicators, such as a state flag at a post office, license plate designs on the vehicles, and various trips to the [[Grand Canyon]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and the beach, place the characters somewhere in [[southern California]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Graham Canyon/Stu-Maker's Elves |series=Rugrats|network=Nickelodeon |date=May 24, 1992 |season=1 |number=13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=Vacation |series=Rugrats|network=Nickelodeon |date=July 8, 1997 |season=4 |number=3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=No Bones About It/Beach Babies |series=Rugrats|network=Nickelodeon |date=November 1, 1992 |season=2 |number=9}}</ref> The location is also hinted at during \"[[Rugrats (season 1)#Little Dude|Little Dude]]\" ([[Rugrats (season 1)|season one]], 1991) when Didi, who is a teacher, takes Tommy to her class at Eucaipah High School, referencing the city of [[Yucaipa, California]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Baby Commercial/Little Dude |series=Rugrats|network=Nickelodeon |date=September 8, 1991 |season=1 |number=4}}</ref> It has been implied that this ambiguity was done intentionally to help give the impression of seeing the world through the eyes of the babies, who would not understand the concept of location.

Chuckie, Tommy's bespectacled, red-headed, insecure, cowardly two-year-old best friend; the twins [[Phil and Lil DeVille|Phil and Lil]], noted for their revolting eccentricities and love of digging for and eating insects and [[earthworm]]s; Tommy's baby brother [[Dil Pickles|Dil]] (who was born in ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]''); [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica]], Tommy and Dil's outrageously spoiled and selfish three-year-old cousin who is a \"rival\" of his friends and the main antagonist of the program; Kimi, Chuckie's adventurous, playful stepsister (introduced in ''Rugrats in Paris'') (later just his sister after adoption); and [[Susie Carmichael|Susie]], a good-hearted neighbor of the Pickles family, Angelica's schoolmate, friend, and \"rival\", who is better liked by the younger children and far more reliable than Angelica.\n\nThe other characters depicted in ''Rugrats'' include the babies' parents, who are portrayed as often being easily distracted, leaving their young children free to emancipate themselves from restraints such as playpens or strollers and venturing out to explore. Such adult figures include Didi and Stu Pickles, Tommy and Dil's mother and father. Didi is a sweet, educated and loving mother<!--and possibly a bit of a [[Renaissance woman]] (telling by her interests and knowledge in certain cultures or festivals when she and the other parents bring the babies to different locations or attractions)--> who decides to return to college in one episode. Stu is an often-feckless toy inventor whose designs have been known to either fail or break. Other parents include Chas Finster, Chuckie's stereotypically nerdy and mild-mannered father, a widower who later remarries; Kira, Chuckie's sweet-natured, kind and understanding stepmother (later just his mother after adoption) whom Chas marries in ''Rugrats in Paris''; Drew Pickles, Angelica's indulgent and doting father who pampers his daughter to a ridiculous degree; Charlotte Pickles, Angelica's workaholic mother who overindulges her daughter equally if often seen talking on her cell phone with an employee of hers named Jonathan, although neither of them afraid to put their foot down when they feel she is getting out of line; Betty DeVille, Phil and Lil's kind but boisterous [[feminism|feminist]] mother; and Howard DeVille, the twins' mild-mannered and soft-spoken father.\n\nSusie's parents and elder siblings also make appearances in some episodes, and another major adult character includes Lou Pickles, Drew and Stu's father and Tommy, Angelica, and Dil's grandfather; an elderly widower who later remarries with an active woman named Lulu. Didi's parents, Jewish immigrants named Boris and Minka, also appear numerous times and serve as important characters and are often seen bickering. ''Rugrats'' also has animal characters, including the Pickles family dog, [[Spike (Rugrats)|Spike]], who played important roles in some episodes, and Angelica's pet cat Fluffy.\n\nThe show functions under a translation convention for [[baby talk]], which is presented as essentially a separate language which only other babies can understand. The babies' dialogue is almost universally translated for viewers into comprehensible English dialogue, but adults in the series cannot understand them. One example of this dissonance is when Tommy says \"Reptar!\", (the title character of a popular in-show children's franchise) but his mother then responds that she heard him say \"riff-raff\", and that she hopes he is getting close to speaking full words, indicating that adult characters still hear the dialogue of baby characters as babbling. The translated dialogue of the babies is still presented as infantile English, reflecting their limited understanding of the world. Another major point of this plot convention is that toddlers who have learned to speak the adult language can still understand baby talk because they are at a transitional age between the two. Angelica and Susie can understand what the baby characters are saying but can also communicate with adults, though they never outright reveal to the adults that they can comprehend complex messages from the babies. Very young newborns, such as Tommy's little brother, cannot yet communicate even with baby talk, although Dil has a very limited vocabulary consisting of the words \"poopy\" and \"mine\" which are perhaps the only words he is capable of saying. The older babies, such as Tommy and Chuckie, are able to interpret what Dil is trying to communicate although, due to their own age, it is difficult. When the older babies do figure out what Dil wants or needs, it usually involves changing his diaper or giving him an object \u2013 to play with or just to experience the joy of holding it.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Rugrats'' was formed by the then-husband-and-wife duo of G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3 and Arlene Klasky, along with Paul Germain in 1989. Klasky Csupo had a major animation firm at the time which also provided services for commercials and music videos. Klasky, Csup\u00f3, and Germain were also animating ''[[The Simpsons]]'' at the time, which they would continue to do until 1992. The trio decided to create their own series in reaction to a proclamation by the children's cable network Nickelodeon that they were to launch their own line of animated shows, which would be later called \"Nicktoons\". With the comedic stimulation branching from the antics of Klasky and Csup\u00f3's infant children and also pulling inspiration from [[The Beatles]], the 6{{frac|1|2}}\u2013minute pilot episode, \"[[Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing]]\" (never to be aired), went into production.\n\n[[Peter Chung]], along with Klasky and Csup\u00f3, co-designed the characters and directed the series pilot, \"Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing\", as well as the opening sequence. In a ''Decider'' article, Chung said, \"He [G\u00e1bor] wanted the babies to be 'strange' instead of 'cute.'\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://decider.com/2016/06/16/the-oral-history-of-nicktoons-part-iii-rugrats/|title=The Oral History Of 'Nicktoons', Part III: Exploring The Multigenerational Appeal Of 'Rugrats'|last=Gaines|first=Caseen|last2=Klickstein|first2=Mathew|date=June 16, 2016|website=Decider {{!}} Where To Stream Movies & Shows on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant, HBO Go|access-date=June 25, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308002230/http://decider.com/2016/06/16/the-oral-history-of-nicktoons-part-iii-rugrats/|archivedate=March 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The production was completed in 1990 and they submitted it to Nickelodeon, who tested it with an audience of children. The feedback for the pilot episode was primarily positive. With that, the series went into production. Chuckie and Angelica were added as characters.\n\nPaul Germain felt that the series needed a bully. Angelica was based on a bully in Germain's childhood, who was a girl. In addition to that, it was Germain who decided that Angelica would be a spoiled brat. Klasky initially did not like Angelica Pickles and also protested the character's actions in episodes like \"Barbecue Story\", where she throws Tommy's ball over the fence.\n\nIn a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, Klasky said, \"I think she's a bully. I never liked Angelica.\"<ref name=\"Mimi1998\"/> She never fully approved of Angelica's character development. Her bullying caused Klasky to disdain her. Angelica started to become a problem for some of the ''Rugrats'' staff. In some instances, her voice actress, Cheryl Chase, had trouble portraying a mean Angelica. To help Chase out, Steve Viksen, one of the writers, would mention that Angelica was the series' [[J. R. Ewing]].\n\nAfter the episode \"The Trial\", Klasky complained that the Rugrats were starting to act too old for their age. Csup\u00f3 often acted as a mediator in arguments between Klasky and the writers, with the writers often winning. Some of the offscreen tensions ultimately found their way into the scripts and, naturally, into the show. In 1994, before Nick premiered the last of the original 65, production of new episodes went on hiatus, and most of the ''Rugrats'' writing team (including Germain) left Klasky-Csupo.<ref>https://ew.com/article/2016/08/10/rugrats-passover-chuckie-mom/</ref> After the first-run days were over, Nickelodeon had enough episodes to show every day, and did just that, scheduling the show in the early evening, when both kids and parents would be watching, among multiple other times in the day; in 1996, ''Rugrats'' episodes had aired 655 times over the course of the calendar year, and despite (or perhaps because of) the saturation it remained one of cable television's most-watched series that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/ratings/numbers-game-puts-nick-way-out-front-1117433320/|title=Numbers game puts Nick way out front|first=Ray|last=Richmond|date=January 20, 1997|website=Variety.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> The show resumed production in 1996. However, the tensions between Klasky-Csupo and their former writers still existed.\n\nAfter ''The Rugrats Movie'' and seeing the \"new\" Angelica in the film, Klasky changed her tune: \"I think she's great for the show; I love Angelica.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=The New Yorkers Facts About Rugrats|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrnews2.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314183149/http://www.rugratonline.com/rrnews2.htm|archivedate=March 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Nicktoons===\n''Rugrats'' was Nickelodeon's second [[Nicktoons|Nicktoon]], debuting on the same day as ''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]'' (which premiered before it) and ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' (which debuted after). The first run of the series was produced from 1990 to 1993 before production went on a hiatus (episodes that had not yet been released at that point continued to be released through 1994). Between 1995 and 1996, only two Jewish-themed specials premiered, and the rest of the series aired in reruns. Production on new episodes restarted in 1996 and the show aired in Nickelodeon's [[SNICK]] block from 1997 to 2001. From 1994 until 2012, ''Rugrats'' was Nickelodeon's longest-running Nicktoon, with 172 episodes produced across its 13-year run. It was surpassed in 2012 by ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' with the episode \"Squiditis/Demolition Doofus\" that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/article/spongebob-renewed-26-episodes-11810 |accessdate=December 16, 2009 |work=The Wrap |title='SpongeBob' Renewed for 26 Episodes |date=December 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn July 21, 2001, ''Rugrats'' celebrated its 10-year anniversary; the special/TV movie \"[[All Growed Up]]\" was produced for the occasion. After the show, a special retrospective look-back aired, entitled \"Rugrats: Still Babies After All These Years\". It was narrated by [[Amanda Bynes]]. Nickelodeon approved of its ratings and popularity so much, they eventually commissioned a full series, ''All Grown Up'', which ran from 2003 to 2008.\n\n''Rugrats'' ended in 2004, along with fellow Nicktoons ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'', and ''[[Rocket Power]]''. After the run, two fairytale-themed direct-to-video films based on the original series, under the title ''Rugrats: Tales from the Crib'', were produced and then released separately in 2005 and 2006.\n\n===Nick Jr.===\nWhen production was put on hiatus the series was put on reruns both on [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] (the block) and regular Nickelodeon.  As of 2013, ''Rugrats'' was also on [[Nick Jr.]]'s nighttime block [[NickMom]] for a brief time, but it came back on July 11, 2014.\n\n===Voice actors===\nThrough its full run, ''Rugrats'' occupied several main voice actors. [[E. G. Daily]] provided the voice of [[Tommy Pickles]], except in the unaired pilot where Tami Holbrook provided the voice; [[Christine Cavanaugh]] was the original voice of Chuckie Finster, but left the show for personal reasons and was subsequently replaced by [[Nancy Cartwright]] in 2002. The fraternal twins, Phil and Lil (as well as their mother, Betty) were voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]; Dil Pickles and Timmy McNulty were voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. [[Cheryl Chase (actress)|Cheryl Chase]] initially auditioned for the role of Tommy, but was passed up. When the show came to series, she was brought on board to be cast as the voice of [[Angelica Pickles]]. [[Dionne Quan]] was the voice of Kimi Finster. Susie was primarily voiced by [[Cree Summer]], though in two episodes where she could not be in attendance E. G. Daily filled in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrchar01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105124810/http://rugratonline.com/rrchar01.htm |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Other regular voice actors included [[Melanie Chartoff]] as Didi Pickles, [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] was the voice of Stu Pickles, [[Tress MacNeille]] as Charlotte Pickles, and [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] as Drew Pickles and Chas Finster.

In 2000, [[Debbie Reynolds]] joined the cast as Lulu Pickles, Lou's second wife, and remained until the series' end.\n\n===Episode production===\nEpisodes took up to a year in advance to produce. First, the story had to get written and then approved. The next phase consisted of voice recording, storyboarding, pre-eliminating animation, overseas production, overseas delivery, followed by editing and polishing. All of that had to happen even before [[Klasky-Csupo]] sent the master tapes to Nick. In addition, fine animation took time to make. During the first six seasons of ''Rugrats'', shows were primarily divided into two eleven-minute episodes. After the second movie, during season seven, ''Rugrats'' made a change with a different format that consisted of three episodes per show, though it returned to its original two-episode-per-show format in the final two seasons.<ref>{{cite news|title=The rugrats FAQ|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/faq.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105100523/http://rugratonline.com/faq.htm|archivedate=January 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Rugrats episodes}}\n{{:List of Rugrats episodes}}\n\n==Themes==\n''Rugrats'' visualizes ordinary, everyday activities through the eyes of a group of toddlers. Using their imaginations, the babies transform routine tasks into surprising adventures. The show plays with [[baby talk]], having the group constantly mispronounce words and use improper grammar. Challenges often emerge because the babies misinterpret the adults, usually caused by Angelica's deceptive translations. The grown-ups of ''Rugrats'' are simultaneously quirky, over-cautious, and oblivious. The series portrays adults as mysterious eccentrics.

In 2000 a sequel, ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'', was released, with three new characters introduced, Kimi, Kira, and Fifi. Kimi would become Chuckie's sister and Kira would become his new mother, after marrying his father. Fifi would become Spike's new mate and Chuckie's new dog. It too was a box office success and also received a more positive critical reception. In 2003, ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'' was released.

Initially written by show-writer Scott Gray and drawn by comic book artist Steve Crespo, with Rob Armstrong as editor. Will Blyberg came on board shortly after as inker. By the end of 1998, Lee Nordling, who had joined as a contributing gag writer, took over as editor. Nordling hired extra writers, including Gordon Kent, Scott Roberts, Chuck Kim, [[J. Torres]], Marc Bilgrey, and [[John Zakour]], as well as new artists including Gary Fields, Tim Harkins, Vince Giaranno, and Scott Roberts. Stu Chaifetz colored the Sunday strips. The ''Rugrats'' strip started out in many papers, but as often happens with spin-off strips, soon slowed down. It is still seen in some papers in re-runs. Two paperback collections were published by [[Andrews McMeel]] ''It's a Jungle-Gym Out There'' and ''A Baby's Work Is Never Done''.\n\nDuring this time, [[Nickelodeon]] also published 30 issues of an all Rugrats comic magazine. Most of these were edited by Frank Pittarese and [[Dave Roman]], and featured stories and art by the comic strip creators and others. The last nine issues featured cover art by Scott Roberts, who wrote and drew many of the stories. Other writers included Roman, Chris Duffy, Patrick M. O'Connell, Joyce Mann, and Jim Spivey. Other artists included [[Joe Staton]] and [[Ernie Col\u00f3n]]. The magazine also included short stories, many by Pittarese, and games, as well as reprints from an earlier, UK produced Rugrats comic.\n\nNick produced a special, 50-page comic magazine retelling of the film ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie|Rugrats in Paris]]'', edited by Pittarese and Roman, written by Scott Gray, pencils by Scott Roberts, and inks by Adam DeKraker.\n\nOn October 18, 2017, [[Boom!

Tommy and Angelica appear as guest characters in ''Rocket Power: Team Rocket Rescue''. They appear again as playable characters in ''[[Nickelodeon Party Blast]]'' and ''[[Nicktoons Racing]]''. Tommy later appears in ''[[Nicktoons Basketball]]'' in his ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' form. ''Rugrats'' characters make non-playable appearances in ''[[Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots]]'' and ''[[Nicktoons MLB]]''. Tommy, Angelica, and Reptar appear as playable characters in the video game ''[[Nickelodeon Kart Racers]]''. Tommy, Angelica, and Reptar are playable characters in the official [[mobile game]] ''Nickelodeon Super Brawl Universe''.\n\n===Live performances===\n''Rugrats&nbsp;\u2013 A Live Adventure'' was a show about Angelica's constant attempts to scare Chuckie. To help Chuckie combat his wide range of fears, Tommy invents a magic wand called the \"People-ator\" to make Chuckie brave. Angelica, however, wants Chuckie to stay scared, so she steals Tommy's wand. The Rugrats try to get it back but to no avail. Angelica becomes Princess of the World. Eventually, Chuckie becomes brave thanks to the help of Susie, Mr. Flashlight and the audience.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rugrats\u2014A live Adventure|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrlive.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=2017-08-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312081311/http://www.rugratonline.com/rrlive.htm|archivedate=March 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Many songs were included in the play, including the theme song.

The Rugrats and Reptar were predominantly featured on the front, there's a board game on the back and a special $3 rebate for Runaway Reptar on the side. This cereal was released for a limited time only, sold at US supermarkets 8/1/99 to 9/15/99 only, and not all supermarkets carried the cereal. To memorialize the movie, Rugrats in Paris, another Rugrats-based cereal came out in October 2000. Simply called the Rugrats in Paris Cereal, it has a similar appearance to Trix; it's a sweetened, multi-grain cereal with small-round bits in plain, red, purple and green. Small Eiffel Towers could also be seen.<ref>{{cite news|title=Breakfast with Rugrats: The kids On The Cereal Box|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrcerbox.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=2017-08-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314183116/http://www.rugratonline.com/rrcerbox.htm|archivedate=March 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2017, entertainment retail store chain [[FYE (retailer)|FYE]] began selling Reptar Cereal, as well as Reptar Bars, both based on fictional products within the show. Reptar Cereal is very similar to [[Froot Loops]], and Reptar Bars are chocolate bars filled with green frosting, a reference to the show in which the bars would turn the tongues of whoever ate it green.\n\n''Rugrats'' made fast-food appearances as well, with the most appearances being on Burger King. In 1994, the Hardee's fast-food chain offered a collection of Nicktoons toys as premiums that were included with kids' meals at their restaurants. All 4 Nicktoons at that time were featured \u2014 ''Doug'', ''Rugrats'', ''Ren & Stimpy'', and ''Rocko's Modern Life''. Other food items that feature ''Rugrats'' were Fruit Snacks, Macaroni and Cheese, Bubble Gum and Campbell's Rugrats Pasta with Chicken and Broth.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rugrats Foods|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrfood.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=2017-08-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226181939/http://www.rugratonline.com/rrfood.htm|archivedate=December 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn their first tie-in with Burger King, 5 ''Rugrats'' toys were offered with their Kids Club meals, a different one with each meal. Each toy came with a 12-page (including covers) miniature version of Nickelodeon Magazine, which featured the toy's instructions, word search, picture puzzle, \"Say What?\", a scrambled word puzzle, a coupon for Oral-B Rugrats toothpaste and toothbrush, and entry blanks to subscribe to Rugrats Comic Adventures, Nick Magazine, and the Kids Club. From 1998 until 2004, ''Rugrats'' based-products included watches and various toys.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"Burger King Rules\", And So Does Rugrats|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/burgking.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=2017-08-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904105652/http://rugratonline.com/burgking.htm|archivedate=September 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Reboot===\nIn 2012, co-creator Arlene Klasky stated that, if Nickelodeon asked [[Klasky Csupo]] to, she would be more than happy to produce new episodes of ''Rugrats'' and bring it back for a tenth season.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nOn September 2, 2015, it was announced on ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that [[Nickelodeon]] may \"seek to experiment with retooled versions of classics\" that could include ''Rugrats''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/nickelodeon-classic-tv-rugrats-hey-arnold-1201583856/|title='Rugrats' Revival?

Co-creator Paul Germain says it's a possibility if Nickelodeon is so inclined. \"It's completely up to them, but I think it could be interesting,\" he told ''[[Entertainment Weekly|EW]]''. The hitch here is Germain, who was largely the creative voice of ''Rugrats'' once it went to series, left after the original order of 65 episodes. \"A lot of the direction that they took the show in after I left in 1993 \u2013 the second 65 episodes and then the ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' series \u2013 I thought those episodes were poor. I thought they lost the spirit of it. I think the way to go for a reboot would be to take it back to where it was. I don't know if we could really do that, but that's what I would like to see. I think it's possible.\" Arlene Klasky, who co-created the show with Gabor Csup\u00f3 and Germain, but left showrunning to the latter, said a revival is something she and Csupo \"think about, 100 percent.\" But Klasky and Germain would disagree on one of the first fundamental questions that would face ''Rugrats'', just as it faces every reboot: whether the show should acknowledge the passing of time and, in the case of this show, how technology has seeped its way into child-rearing. Germain says he'd rather keep a ''Rugrats'' reboot as a time capsule. \"One of the things I think might be fun would be to just make the show a retro '90s show,\" he says. \"I think that'd be cool.

Production was initially halted in 1993 after 65 episodes spanning three seasons, with the last episode airing on May 22, 1994. From 1995 to 1996, the only new episodes broadcast were \"[[A Rugrats Passover]]\" and \"[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]\", two [[Judaism|Jewish]]-themed episodes that received critical acclaim; during this time, after the end of the show's production run, ''Rugrats'' began to receive a boost in ratings and popularity due to constant [[reruns]] on Nickelodeon.\n\nIn 1996, [[Klasky Csupo|Klasky Csupo Animation]] began producing new episodes, and the show's fourth season began in 1997. As a result of the show's popularity, a [[Rugrats (film series)|series of theatrical films]] were released over the next five years: ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'', which introduced Tommy's younger brother [[Dil Pickles|Dil]], was released in 1998;  ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]],'' which introduced [[List of Rugrats characters|Kimi, Kira, and Fifi]], was released in 2000; and ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'', a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film with another Klasky Csupo series, ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'', was released in 2003.

The 13-year run (with the 2-year break) ties ''Rugrats'' with ''[[King of the Hill]]'' as one of the [[List of longest-running United States television series|eighth longest-running American animated television series]].\n\nOn July 21, 2001, Nickelodeon broadcast the [[Made for TV|made-for-TV]] special \"[[All Growed Up]]\" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the series premiere. The special was a [[Pilot Episode|pilot]] for the ''Rugrats'' [[sequel]] series ''[[All Grown Up!]]'', which aired from 2003 to 2008 as it chronicles the lives of the babies and their parents after they age 10 years. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Rugrats Pre-School Daze]]'', aired on TV in 2008 but had only four episodes after Nickelodeon decided to focus on the sequel series. Two [[direct-to-video]] specials were released in 2005 and 2006 under the title ''[[Rugrats: Tales From The Crib|Rugrats: Tales from the Crib]]''. [[Tie-in]] media for the series include [[video games]], [[comics]], [[toys]], and various other [[merchandise]].\n\n''Rugrats'' gained over 20 awards during its 13-year run, including 4 [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, 6 [[Kids' Choice Awards]], and its own star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. The series garnered high ratings on Nickelodeon and was the network's top-rated show from 1995 to 2001. It was Nickelodeon's longest-running cartoon for 8 years, until ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' aired its 173rd episode in 2012. The show is Nickelodeon's third longest-running animated series, behind ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]''.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, Nickelodeon announced a revival of the series to be [[Executive producer|executive produced]] by the original creative team of Klasky, Csup\u00f3, and Germain.

Chuckie, Tommy's bespectacled, red-headed, insecure, cowardly two-year-old best friend; the twins [[Phil and Lil DeVille|Phil and Lil]], noted for their revolting eccentricities and love of digging for and eating insects and [[earthworm]]s; Tommy's baby brother [[Dil Pickles|Dil]] (who was born in ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]''); [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica]], Tommy and Dil's outrageously spoiled and selfish three-year-old cousin who is a \"rival\" of his friends and the main antagonist of the program; Kimi, Chuckie's adventurous, playful stepsister (introduced in ''Rugrats in Paris'') (later just his sister after adoption); and [[Susie Carmichael|Susie]], a good-hearted neighbor of the Pickles family, Angelica's schoolmate, friend, and \"rival\", who is better liked by the younger children and far more reliable than Angelica.\n\nThe other characters depicted in ''Rugrats'' include the babies' parents, who are portrayed as often being easily distracted, leaving their young children free to emancipate themselves from restraints such as playpens or strollers and venturing out to explore. Such adult figures include Didi and Stu Pickles, Tommy and Dil's mother and father. Didi is a sweet, educated and loving mother<!--and possibly a bit of a [[Renaissance woman]] (telling by her interests and knowledge in certain cultures or festivals when she and the other parents bring the babies to different locations or attractions)--> who decides to return to college in one episode. Stu is an often-feckless toy inventor whose designs have been known to either fail or break. Other parents include Chas Finster, Chuckie's stereotypically nerdy and mild-mannered father, a widower who later remarries; Kira, Chuckie's sweet-natured, kind and understanding stepmother (later just his mother after adoption) whom Chas marries in ''Rugrats in Paris''; Drew Pickles, Angelica's indulgent and doting father who pampers his daughter to a ridiculous degree; Charlotte Pickles, Angelica's workaholic mother who overindulges her daughter equally if often seen talking on her cell phone with an employee of hers named Jonathan, although neither of them afraid to put their foot down when they feel she is getting out of line; Betty DeVille, Phil and Lil's kind but boisterous [[feminism|feminist]] mother; and Howard DeVille, the twins' mild-mannered and soft-spoken father.\n\nSusie's parents and elder siblings also make appearances in some episodes, and another major adult character includes Lou Pickles, Drew and Stu's father and Tommy, Angelica, and Dil's grandfather; an elderly widower who later remarries with an active woman named Lulu. Didi's parents, Jewish immigrants named Boris and Minka, also appear numerous times and serve as important characters and are often seen bickering. ''Rugrats'' also has animal characters, including the Pickles family dog, [[Spike (Rugrats)|Spike]], who played important roles in some episodes, and Angelica's pet cat Fluffy.\n\nThe show functions under a translation convention for [[baby talk]], which is presented as essentially a separate language which only other babies can understand. The babies' dialogue is almost universally translated for viewers into comprehensible English dialogue, but adults in the series cannot understand them. One example of this dissonance is when Tommy says \"Reptar!\", (the title character of a popular in-show children's franchise) but his mother then responds that she heard him say \"riff-raff\", and that she hopes he is getting close to speaking full words, indicating that adult characters still hear the dialogue of baby characters as babbling. The translated dialogue of the babies is still presented as infantile English, reflecting their limited understanding of the world. Another major point of this plot convention is that toddlers who have learned to speak the adult language can still understand baby talk because they are at a transitional age between the two. Angelica and Susie can understand what the baby characters are saying but can also communicate with adults, though they never outright reveal to the adults that they can comprehend complex messages from the babies. Very young newborns, such as Tommy's little brother, cannot yet communicate even with baby talk, although Dil has a very limited vocabulary consisting of the words \"poopy\" and \"mine\" which are perhaps the only words he is capable of saying. The older babies, such as Tommy and Chuckie, are able to interpret what Dil is trying to communicate although, due to their own age, it is difficult. When the older babies do figure out what Dil wants or needs, it usually involves changing his diaper or giving him an object \u2013 to play with or just to experience the joy of holding it.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Rugrats'' was formed by the then-husband-and-wife duo of G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3 and Arlene Klasky, along with Paul Germain in 1989. Klasky Csupo had a major animation firm at the time which also provided services for commercials and music videos. Klasky, Csup\u00f3, and Germain were also animating ''[[The Simpsons]]'' at the time, which they would continue to do until 1992. The trio decided to create their own series in reaction to a proclamation by the children's cable network Nickelodeon that they were to launch their own line of animated shows, which would be later called \"Nicktoons\". With the comedic stimulation branching from the antics of Klasky and Csup\u00f3's infant children and also pulling inspiration from [[The Beatles]], the 6{{frac|1|2}}\u2013minute pilot episode, \"[[Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing]]\" (never to be aired), went into production.\n\n[[Peter Chung]], along with Klasky and Csup\u00f3, co-designed the characters and directed the series pilot, \"Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing\", as well as the opening sequence. In a ''Decider'' article, Chung said, \"He [G\u00e1bor] wanted the babies to be 'strange' instead of 'cute.'\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://decider.com/2016/06/16/the-oral-history-of-nicktoons-part-iii-rugrats/|title=The Oral History Of 'Nicktoons', Part III: Exploring The Multigenerational Appeal Of 'Rugrats'|last=Gaines|first=Caseen|last2=Klickstein|first2=Mathew|date=June 16, 2016|website=Decider {{!}} Where To Stream Movies & Shows on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant, HBO Go|access-date=June 25, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308002230/http://decider.com/2016/06/16/the-oral-history-of-nicktoons-part-iii-rugrats/|archivedate=March 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The production was completed in 1990 and they submitted it to Nickelodeon, who tested it with an audience of children. The feedback for the pilot episode was primarily positive. With that, the series went into production. Chuckie and Angelica were added as characters.\n\nPaul Germain felt that the series needed a bully. Angelica was based on a bully in Germain's childhood, who was a girl. In addition to that, it was Germain who decided that Angelica would be a spoiled brat. Klasky initially did not like Angelica Pickles and also protested the character's actions in episodes like \"Barbecue Story\", where she throws Tommy's ball over the fence.\n\nIn a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, Klasky said, \"I think she's a bully. I never liked Angelica.\"<ref name=\"Mimi1998\"/> She never fully approved of Angelica's character development. Her bullying caused Klasky to disdain her. Angelica started to become a problem for some of the ''Rugrats'' staff. In some instances, her voice actress, Cheryl Chase, had trouble portraying a mean Angelica. To help Chase out, Steve Viksen, one of the writers, would mention that Angelica was the series' [[J. R. Ewing]].\n\nAfter the episode \"The Trial\", Klasky complained that the Rugrats were starting to act too old for their age. Csup\u00f3 often acted as a mediator in arguments between Klasky and the writers, with the writers often winning. Some of the offscreen tensions ultimately found their way into the scripts and, naturally, into the show. In 1994, before Nick premiered the last of the original 65, production of new episodes went on hiatus, and most of the ''Rugrats'' writing team (including Germain) left Klasky-Csupo.<ref>https://ew.com/article/2016/08/10/rugrats-passover-chuckie-mom/</ref> After the first-run days were over, Nickelodeon had enough episodes to show every day, and did just that, scheduling the show in the early evening, when both kids and parents would be watching, among multiple other times in the day; in 1996, ''Rugrats'' episodes had aired 655 times over the course of the calendar year, and despite (or perhaps because of) the saturation it remained one of cable television's most-watched series that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/ratings/numbers-game-puts-nick-way-out-front-1117433320/|title=Numbers game puts Nick way out front|first=Ray|last=Richmond|date=January 20, 1997|website=Variety.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> The show resumed production in 1996. However, the tensions between Klasky-Csupo and their former writers still existed.\n\nAfter ''The Rugrats Movie'' and seeing the \"new\" Angelica in the film, Klasky changed her tune: \"I think she's great for the show; I love Angelica.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=The New Yorkers Facts About Rugrats|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrnews2.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314183149/http://www.rugratonline.com/rrnews2.htm|archivedate=March 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Nicktoons===\n''Rugrats'' was Nickelodeon's second [[Nicktoons|Nicktoon]], debuting on the same day as ''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]'' (which premiered before it) and ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' (which debuted after). The first run of the series was produced from 1990 to 1993 before production went on a hiatus (episodes that had not yet been released at that point continued to be released through 1994). Between 1995 and 1996, only two Jewish-themed specials premiered, and the rest of the series aired in reruns. Production on new episodes restarted in 1996 and the show aired in Nickelodeon's [[SNICK]] block from 1997 to 2001. From 1994 until 2012, ''Rugrats'' was Nickelodeon's longest-running Nicktoon, with 172 episodes produced across its 13-year run. It was surpassed in 2012 by ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' with the episode \"Squiditis/Demolition Doofus\" that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/article/spongebob-renewed-26-episodes-11810 |accessdate=December 16, 2009 |work=The Wrap |title='SpongeBob' Renewed for 26 Episodes |date=December 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn July 21, 2001, ''Rugrats'' celebrated its 10-year anniversary; the special/TV movie \"[[All Growed Up]]\" was produced for the occasion. After the show, a special retrospective look-back aired, entitled \"Rugrats: Still Babies After All These Years\". It was narrated by [[Amanda Bynes]]. Nickelodeon approved of its ratings and popularity so much, they eventually commissioned a full series, ''All Grown Up'', which ran from 2003 to 2008.\n\n''Rugrats'' ended in 2004, along with fellow Nicktoons ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'', and ''[[Rocket Power]]''. After the run, two fairytale-themed direct-to-video films based on the original series, under the title ''Rugrats: Tales from the Crib'', were produced and then released separately in 2005 and 2006.\n\n===Nick Jr.===\nWhen production was put on hiatus the series was put on reruns both on [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] (the block) and regular Nickelodeon.  As of 2013, ''Rugrats'' was also on [[Nick Jr.]]'s nighttime block [[NickMom]] for a brief time, but it came back on July 11, 2014.\n\n===Voice actors===\nThrough its full run, ''Rugrats'' occupied several main voice actors. [[E. G. Daily]] provided the voice of [[Tommy Pickles]], except in the unaired pilot where Tami Holbrook provided the voice; [[Christine Cavanaugh]] was the original voice of Chuckie Finster, but left the show for personal reasons and was subsequently replaced by [[Nancy Cartwright]] in 2002. The fraternal twins, Phil and Lil (as well as their mother, Betty) were voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]; Dil Pickles and Timmy McNulty were voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. [[Cheryl Chase (actress)|Cheryl Chase]] initially auditioned for the role of Tommy, but was passed up. When the show came to series, she was brought on board to be cast as the voice of [[Angelica Pickles]]. [[Dionne Quan]] was the voice of Kimi Finster. Susie was primarily voiced by [[Cree Summer]], though in two episodes where she could not be in attendance E. G. Daily filled in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrchar01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105124810/http://rugratonline.com/rrchar01.htm |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Other regular voice actors included [[Melanie Chartoff]] as Didi Pickles, [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] was the voice of Stu Pickles, [[Tress MacNeille]] as Charlotte Pickles, and [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] as Drew Pickles and Chas Finster. [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]] provided the voice of Grandpa Lou Pickles until his death in 1997,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Myrna|title=David Doyle; Actor on 'Charlie's Angels'|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-01/news/mn-33700_1_david-doyle|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=September 21, 2014|date=March 1, 1997}}</ref> when [[Joe Alaskey]] took over until the end of the series. In 2000, [[Debbie Reynolds]] joined the cast as Lulu Pickles, Lou's second wife, and remained until the series' end.\n\n===Episode production===\nEpisodes took up to a year in advance to produce. First, the story had to get written and then approved. The next phase consisted of voice recording, storyboarding, pre-eliminating animation, overseas production, overseas delivery, followed by editing and polishing. All of that had to happen even before [[Klasky-Csupo]] sent the master tapes to Nick. In addition, fine animation took time to make. During the first six seasons of ''Rugrats'', shows were primarily divided into two eleven-minute episodes. After the second movie, during season seven, ''Rugrats'' made a change with a different format that consisted of three episodes per show, though it returned to its original two-episode-per-show format in the final two seasons.<ref>{{cite news|title=The rugrats FAQ|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/faq.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105100523/http://rugratonline.com/faq.htm|archivedate=January 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Rugrats episodes}}\n{{:List of Rugrats episodes}}\n\n==Themes==\n''Rugrats'' visualizes ordinary, everyday activities through the eyes of a group of toddlers. Using their imaginations, the babies transform routine tasks into surprising adventures. The show plays with [[baby talk]], having the group constantly mispronounce words and use improper grammar. Challenges often emerge because the babies misinterpret the adults, usually caused by Angelica's deceptive translations. The grown-ups of ''Rugrats'' are simultaneously quirky, over-cautious, and oblivious. The series portrays adults as mysterious eccentrics. Episodes usually center on a [[morality|moral lesson]] that the babies learn during their imaginative explorations.\n\n==Release==\n{{Split|List of Rugrats home video releases|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Home media===\nNickelodeon and [[Amazon.com]] struck a deal to produce DVDs of new and old Nickelodeon shows, through the [[CreateSpace]] service. Using a concept similar to [[print on demand]], Amazon made the discs, cover art, and disc art itself. The first and second seasons of ''Rugrats'' were released on June 2, 2009, along with the first and second seasons of ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' (although the ''Rugrats'' Season 2 was released in a \"Best of\" collection).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Season-1/11806|title=Rugrats DVD news: Pre-order&nbsp;\u2013 Season 1 from Amazon|publisher=TV Shows on DVD|accessdate=May 25, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604034552/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Season-1/11806|archivedate=June 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Season 3 and 4 were released on September 23, 2011, through the CreateSpace program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Seasons-3-and-4/16001 |title=Rugrats DVD news: Announcement for Rugrats&nbsp;\u2013 Season 3 and Rugrats&nbsp;\u2013 Season 4 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218034536/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Seasons-3-and-4/16001 |archivedate=December 18, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Season 5 was released shortly after on October 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Season-5/16034 |title=Rugrats DVD news: Announcement for Rugrats&nbsp;\u2013 Season 5 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date=May 25, 2007 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017064601/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Season-5/16034 |archivedate=October 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On October 6, 2011, the complete Seasons 6\u20138 were released through CreateSpace, and Season 9 was released in a \"Best of\" collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Seasons-6-7-8-Best-of-9/16056 |title=Rugrats DVD news: Announcement for Rugrats&nbsp;\u2013 Season 6, Season 7, Season 8, Best of Season 9 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date=May 25, 2007 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809075010/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Seasons-6-7-8-Best-of-9/16056 |archivedate=August 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Amazon re-released seasons 2 & 9 as complete seasons on May 9, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Seasons-2-and-9/19793|title=Rugrats DVD news: Update about Rugrats&nbsp;\u2014 Season 2 and Rugrats&nbsp;\u2014 Season 9 - TVShowsOnDVD.com|work=tvshowsondvd.com|accessdate=August 13, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721064416/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Seasons-2-and-9/19793|archivedate=July 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As of February 2017, the Amazon.com releases have been discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WPIvNZeUtk|title=Rugrats Season DVD Sets OUT OF PRINT ON AMAZON???|last=J's Blu-Rays|date=February 28, 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> In May 2017, Nickelodeon and [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] released Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Season-1-and-Season-2/23077|title=Rugrats DVD news: General Release for Season 1 and Season 2 -TVShowsOnDVD.com|website=Tvshowsondvd.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820163134/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Season-1-and-Season-2/23077|archivedate=August 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In February 2018, Nickelodeon and Paramount Home Media Distribution released Seasons 3 and 4 on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Seasons-3-and-4/23836|title=Rugrats - 'Season 3' and 'Season 4' DVDs to 'Go Wide' at General Retail|website=TVShowsOnDVD.com|accessdate=November 29, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130220749/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rugrats-Seasons-3-and-4/23836|archivedate=November 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn Australia, all seasons have been released by [[Beyond Home Entertainment]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ DVD releases&nbsp;\u2014 complete seasons\n|-\n!

Initially written by show-writer Scott Gray and drawn by comic book artist Steve Crespo, with Rob Armstrong as editor. Will Blyberg came on board shortly after as inker. By the end of 1998, Lee Nordling, who had joined as a contributing gag writer, took over as editor. Nordling hired extra writers, including Gordon Kent, Scott Roberts, Chuck Kim, [[J. Torres]], Marc Bilgrey, and [[John Zakour]], as well as new artists including Gary Fields, Tim Harkins, Vince Giaranno, and Scott Roberts. Stu Chaifetz colored the Sunday strips. The ''Rugrats'' strip started out in many papers, but as often happens with spin-off strips, soon slowed down. It is still seen in some papers in re-runs. Two paperback collections were published by [[Andrews McMeel]] ''It's a Jungle-Gym Out There'' and ''A Baby's Work Is Never Done''.\n\nDuring this time, [[Nickelodeon]] also published 30 issues of an all Rugrats comic magazine. Most of these were edited by Frank Pittarese and [[Dave Roman]], and featured stories and art by the comic strip creators and others. The last nine issues featured cover art by Scott Roberts, who wrote and drew many of the stories. Other writers included Roman, Chris Duffy, Patrick M. O'Connell, Joyce Mann, and Jim Spivey. Other artists included [[Joe Staton]] and [[Ernie Col\u00f3n]]. The magazine also included short stories, many by Pittarese, and games, as well as reprints from an earlier, UK produced Rugrats comic.\n\nNick produced a special, 50-page comic magazine retelling of the film ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie|Rugrats in Paris]]'', edited by Pittarese and Roman, written by Scott Gray, pencils by Scott Roberts, and inks by Adam DeKraker.\n\nOn October 18, 2017, [[Boom!

Tommy later appears in ''[[Nicktoons Basketball]]'' in his ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' form. ''Rugrats'' characters make non-playable appearances in ''[[Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots]]'' and ''[[Nicktoons MLB]]''. Tommy, Angelica, and Reptar appear as playable characters in the video game ''[[Nickelodeon Kart Racers]]''. Tommy, Angelica, and Reptar are playable characters in the official [[mobile game]] ''Nickelodeon Super Brawl Universe''.\n\n===Live performances===\n''Rugrats&nbsp;\u2013 A Live Adventure'' was a show about Angelica's constant attempts to scare Chuckie. To help Chuckie combat his wide range of fears, Tommy invents a magic wand called the \"People-ator\" to make Chuckie brave. Angelica, however, wants Chuckie to stay scared, so she steals Tommy's wand. The Rugrats try to get it back but to no avail. Angelica becomes Princess of the World. Eventually, Chuckie becomes brave thanks to the help of Susie, Mr. Flashlight and the audience.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rugrats\u2014A live Adventure|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrlive.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=2017-08-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312081311/http://www.rugratonline.com/rrlive.htm|archivedate=March 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Many songs were included in the play, including the theme song.

The Rugrats and Reptar were predominantly featured on the front, there's a board game on the back and a special $3 rebate for Runaway Reptar on the side. This cereal was released for a limited time only, sold at US supermarkets 8/1/99 to 9/15/99 only, and not all supermarkets carried the cereal. To memorialize the movie, Rugrats in Paris, another Rugrats-based cereal came out in October 2000. Simply called the Rugrats in Paris Cereal, it has a similar appearance to Trix; it's a sweetened, multi-grain cereal with small-round bits in plain, red, purple and green. Small Eiffel Towers could also be seen.<ref>{{cite news|title=Breakfast with Rugrats: The kids On The Cereal Box|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrcerbox.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=2017-08-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314183116/http://www.rugratonline.com/rrcerbox.htm|archivedate=March 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2017, entertainment retail store chain [[FYE (retailer)|FYE]] began selling Reptar Cereal, as well as Reptar Bars, both based on fictional products within the show. Reptar Cereal is very similar to [[Froot Loops]], and Reptar Bars are chocolate bars filled with green frosting, a reference to the show in which the bars would turn the tongues of whoever ate it green.\n\n''Rugrats'' made fast-food appearances as well, with the most appearances being on Burger King. In 1994, the Hardee's fast-food chain offered a collection of Nicktoons toys as premiums that were included with kids' meals at their restaurants. All 4 Nicktoons at that time were featured \u2014 ''Doug'', ''Rugrats'', ''Ren & Stimpy'', and ''Rocko's Modern Life''. Other food items that feature ''Rugrats'' were Fruit Snacks, Macaroni and Cheese, Bubble Gum and Campbell's Rugrats Pasta with Chicken and Broth.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rugrats Foods|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/rrfood.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=2017-08-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226181939/http://www.rugratonline.com/rrfood.htm|archivedate=December 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn their first tie-in with Burger King, 5 ''Rugrats'' toys were offered with their Kids Club meals, a different one with each meal. Each toy came with a 12-page (including covers) miniature version of Nickelodeon Magazine, which featured the toy's instructions, word search, picture puzzle, \"Say What?\", a scrambled word puzzle, a coupon for Oral-B Rugrats toothpaste and toothbrush, and entry blanks to subscribe to Rugrats Comic Adventures, Nick Magazine, and the Kids Club.

Co-creator Paul Germain says it's a possibility if Nickelodeon is so inclined. \"It's completely up to them, but I think it could be interesting,\" he told ''[[Entertainment Weekly|EW]]''. The hitch here is Germain, who was largely the creative voice of ''Rugrats'' once it went to series, left after the original order of 65 episodes. \"A lot of the direction that they took the show in after I left in 1993 \u2013 the second 65 episodes and then the ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' series \u2013 I thought those episodes were poor. I thought they lost the spirit of it. I think the way to go for a reboot would be to take it back to where it was. I don't know if we could really do that, but that's what I would like to see. I think it's possible.\" Arlene Klasky, who co-created the show with Gabor Csup\u00f3 and Germain, but left showrunning to the latter, said a revival is something she and Csupo \"think about, 100 percent.\" But Klasky and Germain would disagree on one of the first fundamental questions that would face ''Rugrats'', just as it faces every reboot: whether the show should acknowledge the passing of time and, in the case of this show, how technology has seeped its way into child-rearing. Germain says he'd rather keep a ''Rugrats'' reboot as a time capsule. \"One of the things I think might be fun would be to just make the show a retro '90s show,\" he says. \"I think that'd be cool. Cell phones can be interesting, but technology has a funny way of making it very difficult to write around because people are always in constant communication with each other in a way that works against drama. It takes a really fun writers' obstacle away and makes it too easy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/08/nicktoons-rugrats-doug-ren-stimpy-reboots|title=Nicktoons creators talk 'Rugrats,' 'Doug,' 'Ren & Stimpy' reboots|date=August 8, 2016|website=Ew.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, a Nickelodeon senior vice president stated that ''Rugrats'' was one of many fan-favorite franchises being considered for a revival. \"Nickelodeon is going to look at the rich library they have, and not just ''Rugrats'',\" Michael Sammaciccia said, in response to a fan question.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/celebrity/rugrats-revival-still-possibility-says-010009957.html|title=Rugrats revival still a possibility, says Nickelodeon VP|website=Yahoo.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 2018, it was announced that Nickelodeon had given a series order to a 26-episode revival of the series, executive produced by Klasky, Csup\u00f3 and Germain.

The ''Silly Songs'' are generally introduced with a [[title card]] and a [[voice-over]] saying, \"And now it's time for Silly Songs with Larry, the part of the show where Larry comes out and sings a silly song.\" Some ''Silly Songs'' have alternate titles, such as \"Love Songs with Mr. Lunt,\" or \"Ukulele Karaoke with Bob,\" where another character sings the song instead.<ref>{{Citation|last=VeggieTales Official|title=VeggieTales {{!}} Monkey Silly Song {{!}} Silly Songs With Larry {{!}} Kids Cartoon {{!}} Kids Videos {{!}} Kids Movies|date=April 30, 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv9YwNGUSSU|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> The ''Silly Song'', if one appears, is usually in the middle of the program, often at a [[cliffhanger]] moment or in between two stories (although the LarryBoy videos, in particular, often lack this segment, with the exception of ''League of Incredible Vegetables'').

Bob, [[Larry the Cucumber]], and other Veggie characters then sing the show's theme song as they hop to Bob's front door. The theme song ends with a character making a random comment, such as Pa Grape commenting on Archibald's new sweater. Bob and Larry then wait for the mailman, Jimmy Gourd, to deliver a letter. When Jimmy comes, he happily sings his Mail Song, which Bob and Larry both find tedious. Similar to the opening counter top sequence of the ''VeggieTales'' videos, Bob and Larry read the letter and the cast tries to decide how to solve the viewer's problem through one of three regular segments: Archibald reads a story from his Big Book of Oddities, Pa Grape shows an old film, or Mr. Lunt appears with his stick puppet, Paco the Storytelling Mule, and tells a story. The result always proves disastrous, as the story or film makes no sense. Bob and Larry then intervene with a story from a VeggieTales video. The show ends with Bob and Larry wrapping things up by reiterating the story's lesson and thanking the kids for coming to his house. NBC episodes end with characters bidding the audience a simple \"Good-bye\".\n\nAccording to the [[Los Angeles Times]], \"Veggietales has been very successful for NBC in a Saturday morning time slot that has traditionally been difficult for the networks.

The program was offered in the direct-to-video market, with the first 30-minute program, ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]],'' released in December 1993.<ref name=\"MeMyselfBob\">{{cite book|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Me, Myself, & Bob: A True Story About God, Dreams, and Talking Vegetables|date=2008|publisher=T.

His first animation model was an [[anthropomorphic]] candy bar. When his wife suggested that parents might prefer a hero who promoted [[healthy diet|healthier eating habit]]s, he began designing the characters based on fruits and vegetables. The cast of voice actors of the early VeggieTales videos predominantly came from friends of Phil Vischer such as Dan Anderson ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Dad and Mom Asparagus|Dad Asparagus]]) and Jim Poole ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Scooter|Scooter the Carrot]]) who collaborated with Vischer on dramas at their local church.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Episode 200: THE BIG 2-0-0!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzD_J03KcuY|via=YouTube|accessdate=January 22, 2017|date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Softimage 3D was used for further episodes until 1999 when it was replaced with [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Noell Wolfgram|title=VeggieTales: What's the Big Idea?|url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Features/bigideap.html|accessdate=January 6, 2018|work=Digital Media FX|year=2003}}</ref>\n\n[[Lyrick Studios]] sued Big Idea in January 2002 claiming Big Idea \"abruptly walked away\" from a 1997 deal to manufacture and distribute VeggieTales merchandise.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2002/01/21/story1.html|title=Lawsuit over verbal pact pits Lyrick Studios, VeggieTales|last=Patrick|first=Stephanie|work=[[Dallas Business Journal]]|date=January 20, 2002|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref> Big Idea, which had no written contract, made a new deal with [[Warner Home Video]].

When Jimmy comes, he happily sings his Mail Song, which Bob and Larry both find tedious. Similar to the opening counter top sequence of the ''VeggieTales'' videos, Bob and Larry read the letter and the cast tries to decide how to solve the viewer's problem through one of three regular segments: Archibald reads a story from his Big Book of Oddities, Pa Grape shows an old film, or Mr. Lunt appears with his stick puppet, Paco the Storytelling Mule, and tells a story. The result always proves disastrous, as the story or film makes no sense. Bob and Larry then intervene with a story from a VeggieTales video. The show ends with Bob and Larry wrapping things up by reiterating the story's lesson and thanking the kids for coming to his house. NBC episodes end with characters bidding the audience a simple \"Good-bye\".\n\nAccording to the [[Los Angeles Times]], \"Veggietales has been very successful for NBC in a Saturday morning time slot that has traditionally been difficult for the networks.
