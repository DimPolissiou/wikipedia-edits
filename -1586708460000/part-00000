The [[targeted therapy]] revolution has arrived, but many of the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.\n\n== Beginnings ==\nThe beginnings of the modern era of cancer chemotherapy can be traced directly to the German introduction of chemical warfare during World War I. Among the chemical agents used, [[mustard gas]] was particularly devastating.  Although banned by the [[Geneva Protocol]] in 1925, the advent of World War II caused concerns over the possible re-introduction of chemical warfare. Such concerns led to the discovery of [[nitrogen mustard]], a chemical warfare agent, as an effective treatment for cancer. Two [[pharmacologist]]s from the [[Yale School of Medicine]], [[Louis S. Goodman]] and [[Alfred Gilman, Sr.|Alfred Gilman]], were recruited by the [[US Department of Defense]] to investigate potential therapeutic applications of [[chemical warfare]] agents. Goodman and Gilman observed that mustard gas was too volatile an agent to be suitable for laboratory experiments. They exchanged a nitrogen molecule for sulfur and had a more stable compound in [[nitrogen mustard]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Weisse|first=Allen B.|title=Medical Odysseys: The Different and Sometimes Unexpected Pathways to Twentieth-Century Medical Discoveries|url=https://archive.org/details/medicalodysseysd00weis|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-1616-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/medicalodysseysd00weis/page/127 127]}}</ref> A year into the start of their research, a [[Air Raid on Bari|German air raid in Bari, Italy]] led to the exposure of more than 1000 people to the [[John Harvey (ship)|SS ''John Harvey'']]'s secret cargo composed of [[mustard gas]] [[bomb]]s. Dr. [[Stewart Francis Alexander]], a lieutenant colonel who was an expert in chemical warfare, was subsequently deployed to investigate the aftermath.  [[Autopsy|Autopsies]] of the victims suggested that profound [[lymphoid]] and [[myeloid]] suppression had occurred after exposure. In his report, Dr. Alexander theorized that since mustard gas all but ceased the division of certain types of [[somatic cell]]s whose nature was to divide fast, it could also potentially be put to use in helping to suppress the division of certain types of cancerous cells.<ref name=li>{{cite book | last = Li | first = Jie Jack | title = Laughing Gas, Viagra, and Lipitor: The Human Stories behind the Drugs We Use | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2006 | page = 8 | isbn = 978-0-19-530099-4}}</ref>\n\nUsing that information, Goodman and Gilman reasoned that this agent could be used to treat [[lymphoma]], a tumor of lymphoid cells. They first set up an animal model by establishing lymphomas in [[mouse|mice]] and demonstrated they could treat them with mustard agents. Next, in collaboration with a thoracic surgeon, [[Gustaf Lindskog]], they injected a related agent, [[mustine]] (the prototype [[nitrogen mustard]] anticancer chemotherapeutic), into a patient with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].<ref name=\"Fenn\">{{cite journal |author1=Fenn JE |author2=Udelsman R |title=First Use of Intravenous Chemotherapy Cancer Treatment: Rectifying the Record |journal=J Am Coll Surg |date=March 2011 |volume=212 |issue=3 |pages=413\u2013417 |doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.10.018 |pmid=21247779}}</ref> They observed a dramatic reduction in the patient's [[tumor]] masses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilman A |author1-link=Alfred Gilman, Sr. |title=The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard |journal=Am.

[[Sidney Farber]], a [[pathologist]] at [[Harvard Medical School]], studied the effects of [[folic acid]] on leukemia patients. Folic acid, a [[vitamin]] crucial for DNA metabolism (he did not know the significance of [[History of molecular biology|DNA]] at that time), had been discovered by [[Lucy Wills]], when she was working in India, in 1937. It seemed to stimulate the proliferation of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL) cells when administered to children with this cancer. In one of the first examples of rational drug design (rather than accidental discovery), Farber used folate analogues synthesized by [[Harriett Kiltie]] and [[Yellapragada Subbarow]] of [[Lederle Laboratories]]. These analogues \u2014 first [[aminopterin]] and then [[amethopterin]] (now methotrexate) were antagonistic to folic acid, and blocked the function of folate-requiring enzymes. When administered to children with ALL in 1948, these agents became the first drugs to induce remission in children with ALL. Remissions were brief, but the principle was clear \u2014 antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. Farber met resistance to conducting his studies at a time when the commonly held medical belief was that leukemia was incurable, and that the children should be allowed to die in peace.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Afterwards, Farber's 1948 report in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] was met with incredulity and ridicule.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn 1947, [[Major League Baseball]] [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Babe Ruth]], who was battling [[nasopharyngeal cancer]], became one of the first human subjects of pteroyl triglutamate (also known by its brand name Teropterin, and similar to aminopterin) treatment. Dr. [[Richard Lewisohn]] of [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[New York City|New York]] administered the drug, and over the course of several months, Ruth's condition began to improve. However, Ruth died the following year.<ref name=\"visitors\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/august-16-1948-babe-ruth-americas-greatest-baseball-star-pioneer-modern-treatment-cancer-dies|title=Home run king Babe Ruth helped pioneer modern cancer treatment|author=Howard Markel|publisher=PBS|date=2014-08-15|accessdate=2018-06-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, [[Jane C.

He then decided to try to develop anti-metabolites in the same way as Farber, by making small changes in a metabolite needed by a cell to divide. With the help of [[George Hitchings]] and [[Gertrude Elion]], two pharmaceutical chemists who were working at the [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]] in [[Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York|Tuckahoe]], many [[purine]] analogues were tested, culminating in the discovery of [[6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP), which was subsequently shown to be a highly active antileukemic drug.\n\n==Vinca Alkaloids==\nThe [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] natural products group found that [[alkaloid]]s of the [[Madagascar periwinkle]] (''Vinca rosea''), originally discovered in a screen for [[anti-diabetic drug]]s, blocked proliferation of tumour cells. The antitumour effect of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. [[vincristine]]) was later shown to be due to their ability to inhibit [[microtubule]] polymerization alkaloys, and therefore cell division.\n\n==National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center==\n\nThe NCI, headed by Dr. [[John R. Heller Jr.]], lobbied the [[United States Congress]] for financial support for second-generation chemotherapy research.  In response, Congress created a [[National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center]] (NCCSC) at the NCI in 1955. This was the first federal programme to promote drug discovery for cancer \u2013 unlike now, most pharmaceutical companies were not yet interested in developing anticancer drugs. The NCCSC developed the methodologies and crucial tools (like [[cell line]]s and [[animal model]]s) for chemotherapeutic development.\n\n==Combination chemotherapy==\nIn 1965, a major breakthrough in cancer therapy occurred. [[James F. Holland]], [[Emil Freireich]], and [[Emil Frei]] hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs ''concurrently'' it would be more difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered [[methotrexate]] (an antifolate), [[vincristine]] (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-[[mercaptopurine]] (6-MP) and [[prednisone]] \u2014 together referred to as the POMP regimen \u2014 and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German [[Berlin]]-[[Frankfurt]]-[[M\u00fcnster]] clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease.\n\nThis approach was extended to the lymphomas in 1963 by [[Vincent T. DeVita]] and [[George Canellos]] at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone \u2014 known as the [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP regimen]] \u2014 could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nCurrently, nearly all successful cancer [[chemotherapy regimens]] use this paradigm of multiple drugs given simultaneously, called '''combination chemotherapy''' or '''polychemotherapy'''.\n\n==Adjuvant therapy==\n\nAs predicted by studies in animal models, drugs were most effective when used in patients with tumours of smaller volume. Another important strategy developed from this \u2014 if the tumour burden could be reduced first by surgery, then chemotherapy may be able to clear away any remaining malignant cells, even if it would not have been potent enough to destroy the tumor in its entirety. This approach was termed \"adjuvant therapy\".\n\n[[Emil Frei]] first demonstrated this effect \u2014 high doses of methotrexate prevented recurrence of [[osteosarcoma]] following surgical removal of the primary tumour. [[5-fluorouracil]], which inhibits [[thymidylate synthase]], was later shown to improve survival when used as an adjuvant to surgery in treating patients with colon cancer. Similarly, the landmark trials of [[Bernard Fisher (scientist)|Bernard Fisher]], chair of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, and of [[Gianni Bonadonna]], working in the [[Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano]], [[Italy]], proved that [[adjuvant chemotherapy]] after complete surgical resection of breast tumours significantly extended survival \u2014 particularly in more advanced cancer.\n\n==Drug discovery at the NCI and elsewhere==\n\n===Zubrod's initiatives===\nIn 1956, [[C. Gordon Zubrod]], who had formerly led the development of antimalarial agents for the United States Army, took over the Division of Cancer Treatment of the NCI and guided development of new drugs. In the two decades that followed the establishment of the NCCSC, a large network of cooperative clinical trial groups evolved under the auspices of the NCI to test anticancer agents. Zubrod had a particular interest in natural products, and established a broad programme for collecting and testing plant and marine sources, a controversial programme that led to the discovery of taxanes (in 1964) and camptothecins (in 1966). Both classes of drug were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of [[Monroe Wall]] at the [[Research Triangle Institute]].\n\n===Taxanes===\n[[Paclitaxel]] (Taxol) was a novel antimitotic agent that promoted [[microtubule]] assembly. This agent proved difficult to synthesize and could only be obtained from the bark of the [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific Yew tree]], which forced the NCI into the costly business of harvesting substantial quantities of yew trees from public lands. After 4 years of clinical testing in solid tumours, it was found in 1987 (23 years after its initial discovery) to be effective in [[ovarian cancer]] therapy. Notably, this agent, although developed by the NCI in partnership with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], was exclusively marketed by BMS (who had utilized the synthetic methodology developed by Robert Holton at Florida State University) who went on to make over a billion dollars profit from Taxol.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Camptothecins===\nAnother drug class originating from the NCI was the camptothecins. [[Camptothecin]], derived from a Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits [[topoisomerase]] I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the agent had little antitumour activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by [[nephrotoxicity|kidney toxicity]]: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, [[irinotecan]], won [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval for the treatment of colon cancer. Later, this agent would also be used to treat lung and ovarian cancers.\n\n===Platinum-based agents===\n[[Cisplatin]], a [[platinum]]-based compound, was discovered by a [[Michigan State University]] researcher, [[Barnett Rosenberg]], working under an NCI contract. This was yet another [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing to try to explain this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental [[Artifact (error)|artifact]] \u2014 the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an [[electrolysis]] product of the platinum [[electrode]] rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of [[testicular cancer]]. Subsequently, [[Eve Wiltshaw]] and others at the [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of [[carboplatin]], a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.\n\n===Nitrosoureas===\nA second group with an NCI contract, led by John Montgomery at the [[Southern Research Institute]], synthesized [[nitrosourea]]s, an [[alkylation|alkylating agent]] which cross-links DNA. [[Fludarabine]] phosphate, a purine analogue which has become a mainstay in treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, was another similar development by Montgomery.\n\n===Anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins===\nOther effective molecules also came from industry during the period of 1970 to 1990, including [[anthracycline]]s<ref name=\"weiss\">{{cite journal |author=Weiss RB |title=The anthracyclines: will we ever find a better doxorubicin? |journal=Seminars in Oncology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=670\u201386 |date=December 1992 |pmid=1462166}}</ref> and [[epipodophyllotoxin]]s \u2014 both of which inhibited the action of [[topoisomerase II]], an [[enzyme]] crucial for [[DNA]] synthesis.\n\n==Supportive care during chemotherapy==\nAs is obvious from their origins, the above cancer chemotherapies are essentially [[poison]]s. Patients receiving these agents experienced severe side-effects that limited the doses which could be administered, and hence limited the beneficial effects. Clinical investigators realized that the ability to manage these toxicities was crucial to the success of cancer chemotherapy.\n\nSeveral examples are noteworthy. Many chemotherapeutic agents cause profound suppression of the bone marrow. This is reversible, but takes time to recover. Support with [[platelet]] and red-cell transfusions as well as broad-spectrum [[antibiotic]]s in case of infection during this period is crucial to allow the patient to recover.\n\nSeveral practical factors are also worth mentioning. Most of these agents caused very severe nausea (termed [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] (CINV) in the literature) which, while not directly causing patient deaths, was unbearable at higher doses. The development of new drugs to prevent nausea (the prototype of which was [[ondansetron]]) was of great practical use, as was the design of indwelling intravenous catheters (e.g. [[Hickman line]]s and [[Peripherally inserted central catheter|PICC lines]]) which allowed safe administration of chemotherapy as well as supportive therapy.\n\n==Bone marrow transplantation ==\nOne important contribution during this period{{when|date=December 2012}} was the discovery of a means that allowed the administration of previously lethal doses of chemotherapy. The patient's [[bone marrow]] was first harvested, the [[chemotherapy]] administered, and the harvested marrow then returned to patient a few days later. This approach, termed [[autologous]] [[bone marrow transplantation]], was initially thought to be of benefit to a wide group of patients, including those with advanced breast cancer. However, rigorous studies have failed to confirm this benefit, and autologous transplantation is no longer widely used for solid tumors. The proven curative benefits of high doses of chemotherapy afforded by autologous bone marrow rescue are limited to both Hodgkin's and selected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who have failed therapy with conventional combination chemotherapy. Autologous transplantation continues to be used as a component of therapy for a number of other [[hematological malignancy|hematologic malignancies]].\n\n==Antihormone therapy==\nThe hormonal contribution to several categories of breast cancer subtypes was recognized during this time{{when|date=May 2015}}, leading to the development of pharmacological modulators (e.g. of [[Estrogen|oestrogen]]) such as [[tamoxifen]].\n\n==Targeted therapy==\n[[File:Bcr abl STI 1IEP.png|thumb|350px|right|<em style=\"color:green;font-style:normal\">bcr-abl kinase</em>, which causes [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]], inhibited by <em style=\"color:red;font-style:normal\">imatinib</em> (small molecule).]]\n\nMolecular genetics has uncovered signalling networks that regulate cellular activities such as proliferation and survival. In a particular cancer, such a network may be radically altered, due to a chance somatic mutation. [[Targeted therapy]] inhibits the metabolic pathway that underlies that type of cancer's cell division.\n\n===Tyrosine kinase inhibitors===\n{{further|Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors}}\nThe classic example of [[targeted therapy|targeted development]] is [[imatinib mesylate]] (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule [[kinase]]. The genetic abnormality causing [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML) has been known for a long time to be a [[chromosomal translocation]] creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. [[Brian Druker]], working in [[Oregon Health & Science University]], had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with [[Novartis]] chemist [[Nicholas Lydon]], who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, [[imatinib]] was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.\n\n===Monoclonal antibodies===\nAnother branch in [[targeted therapy]] is the increasing use of [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] in cancer therapy. Although monoclonal antibodies (immune proteins which can be selected to precisely bind to almost any target) have been around for decades, they were derived from mice and did not function particularly well when administered to humans, causing allergic reactions and being rapidly removed from circulation. \"[[Humanization]]\" of these antibodies (genetically transforming them to be as similar to a human antibody as possible) has allowed the creation of a new family of highly effective humanized monoclonal antibodies. [[Trastuzumab]], a drug used to treat breast cancer, is a prime example.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe discovery that certain toxic chemicals administered in combination can cure certain cancers ranks as one of the greatest in modern medicine. Childhood [[Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|ALL]], [[testicular cancer]], and [[Hodgkins disease]], previously universally fatal, are now generally curable diseases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown the ability to cure some cancers, including [[testicular cancer]], [[Hodgkin disease]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and some [[leukemia]]s. It has also proved effective in the [[adjuvant]] setting, in reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery for high-risk breast cancer, [[colon cancer]], and lung cancer, among others.{{when|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe overall impact of chemotherapy on cancer survival can be difficult to estimate, since improved cancer screening, prevention (e.g. anti-smoking campaigns), and detection all influence statistics on cancer incidence and mortality. In the United States, overall cancer incidence rates were stable from 1995 through 1999, while cancer death rates decreased steadily from 1993 through 1999.<ref>{{cite book |author=Abeloff |title=Clinical Oncology |publisher=Churchill Livingston |year=2004 |edition=3rd |pages=408\u2013413 }}</ref> Again, this likely reflects the combined impact of improved screening, prevention, and treatment. Nonetheless, cancer remains a major cause of illness and death, and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has proved unable to cure most cancers after they have [[metastasis|metastasized]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cancer (film)|''Cancer'' (2015 PBS film)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Papac RJ |title=Origins of cancer therapy |journal=Yale J Biol Med |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=391\u20138 |year=2001 |pmid=11922186 |pmc=2588755 }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilman A, Philips FS |title=The Biological Actions and Therapeutic Applications of the B-Chloroethyl Amines and Sulfides |journal=Science |volume=103 |issue=2675 |pages=409\u201336 |date=April 1946 |pmid=17751251 |doi=10.1126/science.103.2675.409 }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Farber S, Diamond LK |title=Temporary remissions in acute leukemia in children produced by folic acid antagonist, 4-aminopteroyl-glutamic acid |journal=N.

The [[targeted therapy]] revolution has arrived, but many of the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.\n\n== Beginnings ==\nThe beginnings of the modern era of cancer chemotherapy can be traced directly to the German introduction of chemical warfare during World War I. Among the chemical agents used, [[mustard gas]] was particularly devastating.  Although banned by the [[Geneva Protocol]] in 1925, the advent of World War II caused concerns over the possible re-introduction of chemical warfare. Such concerns led to the discovery of [[nitrogen mustard]], a chemical warfare agent, as an effective treatment for cancer. Two [[pharmacologist]]s from the [[Yale School of Medicine]], [[Louis S. Goodman]] and [[Alfred Gilman, Sr.|Alfred Gilman]], were recruited by the [[US Department of Defense]] to investigate potential therapeutic applications of [[chemical warfare]] agents. Goodman and Gilman observed that mustard gas was too volatile an agent to be suitable for laboratory experiments. They exchanged a nitrogen molecule for sulfur and had a more stable compound in [[nitrogen mustard]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Weisse|first=Allen B.|title=Medical Odysseys: The Different and Sometimes Unexpected Pathways to Twentieth-Century Medical Discoveries|url=https://archive.org/details/medicalodysseysd00weis|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-1616-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/medicalodysseysd00weis/page/127 127]}}</ref> A year into the start of their research, a [[Air Raid on Bari|German air raid in Bari, Italy]] led to the exposure of more than 1000 people to the [[John Harvey (ship)|SS ''John Harvey'']]'s secret cargo composed of [[mustard gas]] [[bomb]]s. Dr. [[Stewart Francis Alexander]], a lieutenant colonel who was an expert in chemical warfare, was subsequently deployed to investigate the aftermath.  [[Autopsy|Autopsies]] of the victims suggested that profound [[lymphoid]] and [[myeloid]] suppression had occurred after exposure. In his report, Dr. Alexander theorized that since mustard gas all but ceased the division of certain types of [[somatic cell]]s whose nature was to divide fast, it could also potentially be put to use in helping to suppress the division of certain types of cancerous cells.<ref name=li>{{cite book | last = Li | first = Jie Jack | title = Laughing Gas, Viagra, and Lipitor: The Human Stories behind the Drugs We Use | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2006 | page = 8 | isbn = 978-0-19-530099-4}}</ref>\n\nUsing that information, Goodman and Gilman reasoned that this agent could be used to treat [[lymphoma]], a tumor of lymphoid cells. They first set up an animal model by establishing lymphomas in [[mouse|mice]] and demonstrated they could treat them with mustard agents. Next, in collaboration with a thoracic surgeon, [[Gustaf Lindskog]], they injected a related agent, [[mustine]] (the prototype [[nitrogen mustard]] anticancer chemotherapeutic), into a patient with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].<ref name=\"Fenn\">{{cite journal |author1=Fenn JE |author2=Udelsman R |title=First Use of Intravenous Chemotherapy Cancer Treatment: Rectifying the Record |journal=J Am Coll Surg |date=March 2011 |volume=212 |issue=3 |pages=413\u2013417 |doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.10.018 |pmid=21247779}}</ref> They observed a dramatic reduction in the patient's [[tumor]] masses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilman A |author1-link=Alfred Gilman, Sr. |title=The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard |journal=Am.

[[Sidney Farber]], a [[pathologist]] at [[Harvard Medical School]], studied the effects of [[folic acid]] on leukemia patients. Folic acid, a [[vitamin]] crucial for DNA metabolism (he did not know the significance of [[History of molecular biology|DNA]] at that time), had been discovered by [[Lucy Wills]], when she was working in India, in 1937. It seemed to stimulate the proliferation of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL) cells when administered to children with this cancer. In one of the first examples of rational drug design (rather than accidental discovery), Farber used folate analogues synthesized by [[Harriett Kiltie]] and [[Yellapragada Subbarow]] of [[Lederle Laboratories]]. These analogues \u2014 first [[aminopterin]] and then [[amethopterin]] (now methotrexate) were antagonistic to folic acid, and blocked the function of folate-requiring enzymes. When administered to children with ALL in 1948, these agents became the first drugs to induce remission in children with ALL. Remissions were brief, but the principle was clear \u2014 antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. Farber met resistance to conducting his studies at a time when the commonly held medical belief was that leukemia was incurable, and that the children should be allowed to die in peace.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Afterwards, Farber's 1948 report in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] was met with incredulity and ridicule.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn 1947, [[Major League Baseball]] [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Babe Ruth]], who was battling [[nasopharyngeal cancer]], became one of the first human subjects of pteroyl triglutamate (also known by its brand name Teropterin, and similar to aminopterin) treatment. Dr. [[Richard Lewisohn]] of [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[New York City|New York]] administered the drug, and over the course of several months, Ruth's condition began to improve. However, Ruth died the following year.<ref name=\"visitors\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/august-16-1948-babe-ruth-americas-greatest-baseball-star-pioneer-modern-treatment-cancer-dies|title=Home run king Babe Ruth helped pioneer modern cancer treatment|author=Howard Markel|publisher=PBS|date=2014-08-15|accessdate=2018-06-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, [[Jane C.

He then decided to try to develop anti-metabolites in the same way as Farber, by making small changes in a metabolite needed by a cell to divide. With the help of [[George Hitchings]] and [[Gertrude Elion]], two pharmaceutical chemists who were working at the [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]] in [[Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York|Tuckahoe]], many [[purine]] analogues were tested, culminating in the discovery of [[6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP), which was subsequently shown to be a highly active antileukemic drug.\n\n==Vinca Alkaloids==\nThe [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] natural products group found that [[alkaloid]]s of the [[Madagascar periwinkle]] (''Vinca rosea''), originally discovered in a screen for [[anti-diabetic drug]]s, blocked proliferation of tumour cells. The antitumour effect of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. [[vincristine]]) was later shown to be due to their ability to inhibit [[microtubule]] polymerization alkaloys, and therefore cell division.\n\n==National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center==\n\nThe NCI, headed by Dr. [[John R. Heller Jr.]], lobbied the [[United States Congress]] for financial support for second-generation chemotherapy research.  In response, Congress created a [[National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center]] (NCCSC) at the NCI in 1955. This was the first federal programme to promote drug discovery for cancer \u2013 unlike now, most pharmaceutical companies were not yet interested in developing anticancer drugs. The NCCSC developed the methodologies and crucial tools (like [[cell line]]s and [[animal model]]s) for chemotherapeutic development.\n\n==Combination chemotherapy==\nIn 1965, a major breakthrough in cancer therapy occurred. [[James F. Holland]], [[Emil Freireich]], and [[Emil Frei]] hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs ''concurrently'' it would be more difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered [[methotrexate]] (an antifolate), [[vincristine]] (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-[[mercaptopurine]] (6-MP) and [[prednisone]] \u2014 together referred to as the POMP regimen \u2014 and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German [[Berlin]]-[[Frankfurt]]-[[M\u00fcnster]] clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease.\n\nThis approach was extended to the lymphomas in 1963 by [[Vincent T. DeVita]] and [[George Canellos]] at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone \u2014 known as the [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP regimen]] \u2014 could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nCurrently, nearly all successful cancer [[chemotherapy regimens]] use this paradigm of multiple drugs given simultaneously, called '''combination chemotherapy''' or '''polychemotherapy'''.\n\n==Adjuvant therapy==\n\nAs predicted by studies in animal models, drugs were most effective when used in patients with tumours of smaller volume. Another important strategy developed from this \u2014 if the tumour burden could be reduced first by surgery, then chemotherapy may be able to clear away any remaining malignant cells, even if it would not have been potent enough to destroy the tumor in its entirety. This approach was termed \"adjuvant therapy\".\n\n[[Emil Frei]] first demonstrated this effect \u2014 high doses of methotrexate prevented recurrence of [[osteosarcoma]] following surgical removal of the primary tumour. [[5-fluorouracil]], which inhibits [[thymidylate synthase]], was later shown to improve survival when used as an adjuvant to surgery in treating patients with colon cancer. Similarly, the landmark trials of [[Bernard Fisher (scientist)|Bernard Fisher]], chair of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, and of [[Gianni Bonadonna]], working in the [[Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano]], [[Italy]], proved that [[adjuvant chemotherapy]] after complete surgical resection of breast tumours significantly extended survival \u2014 particularly in more advanced cancer.\n\n==Drug discovery at the NCI and elsewhere==\n\n===Zubrod's initiatives===\nIn 1956, [[C. Gordon Zubrod]], who had formerly led the development of antimalarial agents for the United States Army, took over the Division of Cancer Treatment of the NCI and guided development of new drugs. In the two decades that followed the establishment of the NCCSC, a large network of cooperative clinical trial groups evolved under the auspices of the NCI to test anticancer agents. Zubrod had a particular interest in natural products, and established a broad programme for collecting and testing plant and marine sources, a controversial programme that led to the discovery of taxanes (in 1964) and camptothecins (in 1966). Both classes of drug were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of [[Monroe Wall]] at the [[Research Triangle Institute]].\n\n===Taxanes===\n[[Paclitaxel]] (Taxol) was a novel antimitotic agent that promoted [[microtubule]] assembly. This agent proved difficult to synthesize and could only be obtained from the bark of the [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific Yew tree]], which forced the NCI into the costly business of harvesting substantial quantities of yew trees from public lands. After 4 years of clinical testing in solid tumours, it was found in 1987 (23 years after its initial discovery) to be effective in [[ovarian cancer]] therapy. Notably, this agent, although developed by the NCI in partnership with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], was exclusively marketed by BMS (who had utilized the synthetic methodology developed by Robert Holton at Florida State University) who went on to make over a billion dollars profit from Taxol.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Camptothecins===\nAnother drug class originating from the NCI was the camptothecins. [[Camptothecin]], derived from a Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits [[topoisomerase]] I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the agent had little antitumour activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by [[nephrotoxicity|kidney toxicity]]: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, [[irinotecan]], won [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval for the treatment of colon cancer. Later, this agent would also be used to treat lung and ovarian cancers.\n\n===Platinum-based agents===\n[[Cisplatin]], a [[platinum]]-based compound, was discovered by a [[Michigan State University]] researcher, [[Barnett Rosenberg]], working under an NCI contract. This was yet another [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing to try to explain this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental [[Artifact (error)|artifact]] \u2014 the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an [[electrolysis]] product of the platinum [[electrode]] rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of [[testicular cancer]]. Subsequently, [[Eve Wiltshaw]] and others at the [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of [[carboplatin]], a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.\n\n===Nitrosoureas===\nA second group with an NCI contract, led by John Montgomery at the [[Southern Research Institute]], synthesized [[nitrosourea]]s, an alkylating agent which cross-links DNA. [[Fludarabine]] phosphate, a purine analogue which has become a mainstay in treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, was another similar development by Montgomery.\n\n===Anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins===\nOther effective molecules also came from industry during the period of 1970 to 1990, including [[anthracycline]]s<ref name=\"weiss\">{{cite journal |author=Weiss RB |title=The anthracyclines: will we ever find a better doxorubicin? |journal=Seminars in Oncology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=670\u201386 |date=December 1992 |pmid=1462166}}</ref> and [[epipodophyllotoxin]]s \u2014 both of which inhibited the action of [[topoisomerase II]], an [[enzyme]] crucial for [[DNA]] synthesis.\n\n==Supportive care during chemotherapy==\nAs is obvious from their origins, the above cancer chemotherapies are essentially [[poison]]s. Patients receiving these agents experienced severe side-effects that limited the doses which could be administered, and hence limited the beneficial effects. Clinical investigators realized that the ability to manage these toxicities was crucial to the success of cancer chemotherapy.\n\nSeveral examples are noteworthy. Many chemotherapeutic agents cause profound suppression of the bone marrow. This is reversible, but takes time to recover. Support with [[platelet]] and red-cell transfusions as well as broad-spectrum [[antibiotic]]s in case of infection during this period is crucial to allow the patient to recover.\n\nSeveral practical factors are also worth mentioning. Most of these agents caused very severe nausea (termed [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] (CINV) in the literature) which, while not directly causing patient deaths, was unbearable at higher doses. The development of new drugs to prevent nausea (the prototype of which was [[ondansetron]]) was of great practical use, as was the design of indwelling intravenous catheters (e.g. [[Hickman line]]s and [[Peripherally inserted central catheter|PICC lines]]) which allowed safe administration of chemotherapy as well as supportive therapy.\n\n==Bone marrow transplantation ==\nOne important contribution during this period{{when|date=December 2012}} was the discovery of a means that allowed the administration of previously lethal doses of chemotherapy. The patient's [[bone marrow]] was first harvested, the [[chemotherapy]] administered, and the harvested marrow then returned to patient a few days later. This approach, termed [[autologous]] [[bone marrow transplantation]], was initially thought to be of benefit to a wide group of patients, including those with advanced breast cancer. However, rigorous studies have failed to confirm this benefit, and autologous transplantation is no longer widely used for solid tumors. The proven curative benefits of high doses of chemotherapy afforded by autologous bone marrow rescue are limited to both Hodgkin's and selected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who have failed therapy with conventional combination chemotherapy. Autologous transplantation continues to be used as a component of therapy for a number of other [[hematological malignancy|hematologic malignancies]].\n\n==Antihormone therapy==\nThe hormonal contribution to several categories of breast cancer subtypes was recognized during this time{{when|date=May 2015}}, leading to the development of pharmacological modulators (e.g. of [[Estrogen|oestrogen]]) such as [[tamoxifen]].\n\n==Targeted therapy==\n[[File:Bcr abl STI 1IEP.png|thumb|350px|right|<em style=\"color:green;font-style:normal\">bcr-abl kinase</em>, which causes [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]], inhibited by <em style=\"color:red;font-style:normal\">imatinib</em> (small molecule).]]\n\nMolecular genetics has uncovered signalling networks that regulate cellular activities such as proliferation and survival. In a particular cancer, such a network may be radically altered, due to a chance somatic mutation. [[Targeted therapy]] inhibits the metabolic pathway that underlies that type of cancer's cell division.\n\n===Tyrosine kinase inhibitors===\n{{further|Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors}}\nThe classic example of [[targeted therapy|targeted development]] is [[imatinib mesylate]] (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule [[kinase]]. The genetic abnormality causing [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML) has been known for a long time to be a [[chromosomal translocation]] creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. [[Brian Druker]], working in [[Oregon Health & Science University]], had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with [[Novartis]] chemist [[Nicholas Lydon]], who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, [[imatinib]] was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.\n\n===Monoclonal antibodies===\nAnother branch in [[targeted therapy]] is the increasing use of [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] in cancer therapy. Although monoclonal antibodies (immune proteins which can be selected to precisely bind to almost any target) have been around for decades, they were derived from mice and did not function particularly well when administered to humans, causing allergic reactions and being rapidly removed from circulation. \"[[Humanization]]\" of these antibodies (genetically transforming them to be as similar to a human antibody as possible) has allowed the creation of a new family of highly effective humanized monoclonal antibodies. [[Trastuzumab]], a drug used to treat breast cancer, is a prime example.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe discovery that certain toxic chemicals administered in combination can cure certain cancers ranks as one of the greatest in modern medicine. Childhood [[Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|ALL]], [[testicular cancer]], and [[Hodgkins disease]], previously universally fatal, are now generally curable diseases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown the ability to cure some cancers, including [[testicular cancer]], [[Hodgkin disease]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and some [[leukemia]]s. It has also proved effective in the [[adjuvant]] setting, in reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery for high-risk breast cancer, [[colon cancer]], and lung cancer, among others.{{when|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe overall impact of chemotherapy on cancer survival can be difficult to estimate, since improved cancer screening, prevention (e.g. anti-smoking campaigns), and detection all influence statistics on cancer incidence and mortality. In the United States, overall cancer incidence rates were stable from 1995 through 1999, while cancer death rates decreased steadily from 1993 through 1999.<ref>{{cite book |author=Abeloff |title=Clinical Oncology |publisher=Churchill Livingston |year=2004 |edition=3rd |pages=408\u2013413 }}</ref> Again, this likely reflects the combined impact of improved screening, prevention, and treatment. Nonetheless, cancer remains a major cause of illness and death, and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has proved unable to cure most cancers after they have [[metastasis|metastasized]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cancer (film)|''Cancer'' (2015 PBS film)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Papac RJ |title=Origins of cancer therapy |journal=Yale J Biol Med |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=391\u20138 |year=2001 |pmid=11922186 |pmc=2588755 }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilman A, Philips FS |title=The Biological Actions and Therapeutic Applications of the B-Chloroethyl Amines and Sulfides |journal=Science |volume=103 |issue=2675 |pages=409\u201336 |date=April 1946 |pmid=17751251 |doi=10.1126/science.103.2675.409 }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Farber S, Diamond LK |title=Temporary remissions in acute leukemia in children produced by folic acid antagonist, 4-aminopteroyl-glutamic acid |journal=N.
