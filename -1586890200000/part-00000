Hincks and Clifford W. Beers on April 26, 1918. Hincks was very interested in the field because he had experienced bouts of [[mental illness]].\n\n[[The Globe and Mail]] reported the group's formation under the headline: \"$20,000 Secured for Institute: Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene Started in Mrs. Dunlap's Home.\"\n\nA short historical note records the purposes and objectives of the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene, as tentatively described at that first meeting. They included:\n\n1. War Work (a) Psychiatric examination of recruits. (b) Adequate care of returned soldiers suffering from mental disabilities.\n\n2. Mental examination of immigrants (post-war) to ensure a better selection of newcomers.\n\n3. Adequate facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of cases of mental disease.\n\n4. Adequate care of the mentally deficient.\n\n5. Prevention of mental disease and deficiency.\n\nHincks solicited friends and professionals to join the committee, with an emphasis on those in the medical profession. He already had the backing of C.K. Clarke, Dean of Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto; his persuasive address to the medical faculty of McGill won him its unanimous approval.\n\nHincks then established a Board of Directors. He asked 20 business and professional leaders to sit on the Board; 18 accepted. Among them were Lord Shaughnessy, President of the CPR; Richard B. Angus, Montreal financier and philanthropist; Dr. C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine, McGill University; Sir Vincent Meredith, President, Bank of Montreal; and F.W. Molson, President of Molson's Brewery. Each agreed to pledge $1,000 a year for three years towards the expenses of the new organization.\n\nHincks gained further support through a series of \"drawing-room meetings\". These were afternoon teas hosted by socially prominent women, each of whom invited her wealthy and influential friends. Hicks would present a speaker, his friend and co-founder Clifford W. Beers, author of the book, A Mind that Found Itself. It gave a graphic account of Beers' own mental illness and the treatment he received, some of it rather abusive and even cruel.\n\nHincks's extended the strategy to homes of friends in Quebec City, Montreal and Ottawa. It proved very successful: he recruited an impressive list of potential members and donors.\n\nThe first official meeting of the CNCMH was held in Ottawa on April 26, 1918. A provisional constitution was adopted. Dr C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine at McGill University, was elected President. Dr C.K. Clarke was appointed Medical Director, and Dr. C.M. Hincks was appointed Associate Medical Director and Secretary.\n\nIn the fall of 1918, the Committee established itself at 143 College St. in Toronto. Joining Clarke and Hincks were Miss Marjorie Keyes and two secretaries, Anne Abbot and Doris Secord. Miss Keyes was a graduate nurse who had been associated with Dr. Clarke and Dr. Hincks at the Out-Patient Psychiatric Clinic at [[Toronto General Hospital]]. During the summer of 1918, Miss Keyes prepared for her new role by taking psychiatric studies at Smith College.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Colin Russel soon gave the CNCMH an opportunity to undertake an important project. Russel was the consultant neurologist to the Department of Soldiers and had visited many of the provincial mental hospitals which were caring for soldier patients. He was particularly distressed with those facilities in Manitoba. That province's government included with the mental hospitals in the province, all the institutions presently caring for the mentally disordered or defective including jails, schools, special homes and juvenile courts.\n\nOn September 30, 1918, Hincks and Keyes arrived in Winnipeg, where they visited several institutions. They also toured the Salvation Army Industrial Home and the Home for Incurables in Portage la Prairie and were so shocked by what they found that they immediately returned to Winnipeg to consult with government representatives. The CNCMH prepared a confidential report on its findings which was submitted to the government and the Public Welfare Commission.\n\nAs a result of the Manitoba Survey, and that province's quick response in implementing the recommendations, other provinces became interested in having similar surveys. During the next four years, requests for surveys were received from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]], Alberta, and Saskatchewan. As in Manitoba, these surveys included all institutions. Results of these surveys, however, have had controversial implications, including how they were used to argue for pro-sterilization policies by the [[Alberta Eugenics Board#Historical context|Alberta Eugenics Board]] and in the form of the ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta.\n\nThe CNCMH also was very involved in the plight of soldiers. It became evident to Hincks that soldiers under care were not receiving adequate treatment. Assisted by Miss Keyes, Dr. Clarke conducted a quick inspection soldier patients in 10 hospitals in the western. The results of this preliminary survey were published in 1920. Highlighting the problem of shell shock and other neuropsychiatric disorders affecting so many able-bodied men helped pave the way for the work of the National Committee.\n\nThe CNCMH was also interested in advocated improvements to the psychiatric screening of immigrants. Dr. Clarke's lectures and official reports emphasized this fact.\n\nSchools were other areas of involvement. Dr. Hincks and Dr. Helen MacMurchy pressed for surveys to assess the extent of mental retardation and other psychiatric disorders among schoolchildren and to provide support for the establishment of auxiliary classes for the special education of such children. In its first five years, the CNCMH built a firm foundation for meeting the objectives established in 1918. Surveys on the care and treatment of people suffering from mental disorders were conducted in every province. Mental hospitals in all provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, were inspected at the request of provincial governments. The extent of mental disorder was found to be greater than expected, and preventive programs were non-existent. In accordance with the committee's recommendations, provincial governments spent over six million dollars on improving facilities for the mentally ill.\n\nCNCMH surveys of schoolchildren, conducted in several centres in Ontario and Quebec, resulted in over 150 special classes for retarded children being established by school boards. Mental Hygiene clinics were promoted and, in some cases, partially supported. A study of the psychiatric screening of immigrants resulted in a reduction of the number of new Canadians with mental disorders. The problem of \"shell shock\" and the rehabilitation of soldiers suffering from mental and nervous disorders was addressed through co-operation with DSCR and the Director General of Medical Services in the army. A beginning was made on public and professional education in mental hygiene and psychiatry.\n\n== Current Programs ==\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association has established various programs aimed at combating mental health issues. One of these is Peer Support Canada, an organization which specializes in connecting certified people who have experienced and beaten mental health issues with current sufferers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/peer-support-canada|title=Peer Support Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group also offers a certification, a three-phase program where individuals are be assessed and verified based on the national Standards of Practice regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to assist those with mental health challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peersupportcanada.ca/|title=Peer Support Canada|website=peersupportcanada.ca|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nNot Myself Today is a campaign directed at addressing mental health issues by cultivating a better workplace culture through training and services in corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/not-myself-today|title=Not Myself Today|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Companies that utilize the program receive a toolkit comprised of planning support, awareness and engagement activities, and evaluation tools.

A beginning was made on public and professional education in mental hygiene and psychiatry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mental health]]\n*[[Mental Health Commission of Canada]]\n*[[Mary Scullion]]\n*[[Ride Don't Hide]] - Charity riding event to raise awareness of mental issues\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.cmha.ca}}\n*[https://cmha.ca/about-cmha/history-of-cmha Canadian Mental Health Association history]\n\n[[Category:Mental health organizations in Canada]]\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Canada]]\n[[Category:Medical associations based in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "Rpaylor", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added current programs section including Peer Support Canada and Not Myself Today", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Mental_Health_Association"}

[[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not an eyewitness, related in his ''History of Virginia'' that braves of the [[Powhatan]] \"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\".<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/659023 James Mooney, \"The Powhatan Confederacy, Past and Present],\" ''American Anthropologist'' 9, no. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1907), 129\u201352.</ref> The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all the English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages. Chief [[Opchanacanough|Opechancanough]] led the Powhatan Confederacy in a coordinated series of surprise attacks; they killed 347 people, a quarter of the population of the Virginia colony.\n\n[[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 72. \"By 1620 the colonists were simply taking the acres they required for their expanding tobacco economy without even the pretense of negotiation or payment. Increasing encroachments on native American lands, and particularly onto their hunting grounds, largely accounted for the deterioration of relations between the English and the indigenous populations of the Tidewater Chesapeake that finally exploded in 1622.\"</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nAt first, the natives were glad to trade provisions to the colonists for metal tools, but by 1609 the English governor, John Smith, had begun to send raiding parties to demand food. This earned the colonists a bad reputation among the Native Americans and precipitated conflict.<ref>Fausz, ''An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) p. 20</ref> They isolated the Native Americans, burned down houses, and stole their food supplies.<ref>Fausz, \n Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) pp. 6, 22.</ref> The English violence alienated the natives further and they laid siege to the Jamestown fort for several months. Unable to secure more food supplies, many colonists died during the \"[[Starving Time]]\" in 1609\u201310.<ref>Fausz, ''An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) p. 54.</ref>\n\n[[London Company|The London Company]]'s primary concern was the survival of the colony. In England's best interest the colonists would have to maintain civil relations with the Powhatan. The Powhatan and the English realized that they could benefit from each other through trade once peace was restored. In exchange for food, the chief asked the colonists to provide him with metal hatchets and copper.<ref>Jay B. Hubbell, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4246320  The Smith-Pocahontas Story in Literature],\" ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' 65, no. 3 (Jul., 1957), 275\u2013300.</ref> Unlike John Smith, other early leaders of Virginia such as [[Thomas Dale]] and [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] based their actions on different thinking, as they were military men and saw the Powhatan as essentially a \"military problem.\"<ref>Glenn, ''Captain John Smith and the Indians'', 228\u201348.</ref>\n\nThe Powhatan had soon realized that the Englishmen did not settle in Jamestown to trade with them.  The English wanted more; they wanted control over the land. As [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]] said:\n\n{{quote|Your coming is not for trade, but to invade my people and possess my country\u2026Having seen the death of all my people thrice\u2026 I know the difference of peace and were better than any other Country.  [If he fought the English, Powhatan predicted], he would be so haunted by Smith that he can neither rest eat nor sleep, but his tired men must watch, and if a twig but break, every one cry, there comes Captain John Smith; then he must fly he know not whether, and thus with miserable fear end his miserable life<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\">Alden T.

As the colonists were about to leave the Bay and head out into the open sea, they were met by the incoming fleet of [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]]. Taking command as governor, de la Warr ordered the fort reoccupied. He plotted conquest of the surrounding tribes.<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" />\n\nIn July 1610 he sent Gates against the Kecoughtan people. \"Gates lured the Indians into the open by means of music-and-dance act by his drummer, and then slaughtered them\".<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" /> This was the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#First Anglo-Powhatan War|First Anglo-Powhatan War]]. The English, led by [[Samuel Argall]], captured [[Pocahontas]], daughter of Powhatan, and held her hostage until he would agree to their demands. \"English demanded that all Powhatan captives be released, return all English weapons taken by his warriors, and agree upon a lasting peace\".\n\nIt was while Pocahontas was held by the English that she met [[John Rolfe]], whom she later married. While in captivity, Pocahontas was taught the English language, and she learned about English customs and religion. She was baptized as a Christian and took the name Rebecca. Rolfe wrote that the way to maintain peace between the Powhatan and the English, was to marry Pocahontas, not \"with the unbridled desire of carnal affection but for the good of the colony and the glory of God. Such a marriage might bring peace between the warring English and Powhatan, just as it would satisfy Pocahontas's desire.\"<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" /> After they married, there were more peaceful relations for a time between the English colonists and the Powhatan Confederacy. Edward Waterhouse, secretary of the Virginia Company, wrote:\n\n{{quote|[S]uch was the conceit of firme peace and amitie, as that there was seldome or never a sword worne, and a Peece [firearm] seldomer, except for a Deere or Fowle....The Plantations of particular Adventurers and Planters were placed scatteringly and straglingly as a choyce veyne of rich ground invited them, and the further from neighbors held the better.

He planned to return with a ship filled with soldiers, sailors, and ammunition, to establish a \"running Army\" able to fight the Powhatan. Smith's goal was to \"inforce the Savages to leave their Country, or bring them in the feare of subjection that every man should follow their business securely\",<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\" /> but Smith never returned to Virginia.\n\nThe English took revenge against the Powhatan by \"the use of force, surprise attacks, famine resulting from the burning of their corn, destroying their boats, canoes, and houses, breaking their fishing weirs and assaulting them in their hunting expedition, pursuing them with horses and using bloodhounds to find them and mastiffs to seaze them, driving them to flee within reach of their enemies among other tribes, and 'assimilating and abetting their enemies against them\".<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\" />\n\nThe 1622 massacre was used as a justification for ongoing seizure of Powhatan land by the colonists for the next ten years. Historian Betty Wood writes:\n\n<blockquote>What is usually referred to as the \"Massacre of 1622,\" the native American attack that resulted in the death of 347 English settlers and almost wiped out Jamestown, gave the colonists the excuse they needed to take even more of what they wanted from the indigenous population of the Chesapeake. As far as the survivors of the Massacre of 1622 were concerned, by virtue of launching this unprovoked assault native Americans had forfeited any legal and moral rights they might previously have claimed to the ownership of the lands they occupied.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 72.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWood quotes a Virginian settler:\n\n<blockquote>We, who hitherto have had possession of no more ground than their waste and our purchase at a valuable consideration to their own contentment. . . may now by right of war, and law of nations, invade the country, and those who sought to destroy us: whereby we shall enjoy their cultivated places.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 73.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Indian decline and defeat==\nIn 1624 Virginia was made a [[crown colony|royal colony]] of [[England]] by King James I. This meant that the Crown took direct authority rather than allowing guidance by the [[London Company]]. The Crown could exercise its patronage for royal favorites. Settlers continued to encroach on land of the Powhatan tribes, and the colony (and England) tended to change or ignore agreements with the natives when no longer in the colony's interest.  The tribes felt increasing frustration with the settlers.\n\nThe next major confrontation with the Powhatan, the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#Third Anglo-Powhatan War|Third Anglo-Powhatan War]], occurred in 1644, resulting in the deaths of about 500 colonists.  While similar to the death toll in 1622, the loss a generation later represented less than ten percent of the population, and had far less impact upon the colony. This time, the elder Opechancanough, who was being transported by litter, was captured by the colonists. Imprisoned at Jamestown, he was killed by one of his guards.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Spencer C. Tucker|author2=James R.

Its member tribes eventually left the area entirely, gradually lived among the colonists, or lived on one of the few reservations established in Virginia. Most of these were also subject to incursion and seizure of land by the ever-expanding European population.\n\nIn modern times, seven tribes of the original Powhatan Confederacy are recognized in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  The [[Pamunkey]] and [[Mattaponi]] still have control of their reservations established in the 17th century, each located between the rivers of the same names within the boundaries of present-day [[King William County, Virginia|King William County]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of events named massacres]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last=Fausz |first=J.

[[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not an eyewitness, related in his ''History of Virginia'' that braves of the [[Powhatan]] \"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\".<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/659023 James Mooney, \"The Powhatan Confederacy, Past and Present],\" ''American Anthropologist'' 9, no. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1907), 129\u201352.</ref> The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all the English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages. Chief [[Opchanacanough|Opechancanough]] led the Powhatan Confederacy in a coordinated series of surprise attacks; they killed 347 people, a quarter of the population of the Virginia colony.\n\n[[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 72. \"By 1620 the colonists were simply taking the acres they required for their expanding tobacco economy without even the pretense of negotiation or payment. Increasing encroachments on native American lands, and particularly onto their hunting grounds, largely accounted for the deterioration of relations between the English and the indigenous populations of the Tidewater Chesapeake that finally exploded in 1622.\"</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nAt first, the natives were glad to trade provisions to the colonists for metal tools, but by 1609 the English governor, John Smith, had begun to send raiding parties to demand food. This earned the colonists a bad reputation among the Native Americans and precipitated conflict.<ref>Fausz, ''An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) p. 20</ref> They isolated the Native Americans, burned down houses, and stole their food supplies.<ref>Fausz, \n Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) pp. 6, 22.</ref> The English violence alienated the natives further and they laid siege to the Jamestown fort for several months. Unable to secure more food supplies, many colonists died during the \"[[Starving Time]]\" in 1609\u201310.<ref>Fausz, ''An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides'' (1990) p. 54.</ref>\n\n[[London Company|The London Company]]'s primary concern was the survival of the colony. In England's best interest the colonists would have to maintain civil relations with the Powhatan. The Powhatan and the English realized that they could benefit from each other through trade once peace was restored. In exchange for food, the chief asked the colonists to provide him with metal hatchets and copper.<ref>Jay B. Hubbell, \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4246320  The Smith-Pocahontas Story in Literature],\" ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' 65, no. 3 (Jul., 1957), 275\u2013300.</ref> Unlike John Smith, other early leaders of Virginia such as [[Thomas Dale]] and [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] based their actions on different thinking, as they were military men and saw the Powhatan as essentially a \"military problem.\"<ref>Glenn, ''Captain John Smith and the Indians'', 228\u201348.</ref>\n\nThe Powhatan had soon realized that the Englishmen did not settle in Jamestown to trade with them.  The English wanted more; they wanted control over the land. As [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]] said:\n\n{{quote|Your coming is not for trade, but to invade my people and possess my country\u2026Having seen the death of all my people thrice\u2026 I know the difference of peace and were better than any other Country.

As the colonists were about to leave the Bay and head out into the open sea, they were met by the incoming fleet of [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]]. Taking command as governor, de la Warr ordered the fort reoccupied. He plotted conquest of the surrounding tribes.<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" />\n\nIn July 1610 he sent Gates against the Kecoughtan people. \"Gates lured the Indians into the open by means of music-and-dance act by his drummer, and then slaughtered them\".<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" /> This was the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#First Anglo-Powhatan War|First Anglo-Powhatan War]]. The English, led by [[Samuel Argall]], captured [[Pocahontas]], daughter of Powhatan, and held her hostage until he would agree to their demands. \"English demanded that all Powhatan captives be released, return all English weapons taken by his warriors, and agree upon a lasting peace\".\n\nIt was while Pocahontas was held by the English that she met [[John Rolfe]], whom she later married. While in captivity, Pocahontas was taught the English language, and she learned about English customs and religion. She was baptized as a Christian and took the name Rebecca. Rolfe wrote that the way to maintain peace between the Powhatan and the English, was to marry Pocahontas, not \"with the unbridled desire of carnal affection but for the good of the colony and the glory of God. Such a marriage might bring peace between the warring English and Powhatan, just as it would satisfy Pocahontas's desire.\"<ref name = \"Vaughan 1978 57-84\" /> After they married, there were more peaceful relations for a time between the English colonists and the Powhatan Confederacy. Edward Waterhouse, secretary of the Virginia Company, wrote:\n\n{{quote|[S]uch was the conceit of firme peace and amitie, as that there was seldome or never a sword worne, and a Peece [firearm] seldomer, except for a Deere or Fowle....The Plantations of particular Adventurers and Planters were placed scatteringly and straglingly as a choyce veyne of rich ground invited them, and the further from neighbors held the better.

Randolph Turner III, ''Before and After Jamestown: Virginia's Powhatans and Their Predecessors''</ref>  Following the event, Opechancanough told the [[Patawomeck]], who were not part of the Confederacy and had remained neutral, that he expected \"before the end of two Moones there should not be an Englishman in all their Countries.\"<ref>Helen Rountree, ''Pocahontas's People'' p. 75, citing John Smith's 1624 ''Generall Historie''.</ref> He misunderstood the English colonists and their backers overseas.\n\nThe surviving English settlers were in shock after the attacks. As they began to recover, the men worked on a plan of action. \"By unanimous decision both the council and planters it was agreed to draw people together into fewer settlements\" for better defense.<ref>\"\"to quitt many of our Plantacons and to vnite more neerely together in fewer places the better for to Strengthen and Defende ourselve.\", Gov. Francis Wyatt, quoted in [http://www.apva.org/resource/other/sandys.pdf Seth Mallios, \"At the Edge of the Precipice: Frontier Ventures, Jamestown\u2019s Hinterland, and the Archaeology of 44JC802\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724094320/http://www.apva.org/resource/other/sandys.pdf |date=July 24, 2008 }}, ''APVA Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities'', July 2000</ref>  The colony intended to gather men together to plan attack, but this was difficult because of the survivors, \"two-thirds were said to have been women and children and men who were unable to work or to go against the Indians\".<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4246389 William S. Powell, \"Aftermath of the Massacre]: The First Indian War, 1622\u20131632\", ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'', Vol. 66, no. 1 (Jan., 1958), pp. 44\u201375</ref>\n\nIn England \nwhen the massacre occurred, John Smith believed that the settlers would not leave their plantations to defend the colony.  He planned to return with a ship filled with soldiers, sailors, and ammunition, to establish a \"running Army\" able to fight the Powhatan. Smith's goal was to \"inforce the Savages to leave their Country, or bring them in the feare of subjection that every man should follow their business securely\",<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\" /> but Smith never returned to Virginia.\n\nThe English took revenge against the Powhatan by \"the use of force, surprise attacks, famine resulting from the burning of their corn, destroying their boats, canoes, and houses, breaking their fishing weirs and assaulting them in their hunting expedition, pursuing them with horses and using bloodhounds to find them and mastiffs to seaze them, driving them to flee within reach of their enemies among other tribes, and 'assimilating and abetting their enemies against them\".<ref name = \"Powell 1958 44-75\" />\n\nThe 1622 massacre was used as a justification for ongoing seizure of Powhatan land by the colonists for the next ten years. Historian Betty Wood writes:\n\n<blockquote>What is usually referred to as the \"Massacre of 1622,\" the native American attack that resulted in the death of 347 English settlers and almost wiped out Jamestown, gave the colonists the excuse they needed to take even more of what they wanted from the indigenous population of the Chesapeake. As far as the survivors of the Massacre of 1622 were concerned, by virtue of launching this unprovoked assault native Americans had forfeited any legal and moral rights they might previously have claimed to the ownership of the lands they occupied.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 72.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWood quotes a Virginian settler:\n\n<blockquote>We, who hitherto have had possession of no more ground than their waste and our purchase at a valuable consideration to their own contentment. . . may now by right of war, and law of nations, invade the country, and those who sought to destroy us: whereby we shall enjoy their cultivated places.<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 73.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Indian decline and defeat==\nIn 1624 Virginia was made a [[crown colony|royal colony]] of [[England]] by King James I. This meant that the Crown took direct authority rather than allowing guidance by the [[London Company]]. The Crown could exercise its patronage for royal favorites. Settlers continued to encroach on land of the Powhatan tribes, and the colony (and England) tended to change or ignore agreements with the natives when no longer in the colony's interest.  The tribes felt increasing frustration with the settlers.\n\nThe next major confrontation with the Powhatan, the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars#Third Anglo-Powhatan War|Third Anglo-Powhatan War]], occurred in 1644, resulting in the deaths of about 500 colonists.  While similar to the death toll in 1622, the loss a generation later represented less than ten percent of the population, and had far less impact upon the colony. This time, the elder Opechancanough, who was being transported by litter, was captured by the colonists. Imprisoned at Jamestown, he was killed by one of his guards.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Spencer C. Tucker|author2=James R.

Its member tribes eventually left the area entirely, gradually lived among the colonists, or lived on one of the few reservations established in Virginia. Most of these were also subject to incursion and seizure of land by the ever-expanding European population.\n\nIn modern times, seven tribes of the original Powhatan Confederacy are recognized in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  The [[Pamunkey]] and [[Mattaponi]] still have control of their reservations established in the 17th century, each located between the rivers of the same names within the boundaries of present-day [[King William County, Virginia|King William County]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of events named massacres]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last=Fausz |first=J.
