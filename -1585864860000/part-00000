Spanning approximately {{convert|21|mi|km}} along a south\u2013north axis, it is a continuation of [[Rhode Island Route 146|Route 146]] in [[Rhode Island]], which splits from [[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|I-95]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. The southern terminus within Massachusetts exists in [[Millville, Massachusetts|Millville]], where the expressway enters the state from [[North Smithfield, Rhode Island]]. Among several local roads, Route 146 intersects with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] (I-90) in [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] and [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] before arriving at its northern terminus at the intersection of several surface streets in downtown Worcester.  Most of the route is a [[freeway]], except for a short section near the boundary between Millbury and Sutton where there is driveway access and at-grade crossings.\n\n==History==\nDuring the late 1940s, the then-Massachusetts Department of Public Works (MassDPW, now the [[Massachusetts Highway Department]]) planned an extension of Route 146 from Rhode Island north toward Worcester. MA 146 was built between 1949 and 1952 as a four-lane divided roadway from US 20 in [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] to Boston Road in [[Sutton, Massachusetts|Sutton]], and from Sutton south to the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border, Route 146 was built as a three-lane undivided roadway, providing one lane in each direction and a shared lane in the center.\n\nIn 1981, the MassDPW began work on rebuilding Route 146. During the next three years, the state rebuilt the {{convert|13.1|mile|km|adj=mid|-long}} section from just south of Boston Road in Sutton to the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border, replacing the three-lane undivided section with a four-lane freeway and eliminating all at-grade intersections and curb cuts.\n\nThe project upgrading the section linking Exit 10A on the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] north into downtown Worcester at Brosnihan Square to [[Interstate Highway standards]] was completed in November 2007 according to the State Highway Administration.{{clarify |date=April 2020 |reason=No agency of this name in Massachusetts}} The improvements to the road created an economic boon to the [[Blackstone Valley]] through which it passes.

Alvarado was part of the [[Alvarado wrestling family]], which includes his father [[Shadito Cruz]], five brothers who used the \"Brazo\" name at some point and several third generation wrestlers.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\nAlvarado made his debut as \"El Brazo\", an [[Wrestling mask|Enmascarado]] (masked wrestler) who worked mainly in [[Tag team]] action with his brothers who worked as [[Brazo de Oro (wrestler)|Brazo de Oro]] (\"Gold arm\") and [[Brazo de Plata]] (\"Silver Arm\").<ref name=\"BrazoFamily\">{{cite book|title= Lucha Libre> Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling | publisher= Distributed Art Publishers, Inc. | year= 2005 | chapter = Los Brazos Familia Ejemplar / the Brazos a model Family | pages = 184\u2013190 | isbn=968-6842-48-9}}</ref> Los Brazos, as they were billed, wrestled all over Mexico and made appearances for the [[Los Angeles]] based \"NWA Hollywood Wrestling\". Over the years Brazo de Plata and his brothers competed in a large number of [[Lucha Libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de Apuestas]] (\"Bet fights\") where they put their masks or hair on the line against their opponents. Los Brazos' most famous Luchas de Apuestas occurred on October 21, 1988 when Brazo de Plata, Brazo de Oro and El Brazo all placed their masks on the line in a match against another well known Lucha libre family, Los Villanos, in this case [[Villano I]], [[Villano IV]] and [[Villano V]]. The match was the culmination of a long feud (Storyline) between the two families and saw all six wrestlers bleed profusely during the bout. In the end Los Villanos won the match forcing all three Brazos to unmask and reveal their real names as its tradition in these types of matches.<ref name=\"BrazoFamily\"/> Despite losing their masks Los Brazos remained successful in the ring winning various tag team and trios titles such as the [[UWA World Tag Team Championship]],<ref name=\"BookUWATag\">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter= MEXICO/JAPAN: UWA World Tag Team Title | page= 399 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> [[UWA World Trios Championship]],<ref name=\"BookUWATrios\">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter= MEXICO: UWA Trios Title | page= 399 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> [[WWA World Tag Team Championship]]<ref name=\"BookWWATag\">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter= MEXICO: WWA Tag Team Title | page= 401 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> and the [[WWA World Trios Championship]]<ref name=PlataProfile/><ref name=\"BookWWATrios\">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter= MEXICO: WWA Trios Title | page= 401 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> By the 1990s Los Brazos worked mainly for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) where Brazo de Plata, Brazo de Oro and El Brazo won the [[CMLL World Trios Championship]] from [[Los Infernales]] ([[Pirata Morgan]], [[Sat\u00e1nico]] and [[MS-1 (wrestler)|MS-1]]) on April 6, 1993.

El Brazo began working under various ring names such as ''Tio Lucas'', ''Latin Boiler'', ''Ingordable'' and ''La Puerca'', but his expanding waist line made it hard to hide who was actually behind the various gimmicks. In 2008 El Brazo signed with [[Asistencia, Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] (AAA) and quickly inserted himself in his brother Brazo de Plata's storyline with a group known as ''Los Guapos VIP''. Initially it looked like El Brazo was siding with his brother, only to turn on him and join Los Guapos VIP, taking the (storyline) control of the Los Guapos VIP group. The storyline fight of the two brothers came to a crescendo at [[Guerra de Titanes#Guerrera de Titanes 2008|Guerrera de Titanes 2008]], where they faced off in a steel cage match where the loser would have his hair shaved off.

This was a basic settlement built around a stone church. The old-town part of the settlement survives today, housed in a former central watermill. Many mills were constructed next to the streams which led to much industry being developed in the village. The Kleins constructed the Upper Mill in the T\u00f6r\u0151fej Valley in 1840. In 1917, a connecting small power plant was built which provided electricity for the inhabitants.

This was a basic settlement built around a stone church. The old-town part of the settlement survives today, housed in a former central watermill. Many mills were constructed next to the streams which led to much industry being developed in the village. The Kleins constructed the Upper Mill in the T\u00f6r\u0151fej Valley in 1840. In 1917, a connecting small power plant was built which provided electricity for the inhabitants.

The department is dumbfounded by the disappearance until they receive a ransom call from an unnamed source. The kidnappers request that a single officer appear at Kowloon market. Lee, the chief of police, believes this is a trap and plans to send in a squad. One officer, Jerry Ying, disqualifies himself from this role, claiming that an appearance as an officer will blow the cover he's used to infiltrate a Triad group called Dragon Claw. Instead, Inspector [[Tequila Yuen]] decides to go to Kowloon alone, despite Lee's order for him to bring a team. Once in the market, Tequila is attacked by a number of triads, proving Lee's hunch correct. After dispatching the attackers, he discovers the missing officer's badge, only to find a bullethole through the center and a photograph of the dead officer. While engaging in a standoff with the triads, Tequila receives a tip that the officer was assassinated by a group called the Imperial 9s, located in Tai O.\nWhile in Kowloon, Tequila stops in at a teahouse owned by the triad group Golden Kane, where he orders his usual tequila. At one of the teahouse's tables, the Imperial 9s are making a deal with Golden Kane regarding forged passports. Upon the Golden Kane representative's revelation that the man sitting at the bar is a cop, the I9 representative panics and shoots the Golden Kane representative. Shortly afterwards, the I9 is dispatched by Tequila. Enraged that the cop had broken up the deal, the Golden Kane bouncer Kwong Fang attacks Tequila, only to be gunned down. After emerging from the teahouse, Tequila informs his superior that he's going to go to Tai O to investigate further. He also mentions that during the deal he overheard that the Imperial 9s are working under Dragon Claw.\n\nUpon arrival in Tai O, Tequila asks a local fisherman if he knows anything of the triads' activity. The fisherman responds that Tai O is under I9 control, but that Golden Kane is trying to capture it. He also says that the Dragon Claw leader, Jimmy Wong, is currently residing on a boat in Tai O. Tequila tracks down Wong and is introduced to his two top men, Dapang and Jerry, the undercover officer who Tequila had personally trained and worked with in the past. Wong reveals that the Golden Kane assassinated the officer and pinned it on his I9s. Tequila, knowing Dragon Claw to be one of the oldest and largest triad groups, asks why Wong hasn't struck back. Wong's reasoning is that Golden Kane has allied with a Russian mob group based in Chicago, the Zakarovs, who have kidnapped his daughter Billie and granddaughter Teko. The Zakarovs plan to hold them for ransom for a slice of Dragon Claw's territory in Hong Kong. Since Wong can't directly move against the Zakarovs, he asks Tequila to go retrieve his family. He needs a man who isn't affiliated with Dragon Claw but cares enough about Billie and Teko to risk his life for them, and who else but Tequila, the husband of Billie and father of Teko. His hands tied, Tequila agrees to go find them. Immediately after the deal is settled, Golden Kane strikes against Dragon Claw's base in Tai O, and Wong charges Tequila with blowing the place to pieces so he can escape. Since this is in police interest anyway, Tequila agrees, planting C4 charges on his way out of Tai O.\n\nTequila makes a stop at the Golden Kane-owned restaurant Mega, where their leader Yung Gi is holding an internet conference with Damon and Vladimir Zakarov. Seeing that the Zakarovs are recognized as philanthropists while still maintaining high standing in the criminal underworld, the relatively young and inexperienced Yung plans to head to Chicago himself in order to see how Zakarov's organization is run. He also mentions retrieving Billie and Teko, as Golden Kane is to be the middleman between the Zakarovs and Dragon Claw in their exchange. During the conference, Yung's right-hand man Ty Lok receives a call that they've got unexpected company, and offers to stay and deal with him while Yung escapes. Exasperated that Tequila is still alive after all of Golden Kane's attempts to eliminate him, Yung agrees and exits. Shortly afterward, Tequila arrives in the conference room and is attacked by the muscular Lok, who wields an oversized gun and a belt full of grenades. Despite Lok's superior constitution, Tequila emerges victorious.\n\nIn the Zakarovs' penthouse in Chicago, Yung receives word of Lok's death and the destruction of the Mega restaurant. Enraged, he tells the messenger to do him a favor and kill himself. Following the phone call, Yung is approached by Damon Zakarov, who offers to show him his history museum. Uninterested, Yung agrees to go along with it since it is a part of the Zakarovs' operation. As Damon and Yung leave, Vladimir Zakarov glances at a nearby surveillance screen and notes that two men have arrived in the penthouse's parking garage.\n\nAs Tequila and Jerry pull into the parking garage, Jerry pulls out his phone and texts Wong with the current information, telling Tequila he needs to keep Wong thinking he's working for him. The two split up, with Tequila covering the lower floor of the penthouse and Jerry covering the upper floor. This plan goes awry, however, when the voice of Vladimir Zakarov booms through the penthouse's PA claiming to have dealt with Tequila's friend. Tequila fights his way to the top floor, eventually coming face to face with Vlad and a gauntlet of trip mines. Vlad makes his way to a helipad, where a chopper picks him up. As Tequila makes his way to the Zakarov's glass-windowed office, Vlad opens fire with a rocket launcher from the chopper, hovering just outside. Tequila shoots Vlad, causing him to fire a rocket into his own chopper and blow himself out of the sky. On his way out of the penthouse Tequila discovers a wounded Jerry and helps him out.\n\nTequila buys a ticket to the Zakarovs' museum, and enters to find Damon and Yung negotiating the exchange of Billie and Teko. Damon changes the plans at the last minute, letting Yung take Teko back to Hong Kong but saying he'll bring Billie himself. After a standoff between the Zakarov organization and Golden Kane, Yung agrees and leaves with Teko. Damon retreats into the museum, holding Billie hostage, and Tequila gives pursuit. He eventually catches up and shoots Damon dead in the fossil section of the museum. He tearfully reunites with his wife once more, and tells her he was sent by her father to retrieve her. The reunion is cut short, however, when Jerry bursts into the fossil room and opens fire with two pistols. Tequila pushes Billie behind him to shield her and fires back, but moves to dodge a bullet which catches Billie in the chest. Firing wildly, Tequila manages to nick his former friend and partner in the shoulder, causing him to retreat. Turning to his mortally wounded wife, he holds her as she tells him that the Golden Kane have taken Teko to Hong Kong and asks him to forgive her. With that, Billie expires and an enraged Tequila dashes through the halls of the museum in pursuit of Jerry. When he catches up, Jerry is standing on a catwalk above an exhibit and firing at him with dual submachine guns. A breathless Tequila demands to know who paid him off to kill Billie, and Jerry responds that it was Wong, the same man who sent Tequila to find her. With that, Jerry takes off running again, and Tequila follows him to a dead end. The two duel each other with very similar moves, with Jerry diving around the room in much the same manner as Tequila. This doesn't prevent the inspector from gunning down his old friend. As he picks up his fallen partner's phone, Tequila finds Damon's ransom message, which reveals a part of the message that Wong didn't show in the first place: Damon has the names of people tied to Dragon Claw. If Wong doesn't agree to his demands, Billie will expose them in court to prevent the Zakarovs from executing Teko, resulting in Wong getting convicted. Now knowing Wong's motives for killing his own daughter, Tequila texts Wong with a message claiming to have shot Tequila in the head. With that, Tequila tosses the assassinated officer's badge onto his former partner's body.\n\nTequila finds Yung in his office and immediately sits down to strike a bargain with him. He wants his daughter back, but Yung refuses. With the Russians out of the way, he can now trade Teko to Wong for territory in Hong Kong. Tequila tells him he's a fool and shows him a text exchange between Wong and Jerry, where the two mock how stupid the Golden Kanes are and talk about holding a \"GK funeral\". Tequila further confirms the Dragon Claws' plan by asking Yung if Wong set the time and place for the exchange, to which Yung replies affirmatively. Tequila tells him to change it, and offers to interfere on Golden Kane's behalf. This way, he gets his daughter and his revenge, and Golden Kane can pick up the pieces of what Dragon Claw leaves behind. Everybody wins. Yung agrees to this and calls Wong to change the location of the meeting to his old neighborhood in Kowloon.\n\nIn the slums of Kowloon, the exchange goes down seemingly as planned. The only difference; Tequila isn't on time. Yung is forced to improvise, and is unable to stall Dragon Claw until Tequila arrives. As his men bring Teko out of a nearby temple, Tequila bursts from an alleyway and shouts at him for being unable to hold them off. Wong is startled to see him alive after the text he received from Jerry, but nonetheless maintains his composure. He escapes with Teko while Yung, Tequila, and Dapang are locked in a standoff, and as Tequila breaks the standoff by chasing him Dapang guns Yung down and escapes.\n\nTequila hijacks a nearby car and chases Wong to his estate, but is forced to deal with Wong's impressive security. Wong's men wield a variety of weapons ranging from rocket launchers to throwing knives to helicopter gunships. After Tequila shoots down a helicopter, it crashes through the locked front door of Wong's main stronghold. Tequila enters Wong's inner sanctum to find the old man and Dapang have taken Teko hostage. After a very tense standoff, Tequila relents and tells Wong to let his daughter go. But when Dapang takes the tape off Teko's mouth, she warns her father that it's a trap, and as she runs to safety, she takes a bullet in the arm. With newfound fury, Tequila guns down Wong's men and then goes after Wong and Dapang. Tequila takes down Dapang, but Wong pins him down with a high-powered sniper rifle. As Wong lines up what is sure to be a fatal shot on Tequila, Teko moves behind him and shoves him over the balcony. As the father and daughter reunite, Chief Lee arrives on the scene and returns Tequila's badge, which he had earlier confiscated for insubordination. Tequila and Teko leave the scene, leaving Chief Lee to gripe about how long the paperwork will take.\n\n==Influences==\n''Stranglehold'' attempts to translate the gun ballet aesthetic popularized by director [[John Woo]], used in films such as ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' and ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'', to an [[interactive media]] format. Although the game has drawn comparisons to [[Remedy Entertainment]]'s ''[[Max Payne]]'' franchise, which was influenced by Woo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/360/stranglehold.phtml|title=Stranglehold Review|last=Jojic|first=Uros|date=2007-09-05|work=Actiontrip.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011193815/http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/360/stranglehold.phtml|archive-date=2007-10-11|accessdate=2019-10-08}}</ref> a more accurate account of both games' creative provenances traces the games to Woo's lengthy, balletic shootouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/previews/stranglehold.phtml|title=Stranglehold First Look|last=|first=|date=|work=Actiontrip.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630161240/http://www.actiontrip.com/previews/stranglehold.phtml|archive-date=2007-06-30|accessdate=2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nDuring play, jumping in any direction or interacting with any object while aiming at an opponent (or pressing a certain button) will slow time, creating a short window during which Tequila can shoot at targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1375/Stranglehold/p1/|title=Stranglehold Review (Xbox 360)|last=|first=|date=|work=[[TeamXbox]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906093836/http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1375/Stranglehold/p1/|archive-date=2007-09-06|access-date=2007-09-07|df=}}</ref> This technique\u2014called Tequila Time\u2014generates a cinematic effect that mimics Woo's. Tequila Time is managed through a meter which drains with use and regenerates with time. Tequila can also make use of his environment, moving up and down railings, swinging from chandeliers and sliding across tabletops and riding on carts while shooting at enemies.\n\nAnother form of gameplay comes from the style and grace associated with Woo's balletic firefights. By taking out enemies, the player earns stars. The more stylish the kills performed, the more stars received. Taking out enemies in quick succession, or interacting with the environment when taking down opponents, will earn the player the optimum number of stars. As an incentive to interact with the environment, Tequila receives a bonus to his attack power and defense during interactions.\n\nTequila also employs several iconic techniques from Woo's movies, referred to as Tequila Bombs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranglehold-qanda-lighting-the-fuse-on-the-tequila-bomb/1100-6164457/|title=Stranglehold Q&A: Lighting the Fuse on the Tequila Bomb|last=|first=|date=2007-02-20|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> Tequila Bombs require energy to perform. The player gains energy by defeating enemies (equal to the Stars obtained) and by collecting paper cranes hidden about each level.\n\n==Development==\n''Stranglehold'' was developed by [[Midway Games]] and Tiger Hill Entertainment. Following the release of 2004's ''[[Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy]]'', Midway was looking to make a new game based on an existing brand license. Due to a Midway employee's connections, the company was able to get in touch with John Woo about a possible video game collaboration.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/10/04/woo-hoo-the-making-of-stranglehold|title=Woo-Hoo!

The department is dumbfounded by the disappearance until they receive a ransom call from an unnamed source. The kidnappers request that a single officer appear at Kowloon market. Lee, the chief of police, believes this is a trap and plans to send in a squad. One officer, Jerry Ying, disqualifies himself from this role, claiming that an appearance as an officer will blow the cover he's used to infiltrate a Triad group called Dragon Claw. Instead, Inspector [[Tequila Yuen]] decides to go to Kowloon alone, despite Lee's order for him to bring a team. Once in the market, Tequila is attacked by a number of triads, proving Lee's hunch correct. After dispatching the attackers, he discovers the missing officer's badge, only to find a bullethole through the center and a photograph of the dead officer. While engaging in a standoff with the triads, Tequila receives a tip that the officer was assassinated by a group called the Imperial 9s, located in Tai O.\nWhile in Kowloon, Tequila stops in at a teahouse owned by the triad group Golden Kane, where he orders his usual tequila. At one of the teahouse's tables, the Imperial 9s are making a deal with Golden Kane regarding forged passports. Upon the Golden Kane representative's revelation that the man sitting at the bar is a cop, the I9 representative panics and shoots the Golden Kane representative. Shortly afterwards, the I9 is dispatched by Tequila. Enraged that the cop had broken up the deal, the Golden Kane bouncer Kwong Fang attacks Tequila, only to be gunned down. After emerging from the teahouse, Tequila informs his superior that he's going to go to Tai O to investigate further. He also mentions that during the deal he overheard that the Imperial 9s are working under Dragon Claw.\n\nUpon arrival in Tai O, Tequila asks a local fisherman if he knows anything of the triads' activity. The fisherman responds that Tai O is under I9 control, but that Golden Kane is trying to capture it. He also says that the Dragon Claw leader, Jimmy Wong, is currently residing on a boat in Tai O. Tequila tracks down Wong and is introduced to his two top men, Dapang and Jerry, the undercover officer who Tequila had personally trained and worked with in the past. Wong reveals that the Golden Kane assassinated the officer and pinned it on his I9s. Tequila, knowing Dragon Claw to be one of the oldest and largest triad groups, asks why Wong hasn't struck back. Wong's reasoning is that Golden Kane has allied with a Russian mob group based in Chicago, the Zakarovs, who have kidnapped his daughter Billie and granddaughter Teko. The Zakarovs plan to hold them for ransom for a slice of Dragon Claw's territory in Hong Kong. Since Wong can't directly move against the Zakarovs, he asks Tequila to go retrieve his family. He needs a man who isn't affiliated with Dragon Claw but cares enough about Billie and Teko to risk his life for them, and who else but Tequila, the husband of Billie and father of Teko. His hands tied, Tequila agrees to go find them. Immediately after the deal is settled, Golden Kane strikes against Dragon Claw's base in Tai O, and Wong charges Tequila with blowing the place to pieces so he can escape. Since this is in police interest anyway, Tequila agrees, planting C4 charges on his way out of Tai O.\n\nTequila makes a stop at the Golden Kane-owned restaurant Mega, where their leader Yung Gi is holding an internet conference with Damon and Vladimir Zakarov. Seeing that the Zakarovs are recognized as philanthropists while still maintaining high standing in the criminal underworld, the relatively young and inexperienced Yung plans to head to Chicago himself in order to see how Zakarov's organization is run. He also mentions retrieving Billie and Teko, as Golden Kane is to be the middleman between the Zakarovs and Dragon Claw in their exchange. During the conference, Yung's right-hand man Ty Lok receives a call that they've got unexpected company, and offers to stay and deal with him while Yung escapes. Exasperated that Tequila is still alive after all of Golden Kane's attempts to eliminate him, Yung agrees and exits. Shortly afterward, Tequila arrives in the conference room and is attacked by the muscular Lok, who wields an oversized gun and a belt full of grenades. Despite Lok's superior constitution, Tequila emerges victorious.\n\nIn the Zakarovs' penthouse in Chicago, Yung receives word of Lok's death and the destruction of the Mega restaurant. Enraged, he tells the messenger to do him a favor and kill himself. Following the phone call, Yung is approached by Damon Zakarov, who offers to show him his history museum. Uninterested, Yung agrees to go along with it since it is a part of the Zakarovs' operation. As Damon and Yung leave, Vladimir Zakarov glances at a nearby surveillance screen and notes that two men have arrived in the penthouse's parking garage.\n\nAs Tequila and Jerry pull into the parking garage, Jerry pulls out his phone and texts Wong with the current information, telling Tequila he needs to keep Wong thinking he's working for him. The two split up, with Tequila covering the lower floor of the penthouse and Jerry covering the upper floor. This plan goes awry, however, when the voice of Vladimir Zakarov booms through the penthouse's PA claiming to have dealt with Tequila's friend. Tequila fights his way to the top floor, eventually coming face to face with Vlad and a gauntlet of trip mines. Vlad makes his way to a helipad, where a chopper picks him up. As Tequila makes his way to the Zakarov's glass-windowed office, Vlad opens fire with a rocket launcher from the chopper, hovering just outside. Tequila shoots Vlad, causing him to fire a rocket into his own chopper and blow himself out of the sky. On his way out of the penthouse Tequila discovers a wounded Jerry and helps him out.\n\nTequila buys a ticket to the Zakarovs' museum, and enters to find Damon and Yung negotiating the exchange of Billie and Teko. Damon changes the plans at the last minute, letting Yung take Teko back to Hong Kong but saying he'll bring Billie himself. After a standoff between the Zakarov organization and Golden Kane, Yung agrees and leaves with Teko. Damon retreats into the museum, holding Billie hostage, and Tequila gives pursuit. He eventually catches up and shoots Damon dead in the fossil section of the museum. He tearfully reunites with his wife once more, and tells her he was sent by her father to retrieve her. The reunion is cut short, however, when Jerry bursts into the fossil room and opens fire with two pistols. Tequila pushes Billie behind him to shield her and fires back, but moves to dodge a bullet which catches Billie in the chest. Firing wildly, Tequila manages to nick his former friend and partner in the shoulder, causing him to retreat. Turning to his mortally wounded wife, he holds her as she tells him that the Golden Kane have taken Teko to Hong Kong and asks him to forgive her. With that, Billie expires and an enraged Tequila dashes through the halls of the museum in pursuit of Jerry. When he catches up, Jerry is standing on a catwalk above an exhibit and firing at him with dual submachine guns. A breathless Tequila demands to know who paid him off to kill Billie, and Jerry responds that it was Wong, the same man who sent Tequila to find her. With that, Jerry takes off running again, and Tequila follows him to a dead end. The two duel each other with very similar moves, with Jerry diving around the room in much the same manner as Tequila. This doesn't prevent the inspector from gunning down his old friend. As he picks up his fallen partner's phone, Tequila finds Damon's ransom message, which reveals a part of the message that Wong didn't show in the first place: Damon has the names of people tied to Dragon Claw. If Wong doesn't agree to his demands, Billie will expose them in court to prevent the Zakarovs from executing Teko, resulting in Wong getting convicted. Now knowing Wong's motives for killing his own daughter, Tequila texts Wong with a message claiming to have shot Tequila in the head. With that, Tequila tosses the assassinated officer's badge onto his former partner's body.\n\nTequila finds Yung in his office and immediately sits down to strike a bargain with him. He wants his daughter back, but Yung refuses. With the Russians out of the way, he can now trade Teko to Wong for territory in Hong Kong. Tequila tells him he's a fool and shows him a text exchange between Wong and Jerry, where the two mock how stupid the Golden Kanes are and talk about holding a \"GK funeral\". Tequila further confirms the Dragon Claws' plan by asking Yung if Wong set the time and place for the exchange, to which Yung replies affirmatively. Tequila tells him to change it, and offers to interfere on Golden Kane's behalf. This way, he gets his daughter and his revenge, and Golden Kane can pick up the pieces of what Dragon Claw leaves behind. Everybody wins. Yung agrees to this and calls Wong to change the location of the meeting to his old neighborhood in Kowloon.\n\nIn the slums of Kowloon, the exchange goes down seemingly as planned. The only difference; Tequila isn't on time. Yung is forced to improvise, and is unable to stall Dragon Claw until Tequila arrives. As his men bring Teko out of a nearby temple, Tequila bursts from an alleyway and shouts at him for being unable to hold them off. Wong is startled to see him alive after the text he received from Jerry, but nonetheless maintains his composure. He escapes with Teko while Yung, Tequila, and Dapang are locked in a standoff, and as Tequila breaks the standoff by chasing him Dapang guns Yung down and escapes.\n\nTequila hijacks a nearby car and chases Wong to his estate, but is forced to deal with Wong's impressive security. Wong's men wield a variety of weapons ranging from rocket launchers to throwing knives to helicopter gunships. After Tequila shoots down a helicopter, it crashes through the locked front door of Wong's main stronghold. Tequila enters Wong's inner sanctum to find the old man and Dapang have taken Teko hostage. After a very tense standoff, Tequila relents and tells Wong to let his daughter go. But when Dapang takes the tape off Teko's mouth, she warns her father that it's a trap, and as she runs to safety, she takes a bullet in the arm. With newfound fury, Tequila guns down Wong's men and then goes after Wong and Dapang. Tequila takes down Dapang, but Wong pins him down with a high-powered sniper rifle. As Wong lines up what is sure to be a fatal shot on Tequila, Teko moves behind him and shoves him over the balcony. As the father and daughter reunite, Chief Lee arrives on the scene and returns Tequila's badge, which he had earlier confiscated for insubordination. Tequila and Teko leave the scene, leaving Chief Lee to gripe about how long the paperwork will take.\n\n==Influences==\n''Stranglehold'' attempts to translate the gun ballet aesthetic popularized by director [[John Woo]], used in films such as ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' and ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'', to an [[interactive media]] format. Although the game has drawn comparisons to [[Remedy Entertainment]]'s ''[[Max Payne]]'' franchise, which was influenced by Woo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/360/stranglehold.phtml|title=Stranglehold Review|last=Jojic|first=Uros|date=2007-09-05|work=Actiontrip.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011193815/http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/360/stranglehold.phtml|archive-date=2007-10-11|accessdate=2019-10-08}}</ref> a more accurate account of both games' creative provenances traces the games to Woo's lengthy, balletic shootouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/previews/stranglehold.phtml|title=Stranglehold First Look|last=|first=|date=|work=Actiontrip.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630161240/http://www.actiontrip.com/previews/stranglehold.phtml|archive-date=2007-06-30|accessdate=2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nDuring play, jumping in any direction or interacting with any object while aiming at an opponent (or pressing a certain button) will slow time, creating a short window during which Tequila can shoot at targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1375/Stranglehold/p1/|title=Stranglehold Review (Xbox 360)|last=|first=|date=|work=[[TeamXbox]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906093836/http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1375/Stranglehold/p1/|archive-date=2007-09-06|access-date=2007-09-07|df=}}</ref> This technique\u2014called Tequila Time\u2014generates a cinematic effect that mimics Woo's. Tequila Time is managed through a meter which drains with use and regenerates with time. Tequila can also make use of his environment, moving up and down railings, swinging from chandeliers and sliding across tabletops and riding on carts while shooting at enemies.\n\nAnother form of gameplay comes from the style and grace associated with Woo's balletic firefights. By taking out enemies, the player earns stars. The more stylish the kills performed, the more stars received. Taking out enemies in quick succession, or interacting with the environment when taking down opponents, will earn the player the optimum number of stars. As an incentive to interact with the environment, Tequila receives a bonus to his attack power and defense during interactions.\n\nTequila also employs several iconic techniques from Woo's movies, referred to as Tequila Bombs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranglehold-qanda-lighting-the-fuse-on-the-tequila-bomb/1100-6164457/|title=Stranglehold Q&A: Lighting the Fuse on the Tequila Bomb|last=|first=|date=2007-02-20|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> Tequila Bombs require energy to perform. The player gains energy by defeating enemies (equal to the Stars obtained) and by collecting paper cranes hidden about each level.\n\n==Development==\n''Stranglehold'' was developed by [[Midway Games]] and Tiger Hill Entertainment. Following the release of 2004's ''[[Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy]]'', Midway was looking to make a new game based on an existing brand license.

The developer was granted an additional two weeks of development before manufacturing for [[Patch (computing)|bug fixes]].<ref name=\"Kotaku Crunch\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n''The Last of Us Part II'' was originally scheduled to be released on February 21, 2020, but was delayed to May 29, 2020, in October 2019.<ref name=\"GamesRadar State of Play\" /><ref name=\"Game Delayed to May\" /><ref name=\"Delay Indef 2\" /> It was then delayed indefinitely on April 2, 2020, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delay Indef 2\" /><ref name=\"Delay Indef 1\" /><ref name=\"Delay Indef 3\" /> Naughty Dog said development was nearly finished, however they could not release it due to logistical issues.<ref name=\"Delay Indef 2\" /><ref name=\"Delay Indef 1\" /><ref name=\"Delay Indef 3\" />\n\nThe game will release in four editions: standard, special, collector's, and an Ellie edition.

[the idea] was for the player to feel repulsed by some of the violence they are committing themselves.\"<ref name=\"Kotaku Violence\"/>\n\nThe cutscene featured in the 2018 E3 presentation in which Ellie kisses another woman, Dina ([[Shannon Woodward]]), was praised for making a kiss\u2014frequently considered to be difficult to [[Computer animation|animate]]\u2014passionate and believable.<ref

It [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s [[U.S. Route 71 in Missouri|U.S. Route 71]] (US&nbsp;71) in the western part of the state, beginning at [[Pineville, Missouri|Pineville]], just a few miles north of the [[Arkansas]] state line, and ending at [[Interstate 435|I-435]] and [[Interstate 470 (Missouri)|I-470]] on the southeast side of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].\n\nI-49 is planned to extend south into Arkansas upon completion of a bypass of [[Bella Vista, Arkansas]], connecting to the new northern Arkansas segment of I-49 (formerly part of [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)|I-540]] to [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]]). Upon completion, the highway will connect with [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49 in Louisiana]], connecting Kansas City to [[Texarkana]], [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], and [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].\n\n==Route description==\nI-49 begins in [[Pineville, Missouri|Pineville]]. It passes through many smaller communities before reaching [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]]. In Joplin, I-49 junctions with [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|I-44]] and begins a short overlap with I-44 for exits 11 through 18.\n\nJust a few miles east of Joplin, I-49 leaves I-44 and heads north and enters [[Carthage, Missouri|Carthage]]. I-49 then passes through [[Nevada, Missouri|Nevada]] and other communities before reaching the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] area. I-49 intersects with I-470 and I-435 which provides connection to [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I-70]] and [[Interstate 35 in Missouri|I-35]] and [[Interstate 29 in Missouri|I-29]].\n\nIn south Kansas City, at Bannister Road just north of the Grandview Triangle, the I-49 designation ends, and the expressway continues as US&nbsp;71, which proceeds into downtown Kansas City as Bruce R. Watkins Memorial Drive.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Northern end of the future Bella Vista Bypass.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Current southern terminus of I-49. The closed ramp will serve as the northern end of the Bella Vista Bypass upon completion.]]\nArkansas and Missouri pursued an I-49 designation for US&nbsp;71 and [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)|I-540]] for a number of years. In the early 2000s, there were plans by both states to rename the roadway as such between I-44 west of Joplin and I-40 at Fort Smith once new roadway had been completed around [[Bella Vista, Arkansas]], and north to [[Pineville, Missouri]].<ref name=\"jopgl070511\">{{cite news |first=Wally |last=Kennedy |newspaper=[[The Joplin Globe]] |location=[[Joplin, MO]] |title=Plan holds 2008 finish for Range Line Bypass |url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/joplin_metro/x212062961/-img-src-http-www-joplinglobeonline-com-images-zope-extra-gif-border-0-Plan-holds-2008-finish-for-Range-Line-Bypass-font-color-ff0000-w-MSTIP-District-7-project-map-for-2008-2012-font |date=May 11, 2007 |accessdate=November 29, 2012}}</ref> However, the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering denied the I-49 designation at their annual meeting in September 2007 because none of the new roadway was under construction.<ref name=\"aash070929\">{{AASHTO minutes |year= 2007A |link= yes |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe I-49 upgrade involved removing all at-grade intersections and constructing interchanges and overpasses at 15 sites between Harrisonville and Lamar.

designated on December 12, 2012. It [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s [[U.S. Route 71 in Missouri|U.S. Route 71]] (US&nbsp;71) in the western part of the state, beginning at [[Pineville, Missouri|Pineville]], just a few miles north of the [[Arkansas]] state line, and ending at [[Interstate 435|I-435]] and [[Interstate 470 (Missouri)|I-470]] on the southeast side of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].\n\nI-49 is planned to extend south into Arkansas upon completion of a bypass of [[Bella Vista, Arkansas]], connecting to the new northern Arkansas segment of I-49 (formerly part of [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)|I-540]] to [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]]). Upon completion, the highway will connect with [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49 in Louisiana]], connecting Kansas City to [[Texarkana]], [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], and [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].\n\n==Route description==\nI-49 begins in [[Pineville, Missouri|Pineville]]. It passes through many smaller communities before reaching [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]]. In Joplin, I-49 junctions with [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|I-44]] and begins a short overlap with I-44 for exits 11 through 18.\n\nJust a few miles east of Joplin, I-49 leaves I-44 and heads north and enters [[Carthage, Missouri|Carthage]]. I-49 then passes through [[Nevada, Missouri|Nevada]] and other communities before reaching the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] area. I-49 intersects with I-470 and I-435 which provides connection to [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I-70]] and [[Interstate 35 in Missouri|I-35]] and [[Interstate 29 in Missouri|I-29]].\n\nIn south Kansas City, at Bannister Road just north of the Grandview Triangle, the I-49 designation ends, and the expressway continues as US&nbsp;71, which proceeds into downtown Kansas City as Bruce R. Watkins Memorial Drive.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Northern end of the future Bella Vista Bypass.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Current southern terminus of I-49. The closed ramp will serve as the northern end of the Bella Vista Bypass upon completion.]]\nArkansas and Missouri pursued an I-49 designation for US&nbsp;71 and [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)|I-540]] for a number of years. In the early 2000s, there were plans by both states to rename the roadway as such between I-44 west of Joplin and I-40 at Fort Smith once new roadway had been completed around [[Bella Vista, Arkansas]], and north to [[Pineville, Missouri]].<ref name=\"jopgl070511\">{{cite news |first=Wally |last=Kennedy |newspaper=[[The Joplin Globe]] |location=[[Joplin, MO]] |title=Plan holds 2008 finish for Range Line Bypass |url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/joplin_metro/x212062961/-img-src-http-www-joplinglobeonline-com-images-zope-extra-gif-border-0-Plan-holds-2008-finish-for-Range-Line-Bypass-font-color-ff0000-w-MSTIP-District-7-project-map-for-2008-2012-font |date=May 11, 2007 |accessdate=November 29, 2012}}</ref> However, the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering denied the I-49 designation at their annual meeting in September 2007 because none of the new roadway was under construction.<ref name=\"aash070929\">{{AASHTO minutes |year= 2007A |link= yes |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe I-49 upgrade involved removing all at-grade intersections and constructing interchanges and overpasses at 15 sites between Harrisonville and Lamar.
