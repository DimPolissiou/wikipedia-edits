Gradually, the Rajputs emerged as a powerful social class comprising people from a variety of ethnic and geographical backgrounds. The membership of this class became largely [[hereditary]], although new claims to Rajput status continued to be made in the later centuries. Several Rajput-ruled kingdoms played a significant role in many regions of central and northern India until the twentieth century.\n\nRajput are generally considered to be divided into three primary vansh.

It is believed that [[Parashurama]] slaughtered [[Kshatriyas]] (warriors) 21 times. The only escapees were those who disguised themselves, those who fled leaving behind their swords and those who fell at his feet. The absence of any warriors led to a dark age, where demons increased in number, [[Vedas]] came to be trampled under their feet, and [[Hinduism]] was forgotten. The sages then visited Parashurama's cave on [[Mount Abu]]. There, all the gods, men and n\u0101gas assembled and came up with a plan to destroy the demons. [[Vashistha]] erected a fire altar and worshiped [[Shiva]], who appeared before the sages. But the demons disrupted the ceremony by throwing impurities like blood, flesh and garbage on the altar. Twenty sages, including their leader Vashistha, then invoked [[Brahma]] and Shiva. They erected a new altar and conducted a fresh ceremony, singing [[hymns]] from the [[Sama Veda]]. To get rid of these demons, Vashistha performed a [[Homa (ritual)|homa ritual]]. This led to the appearance of a hero named [[Pratihara]] (\"door-keeper\"), who Vashistha placed on the road leading to the palace. After this, another hero named [[Solanki]] (Chalukka) appeared from the hollowed palm of Brahma. Finally, a third hero appeared, who sage named [[Parmar clan|Pavara]] (or Paramara, \"slayer of the enemy\"). However, these three heroes were not able to stop the demons. Vashistha then dug up a new fire pit, and made yet another offering to the fire, to conjure a new hero. This four-armed hero held a sword, a shield, a bow, and an arrow. Vashistha named him Chahavana or Chauhan, performed his coronation with Vedic hymns, and then ordered him to fight the demons. Parashurama and Shakti blessed the newly created heroes. The sage [[Bhrigu]] told him that he would be protected by the goddess [[Shakti |Shakti]] in his endeavours to kill the demons. This, four armed hero warriors defeated the demons. The goddess protected Chohan from all dangers: every time he fell at her feet, his strength doubled and he was able to slay the demons.

We were shocked when, at the age of 32, she was diagnosed with cancer. She endured nine operations, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\nSadly it wasn\u2019t enough. Last year the disease became rampant, and she died in March, aged just 41. My wife and I were, and still are, completely devastated.\n\nOur daughter didn\u2019t leave a will, and sorting her finances has proved very complicated. She didn\u2019t have a family, so all her assets are being inherited by me and my wife.\n\nEverything is in order now, apart from one of her pensions, which she paid into while working for PA WeatherCentre, which is now called MeteoGroup UK. As a result of the company changes, my daughter ended up with three separate pension funds. As the administrator of her estate, I claimed for the benefits of her pension funds to be paid.\n\nTwo of the pensions paid out immediately, but the third, which was the original Press Association Pension Fund, has not paid out. In June last year, I was advised the fund was worth \u00a328,665. It is administered by a company called Lane Clark and Peacock (LCP).\n\nIt said the payment is in the gift of a panel of trustees, but nine months after I contacted it, no money has been forthcoming. I have asked several times for a progress report, but each time all I get is a holding reply.

This issue continues to cause us considerable stress and anxiety, especially now, as the anniversary of our daughter\u2019s passing approaches.\n\nSV, Wiltshire\n\nDear SV\n\nNo parent should have to bear the pain of watching their child fade away like you did. You and your wife have been through so much these past few years, the last thing you needed was extra hassle sorting your daughter\u2019s pension after her death.\n\nI dearly wanted to take the stress of it off your hands to give you some respite. How disappointing it must be that after the many years of loyal service your daughter gave to this company, its pension scheme appeared to be indefinitely stalling paying out money she had rightfully accrued.\n\nWhen someone has died, pension funds are supposed to make it easier, not harder to access money. Yet LCP has been so bad, you are genuinely fearful that criminals may have got their hands on the funds. I asked it to urgently escalate a complaint on your behalf.\n\nPart of the reason this issue with the pension came as such a shock was that your daughter\u2019s employer had been so good to her while she was ill. She had needed a lot of time off for her various operations and treatments, and it had granted her all the time she needed. No fuss was made.\n\n\nYou mentioned she had been made redundant from the company in 2017, though, so I asked you about the circumstances of this. You said your daughter\u2019s employer was having to make a number of redundancies to cut costs, and to prevent someone else losing their job, your daughter volunteered.\n\nI pointed out what a selfless thing this was to have done. \u201cThat was her,\u201d you said knowingly. \u201cAlways thinking of others before herself.\u201d You said she took the payout and lived off it the rest of her days, until she sadly passed away last year.\n\nMeanwhile, LCP was dealing with the pension. It told me the board of trustees had a meeting scheduled, during which they were planning to discuss releasing the money. However, the date came and went, and it turned out they hadn\u2019t had time to discuss it. So they set up a separate call especially to discuss your daughter\u2019s pension.\n\nDays later you received a call with some welcome news. The pension was finally going to be paid. But that wasn\u2019t all. Instead of the \u00a328,000 you were expecting, the lump sum was a higher amount of \u00a350,000. You say the reason for the higher figure was not explained. But when you asked LCP what had prompted the payment, you were told there had been \u201ca call from a journalist\u201d.\n\nI was somewhat shocked by what happened next. I told LCP that you had passed on the good news, and asked it for an explanation of what had happened. It said it was not prepared to comment. No reason was given for the nine-month payment delay. No insight was offered into the larger-than-expected sum of money. Not even an apology for the dreadful way you were treated was forthcoming.\n\nSuch a shutters-up approach is highly unusual, and has heightened my curiosity over what happened here.\n\nHowever, the main thing is that the \u00a350,000 is now being paid. The final element of your daughter\u2019s estate is now sorted, allowing you to move on from the stress of it. While I was solving her case, the first anniversary of her death came and went.

Invited to important events and often interviewed by newspapers, she was admired by both blacks and whites. She primarily flew [[Curtiss JN-4]] \"Jenny\" [[biplanes]] and other aircraft which had been army surplus aircraft left over from the war. She made her first appearance in an American [[airshow]] on September 3, 1922, at an event honoring veterans of the all-black [[369th Infantry Regiment (United States)|369th Infantry Regiment]] of [[World War I]]. Held at [[Roosevelt Field, New York|Curtiss Field]] on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]] near New York City and sponsored by her friend Abbott and the ''Chicago Defender'' newspaper, the show billed Coleman as \"the world's greatest woman flier\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Toth |first=Maria Lynn |date=February 10, 2001 |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/kids/readingroom/la-et-story10-feb10-2006,0,7374705,full.story |title=Daredevil of the Sky: The Bessie Coleman Story |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105072047/http://www.latimes.com/features/kids/readingroom/la-et-story10-feb10-2006,0,7374705,full.story |archivedate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> and featured aerial displays by eight other American ace pilots, and a jump by black parachutist [[Hubert Julian]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/09/04/archives/negress-pilots-airplane-bessle-coleman-makes-three-flights-for.html |title=Negress Pilots Airplane: Bessie Coleman Makes Three Flights for Fifteenth Infantry |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 4, 1922 |page=9}}</ref> Six weeks later, she returned to Chicago to deliver a stunning demonstration of daredevil maneuvers\u2014including figure eights, loops, and near-ground dips to a large and enthusiastic crowd at the Checkerboard Airdrome (now the grounds of Hines Veterans Administration Medical Center, [[Hines, Illinois]], Loyola Hospital, Maywood, and nearby [[Forest Preserve District of Cook County|Cook County Forest Preserve]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1483.html |title=Bessie Coleman: Pioneer Chicago Aviator |last=Keating |first=Ann Durkin |date=2005 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBut the thrill of stunt flying and the admiration of cheering crowds were only part of Coleman's dream. Coleman never lost sight of her childhood vow to one day \"amount to something.\" As a professional aviatrix, Coleman would often be criticized by the press for her opportunistic nature and the flamboyant style she brought to her exhibition flying. However, she also quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and daring pilot who would stop at nothing to complete a difficult stunt. In Los Angeles, she broke a leg and three ribs when her plane stalled and crashed on February 22, 1923.\n[[File:Bessie Coleman and her plane (1922).jpg|thumb|Bessie Coleman, c.1922.]]\n\nCommitted to promoting aviation and combating racism, Coleman spoke to audiences across the country about the pursuit of aviation and goals for African Americans.  She absolutely refused to participate in aviation events that prohibited the attendance of African Americans.{{sfn|Creasman|1997|p=162}}\n\nIn the 1920s, in Orlando, Florida, on a speaking tour, she met the Rev. Hezakiah Hill and his wife Viola, community activists who invited her to stay with them at the parsonage of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church on Washington Street in the neighbourhood of [[Parramore]].  A local street was renamed  \"Bessie Coleman\" Street in her honour in 2013. The couple, who treated her as a daughter, persuaded her to stay and Coleman opened a beauty shop in Orlando to earn extra money to buy her own plane.<ref name=\"os\">{{cite news |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orange/os-black-pilot-bessie-coleman-orlando-20150131-story.html |title=Orlando renames street in honor of black 'daredevil aviatrix' |first=Stephen |last=Hudak |date=January 31, 2015 |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]}}</ref>\n\nThrough her media contacts, she was offered a role in a feature-length film titled, ''Shadow and Sunshine'', to be financed by the [[African American Seminole Film Producing Company]]. She gladly accepted, hoping the publicity would help to advance her career and provide her with some of the money she needed to establish her own flying school. But upon learning that the first scene in the movie required her to appear in tattered clothes, with a walking stick and a pack on her back, she refused to proceed. \"Clearly ... [Bessie's] walking off the movie set was a statement of principle. Opportunist though she was about her career, she was never an opportunist about race.

She had recently purchased a Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) in [[Dallas]]. Her mechanic and publicity agent, 24-year-old William D. Wills, flew the plane from Dallas in preparation for an airshow but had to make three [[emergency landing|forced landings]] along the way because the plane had been so poorly maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/bessie-coleman |title=Bessie Coleman Facts |work=yourdictionary.com}}</ref> Upon learning this, Coleman's friends and family did not consider the aircraft safe and implored her not to fly it. On take-off, Wills was flying the plane with Coleman in the other seat. She had not put on her seat belt because she was planning a parachute jump for the next day and wanted to look over the cockpit sill to examine the Brendans.\n\nAbout ten minutes into the flight, the plane unexpectedly went into a [[Dive (aviation)|dive]] and then a [[Spin (flight)|spin]] at 3,000 feet above the ground. Coleman was thrown from the plane at {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and died instantly when she hit the ground. William Wills was unable to regain control of the plane and it plummeted to the ground. Wills died upon impact and the plane exploded and burst into flames. Although the wreckage of the plane was badly burned, it was later discovered that a wrench used to service the engine had jammed the controls. Coleman was 34 years old.<ref name=\"rich\" />\n\nFuneral services were held in Florida before her body was sent back to Chicago.  While there was little mention in most media, news of her death was widely carried in the African American press and 10,000 mourners attended her ceremonies in Chicago, which were led by activist [[Ida B.

In 1901, George Coleman left his family. He returned to [[Oklahoma]], or [[Indian Territory]], as it was then called, to find better opportunities, but his wife and children did not follow. At the age of 12, Bessie was accepted into the Missionary Baptist Church School on scholarship. When she turned eighteen, she took her savings and enrolled in the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University in Langston, Oklahoma (now called [[Langston University]]).

But, to succeed in this highly competitive arena, she would need advanced lessons and a more extensive repertoire. Returning to Chicago, Coleman could not find anyone willing to teach her, so in February 1922, she sailed again for Europe. She spent the next two months in France completing an advanced course in aviation, then left for the [[Netherlands]] to meet with [[Anthony Fokker]], one of the world's most distinguished aircraft designers. She also traveled to Germany, where she visited the [[Fokker]] Corporation and received additional training from one of the company's chief pilots. She then returned to the United States to launch her career in exhibition flying.<ref name=rich/>\n\n\"Queen Bess,\" as she was known, was a highly popular draw for the next five years. Invited to important events and often interviewed by newspapers, she was admired by both blacks and whites. She primarily flew [[Curtiss JN-4]] \"Jenny\" [[biplanes]] and other aircraft which had been army surplus aircraft left over from the war. She made her first appearance in an American [[airshow]] on September 3, 1922, at an event honoring veterans of the all-black [[369th Infantry Regiment (United States)|369th Infantry Regiment]] of [[World War I]]. Held at [[Roosevelt Field, New York|Curtiss Field]] on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]] near New York City and sponsored by her friend Abbott and the ''Chicago Defender'' newspaper, the show billed Coleman as \"the world's greatest woman flier\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Toth |first=Maria Lynn |date=February 10, 2001 |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/kids/readingroom/la-et-story10-feb10-2006,0,7374705,full.story |title=Daredevil of the Sky: The Bessie Coleman Story |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105072047/http://www.latimes.com/features/kids/readingroom/la-et-story10-feb10-2006,0,7374705,full.story |archivedate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> and featured aerial displays by eight other American ace pilots, and a jump by black parachutist [[Hubert Julian]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/09/04/archives/negress-pilots-airplane-bessle-coleman-makes-three-flights-for.html |title=Negress Pilots Airplane: Bessie Coleman Makes Three Flights for Fifteenth Infantry |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 4, 1922 |page=9}}</ref> Six weeks later, she returned to Chicago to deliver a stunning demonstration of daredevil maneuvers\u2014including figure eights, loops, and near-ground dips to a large and enthusiastic crowd at the Checkerboard Airdrome (now the grounds of Hines Veterans Administration Medical Center, [[Hines, Illinois]], Loyola Hospital, Maywood, and nearby [[Forest Preserve District of Cook County|Cook County Forest Preserve]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1483.html |title=Bessie Coleman: Pioneer Chicago Aviator |last=Keating |first=Ann Durkin |date=2005 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBut the thrill of stunt flying and the admiration of cheering crowds were only part of Coleman's dream. Coleman never lost sight of her childhood vow to one day \"amount to something.\" As a professional aviatrix, Coleman would often be criticized by the press for her opportunistic nature and the flamboyant style she brought to her exhibition flying. However, she also quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and daring pilot who would stop at nothing to complete a difficult stunt. In Los Angeles, she broke a leg and three ribs when her plane stalled and crashed on February 22, 1923.\n[[File:Bessie Coleman and her plane (1922).jpg|thumb|Bessie Coleman, c.1922.]]\n\nCommitted to promoting aviation and combating racism, Coleman spoke to audiences across the country about the pursuit of aviation and goals for African Americans.

Hezakiah Hill and his wife Viola, community activists who invited her to stay with them at the parsonage of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church on Washington Street in the neighbourhood of [[Parramore]].  A local street was renamed  \"Bessie Coleman\" Street in her honour in 2013.

She gladly accepted, hoping the publicity would help to advance her career and provide her with some of the money she needed to establish her own flying school. But upon learning that the first scene in the movie required her to appear in tattered clothes, with a walking stick and a pack on her back, she refused to proceed. \"Clearly ...

She had recently purchased a Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) in [[Dallas]]. Her mechanic and publicity agent, 24-year-old William D.

On take-off, Wills was flying the plane with Coleman in the other seat. She had not put on her seat belt because she was planning a parachute jump for the next day and wanted to look over the cockpit sill to examine the Brendans.\n\nAbout ten minutes into the flight, the plane unexpectedly went into a [[Dive (aviation)|dive]] and then a [[Spin (flight)|spin]] at 3,000 feet above the ground. Coleman was thrown from the plane at {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and died instantly when she hit the ground. William Wills was unable to regain control of the plane and it plummeted to the ground. Wills died upon impact and the plane exploded and burst into flames. Although the wreckage of the plane was badly burned, it was later discovered that a wrench used to service the engine had jammed the controls. Coleman was 34 years old.<ref name=\"rich\" />\n\nFuneral services were held in Florida before her body was sent back to Chicago.
