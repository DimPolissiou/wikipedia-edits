Under the 1919 [[Treaty of Neuilly]], Bulgaria was forced to, amongst other things, cede various territories, pay crippling [[war reparations]], and greatly reduce the size of its military. That same year, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] of the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] became prime minister. After Stamboliyski was overthrown in [[1923 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]] in 1923, Boris recognized the new government of [[Aleksandar Tsankov]], who harshly suppressed the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] and lead the nation through a [[Incident at Petrich|brief border war]] with [[Greece]]. Tsankov was removed from power in 1926, and a series of prime ministers followed until 1934, when the [[Corporatism|corporatist]] ''[[Zveno]]'' movement staged [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]] and outlawed all political parties. Boris opposed the ''Zveno'' government and overthrew them in 1935, eventually installing [[Georgi Kyoseivanov]] as prime minister. For the remainder of his reign, Boris would rule as a ''de facto'' [[absolute monarch]], with his prime ministers largely submitting to his will.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bulgaria initially remained neutral. In 1940, [[Bogdan Filov]] replaced Kyoseivanov as prime minister, becoming the last prime minister to serve under Boris. Later that year, with the support of [[Nazi Germany]], Bulgaria received the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]] from [[Romania]] as part of the [[Treaty of Craiova]]. In January 1941, Boris approved the [[anti-Semitic]] [[Law for Protection of the Nation]], which denied citizenship to [[Bulgarian Jews]] and placed numerous restrictions upon them. In March, Bulgaria joined the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. In exchange, Bulgaria received large portions of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], both of which were key targets of [[Bulgarian irredentism]]. Boris refused to participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] and partially resisted German attempts to deport Bulgarian Jews as part of the [[Holocaust]]. In 1942, ''Zveno'', the Agrarian National Union, the Bulgarian Communist Party, and various other far-left groups united to form a [[resistance movement]] known as the [[Bulgarian Fatherland Front|Fatherland Front]], which would later go on to [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrow the government]] in 1944. In August 1943, shortly after returning from a visit to Germany, Boris died at the age of 49. His six-year-old son, [[Simeon II of Bulgaria|Simeon II]], succeeded him as tsar.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:FieldMarshallVonMackensenAndCrownPrinceBorisReviewingBulgarianRegiment.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|Crown prince Boris (2nd from right) and German Field marshall Von Mackensen reviewing a Bulgarian regiment accompanied by the Commander in Chief General [[Nikola Zhekov|Zhekov]] and the Chief of Staff Army General [[Konstantin Zhostov|Zhostov]] during World War I]]\nBoris was born on 30 January 1894 in [[Sofia]] to [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I, Prince of Bulgaria]], and his wife [[Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nIn February 1896, his father paved the way for the reconciliation of Bulgaria and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] with the conversion of the infant Prince Boris from [[Roman Catholicism]] to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], a move that earned Ferdinand the frustration of his wife, the animosity of his Catholic Austrian relatives (particularly his uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]) and excommunication from the Catholic Church. In order to remedy this difficult situation, Ferdinand christened all his remaining children as Catholics. [[Nicholas II of Russia]] stood as godfather to Boris and met the young boy during Ferdinand's official visit to [[Saint Petersburg]] in July 1898.\n\nHe received his initial education in the so-called Palace Secondary School, which Ferdinand had created in 1908 solely for his sons. Later, Boris graduated from the Military School in [[Sofia]], then took part in the [[Balkan Wars]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]], he served as [[liaison officer]] of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army on the [[Macedonian front]]. In 1916, he was promoted to [[colonel]] and attached again as liaison officer to [[Army Group Mackensen (Romania)|Army Group Mackensen]] and the Bulgarian [[Third Army (Bulgaria)|Third Army]] for the operations against [[Romania during World War I|Romania]]. Boris worked hard to smooth the sometimes difficult relations between [[Field Marshal]] [[August von Mackensen|Mackensen]] and [[Lieutenant General]] [[Stefan Toshev]], the commander of the Third Army. Through his courage and personal example, he earned the respect of the troops and the senior Bulgarian and German commanders, even that of the [[Generalquartiermeister]] of the German Army, [[Erich Ludendorff]], who preferred dealing personally with Boris and described him as excellently trained, a thoroughly soldierly person and mature beyond his years.<ref name=\"Ludendorf\">{{cite book|title=Ludendorff's Own Story, August 1914-November 1918: The Great War from the Siege of Li\u00e8ge to the Signing of the Armistice as Viewed from the Grand Headquarters of the German Army|author=Ludendorff, E.|date=1919|issue=\u0442. 2|publisher=Harper|url=https://archive.org/details/ludendorffsowns00ludegoog|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref> In 1918, Boris was made a [[major general]].\n\n==Early reign==\n[[File:Scepter of Tsar Boris III.jpg|thumb|100px|left| The Royal Sceptre of Boris III]]\nIn September 1918, Bulgaria was defeated in the [[Vardar Offensive]] and forced to sue for peace. Ferdinand subsequently abdicated in favour of Boris, who became Tsar on 3 October 1918.\n\nOne year after Boris's accession, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (or ''Stambolijski'') of the Bulgarian People's Agrarian Union was elected prime minister. Though popular with the large peasant class, Stambolijski earned the animosity of the middle class and military, which led to his toppling in a military coup on 9 June 1923, and his subsequent assassination. On 14 April 1925, an anarchist group attacked Boris's cavalcade as it passed through the [[Arabakonak]] Pass. Two days later, a bomb killed 150 members of the Bulgarian political and military elite in Sofia as they attended the funeral of a murdered general (see [[St Nedelya Church assault]]). Following a further attempt on Boris's life the same year, military reprisals killed several thousand communists and agrarians, including representatives of the intelligentsia. Finally, in October 1925, there was a short border war with Greece, known as the [[Incident at Petrich]], which was resolved with the help of the [[League of Nations]].

As a result of peace treaties that ended the First World War (the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Neuilly]]), Bulgaria, which had fought on the losing side, lost two important territories to neighboring countries: the [[Southern Dobruja|Southern plain of Dobruja]] to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Western Thrace]] to Greece. The Bulgarians considered these treaties an insult and wanted the lands restored. When [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power, he tried to win Bulgarian Tsar Boris III's allegiance. In the summer of 1940, after a year of war, Hitler hosted diplomatic talks between Bulgaria and Romania in Vienna. On 7 September, an [[Treaty of Craiova|agreement]] was signed for the return of [[Southern Dobruja]] to Bulgaria. The Bulgarian nation rejoiced. In March 1941, Boris allied himself with the [[Axis powers]], thus recovering most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and Aegean [[Thrace]], as well as protecting his country from being crushed by the German [[Wehrmacht]] like neighboring [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]]. For recovering these territories, Tsar Boris was called the Unifier (Bulgarian: \u0426\u0430\u0440 \u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b). Tsar Boris appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on 20 January 1941 wearing a full military uniform.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19410120,00.html Tsar Boris III] ''Time'', 20 January 1941.

Retrieved 14 April 2010.</ref>\n\nDespite this alliance, and the German presence in [[Sofia]] and along the railway line which passed through the Bulgarian capital to Greece, Boris was not willing to provide full and unconditional cooperation with Germany. He refused to send regular Bulgarian troops to fight the Soviet Union on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] alongside Germany and the other Axis belligerents, and also refused to allow unofficial volunteers (such as Spain's [[Blue Division]]) to participate, although the German legation in Sofia received 1,500 requests from young Bulgarian men who wanted to fight against [[Bolshevism]].<ref>[http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=3100075 \u0426\u0430\u0440 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 III: \u041f\u043e-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0445\u043b\u044f\u0431, \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725232834/http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=3100075 |date=25 July 2014 }}, \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434, 30 January 2014</ref>\n\n{{House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha of Bulgaria}}\nBut there was a price to be paid for the return of Dobrudja. This was the adoption of the anti-Jewish \"[[Law for Protection of the Nation]]\" (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u2014 \u0417\u0417\u041d) on 24 December 1940. This law was in accordance with the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the rest of Hitler's occupied Europe. Bulgarian Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]] and Interior Minister [[Petur Gabrovski]], both Nazi sympathisers, were the architects of this law, which restricted Jewish rights, imposed new taxes, and established a quota for Jews in some professions. Many Bulgarians protested in letters to their government.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Law_for_Protection_of_the_Nation.jpg].\n\n===The Holocaust===\n[[File:The law for protection of the nation (Bulgaria).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Decree of Boris III for approval of the antisemitic [[Law for protection of the nation]]]]\nIn early 1943, Hitler's emissary, [[Theodor Dannecker]], arrived in Bulgaria. Dannecker was an SS Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer and one of [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s associates who guided the campaign for the deportation of the [[French Jews]] to concentration camps. In February 1943, Dannecker met with the Commissar for Jewish Affairs in Bulgaria, [[Alexander Belev]], notorious for his antisemitic and strong nationalist views. They held closed-door meetings and ended with a secret agreement signed on 22 February 1943 for the deportations of 20,000 Jews - 11,343 from [[Aegean Thrace]] and [[Vardar Macedonia]], and 8,000 from Bulgaria proper. These were the territories conquered by Germany, but being under Bulgarian occupation and jurisdiction at the time, although this occupation was never recognized internationally. The Jewish people in these territories were the only ones who did not get Bulgarian citizenship in 1941-1942, unlike the rest of the population. The remaining 20,000 [[Bulgarian Jews]] were to be deported later.\n\nThe initial roundups were to begin on 9 March 1943. Boxcars were lined up in [[Kyustendil]], a town near the western border. But as the news about the imminent deportations leaked out, protests arose throughout Bulgaria. On the morning of 9 March, a delegation from Kyustendil, composed of eminent public figures and headed by [[Dimitar Peshev]], the deputy speaker of the National Assembly, met with Interior Minister [[Petur Gabrovski]]. Facing strong opposition from within the country, Gabrovski relented. The same day, he sent telegrams to the roundup centers in the pre-war territory of Bulgaria, postponing the deportations to a future, unidentified date.\n\nIn a report of 5 April 1943, Adolph Hoffman, a German government adviser and police attache at the German legation in Sofia (1943\u201344) wrote: \"The Minister of Interior has received instruction from the highest place to stop the planned deportation of Jews from the old borders of Bulgaria\". In fact, Gabrovski's decision was not taken on his own \"personal initiative\", but had come from the highest authority \u2014 Tsar Boris III, who decided to temporarily stop the deportation of the rest of the Jews. While Jews living in [[Bulgaria]] proper were saved, the 11,343 Jews from Vardar Macedonia and Aegean Thrace were deported to the death camps of [[Treblinka]] and [[Majdanek]].\n\nStill reluctant to comply with the German deportation request, the royal palace utilised Swiss diplomatic channels to inquire whether it was possible to deport the Jews to British-controlled Palestine by ship rather than to concentration camps in German-occupied Poland by boat and train.{{citation needed|reason=The claim that the King was 'Still reluctant' to comply with the German deportation requests, that this was his long-standing moral stance, is not backed up by a reliable source quoted here. For example, the book source quoted at the end of this paragraph, merely says,'The following month, Bulgaria sensed the shifting tide of the war and attempted to disassociate itself from the ''Final Solution''.'

Capovilla]] writes: \"Through his intervention, and with the help of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria, thousands of Jews from [[Slovakia]], who had first been sent to [[Hungary]] and then to Bulgaria, and who were in danger of being sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]], obtained transit visas for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] signed by him.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"[[Crown of Thorns]]\" by [[Stephane Groueff]], London, 1987</ref>\n\n==Meetings with Hitler==\n[[File:Boris III Tzar of Bulgaria 1894 - 1943 sculptor Kunio Novachev architect Milomir Boganov.jpg|thumb|Boris III Tsar of Bulgaria (1894 - 1943), sculptor Kunio Novachev, architect Milomir Boganov.

Memorial metalwork \"Tsar Boris III Unifier\" on the City hall from 1992 in memory of thanks for the liberation of Southern Dobrudzha in 1940 and its return to Bulgaria.]]\n\nNazi pressure on Tsar Boris III continued for the deportation of the Bulgarian Jewry. At the end of March, Hitler \"invited\" the Tsar to visit him. Upon returning home, Boris ordered able-bodied Jewish men to join hard labor units to build roads within the interior of his kingdom. It is widely believed{{according to whom|date=August 2019}} that this was the Tsar's attempt to avoid deporting them.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDuring May 1943, Dannecker and Belev, the Commissar for Jewish Affairs, planned the deportation of more than 48,000 Bulgarian Jews, who were to be loaded on steamers on the [[River Danube]]. Boris continued the cat-and-mouse game that he had long been playing; he insisted to the Nazis that [[Bulgarian Jews]] were needed for the construction of roads and railway lines inside his kingdom. Nazi officials requested that Bulgaria deport its Jewish population to German-occupied [[Poland]]. The request caused a public outcry, and a campaign whose most prominent leaders were Parliament's deputy speaker [[Dimitar Peshev]] and the head of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], Archbishop Stefan, was organised. Following this campaign, Boris refused to permit the extradition of Bulgaria's nearly 50,000 Jews.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 30 June 1943, Apostolic Delegate Angelo Roncalli, the future [[Pope John XXIII]], wrote to  Boris, asking for mercy for \"the sons of the [[Jewish people]].\" He wrote that Tsar Boris should on no account agree to the dishonorable action that Hitler was demanding. On the copy of the letter, the future pope noted, by hand, that the Tsar replied verbally to his message. The note states ''\"Il Re ha fatto qualche cosa\"'' (\"The Tsar did something\"); and while noting the difficult situation of the monarch, Roncalli stressed once again ''\"Per\u00f2, ripeto, ha fatto''\" (\"But I repeat, he has acted\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAn excerpt from the diary of Rabbi [[Daniel Zion]], the spiritual leader of the Jewish community in Bulgaria during the war years, reads:\n\n<blockquote>Do not be afraid, dear brothers and sisters! Trust in the Holy Rock of our salvation ... Yesterday I was informed by Bishop Stephen about his conversation with the Bulgarian tsar. When I went to see Bishop Stephen, he said: \"Tell your people, the Tsar has promised, that the Bulgarian Jews shall not leave the borders of Bulgaria ...\". When I returned to the synagogue, silence reigned in anticipation of the outcome of my meeting with Bishop Stephen. When I entered, my words were: \"Yes, my brethren, God heard our prayers ...\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/></blockquote>\n\nMost irritating for Hitler was the Tsar's refusal to declare war on the [[Soviet Union]] or send Bulgarian troops to the Eastern Front. On 9 August 1943, Hitler summoned Boris to a stormy meeting at [[Rastenburg]], [[East Prussia]]. Boris arrived by plane from [[Vrazhdebna]] on 14 August. The Tsar asserted his stance once again not to send Bulgarian Jews to death camps in occupied by the Germans Poland or Germany. While Bulgaria had declared a \"symbolic\" war on the distant United Kingdom and United States, the Tsar was not willing to do more than that. At the meeting, Boris once again refused to get involved in the war against the Soviet Union, giving two major reasons for his unwillingness to send troops to Russia. First, many ordinary Bulgarians had strong pro-Russian sentiments; and second, the political and military position of Turkey remained unclear.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The \"symbolic\" war against the Western Allies turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]], as the city was heavily bombarded by the [[US Army Air Force]] and the British [[Royal Air Force]] in 1943 and 1944. (The [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II#April 1941|bombardment of Bulgarian cities]] was started by the British [[Royal Air Force]] in April 1941 without declaring a war.)\n\nBulgaria's opposition came to a head at this last official meeting between Hitler and Boris. Reports of the meeting indicate that Hitler was furious with the Tsar for refusing either to join the war against the USSR or to deport the Jews within his kingdom.<ref>Naomi Martinez \"The Rescue of the Bulgarian Jews during World War II\"</ref> At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that \"the Bulgarian Jews were not to be deported, for Tsar Boris had insisted that the Jews were needed for various laboring tasks including road maintenance.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Death==\n{{Main|The death of Boris III}}\n[[File:Grateful Macedonia to her Tzar Liberator Boris III.JPG|left|thumb|125px|Wood-carving made by inhabitants of the village of Osoi, Debar district, with the inscription: ''To its Tsar Liberator Boris III, from grateful Macedonia''.]]\n\nShortly after returning to Sofia from a meeting with Hitler, Boris died of apparent heart failure on 28 August 1943.<ref>\"Bulgarian Rule Goes to Son, 6.

After taking power in September 1944, the Communist-dominated government had his body exhumed and secretly buried in the courtyard of [[Vrana Palace]], near Sofia. At a later time, the Communist authorities moved the zinc coffin from Vrana to a secret location, which remains unknown to this day. After the fall of communism, an excavation was made at Vrana Palace. Only Boris's heart was found, as it had been put in a glass cylinder outside the coffin. The heart was taken by his widow in 1994 to Rila Monastery, where it was reinterred.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nA wood carving is placed on the left side of his grave in Rila Monastery, made on 10 October 1943 by inhabitants of the village of Osoi, [[Debar Municipality|Debar district]].

Under the 1919 [[Treaty of Neuilly]], Bulgaria was forced to, amongst other things, cede various territories, pay crippling [[war reparations]], and greatly reduce the size of its military. That same year, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] of the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] became prime minister. After Stamboliyski was overthrown in [[1923 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]] in 1923, Boris recognized the new government of [[Aleksandar Tsankov]], who harshly suppressed the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] and lead the nation through a [[Incident at Petrich|brief border war]] with [[Greece]]. Tsankov was removed from power in 1926, and a series of prime ministers followed until 1934, when the [[Corporatism|corporatist]] ''[[Zveno]]'' movement staged [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]] and outlawed all political parties. Boris opposed the ''Zveno'' government and overthrew them in 1935, eventually installing [[Georgi Kyoseivanov]] as prime minister. For the remainder of his reign, Boris would rule as a ''de facto'' [[absolute monarch]], with his prime ministers largely submitting to his will.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bulgaria initially remained neutral. In 1940, [[Bogdan Filov]] replaced Kyoseivanov as prime minister, becoming the last prime minister to serve under Boris. Later that year, with the support of [[Nazi Germany]], Bulgaria received the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]] from [[Romania]] as part of the [[Treaty of Craiova]]. In January 1941, Boris approved the [[anti-Semitic]] [[Law for Protection of the Nation]], which denied citizenship to [[Bulgarian Jews]] and placed numerous restrictions upon them. In March, Bulgaria joined the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. In exchange, Bulgaria received large portions of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], both of which were key targets of [[Bulgarian irredentism]]. Boris refused to participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] and partially resisted German attempts to deport Bulgarian Jews as part of the [[Holocaust]]. In 1942, ''Zveno'', the Agrarian National Union, the Bulgarian Communist Party, and various other far-left groups united to form a [[resistance movement]] known as the [[Bulgarian Fatherland Front|Fatherland Front]], which would later go on to [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrow the government]] in 1944. In August 1943, shortly after returning from a visit to Germany, Boris died at the age of 49. His six-year-old son, [[Simeon II of Bulgaria|Simeon II]], succeeded him as tsar.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:FieldMarshallVonMackensenAndCrownPrinceBorisReviewingBulgarianRegiment.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|Crown prince Boris (2nd from right) and German Field marshall Von Mackensen reviewing a Bulgarian regiment accompanied by the Commander in Chief General [[Nikola Zhekov|Zhekov]] and the Chief of Staff Army General [[Konstantin Zhostov|Zhostov]] during World War I]]\nBoris was born on 30 January 1894 in [[Sofia]] to [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I, Prince of Bulgaria]], and his wife [[Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma]].\n\nIn February 1896, his father paved the way for the reconciliation of Bulgaria and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] with the conversion of the infant Prince Boris from [[Roman Catholicism]] to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], a move that earned Ferdinand the frustration of his wife, the animosity of his Catholic Austrian relatives (particularly his uncle [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]) and excommunication from the Catholic Church. In order to remedy this difficult situation, Ferdinand christened all his remaining children as Catholics. [[Nicholas II of Russia]] stood as godfather to Boris and met the young boy during Ferdinand's official visit to [[Saint Petersburg]] in July 1898.\n\nHe received his initial education in the so-called Palace Secondary School, which Ferdinand had created in 1908 solely for his sons. Later, Boris graduated from the Military School in [[Sofia]], then took part in the [[Balkan Wars]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]], he served as [[liaison officer]] of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army on the [[Macedonian front]]. In 1916, he was promoted to [[colonel]] and attached again as liaison officer to [[Army Group Mackensen (Romania)|Army Group Mackensen]] and the Bulgarian [[Third Army (Bulgaria)|Third Army]] for the operations against [[Romania during World War I|Romania]]. Boris worked hard to smooth the sometimes difficult relations between [[Field Marshal]] [[August von Mackensen|Mackensen]] and [[Lieutenant General]] [[Stefan Toshev]], the commander of the Third Army. Through his courage and personal example, he earned the respect of the troops and the senior Bulgarian and German commanders, even that of the [[Generalquartiermeister]] of the German Army, [[Erich Ludendorff]], who preferred dealing personally with Boris and described him as excellently trained, a thoroughly soldierly person and mature beyond his years.<ref name=\"Ludendorf\">{{cite book|title=Ludendorff's Own Story, August 1914-November 1918: The Great War from the Siege of Li\u00e8ge to the Signing of the Armistice as Viewed from the Grand Headquarters of the German Army|author=Ludendorff, E.|date=1919|issue=\u0442. 2|publisher=Harper|url=https://archive.org/details/ludendorffsowns00ludegoog|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref> In 1918, Boris was made a [[major general]].\n\n==Early reign==\n[[File:Scepter of Tsar Boris III.jpg|thumb|100px|left| The Royal Sceptre of Boris III]]\nIn September 1918, Bulgaria was defeated in the [[Vardar Offensive]] and forced to sue for peace. Ferdinand subsequently abdicated in favour of Boris, who became Tsar on 3 October 1918.\n\nOne year after Boris's accession, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (or ''Stambolijski'') of the Bulgarian People's Agrarian Union was elected prime minister. Though popular with the large peasant class, Stambolijski earned the animosity of the middle class and military, which led to his toppling in a military coup on 9 June 1923, and his subsequent assassination. On 14 April 1925, an anarchist group attacked Boris's cavalcade as it passed through the [[Arabakonak]] Pass. Two days later, a bomb killed 150 members of the Bulgarian political and military elite in Sofia as they attended the funeral of a murdered general (see [[St Nedelya Church assault]]). Following a further attempt on Boris's life the same year, military reprisals killed several thousand communists and agrarians, including representatives of the intelligentsia. Finally, in October 1925, there was a short border war with Greece, known as the [[Incident at Petrich]], which was resolved with the help of the [[League of Nations]].

As a result of peace treaties that ended the First World War (the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Neuilly]]), Bulgaria, which had fought on the losing side, lost two important territories to neighboring countries: the [[Southern Dobruja|Southern plain of Dobruja]] to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Western Thrace]] to Greece. The Bulgarians considered these treaties an insult and wanted the lands restored. When [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power, he tried to win Bulgarian Tsar Boris III's allegiance. In the summer of 1940, after a year of war, Hitler hosted diplomatic talks between Bulgaria and Romania in Vienna. On 7 September, an [[Treaty of Craiova|agreement]] was signed for the return of [[Southern Dobruja]] to Bulgaria. The Bulgarian nation rejoiced. In March 1941, Boris allied himself with the [[Axis powers]], thus recovering most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and Aegean [[Thrace]], as well as protecting his country from being crushed by the German [[Wehrmacht]] like neighboring [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]]. For recovering these territories, Tsar Boris was called the Unifier (Bulgarian: \u0426\u0430\u0440 \u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b). Tsar Boris appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on 20 January 1941 wearing a full military uniform.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19410120,00.html Tsar Boris III] ''Time'', 20 January 1941.

Retrieved 14 April 2010.</ref>\n\nDespite this alliance, and the German presence in [[Sofia]] and along the railway line which passed through the Bulgarian capital to Greece, Boris was not willing to provide full and unconditional cooperation with Germany. He refused to send regular Bulgarian troops to fight the Soviet Union on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] alongside Germany and the other Axis belligerents, and also refused to allow unofficial volunteers (such as Spain's [[Blue Division]]) to participate, although the German legation in Sofia received 1,500 requests from young Bulgarian men who wanted to fight against [[Bolshevism]].<ref>[http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=3100075 \u0426\u0430\u0440 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 III: \u041f\u043e-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0445\u043b\u044f\u0431, \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725232834/http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=3100075 |date=25 July 2014 }}, \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434, 30 January 2014</ref>\n\n{{House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha of Bulgaria}}\nBut there was a price to be paid for the return of Dobrudja. This was the adoption of the anti-Jewish \"[[Law for Protection of the Nation]]\" (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u2014 \u0417\u0417\u041d) on 24 December 1940. This law was in accordance with the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the rest of Hitler's occupied Europe. Bulgarian Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]] and Interior Minister [[Petur Gabrovski]], both Nazi sympathisers, were the architects of this law, which restricted Jewish rights, imposed new taxes, and established a quota for Jews in some professions. Many Bulgarians protested in letters to their government.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Law_for_Protection_of_the_Nation.jpg].\n\n===The Holocaust===\n[[File:The law for protection of the nation (Bulgaria).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Decree of Boris III for approval of the antisemitic [[Law for protection of the nation]]]]\nIn early 1943, Hitler's emissary, [[Theodor Dannecker]], arrived in Bulgaria. Dannecker was an SS Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer and one of [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s associates who guided the campaign for the deportation of the [[French Jews]] to concentration camps. In February 1943, Dannecker met with the Commissar for Jewish Affairs in Bulgaria, [[Alexander Belev]], notorious for his antisemitic and strong nationalist views. They held closed-door meetings and ended with a secret agreement signed on 22 February 1943 for the deportations of 20,000 Jews - 11,343 from [[Aegean Thrace]] and [[Vardar Macedonia]], and 8,000 from Bulgaria proper. These were the territories conquered by Germany, but being under Bulgarian occupation and jurisdiction at the time, although this occupation was never recognized internationally. The Jewish people in these territories were the only ones who did not get Bulgarian citizenship in 1941-1942, unlike the rest of the population. The remaining 20,000 [[Bulgarian Jews]] were to be deported later.\n\nThe initial roundups were to begin on 9 March 1943. Boxcars were lined up in [[Kyustendil]], a town near the western border. But as the news about the imminent deportations leaked out, protests arose throughout Bulgaria. On the morning of 9 March, a delegation from Kyustendil, composed of eminent public figures and headed by [[Dimitar Peshev]], the deputy speaker of the National Assembly, met with Interior Minister [[Petur Gabrovski]]. Facing strong opposition from within the country, Gabrovski relented. The same day, he sent telegrams to the roundup centers in the pre-war territory of Bulgaria, postponing the deportations to a future, unidentified date.\n\nIn a report of 5 April 1943, Adolph Hoffman, a German government adviser and police attache at the German legation in Sofia (1943\u201344) wrote: \"The Minister of Interior has received instruction from the highest place to stop the planned deportation of Jews from the old borders of Bulgaria\". In fact, Gabrovski's decision was not taken on his own \"personal initiative\", but had come from the highest authority \u2014 Tsar Boris III, who decided to temporarily stop the deportation of the rest of the Jews. While Jews living in [[Bulgaria]] proper were saved, the 11,343 Jews from Vardar Macedonia and Aegean Thrace were deported to the death camps of [[Treblinka]] and [[Majdanek]].\n\nStill reluctant to comply with the German deportation request, the royal palace utilised Swiss diplomatic channels to inquire whether it was possible to deport the Jews to British-controlled Palestine by ship rather than to concentration camps in German-occupied Poland by boat and train.{{citation needed|reason=The claim that the King was 'Still reluctant' to comply with the German deportation requests, that this was his long-standing moral stance, is not backed up by a reliable source quoted here. For example, the book source quoted at the end of this paragraph, merely says,'The following month, Bulgaria sensed the shifting tide of the war and attempted to disassociate itself from the ''Final Solution''.' Sounds like the King was shifting his position on Jewish deportations only cynically to save his arse.|date=August 2019}} This was blocked by the British Foreign Secretary, [[Anthony Eden]].<ref>''A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time'' by [[Howard M. Sachar]], Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 2007</ref>\n\nAware of Bulgaria's unreliability on the Jewish matter, the Nazis grew more suspicious about the quiet activities in aid of European Jewry of an old friend of Tsar Boris, Monsignor Angelo Roncalli (the future [[Pope John XXIII]]), the [[Nuncio|Papal Nuncio]] in [[Istanbul]]. Reporting on the humanitarian efforts of Roncalli, his secretary in [[Venice]] and in the [[Holy See|Vatican]], Monsignor [[Loris Francesco Capovilla|Loris F. Capovilla]] writes: \"Through his intervention, and with the help of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria, thousands of Jews from [[Slovakia]], who had first been sent to [[Hungary]] and then to Bulgaria, and who were in danger of being sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]], obtained transit visas for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] signed by him.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"[[Crown of Thorns]]\" by [[Stephane Groueff]], London, 1987</ref>\n\n==Meetings with Hitler==\n[[File:Boris III Tzar of Bulgaria 1894 - 1943 sculptor Kunio Novachev architect Milomir Boganov.jpg|thumb|Boris III Tsar of Bulgaria (1894 - 1943), sculptor Kunio Novachev, architect Milomir Boganov.

At the end of March, Hitler \"invited\" the Tsar to visit him. Upon returning home, Boris ordered able-bodied Jewish men to join hard labor units to build roads within the interior of his kingdom. It is widely believed{{according to whom|date=August 2019}} that this was the Tsar's attempt to avoid deporting them.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDuring May 1943, Dannecker and Belev, the Commissar for Jewish Affairs, planned the deportation of more than 48,000 Bulgarian Jews, who were to be loaded on steamers on the [[River Danube]]. Boris continued the cat-and-mouse game that he had long been playing; he insisted to the Nazis that [[Bulgarian Jews]] were needed for the construction of roads and railway lines inside his kingdom. Nazi officials requested that Bulgaria deport its Jewish population to German-occupied [[Poland]]. The request caused a public outcry, and a campaign whose most prominent leaders were Parliament's deputy speaker [[Dimitar Peshev]] and the head of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], Archbishop Stefan, was organised. Following this campaign, Boris refused to permit the extradition of Bulgaria's nearly 50,000 Jews.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 30 June 1943, Apostolic Delegate Angelo Roncalli, the future [[Pope John XXIII]], wrote to  Boris, asking for mercy for \"the sons of the [[Jewish people]].\" He wrote that Tsar Boris should on no account agree to the dishonorable action that Hitler was demanding. On the copy of the letter, the future pope noted, by hand, that the Tsar replied verbally to his message. The note states ''\"Il Re ha fatto qualche cosa\"'' (\"The Tsar did something\"); and while noting the difficult situation of the monarch, Roncalli stressed once again ''\"Per\u00f2, ripeto, ha fatto''\" (\"But I repeat, he has acted\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAn excerpt from the diary of Rabbi [[Daniel Zion]], the spiritual leader of the Jewish community in Bulgaria during the war years, reads:\n\n<blockquote>Do not be afraid, dear brothers and sisters! Trust in the Holy Rock of our salvation ... Yesterday I was informed by Bishop Stephen about his conversation with the Bulgarian tsar. When I went to see Bishop Stephen, he said: \"Tell your people, the Tsar has promised, that the Bulgarian Jews shall not leave the borders of Bulgaria ...\". When I returned to the synagogue, silence reigned in anticipation of the outcome of my meeting with Bishop Stephen. When I entered, my words were: \"Yes, my brethren, God heard our prayers ...\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/></blockquote>\n\nMost irritating for Hitler was the Tsar's refusal to declare war on the [[Soviet Union]] or send Bulgarian troops to the Eastern Front. On 9 August 1943, Hitler summoned Boris to a stormy meeting at [[Rastenburg]], [[East Prussia]]. Boris arrived by plane from [[Vrazhdebna]] on 14 August. The Tsar asserted his stance once again not to send Bulgarian Jews to death camps in occupied by the Germans Poland or Germany. While Bulgaria had declared a \"symbolic\" war on the distant United Kingdom and United States, the Tsar was not willing to do more than that. At the meeting, Boris once again refused to get involved in the war against the Soviet Union, giving two major reasons for his unwillingness to send troops to Russia. First, many ordinary Bulgarians had strong pro-Russian sentiments; and second, the political and military position of Turkey remained unclear.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The \"symbolic\" war against the Western Allies turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]], as the city was heavily bombarded by the [[US Army Air Force]] and the British [[Royal Air Force]] in 1943 and 1944. (The [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II#April 1941|bombardment of Bulgarian cities]] was started by the British [[Royal Air Force]] in April 1941 without declaring a war.)\n\nBulgaria's opposition came to a head at this last official meeting between Hitler and Boris. Reports of the meeting indicate that Hitler was furious with the Tsar for refusing either to join the war against the USSR or to deport the Jews within his kingdom.<ref>Naomi Martinez \"The Rescue of the Bulgarian Jews during World War II\"</ref> At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that \"the Bulgarian Jews were not to be deported, for Tsar Boris had insisted that the Jews were needed for various laboring tasks including road maintenance.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Death==\n{{Main|The death of Boris III}}\n[[File:Grateful Macedonia to her Tzar Liberator Boris III.JPG|left|thumb|125px|Wood-carving made by inhabitants of the village of Osoi, Debar district, with the inscription: ''To its Tsar Liberator Boris III, from grateful Macedonia''.]]\n\nShortly after returning to Sofia from a meeting with Hitler, Boris died of apparent heart failure on 28 August 1943.<ref>\"Bulgarian Rule Goes to Son, 6.
