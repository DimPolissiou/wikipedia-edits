The city contains superb architectural edifices, including a few old churches and the \"Samuil Vulcan\" highschool, built in 1828, which obtained the \"National College\" designation in 1998. The city is a key point in reaching the [[Apuseni Mountains]] and their rich mines, or mountain resorts like [[St\u00e2na de Vale]] or [[Arie\u0219eni]] through smaller but picturesque communities and villages like Budureasa or Vasc\u01ceu. The nearby mountains are hosts to some of the most dense and spectacular limestone cave systems in the world. These caves contain remains of the extinct cave bear (''Ursus speleus'') and prehistoric humans, huge colonies of bats, subterranean lakes, striking calcareous formations and giant earthworms that live in the [[guano]]-flooded cave floor.\n\nBeiu\u0219 has its own city museum which houses over 3,000 pieces. The museum exhibits reflect its natural history, military history and art, but most famous are its folkloric artifacts: peasant tools, pottery, garments and folk art gathered from the entire central and southern county of Bihor. The tunnels in the city are also famous, as they are believed to link together and act as escape routes used during the Medieval Age. Their construction began during the rule of Hungarian king [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|Bela IV]]. The nearby landscape includes: agricultural hills with crops ranging from corn, wheat and potato to fruit orchards like apple, pears, plums and strawberries. A long stretch of wildlife depleted forest that is rich in flora begins in the north-east of the city. Industry is represented mainly through production of furniture and fashion destined for European markets. The nearby distillery and beverage factory of Sudrigiu also employs a large part of the city's labour force.\n\nAvailable or popular sports in or around Beiu\u0219 are: fresh water fishing ([[Brown trout|trout]], [[catfish]], [[Common carp|carp]], [[barbel (fish species)|barbel]] [[European chub|chub]] [[Common dace|dace]] and at least a dozen other edible species), speleology (spelunking), soccer (Sunday soccer is a local ritual for all ages), skiing, snowboarding, sledding, tennis, hiking, camping, backpacking and rock climbing. Hunting for species like: [[wild boar]], roe deer, rabbit, pheasant, dove, partridge or ducks (mainly mallards) is also popular.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most successful and loved sport in Beiu\u0219, [[CS Bihorul Beiu\u0219|Bihorul Beiu\u0219]] being the most representative team of the city, a club with a rather rich history, being founded in 1921.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Cosmin Bodea]], football player and manager\n*[[Josef Dande]], landscape artist\n*[[Remus Ganea]], footballer \n*[[Adrian Pintea]], actor\n*[[Gheorghe Solomie]], rugby player\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Romania}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities===\nBeiu\u0219 is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|HUN}} [[B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba]] in [[Hungary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Beiu\u0219}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{LocalitiesBihor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beius}}\n[[Category:Beiu\u0219| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Bihor County]]\n[[Category:Cities in Romania]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Beiu\u0219 (disambiguation)}}\n{{Cleanup|date=September 2011}}\n{{Infobox Romanian subdivision\n|type                   = municipality\n|county                 = Bihor\n|population_total       = auto\n|image_skyline =Beius centru din aer.jpg\n|image_caption = Aerial view\n|map_caption = Location within Bihor County\n|official_name=Beiu\u0219\n|image_map = Beius jud Bihor.png\n|image_shield=ROU BH Beius CoA.svg\n|leader_name=Adrian Nicolae Domoco\u0219\n|leader_party=[[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]\n|area_total_km2=24.46\n|coordinates = {{coord|46|39|N|22|21|E|region:RO|display=inline,title}}\n|website={{url|http://www.primariabeius.ro/}}\n}}\n\n'''Beiu\u0219''' ({{IPA-ro|be\u02c8ju\u0283}}; [[German language|German]]: ''Binsch'';{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Bel\u00e9nyes'') is a [[municipiu|city]] in [[Bihor County]], [[Romania]] near the [[Apuseni Mountains]].

The city is a key point in reaching the [[Apuseni Mountains]] and their rich mines, or mountain resorts like [[St\u00e2na de Vale]] or [[Arie\u0219eni]] through smaller but picturesque communities and villages like Budureasa or Vasc\u01ceu. The nearby mountains are hosts to some of the most dense and spectacular limestone cave systems in the world. These caves contain remains of the extinct cave bear (''Ursus speleus'') and prehistoric humans, huge colonies of bats, subterranean lakes, striking calcareous formations and giant earthworms that live in the [[guano]]-flooded cave floor.\n\nBeiu\u0219 has its own city museum which houses over 3,000 pieces. The museum exhibits reflect its natural history, military history and art, but most famous are its folkloric artifacts: peasant tools, pottery, garments and folk art gathered from the entire central and southern county of Bihor. The tunnels in the city are also famous, as they are believed to link together and act as escape routes used during the Medieval Age. Their construction began during the rule of Hungarian king [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|Bela IV]]. The nearby landscape includes: agricultural hills with crops ranging from corn, wheat and potato to fruit orchards like apple, pears, plums and strawberries. A long stretch of wildlife depleted forest that is rich in flora begins in the north-east of the city. Industry is represented mainly through production of furniture and fashion destined for European markets. The nearby distillery and beverage factory of Sudrigiu also employs a large part of the city's labour force.\n\nAvailable or popular sports in or around Beiu\u0219 are: fresh water fishing ([[Brown trout|trout]], [[catfish]], [[Common carp|carp]], [[barbel (fish species)|barbel]] [[European chub|chub]] [[Common dace|dace]] and at least a dozen other edible species), speleology (spelunking), soccer (Sunday soccer is a local ritual for all ages), skiing, snowboarding, sledding, tennis, hiking, camping, backpacking and rock climbing. Hunting for species like: [[wild boar]], roe deer, rabbit, pheasant, dove, partridge or ducks (mainly mallards) is also popular.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most successful and loved sport in Beiu\u0219, [[CS Bihorul Beiu\u0219|Bihorul Beiu\u0219]] being the most representative team of the city, a club with a rather rich history, being founded in 1921.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Cosmin Bodea]], football player and manager\n*[[Josef Dande]], landscape artist\n*[[Remus Ganea]], footballer \n*[[Adrian Pintea]], actor\n*[[Gheorghe Solomie]], rugby player\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Romania}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities===\nBeiu\u0219 is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|HUN}} [[B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba]] in [[Hungary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Beiu\u0219}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{LocalitiesBihor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beius}}\n[[Category:Beiu\u0219| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Bihor County]]\n[[Category:Cities in Romania]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiu%C8%99"}

Built as a response to the Italian {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|4}}, the ''Richelieu''s were based on their immediate predecessors of the {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|4}} with the same unconventional arrangement that grouped their [[main battery]] forward in two quadruple [[gun turret]]s. They were scaled up to accommodate a much more powerful [[main battery]] of eight [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|{{cvt|380|mm}} guns]] (compared to the {{cvt|330|mm}} guns of the ''Dunkerque''s), with increased armor to protect them from guns of the same caliber. ''Richelieu'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1935 and was [[ship launching|launched]] in 1939, just before the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe. As war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] became increasingly likely, work on the ship was rushed to prepare her for [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] in April 1940.\n\nCompleted just days before the Germans won the [[Battle of France]] in June, ''Richelieu'' fled to [[Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]] to keep her under French control. There, she came under repeated British attacks that had been intended to either compel the battleship to join the [[Free French Naval Forces]] or sink her; these included during [[Operation Catapult]] in July 1940 and the [[Battle of Dakar]] in September. Damaged in both attacks, the ship was slowly repaired before eventually being turned over to Free French control after the [[Operation Torch|Allied invasion of North Africa]] in November 1942. After being sent to the United States for repairs and an extensive modernization, the ship served with the British [[Home Fleet]] in early 1944 before being deployed to the [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]] for operations against the Japanese in the [[Indian Ocean]]. These included several bombardment operations and in May 1945 she was present during the [[Battle of the Malacca Strait]], though she was too far away to engage the Japanese ships before they were sunk.\n\n''Richelieu'' was part of the force that liberated [[Singapore]] following the [[Japanese surrender]] in September, and she thereafter operated in [[French Indochina]] as part of the initial effort to restore French colonial rule. Recalled to France in December 1945, she was repaired and modernized slightly in 1946. The ship saw relatively limited peacetime training in the immediate postwar years and in 1952, she was removed from active service for use as a gunnery [[training ship]]. In 1956, she was placed in [[reserve fleet|reserve]] and was thereafter used as a stationary training vessel and [[barracks ship]] until 1967, when the French Navy decided to discard her. Sold for [[scrap]] in 1968, she was [[ship breaking|broken up]] in Italy from 1968 to 1969.\n\n== Design==\n{{main|Richelieu-class battleship}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-1.jpg|left|thumb|Recognition drawing of ''Richelieu'' in her original configuration]]\n\nWhen in 1934 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] announced that it would begin building two {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|1}}s armed with {{cvt|380|mm}} guns, the [[French Navy]] immediately began preparations to counter them. The small {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|1}}s that had been ordered provided the template for the next French battleship design, but it needed to be scaled up to match the new Italian vessels, both in terms of offensive and defensive characteristics. The design staff considered 380 and {{cvt|406|mm|0}} guns, but the latter could not be incorporated in a design that remained within the {{cvt|35000|LT|MT|-1|lk=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and was quickly discarded. The ''Dunkerque''s carried their armament in two quadruple [[gun turret]]s arrayed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] forward of the [[superstructure]], and the designers experimented with other arrangements, including combinations of triple and twin turrets, but the need to minimize the length of the armor belt (and thus its weight) necessitated the ''Dunkerque'' layout.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=94\u201397}}\n\n''Richelieu'' displaced {{convert|37250|LT|MT|abbr=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]] and {{convert|44698|MT|LT|order=flip}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|247.85|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33.08|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbines]] and six oil-fired Sural [[water-tube boiler]]s, which developed a total of {{convert|155000|shp|lk=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. At a cruising speed of {{convert|15|kn}}, the ship could steam for {{convert|9500|nmi|lk=in}}. Her crew numbered 1,569&nbsp;officers and men. The ship carried four [[Loire 130]] [[seaplane]]s on the [[quarterdeck]], and the aircraft facilities consisted of a steam [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] and a crane to handle the floatplanes.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le (Mle) 1935 guns]] arranged in two quadruple gun turrets,{{efn|/45 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[caliber (artillery)|calibers]]; a /45 gun is 45 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} both of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of nine [[Canon de 152 mm Mod\u00e8le 1930|{{convert|152|mm|abbr=on|0}} /55 Mle 1930 guns]] mounted in three triple turrets, arranged on the rear superstructure. Heavy [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) defense consisted of twelve {{cvt|100|mm}} /45 Mle 1930 anti-aircraft guns in twin turrets. Close range anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of eight [[Canon de 37 mm Mod\u00e8le 1925|{{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] guns in twin mounts and twenty [[Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] machine guns in four quadruple and two twin mounts. The ship's [[belt armor]] was {{convert|330|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships, and the main battery turrets were protected by {{convert|430|mm|abbr=on}} of armor plate on the faces. The main armored deck was {{convert|170|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and the [[conning tower]] had {{convert|340|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=99}}\n\n== Service ==\n\n===Construction===\nThe contract for ''Richelieu'' was awarded to the [[Arsenal de Brest]] on 31 August 1935, and the [[keel]] for the new ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 22 October in the No. 4 dock that had recently built {{ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}}. The [[slipway]] was not long enough to accommodate the entire length of the new battleship, and so the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] had to be built in pieces. The main section of the hull, which amounted to {{cvt|197|m}}, was built on the slipway, while a {{cvt|43|m}} length of the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and an {{cvt|8|m}} length of her [[stern]] were built elsewhere and attached after the rest of the ship was [[ship launching|launched]] on 17 January 1939. The French decision to lay down ''Richelieu'' in 1935 put the country in violation of the Washington Treaty, which was to expire on 31 December 1936, as the combined tonnage of the two ''Dunkerque''s and ''Richelieu'' exceeded the {{cvt|70000|LT|MT}} that had been allotted to France during the moratorium on new battleship construction. France used the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which Britain had unilaterally signed with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in June 1935 to dismiss British objections to the new ship, though they nevertheless slowed construction of ''Richelieu'' to ease British concerns. Work was also slowed by [[Strike action|strikes]] in the shipyards for better pay and working conditions.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=98, 122}}\n\nBy the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the hull had been assembled; the start of the war led the naval command to decide to slow work on other, less complete vessels to focus efforts on ''Richelieu'' and her [[sister ship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1940|2}}. The ship began initial testing on 15 October while still [[fitting-out]] in an effort to rush the ship into service; the same day, the ship's first commander, [[Ship-of-the-line captain|''Capitaine de vaisseau'']] (''CV''\u2014Ship-of-the-line captain) Marzin came aboard. Engine testing began on 14 January 1940, and a week later her main battery was completed when the last barrel was installed. Further engine testing was carried out between 31 March and 7 April; during this period, she was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 April. Formal [[sea trial|acceptance trials]] began on 14 April. Repair work was conducted in [[Brest, France|Brest]] from 19 to 27 May, and fire control equipment for the main and secondary batteries were installed. ''Richelieu'' conducted full power trials on 13 June, reaching {{convert|32.63|kn}} from {{cvt|179000|shp}}, exceeding her design performance. Test firings of the guns were conducted on 13 and 14 June. Work on the ship was completed on 15 June 1940, days before France surrendered to Germany after the [[Battle of France]].{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\n===World War II===\n====Under Vichy control: 1940\u20131942====\nWith German troops advancing across France by mid-June, the Navy decided to evacuate ''Richelieu'' to [[Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]; while earlier plans had been to send the fleet to British ports to continue the war, when the possibility of a negotiated armistice arose, the government decided that the fleet would be a useful bargaining chip. As a result, vessels should be preserved under French control, away from German occupation. At 06:45, the ship took on a load of ammunition and fuel, though she received only 198&nbsp;quarter charges of propellant for her main battery, which amounted to powder sufficient for 49&nbsp;shots. Material that had not yet been installed was also hastily loaded onto the ship, to be fitted once ''Richelieu'' reached the safety of Dakar. She also took aboard gold reserves from the [[Bank of France]] and 250&nbsp;cadets from the ''[[\u00c9cole Navale]]'' (Naval Academy). There was insufficient time to allow the full complement to assemble and board the ship, and at 04:00 the next morning, ''Richelieu'' got underway while German troops approached Brest. ''Richelieu'' steamed in company with the [[destroyer]]s {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} while German aircraft made several ineffective attacks against the ships. The battleship's anti-aircraft guns returned fire without success. Initially cruising at a speed of {{cvt|22|kn}}, boiler trouble forced the ships to decrease speed to {{cvt|18|kn}}. The motors for her [[rudder]] also repeatedly broke down on the voyage, though the crew was able to repair them. While cruising off [[Casablanca]], [[French Morocco]] at 17:00 on 20 June, the torpedo boats were detached to refuel, their place being taken by the new destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Fleuret|1938|2}}. The two vessels then proceeded on to Dakar, where they arrived at 17:44 on 23 June.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=124\u2013125}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' in Dakar in 1940]]\n\nOn arriving in Dakar, an uneasy situation confronted ''Richelieu'' while armistice negotiations were still underway. The commander of French naval forces in the region, ''[[Contre-amiral]]'' (''CA''\u2014Rear Admiral) Plan\u00e7on and the [[governor-general]] of French West Africa, [[:fr:L\u00e9on Cayla|L\u00e9on Cayla]], were inclined to remain in the war against Germany. Also, significant British naval units were in the area, including the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} moored in Dakar and the British South Atlantic Squadron, which was nearby. At the same time, ''Richelieu'' had used half of her fuel to escape Brest, and she could perform little sustained firing of her main or secondary guns. Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]], sent a telegraph on the night of 23\u201324 June to warn Marzin that the British might attack the vessel to neutralize it in the event of a French surrender, and ordered him to begin preparations to [[scuttling|scuttle]] the ship if the need arose. Meanwhile, on 23 June, the British heavy cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} departed [[Freetown]] to observe ''Richelieu''{{'}}s activities in Dakar.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=125}}\n\nOn 25 June, Marzin received word that the French government had signed the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|Armistice with Germany]]. Darlan instructed him that the ship was to remain under French control, and if that proved to be impossible, he was to scuttle the ship or attempt to escape to the then-neutral United States. Marzin decided that, given the threat of British warships in the area, the best course of action was to try to escape to Casablanca and join the French fleet there, and so at 14:30 ''Richelieu'' got underway in company with ''Fleuret''. ''Hermes'' raised anchor as well and began to follow ''Richelieu'' with her [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s on her [[flight deck]], but the coastal artillery trained their guns on the ship, convincing ''Hermes''{{'}} commander to return to port. ''Dorsetshire'' nevertheless shadowed ''Richelieu'' while she was at sea. The next morning, Darlan, who feared that Marzin was trying to defect to the [[Free French forces]], ordered him to return to Dakar. Marzin complied and turned the ships back to port, but while on the way, he received amended orders instructing him to wait some {{cvt|120|nmi}} north of [[Cape Verde]] to escort the 1st Division of Armed Merchant Cruisers to Dakar, as they were carrying another load of gold reserves from the Bank of France. ''Richelieu'' failed to make contact at the prescribed rendezvous point, and since she had not embarked any of her floatplanes before fleeing Brest, she could not conduct an aerial search. Marzin instead returned to Dakar on 28 June; the convoy arrived, having been significantly delayed, on 4 July.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nAfter returning to port, work began to prepare the ship for action as quickly as possible. Marzin ordered that a stockpile of 330&nbsp;mm propellant charges that had been stocked for the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}} before France's surrender to be converted into charges that were usable by ''Richelieu''. The secondary guns were readied for action ten days later, but they lacked a director capable of tracking aerial targets, so they could be used against surface ships only. Under the terms of the armistice, ''Richelieu'' was to be returned to Toulon, where she would be demobilized, though the Germans later decided against permitting the move, as they feared the British would try to seize the ship during the passage through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]; the British, meanwhile, were under the mistaken impression that the Germans sought to seize the French fleet for their own use. This led to [[Operation Catapult]], a series of attacks on French warships to neutralize vessels that would not defect to the Free French.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=72, 126}}\n\n=====British attack on 8 July 1940 and repairs=====\n\n[[File:HMS Hermes June 1940.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Hermes'' (center) and ''Dorsetshire'' (background) off Dakar during the operation against ''Richelieu'']]\n\nThe component of Catapult that targeted ''Richelieu'' consisted of the carrier ''Hermes'', which joined the cruisers {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} and ''Dorsetshire'' off Dakar. On 4 July, the day after the British had [[attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|attacked Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]], Plan\u00e7on ordered the [[submarine]]s {{ship|French submarine|Le Glorieux||2}} and {{ship|French submarine|Le H\u00e9ros||2}} to attack ''Dorsetshire'' while it cruised off the port. He also instructed the coastal batteries to open fire if she closed to within {{cvt|15|km}}, though ''Dorsetshire'' remained at a distance. Marzin moved ''Richelieu'' to a position near the island of [[Gor\u00e9e]], pointed south so that the ship's main battery could aim at any vessels that approached Dakar. The British had intended to send [[Force H]] to Dakar after the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, but the need to return to destroy ''Dunkerque'' forced the British to resort to ''Hermes''; on 7 July, the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Milford|L51|6}} was sent to contact Plan\u00e7on and issue the ultimatum to either surrender his ship to British control or be sunk.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=126}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=32}}\n\nMarzin prepared his ship to sortie the next morning; he intended to use the eight rounds loaded in his main guns to attack ''Hermes''. Other forces in Dakar were put on alert and ''Le H\u00e9ros'' again sortied to assist in the attack. While the French preparations were ongoing, the British sent a motorboat from ''Milford'' to drop four [[depth charge]]s under ''Richelieu''{{'}}s stern to disable her screws, though this attempt failed. At 04:15, a group of Swordfish launched from ''Hermes'' as ''Richelieu'' was about to get underway. One of their torpedoes struck the ship aft on the [[starboard]] side and tore a hole that was {{cvt|9.3|by|8.5|m}} between the propeller shafts. The resulting shock disabled many of the ship's systems. Two of her fire control directors were knocked off their tracks, the starboard propeller shafts were bent, and the blast caused significant flooding. Damage control teams pumped fuel out of the bunkers to counteract the loss of buoyancy aft and the ship was towed into port for repairs. [[Anti-torpedo net]]s were set up around the vessel, which had taken on some {{cvt|2400|t|LT}} of water and at low tide rested on the harbor bottom.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=32}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=127}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nLater that afternoon, [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]] came alongside and began pumping oil out of the ship's bunkers to reduce her draft, but water continued to leak into the hull through the cable tunnels. Pumps attached to the ship helped to control the flooding, but the hoses repeatedly pulled loose as ''Richelieu'' rose and fell with the waves. To further complicate the effort to repair the ship, Dakar lacked a dry dock sufficient to accommodate ''Richelieu''; the battleship could not simply be drained and plated over. Instead, damaged [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] had to be patched and pumped out individually; by 28 August, some {{cvt|1300|t|LT}} of water remained aboard the ship. Heavy use of the pumps caused frequent breakdowns, which further slowed work. In his report on the attack and subsequent repairs, Marin criticized faulty design and construction practices that hindered damage control efforts, including insufficient pumping equipment, poor quality control for the welding of bulkheads, and a failure to ensure that critical components like the turret trunks were watertight.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=128, 137}}\n\nWhile work to control and reverse the flooding was ongoing, other repairs were necessary to return the ship to operational status. The fire-control directors needed to be re-seated in their tracks, wiring that had been damaged by flooding or leaking fuel oil had to be replaced, and several of the electrical generators, which had been badly shaken by the blast, needed to be rebuilt. Given the limited ability to repair the damage to the ship, Marzin focused efforts on ensuring that the main and secondary batteries could be effectively used, even if the ship could only be employed as a static [[floating battery]] against an expected second attack from British forces. ''[[Amiral]]'' (Admiral) [[Jean de Laborde]] flew to Dakar to conduct an inspection and help to organize the defenses. As part of these preparations, both Plan\u00e7on and Cayla, who were suspected of being pro-British, were removed from their posts, with Plan\u00e7on's place taken by ''CA'' Platon and then ''CA'' Landriau.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nWorkers in the local shipyard scavenged metal from other ships in the harbor to fabricate an {{cvt|11.5|m}} square patch to cover the torpedo hole, which was planned to be installed by 10 September. This would allow the rear [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] for the 152&nbsp;mm and 37&nbsp;mm guns to be drained. At the same time, the shipyard began building a steel [[cofferdam]] around the ship that was to have been completed by late October, which would allow the rest of the hull to be pumped dry. With the hull pumped out, permanent repairs were to have been completed by January 1941. While this work was being carried out, the crew cleaned and painted the ship and continued to work on readying the armament. A total of 150 complete charges for the main battery were created by remanufacturing the stockpile intended for ''Strasbourg''. Parts of the crew were dispersed for other tasks: 106 were sent to man the armed merchant cruisers in the harbor, whose reservist crews had to be demobilized, and the 64-man crew of the forward gun turret were sent to man the coastal battery at [[Cap Manuel]]. After another 132&nbsp;reservists from ''Richelieu'' were demobilized, a total of 1,039&nbsp;officers and men were left aboard the ship. The 100-, 37-, and 13.2&nbsp;mm guns were kept manned continuously given the threat of further British air attacks.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n=====Battle of Dakar=====\n[[File:HMS Barham FL1472.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Barham|04|6}}, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s primary opponent during the battle]]\n{{main|Battle of Dakar}}\n\nWhile repairs were being carried out in August, the British began preparations for another attack, code-named Operation Menace. British [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] sought to use a contingent of Free French forces led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] to invade the colony and seize the ship for use against Germany. By late August, a [[convoy]] had been assembled with five ships carrying weapons and supplies got underway, later rendezvousing with a second convoy of six [[troop ship]]s carrying some 2,400&nbsp;Free French soldiers and 4,270&nbsp;British soldiers. The naval support force consisted of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and the battleships {{HMS|Barham|04|2}} and {{HMS|Resolution|09|2}}, along with four cruisers and numerous other warships. The plan called for de Gaulle to use his French forces to attempt to secure the colony, only calling on British support if the Vichy forces resisted him. At the same time, several French colonies in Africa defected to Free France, prompting the Vichy government to secure authorization from the [[German Armistice Commission]] to send several [[light cruiser]]s and destroyers to reinforce their holdings in Africa, designated Force Y. Owing to the risk of encountering British vessels on the passage, the destroyers were temporarily left in Casablanca while the three cruisers, carrying supplies and additional men to crew the coastal batteries, raced south at high speed. They reached Dakar on 14 September, and after disembarking the men and supplies, continued on south to [[French Equatorial Africa]] (in what is now present-day Gabon).{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=139\u2013141}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}\n\nThe British believed that the arrival of Force Y indicated that the French were aware of Operation Menace, but de Gaulle decided to proceed with the attack regardless. While Force Y steamed south, two of the three cruisers were intercepted by British cruisers and forced to fall back to Dakar, arriving there again on 20 September, by which time the destroyers had arrived. On 22 September, the liner {{SS|Banfora}} was due to arrive with a load of 380&nbsp;mm shells, and as a result, French search aircraft were arrayed to the north to cover the liner's approach; they were completely surprised by the arrival of the Anglo-Free French force on the morning of 23 September. A small party of Free French troops sent to rally the port to de Gaulle was repulsed with machine-gun fire and ''Richelieu''{{'}}s 100&nbsp;mm guns fired warning shots toward the Free French [[aviso]] {{ship|French aviso|Savorgnan de Brazza||2}} shortly after 07:00. On the approach of the sloops {{ship|French sloop|Commandant Domin\u00e9||2}} and {{ship|French sloop|Commandant Duboc||2}} at 08:10, ''Richelieu'' again fired warning shots from her 100&nbsp;mm guns. The British warships approached the port and came under fire from the coastal batteries, leading the Anglo-Free French commanders, de Gaulle and Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]] to conclude that they would have to directly attack the port if the operation was to succeed.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=141}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=109\u2013114}}\n\n''Barham'' and ''Resolution'' opened fire on ''Richelieu'' at 11:05, but poor visibility hampered the British shooting and they checked fire after twenty minutes, having inflicted only splinter damage to the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Montcalm|1935|2}} and the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Le Malin||2}}. The French coastal batteries hit several of the cruisers and destroyers, but ''Richelieu'' was moored facing north, which prevented her from taking part in the initial duel. Following the British withdrawal, Marzin used [[tugboat]]s to turn the ship far enough to enable her to bring her main battery to bear. The defenses of Dakar now alerted, the Free French then attempted to land further east at [[Rufisque]], but the landing there was repulsed as well. The British and Free French withdrew to regroup for another attack the next day. Between 06:25 and 08:00 on 24 September, the British launched three strikes with Swordfish and [[Blackburn Skua]] bombers. These attacks scored no hits on ''Richelieu'' owing to poor visibility, though they made several near-misses that inflicted no damage. In return, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s gunners claimed three of the six aircraft that were shot down, and damaged another. An hour and a half later, the British battleships and two [[heavy cruiser]]s approached and took ''Richelieu'' under fire with their 380&nbsp;mm main batteries.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=141\u2013142}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\n''Richelieu'' returned fire at 09:40, but her No. 7 gun was destroyed by a shell that detonated in the barrel and the No. 8 gun was also badly damaged. This was first traced to the use of the remanufactured propellant from ''Strasbourg'', but during a later inquiry in 1941, it was determined that the explosions were caused by a flaw in the design of the shell base.{{sfn|Dumas|pp=77\u201378}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=143, 149}} Guns Nos. 5 and 6 remained in action but they failed to score any hits. At 09:57, one of ''Richelieu''{{'}}s secondary guns hit ''Barham'', though the British ships inflicted little damage in return, apart from minor splinter damage before breaking off at 10:07. During this period, the French counted some 160 shells that hit near the ship, but they did little damage. The French then laid smoke screens to obscure ''Richelieu'' before the British returned to the action at 12:53, initially targeting a destroyer before bombarding the port for the next half an hour. ''Richelieu'' was not struck in the barrage, during which at 12:56, she used guns 5 and 6 to engage the British cruisers, quickly straddling one of them and convincing them to disengage. She fired four 380&nbsp;mm shells at ''Barham'' at 13:11\u201313:12 but failed to hit with any, though both British battleships had been hit several times by the coastal batteries. After disengaging for the day, de Gaulle decided to abandon the operation, but Cunningham convinced him to allow a final attempt the next morning. In the meantime, Marzin decided to transfer the crews from turret 2 to turret 1, which also required moving the shells and propellant between magazines.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=143\u2013145}}{{sfn|Williams|p=140}}\n\nAs the British approached on the morning of 25 September, Marzin decided to engage ''Barham'' with his main battery and ''Resolution'' with his 152&nbsp;mm guns. While the British were approaching their bombardment positions, ''Richelieu'' shot down one of the reconnaissance planes shortly before 07:00. She opened fire at 09:04 with her main battery, firing two shots that fell short, and the coastal guns and Force Y cruisers followed suit shortly thereafter. While the British battleships were turning to unmask their rear guns, the submarine {{ship|French submarine|B\u00e9v\u00e9ziers|1935|2}} torpedoed and badly damaged ''Resolution''. ''Barham'' avoided the torpedoes and opened fire, quickly straddling ''Richelieu'' and at 09:15, she scored a hit [[amidships]] that penetrated above the side armor, though it caused no casualties. In return, ''Richelieu'' hit ''Barham'' in the bow, but it did little damage. At 09:25, the British disengaged to cover ''Resolution''{{'}}s withdrawal. After the British were gone, the gun crew attempted to clear the shells that had been loaded in guns 5 and 6 and the shell in No. 5 also exploded, leaving No. 6 the only operable gun in the turret. In total, French warships in the harbor lost 100&nbsp;dead and 182&nbsp;wounded, while another 84 were killed and 197 wounded among the civilian population.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=147}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=152\u2013154}}\n\nBeginning on 29 September, the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}} and escorting destroyers were detached from Force H to patrol off Dakar, as the British believed ''Richelieu'' would be transferred to [[metropolitan France]] for repairs. The British ships remained in the area until 1 October when it became clear that the ship would not be moved.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=43}}\n\n=====Repairs and defection to Free France=====\n[[File:Richelieu-3.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' at Dakar in 1941]]\n\nRepair work resumed immediately. The hit from ''Barham'' did little serious damage to the ship, but it nevertheless caused extensive deformation of interior bulkheads, the armor deck was forced down where the shell hit it, and the uptakes from the boilers were damaged. Wiring in the area was also cut by fragments and needed to be replaced. On 10 October, the workers attempted to attach the patch that had been manufactured, but it did not work; it did not create a watertight seal, which meant the compartments could not be pumped out. The patch was abandoned in the hopes that the cofferdam, then nearing completion, would work. The cofferdam was modeled to conform to the hull and was built with an interior void that could be used as a [[ballast tank]] so it could be floated in position and sunk in place. The cofferdam was ready by late December, which allowed the hull to be pumped dry and then sealed with welded plates and cement; the hull was finally sealed by 28 February 1941. Further repairs were hampered by the German Armistice Commission, which attempted to slow progress to prevent the ship from returning to full operational status. They blocked the shipment of new guns or a new propeller shaft, and severely constrained the transfer of other equipment. During this period, on 27 February, ''CV'' Deramond replaced Marzin as the ship's commander.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125, 147\u2013149}}\n\nAs repairs were carried out, the ship saw little activity through late 1942 apart from engaging unidentified aircraft on 28 July and 29 September 1941 and 26 February and 12 May 1942.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}} During this period, in April 1941, the ship received the first [[radar]] set installed on a French battleship. And in July, her Loire seaplanes finally arrived; tests with the catapults were conducted in October.{{sfn|Dumas|pp=34, 50}} On 10 April 1942, the ship conducted a test firing with gun No. 6 to demonstrate that the shell design problem had been corrected; all six shells were fired without incident. On 8 November, American and British forces landed in French North Africa (code-named [[Operation Torch]]), which prompted the Germans to invade the rest of Vichy France, which in turn led Darlan to defect to the Allies with the rest of the fleet.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}}\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] sent a group to evaluate the ships under Darlan's control to determine which should be modernized in the United States. The only French battleship still in service, ''Richelieu'' was an obvious candidate. The US Navy had not initially been interested in repairing ''Richelieu''; while the Germans and Italians retained a number of powerful battleships, the United States had recently commissioned or would soon complete eight fast battleships, more than sufficient to cover US requirements for the [[Pacific War]] and to send to Europe to reinforce the [[Royal Navy]]. In addition, repairing and modernizing a ship the size of ''Richelieu'' would require significant resources that could be used for other purposes. But pressure from Britain and the Free French convinced the Navy to agree to the project. For France, she was the only surviving modern battleship and thus a major symbol of national prestige, while the British had long sought to acquire the vessel to stiffen the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], which at that time had just two new battleships to oppose their three Italian counterparts.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=150, 181}}\n\n[[File:French battleship Richelieu in New York.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' in the United States for repairs]]\n\nShe ran sea trials from 25 to 29 January 1943 to evaluate the state of her engines, which had not been used since July 1940. Her aircraft facilities and anti-aircraft armament were removed during the evaluation period, as they would be replaced by US equipment. On 30 January, she departed Dakar with ''Montcalm'', bound for New York City, where both vessels would be modernized. ''Richelieu'' steamed at a speed of {{cvt|14|kn}} and her rudder had to be held to seven degrees to account for the hull deformation. The ships arrived on 11 February and on the 18th, ''Richelieu'' was taken into Dock No. 5 at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] to begin the modernization.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}}{{sfn|Dumas|pp=37, 50}}\n\n====Free-French career: 1943\u20131945====\n=====Refit in New York City=====\nPolitical tensions between the United States and France played a major role in determining how much ''Richelieu'' would be modernized. The US Navy refused to transfer the latest radar equipment on the basis that it was too sensitive to be released. As a result, much of the improvement was limited to the installation of a new anti-aircraft battery of the latest US weapons and auxiliary equipment in addition to a thorough overhaul and permanent repairs to the torpedo damage. Three shifts of workers, totaling some 2,000&nbsp;men, worked on the ship twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, for five months to rush the ship back into service. The modifications to the ship increased her displacement by about {{cvt|3000|t|LT}}. While the ship was being modernized, ''CV'' Lambert replaced Deramont as the ship's commander on 29 April.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125, 181\u2013182, 186}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu Ney York.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' arrives in New York with her damaged turret. The uppermost fire control director on the fore tower had to be dismantled for her to pass under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the [[New York Navy Yard]]]]\n\nThe ship's armament required extensive repairs and modifications to bring ''Richelieu'' up to modern standards. First, three of the eight main battery guns had to be replaced, which required removing the turret roof. Since the gun cradles were undamaged, the guns were simply replaced by barrels taken from ''Jean Bart'', which had been recovered at Casablanca during Operation Torch. The shell handling equipment of both the primary and secondary guns was thoroughly overhauled, with wiring being replaced and the shell and propellant lifts being rebuilt\u2014the latter had never been made to function correctly while the ship was in Dakar. Ammunition for the primary and secondary guns was now a problem as the source, factories in France, were occupied by German forces. Drawings of the plans for the 380&nbsp;mm shells were prepared in Dakar and forwarded to the United States, where a contract to produce 930&nbsp;shells was ordered from [[Crucible Industries|Crucible Steel]]. American 6-inch/47 Mk&nbsp;16 shells were used as a starting point to supply the 152&nbsp;mm guns, as they were the same caliber and required relatively minor modifications for use in the French weapons.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nHer 100&nbsp;mm guns were retained, but her light anti-aircraft battery now consisted of fifty-six [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{cvt|40|mm}} Bofors guns]] in quadruple mounts, all placed with their own Mk&nbsp;51 gun director. These were arranged with two abreast the superfiring turret, two on either side of the forward tower, another two per side of the aft tower, and the remaining four on the [[quarterdeck]], where the aircraft catapults had been. These guns were supplemented with fifty [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{cvt|20|mm}} Oerlikon cannons]], all in individual or twin mounts. Nine were placed on the [[forecastle]] aft of the [[Breakwater (ship)|breakwater]], four were mounted on the superfiring turret, nine were placed on the former aircraft hangar, with the rest dispersed around the superstructure, including on the towers and the shelter deck.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186\u2013188}}\n\n''Richelieu''{{'}}s tower foremast was heavily reconfigured; the upper main battery director (which had never been operational) had been removed to allow the ship to clear the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], was left off. In its place, the [[radome]] for the SF surface search radar was installed, along with the mattress antenna for the SA-2 [[air search radar]]; these were short-range sets that had been designed for small craft, the SA-2 intended for [[PT boat]]s. Most of the command spaces in the tower were converted for other uses. The fire control systems for the main battery had to be replaced and those for the secondary guns were repaired with new wiring and telephones. The ship's original [[Hermann Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe|Ansch\u00fctz]] [[gyrocompass]]es were replaced with [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] models. The ship's propulsion system was thoroughly overhauled: the turbines were thoroughly repaired and the boilers were re-tubed. Much of the wiring throughout the ship was replaced, and a [[degaussing]] cable was installed.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186, 188\u2013189}}\n\nTo repair the hull, the concrete was broken up and removed, the sections that had been most badly damaged by the torpedo were stripped of all fittings, and deformed bulkheads and plating were cut out. After more than two and a half years without being dry-docked in a tropical port, the hull needed maintenance beyond simply repairing the torpedo damage, though given the conditions to which it had been subjected, it was in fairly good condition. It was sandblasted and those sections of plating that exhibited pitting had new plates welded over top. The starboard propeller shafts also required repairs: the mounting brackets were straightened, but the inboard shaft was too badly damaged and had to be replaced. [[Bethlehem Steel]] fabricated a replacement that was installed in June. The bottom row of [[porthole]]s were closed off, as the increase in displacement pushed them closer to the waterline.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=182}}\n\nBeginning in late August and continuing into mid-September, ''Richelieu'' began firing trials in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]; firing the main battery forward on 29 August revealed the need for a blast screen to protect the forecastle 20&nbsp;mm guns, as the test accidentally destroyed two of the guns and their ammunition lockers. With her normal displacement now at {{cvt|43600|t|LT}} and her hull slightly bowed (possibly caused by the torpedo hit), ''Richelieu'' began machinery trials in late September. On 25 September, the ship reached her new top speed of {{cvt|31.5|kn}}, cruising at that speed for thirty minutes, despite the deformation of her hull and the significant increase in displacement. The following day, she steamed for six hours at {{cvt|26.5|kn}}, for two hours at {{cvt|28.9|kn}}, and finally for fifty minutes at {{cvt|30.2|kn}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186, 188}}\n\nAs completed, the ship's displacement had grown to {{cvt|43957|t|LT}} normally and {{cvt|47728|t|LT}} fully loaded; draft correspondingly increased to {{cvt|9.22|m}} and {{cvt|10.68|m|0}}, respectively. Compared to her original wartime crew of 1,569&nbsp;officers and men, ''Richelieu'' was now to be manned by a total of 1,930, amounting to 86&nbsp;officers, 287&nbsp;[[petty officer]]s, and 1,557&nbsp;men. The major increase in complement was largely the result of the additional anti-aircraft guns and radar systems. The ship conducted further trials into October, and on the 14th the ship was finally ready to get underway for European waters.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=189}}\n\n=====In European waters=====\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A20935-colourised.jpg|left|thumb|Anti-aircraft gunners aboard ''Richelieu'' during target practice with the British fleet]]\n\nEscorted by the destroyers {{USS|Tarbell}} and {{USS|Ellet||2}}, ''Richelieu'' departed the US on 14 October, nominally bound for [[Gibraltar]]. The destroyers departed while underway, allowing ''Richelieu'' to keep up a speed of {{convert|24|kn}} in heavy seas. The ship stopped in the [[Azores]], Portugal, where she met the French destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Le Fantasque||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Le Terrible||2}} and the British destroyer {{HMS|Active|H14|2}}, which was limited to a speed of {{cvt|20|kn}}; ''Active'' quickly left the group, which proceeded not to Gibraltar, but to [[Mers El K\u00e9bir]]. There, she replenished supplies; it had been intended to deploy the ship with the Mediterranean Fleet, but Italy had surrendered in September, removing the threat posed by the Italian ''Littorio''-class battleships. ''Richelieu'' was instead sent north to join the [[Home Fleet]], which included the four surviving {{sclass-|King George V|battleship|1||1939}}s. When ''Richelieu'' departed the Mediterranean, Cunningham, now the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, recommended to the Admiralty that she be fitted with gunnery radars. The ship was escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Musketeer|G86|6}} and {{HMS|Scourge|G01|6}}, and on arrival in [[Scapa Flow]], Admiral [[Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape|Bruce Fraser]], the Home Fleet commander, inspected the battleship on 24 November. Work began immediately on installing a Type&nbsp;284 gunnery radar while the ship began an intensive period of training to acclimate the ship's crew to operating with British units.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=190}}\n\nThe ship saw little activity over the winter of 1943\u20131944 until February 1944, when she took part in [[Operation Posthorn]]. ''Richelieu'', the battleship {{HMS|Anson|79|2}}, and the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} departed Scapa Flow on 10 February for a raid on German shipping off occupied Norway. The objective was to lure the German heavy cruisers in the area so that the two battleships could destroy them. The carrier aircraft achieved little, sinking a single [[Cargo ship|freighter]] of 3,000&nbsp;tons and damaging a [[repair ship]] while trading one of the [[Supermarine Seafire]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] for a German [[Bf 109]] fighter. The fleet returned to port on the 12th, and ''Richelieu'' thereafter went to [[Rosyth]] for ten days to rest the crew. A repeat sweep was to have taken place at the end of the month, but two of the escorting destroyers collided while leaving Scapa Flow, leading to a postponement that became permanent as a result of bad weather. In March, the Allies determined that five battleships to counter the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} (which had been damaged in September 1943) was excessive. As a result, ''Richelieu'' was detached for other operations. The Allied command initially considered employing her to support the [[invasion of Normandy]], but as she was only supplied with armor-piercing shells, she was instead sent to reinforce the British [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]], along with a group of [[escort aircraft carrier]]s.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=190\u2013191}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=307, 313}}\n\nThe ship accordingly steamed to [[Greenock]] to take on fuel and ammunition, before cruising south to the Mediterranean with an escort of three British destroyers. She stopped in [[Algiers]] on 26 March to take on additional supplies; there, she was visited by General [[Henri Giraud]] and Admiral [[Andr\u00e9 Lemonnier]]. ''Richelieu'' thereafter departed for the [[Suez Canal]], steaming at a speed of {{cvt|25|kn}}; while underway, she began to experience significant boiler problems. The boiler blowers were not providing sufficient oxygen, so the boilers were not fully burning the fuel. As a result, the boiler tubes quickly became fouled and caused overheating. ''Richelieu'' stopped in [[Aden]] for repairs to the boiler tubes, but the problem was not corrected.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=192}}\n\n=====First deployment with the British Eastern Fleet=====\n[[File:Renown-9.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' (top left) with the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} (center) and the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} (top right) during [[Operation Transom]] on 12 May 1944]]\n\nOn entering the [[Indian Ocean]], ''Richelieu'' picked up an escort consisting of the destroyers {{HMS|Rotherham||2}}, {{HMS|Racehorse|H11|2}}, and {{HMS|Quadrant||2}}. The four ships arrived in [[Trincomalee]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] on 10 April, where they joined an Allied fleet that included the carriers {{HMS|Illustrious|87|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, the battleships {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}}, and numerous cruisers and destroyers, commanded by Admiral [[James Somerville]]. On 16 April, the Eastern Fleet got underway for [[Operation Cockpit]], a diversionary raid to distract the Japanese while American forces [[Battle of Hollandia|landed at Hollandia]] in [[New Guinea]]. Somerville divided his fleet into two squadrons; ''Richelieu'' served in Force 69, the main element, with ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Valiant'', while ''Renown'' operated with the two carriers. The plan for Operation Cockpit called for carrier strikes on the port of [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]], [[Netherlands East Indies]]. The fleet arrived in position early on 19 April, and after the carrier aircraft struck the port, Japanese bombers counter-attacked and ''Richelieu'' engaged the aircraft with her 100&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm batteries.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=192\u2013193}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=319}}\n\nThe next major operation conducted by the Eastern Fleet, [[Operation Transom]], was timed to coincide with American operations in the Central Pacific to keep the attention of the Japanese fleet based in [[Singapore]] focused away from the American fleet. For this operation, the target was the major base at [[Surabaya]], which also had significant oil refinery facilities. The Eastern Fleet got underway on 7 May and stopped to refuel on 15 May before arriving two days later. The strike proceeded uneventfully for ''Richelieu'' and on 18 May the American contingent detached to rejoin the main American fleet in the Pacific while the Eastern Fleet returned to Trincomalee, arriving on 27 May. Two days later, ''Richelieu'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and six destroyers steamed to [[Colombo]] to rest their crews. While there, ''Richelieu'' was visited by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], Supreme Allied Commander of the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asia Theatre]]. On 31 May, ''CV'' Merveilleux du Vignaux replaced Marzin as the ship's commander.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=193\u2013194, 199}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=204\u2013205}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=323}}\n\nSomerville planned another raid for mid-June: [[Operation Pedal]], a carrier attack on the harbor of [[Port Blair]] in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman Islands]]. The purpose of the attack was to again distract the Japanese fleet units in Singapore while American forces embarked on [[Operation Forager]], the invasion of the [[Marianas Islands]]. For the Anglo-French operation, Somerville took only the fast ships, including ''Richelieu'', ''Renown'', and ''Illustrious'' with their accompanying cruiser and destroyer screens. These ships, designated Force 60, sortied on 19 June and two days later, ''Illustrious''{{'}} aircraft struck Japanese targets in the port. The ships arrived back in Trincomalee on 23 June. [[Operation Crimson]] followed in July, and given the lack of a response from the Japanese fleet to the earlier raids, Somerville decided to use his battleships and battlecruiser to bombard Sabang and [[Sumatra]]. ''Richelieu'' and the other ships conducted shooting practice on 7, 14\u201315, and 17 July in preparation for the raid. The plan called for ''Richelieu'', ''Valiant'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and ''Renown'', supported by cruisers, to shell the port at longer range while the Dutch cruiser {{ship|HNMS|Tromp|1937|2}} led a group of destroyers in a close-range attack. ''Illustrious'', joined by the carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}, which had recently arrived, provided air cover to the fleet.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=194}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=206\u2013207, 209\u2013214}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=334, 344}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu from Saratoga May 1944.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' on 18 May 1944 after the conclusion of Operation Transom, taken from USS ''Saratoga'']]\n\nThe Eastern Fleet departed on 22 July and reached the target on the morning of 25 July; the carriers launched their [[combat air patrol]]s and the surface combatants steamed to approach their targets. ''Richelieu'' was the last vessel in the line, astern of ''Renown''. ''Queen Elizabeth'', the leading battleship, opened fire at 06:54 at a range of {{cvt|6000|m}}. The other ships quickly followed suit and [[F4U Corsair]] fighters circled overhead to spot for the ships' guns. ''Richelieu'' fired four-gun salvos, with two guns per turret, and she scored hits with the second salvo, demolishing several buildings and damaging the [[power station]]. Her secondary turrets neutralized a Japanese coastal artillery battery that had been engaging ''Tromp''. At 07:15, the ships ceased firing, and in the brief bombardment, ''Richelieu'' had fired 81&nbsp;main battery shells\u2014this amounted to a [[rate of fire]] of a salvo every 50&nbsp;seconds, nearly twice as fast as the British ships. Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet as it withdrew, but they were kept at bay by the carriers' fighters and heavy anti-aircraft fire from the ships. The fleet arrived back in Trincomalee on 27 July.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nBy this time, ''Richelieu'' was beginning to suffer from reduced speed, the result of continued boiler trouble and [[biofouling]] of her hull. Admiral [[Laurence E. Power]], who had replaced Somerville as the fleet commander, detached ''Richelieu'' for a refit. The British had initially offered the floating dry-dock ''AFD-28'', but Merveilleux du Vignaux believed that the dry-dock would not be able to accommodate a vessel the size of his ship (he proved to be correct when on 8 August, ''AFD-28'' nearly [[capsize]]d with ''Valiant'' aboard). ''Richelieu'' left on 6 September, bound for Algiers with three escorting destroyers. ''Le Terrible'' and ''Le Fantasque'' took over escort duties after ''Richelieu'' passed through the Suez Canal, and on 23 September the three ships arrived in Algiers. ''Richelieu'' then steamed north to Toulon on 1 October where she was visited again by Lemonnier, but the shipyard there was in ruins, so she moved to Casablanca on 10 October to be refitted. In addition to the hull cleaning and boiler repairs, she had new fire control and search radars installed, including a US SG-1 search radar, British Type-281B air search radar, and Type-285P fire control radars, in addition to other equipment, including an FV1 [[Radio jamming|jammer]] and [[high-frequency direction finding]] gear.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=195}}{{sfn|Lepotier|p=217}}\n\n=====Second deployment with the British Eastern Fleet=====\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A23486.jpg|thumb|Seen from the deck of {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} are ''Valiant'' (center-right) and ''Richelieu'' (right background)]]\n\nOn 23 January 1945, ''Richelieu'' left Casablanca for Gibraltar, arriving there two days later to have her hull cleaned and repainted. The French sought to deploy an independent task force consisting of ''Richelieu'', the four light cruisers still in service, and four destroyers, with a view toward reestablishing French control in [[Indochina]]. But the United States opposed the move and refused to allocate the necessary aircraft carriers and support ships that would have been necessary for another independent fleet, and so ''Richelieu'' could only be sent, alone, back to the Eastern Fleet. The ship conducted trials in February that revealed the problem with her boilers had finally been corrected and she thereafter got underway for Trincomalee, arriving on 20 March. By this time, the modern elements of the Eastern Fleet had been detached to form the [[British Pacific Fleet]], with the Eastern Fleet being renamed the East Indies Fleet. This unit, still under Power's command, consisted of ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Renown'', nine cruisers, ten [[escort carrier]]s, and twenty destroyers. Japanese naval strength at Singapore had also significantly decreased to just four heavy cruisers and several destroyers.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=196}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=195\u2013217}}\n\nFor the next few weeks, ''Richelieu'' was occupied with shooting drills with her primary and secondary batteries and tests for the anti-aircraft radars and command systems. Now assigned to Force 63 of the East Indies Fleet, ''Richelieu'' sortied on 8 April to take part in [[Operation Sunfish]], another bombardment of Sabang while aircraft scouted possible landing beaches near the city of [[Padang]] on the coast of Sumatra. The ships allocated for the operation consisted of ''Richelieu'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', two heavy cruisers, two escort carriers, and five destroyers. Early on 11 April, the two battleships, one of the cruisers, and three destroyers bombarded the island while the other vessels conducted the reconnaissance operation. ''Richelieu'' fired seven salvos with her main battery and used her secondary guns to once again silence the coastal battery on the island. Japanese aircraft launched a poorly-coordinated attack on the battleships but they failed to score any hits. After further carrier operations around Padang, the fleet returned to port on 20 April.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=197}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=408}}\n\nThe next major operation followed a week later. Operation Bishop, a strike against Japanese airfields in the [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] and [[Andaman Islands]], was to cover British Army landings at [[Rangoon]] in Burma. The plan called for the East Indies Fleet to be divided into multiple groups, each with escorting cruisers and destroyers: four of the escort carriers were to directly support the landings, ''Richelieu'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' each formed independent surface action groups, and another pair of escort carriers provided air protection for the surface groups. The fleet got underway on 27 April and reached [[Car Nicobar]] two days later. ''Richelieu'' bombarded the airfields at a range of {{cvt|23600|m}}, firing a total of 80&nbsp;main and 45&nbsp;secondary shells. She incurred minor damage to her bow 20&nbsp;mm guns from the blast effects of firing the main battery nearly directly forward. The fleet then proceeded to the Andamans, and at 17:30, ''Richelieu'' opened fire at Port Blair; poor visibility hampered her shooting, and she ceased fire at 18:07, by now having expended the main battery ammunition that had been allotted for the bombardment. She nevertheless returned on 2 May to shell the harbor with her secondary guns, firing 120&nbsp;rounds and inflicting significant damage to the harbor facilities. The fleet steamed north to Rangoon to support the landings, but it was discovered that the Japanese had already withdrawn, allowing the fleet to return to Trincomalee on 8 May.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=198\u2013199}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=412}}\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A23483 cropped.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' astern of ''Valiant'' during [[Operation Bishop (1945)|Operation Bishop]]]]\n\nA decrypted Japanese radio signal revealed that the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Haguro||2}} and the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kamikaze|1922|2}} were to steam from Singapore to Port Blair to evacuate the garrison there on the night of 12\u201313 May while another transport vessel would pick up the troops at Car Nicobar. On 9 May, a pair of British submarines spotted ''Haguro'' was it passed through the [[Malacca Strait]], so the East Indies Fleet launched [[Operation Dukedom]] to intercept the Japanese ships. ''Richelieu'' steamed with the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Cumberland|57|6}} as Group 3 of Force 61. Aware that Allied ships were at sea, ''Haguro'' and ''Kamikaze'' turned back, though they were spotted by aircraft from the escort carriers and then sunk by destroyers of the [[26th Destroyer Flotilla]] before ''Richelieu'' and ''Cumberland'' could arrive. Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet as it withdrew back to Trincomalee but were, once again, poorly coordinated and they failed to damage the ships. ''Richelieu'' arrived in port on 18 May.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=199}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=417}}\n\nOn arrival, the ship took on additional ammunition and fuel, and over the coming weeks, she underwent repairs to her boilers and took part in shooting practice. The bombardments carried out earlier in the year had revealed excessive dispersion of the main battery shells, particularly if both guns on one side of the turret were fired at the same time. The crew at that time was unable to determine the cause of the problem, though tests with the remanufactured ''Strasbourg'' charges reduced the problem. On 3 June, the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Le Triomphant||2}} arrived with spare equipment for ''Richelieu'', which was sent to [[Durban]] for another refit. Her hull again needed to be scraped and her boilers required a re-tubing. The ship had to stop in [[Diego-Suarez|Diego Suarez]] on the way to disembark non-white crewmen at the request of the racist government of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]; though this caused resentment among the crew, the French nevertheless complied. ''Richelieu'' arrived on 18 July and work lasted from 31 July to 10 August. Thirteen of the ship's 20&nbsp;mm guns were replaced with four 40&nbsp;mm guns, as the lighter weapons had proved to be ineffective against [[kamikaze]]s. The ship conducted training and trials of South Africa before departing for Diego Suarez, ultimately arriving back in Trincomalee on 18 August, by which time [[surrender of Japan|Japan had surrendered]].{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Sarnet & Le Vaillant|pp=325, 329}}\n\n=== Postwar era===\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, French and British forces began their attempts to reassert control in their Japanese-occupied colonies. On 7 September, ''Richelieu'' got underway in company with the British battleship {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} to take part in [[Operation Zipper]], the amphibious landing on Sumatra. Two days later, ''Richelieu'' detonated a magnetic mine, though she suffered only minor damage; the force of the blast pushed in some hull plates by {{cvt|10|to|12|cm}} and inflicted minor shock damage to the lighting system, but the vessel remained with the fleet. After landing the troops with no opposition, ''Richelieu'' moved to Singapore on 11 September to participate in [[Operation Tiderace]], the liberation of the city, the following day. She returned to Trincomalee on 16 September before getting underway again on 27 September, bound for Indochina. She steamed with ''Le Triomphant'' as escorts for the transport ships {{SS|Queen Emma||2}} and {{SS|Princess Beatrix||2}}, which carried French soldiers to restore colonial rule in Indochina. French rule was opposed by the [[Viet Minh]], and on arrival ''Richelieu'' was used to support the forces ashore in a variety of capacities: she served as a staging area, hospital, artillery support, and troop transport. She also contributed a landing party to the forces fighting to reassert French control.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Sarnet & Le Vaillant|pp=330\u2013334}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=429, 432}}\n\n''Richelieu'', ''Le Triomphant'', and ''Le Fantasque'' took part in [[Operation Mapor]] at [[Nha Trang]] from 20 to 26 November, providing heavy fire support to soldiers fighting in the area. By this time, a French squadron consisting of the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|B\u00e9arn||2}} and the cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Gloire|1935|2}}, {{ship|French cruiser|Suffren||2}}, and {{ship|French cruiser|\u00c9mile Bertin||2}} had arrived in mid-October, allowing ''Richelieu'' to be returned to France. Before leaving, ''Richelieu'' sent her four single 40&nbsp;mm guns and most of her 20&nbsp;mm guns ashore, along with a considerable stockpile of ammunition for the guns and 152&nbsp;mm shells. She departed on 29 December and arrived in Toulon on 11 February 1946, thereafter taking part in the transport effort to send French soldiers back from France to North Africa. With that completed, she steamed north to [[Cherbourg]], arriving to be dry-docked on 16 March. Repairs lasted until 20 July, and consisted of replacing the starboard propeller, correcting the hull damage from the mine in September 1945, and thoroughly overhauling her boilers.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=432}}\n\nWith the repairs completed, ''Richelieu'' sailed to Britain to carry the crew for the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Colossus|R15|6}}, which was to be loaned to the French for five years, serving as ''Arromanches''. ''Richelieu'' thereafter began a training cruise that included stops in Casablanca, Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, and Dakar. Later that year, she visited Portugal in company with ''Arromanches''. She returned to Brest for modifications to the secondary battery from February to March 1947. The ship thereafter formed the core of a battle group that included three ex-German destroyers, based in Cherbourg. The group, along with a carrier group centered on ''Arromanches'' and cruiser group, both based in Toulon, were combined to form the ''Force d'Intervention'', with ''Richelieu'' as the flagship of ''[[Vice Amiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Robert Jaujard]]. The unit embarked on a training cruise to Africa in May and June, beginning with the three groups assembling in Casablanca on 8 May. ''Richelieu'' arrived back in Cherbourg on 13 June and began a period of maintenance and training of new crew members. Another training cruise to North Africa followed late in 1947, and while there she conducted shooting practice to try to determine the cause of the excessive shell dispersion. The subsequent installation of 60-millisecond delays to the firing circuits of the outer guns in the turrets created enough space between the shells that they did not disrupt each other in flight, significantly improving the issue.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=201\u2013204}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=285\u2013289}}{{sfn|Dumas|pp=43, 74}}\n\nThe ''Force d'Intervention'' was reactivated for another cruise in early 1948; the three constituent groups rendezvoused at Toulon and then conducted training exercises off North Africa. While in Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, the ship was slightly damaged while being moored in the port. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers, the force was disbanded and ''Richelieu'' steamed north to Brest, arriving on 29 May. The ship was in need of a thorough refit, and she was dry-docked in Cherbourg from August to September to survey the work that would be needed to be done. Jaujard left the ship and her crew was reduced to 750&nbsp;men. Since the French naval budget was in a very limited state owing to the wrecked French economy in the immediate postwar years, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s refit was postponed to allow the funds to be used to complete ''Jean Bart'' instead. ''Richelieu'' was accordingly placed in reserve on 1 April 1949. The refit eventually began on 1 January 1950 and lasted until 24 October 1951, and it included a thorough overhaul of her propulsion machinery, replacement of her worn main and secondary battery guns, and repairs to her anti-aircraft battery, along with other modifications.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Canon Richelieu Brest.jpg|thumb|One of the two remaining 380 mm guns of ''Richelieu'', by the Penfeld river in [[Brest, France|Brest]]]]\n\nDuring the refit, it was decided that the ship's anti-aircraft battery was too dated to allow the ship to operate in the era of jet aircraft; coupled with the need to update the ship's radar and electronics and install more capable command spaces, the costs would have been prohibitively high for the French Navy. Instead of fully modernizing the vessel, the navy decided to employ ''Richelieu'' as a [[training ship]] in the gunnery school in February 1951. After completing the refit, the ship underwent trials in November that involved firing nine rounds per gun from the main battery; this would be the last time ''Richelieu'' fired the 380&nbsp;mm guns. Beginning in May 1952, the ship was based in Toulon as the flagship of ''CA'' Champion, and she spent the next few years conducting shooting practice with the secondary and smaller weapons to train the fleet's gunners. Another refit followed from October 1953 to February 1954. This involved replacing the British gunnery radar with a French-built set.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=205\u2013206}}\n\nFor the first and last time of either of their careers, ''Richelieu'' and ''Jean Bart'' cruised together on 30 January 1956. The ship's career as a sea-going gunnery ship ended in February, when she was [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] in Brest. To prepare ''Richelieu'' for [[reserve fleet|reserve]], dehumidifiers were installed in the secondary turrets to inhibit rust and the 100&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm quad mounts were covered. The single 40&nbsp;mm guns and all of the 20&nbsp;mm guns still aboard the vessel were removed. She was thereafter used as a stationary school ship for reserve officers and as a [[barracks ship|floating barracks]] until 30 September 1967, when she was struck from the [[naval register]]. Renamed ''Q432'', she was condemned on 16 January 1968 and sold to the Genoa-based [[ship breaker]] Cantieri Navali Santa Maria in September. Before departing Brest, her 380&nbsp;mm guns were removed and two were later preserved, one in Brest and the other in Ruelle. ''Richelieu'' was then towed to [[La Spezia]], where she was broken up for [[scrap]] over the course of the following year.{{sfn|Jordan &

Built as a response to the Italian {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|4}}, the ''Richelieu''s were based on their immediate predecessors of the {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|4}} with the same unconventional arrangement that grouped their [[main battery]] forward in two quadruple [[gun turret]]s. They were scaled up to accommodate a much more powerful [[main battery]] of eight [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|{{cvt|380|mm}} guns]] (compared to the {{cvt|330|mm}} guns of the ''Dunkerque''s), with increased armor to protect them from guns of the same caliber. ''Richelieu'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1935 and was [[ship launching|launched]] in 1939, just before the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe. As war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] became increasingly likely, work on the ship was rushed to prepare her for [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] in April 1940.\n\nCompleted just days before the Germans won the [[Battle of France]] in June, ''Richelieu'' fled to [[Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]] to keep her under French control. There, she came under repeated British attacks that had been intended to either compel the battleship to join the [[Free French Naval Forces]] or sink her; these included during [[Operation Catapult]] in July 1940 and the [[Battle of Dakar]] in September. Damaged in both attacks, the ship was slowly repaired before eventually being turned over to Free French control after the [[Operation Torch|Allied invasion of North Africa]] in November 1942. After being sent to the United States for repairs and an extensive modernization, the ship served with the British [[Home Fleet]] in early 1944 before being deployed to the [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]] for operations against the Japanese in the [[Indian Ocean]]. These included several bombardment operations and in May 1945 she was present during the [[Battle of the Malacca Strait]], though she was too far away to engage the Japanese ships before they were sunk.\n\n''Richelieu'' was part of the force that liberated [[Singapore]] following the [[Japanese surrender]] in September, and she thereafter operated in [[French Indochina]] as part of the initial effort to restore French colonial rule. Recalled to France in December 1945, she was repaired and modernized slightly in 1946. The ship saw relatively limited peacetime training in the immediate postwar years and in 1952, she was removed from active service for use as a gunnery [[training ship]]. In 1956, she was placed in [[reserve fleet|reserve]] and was thereafter used as a stationary training vessel and [[barracks ship]] until 1967, when the French Navy decided to discard her. Sold for [[scrap]] in 1968, she was [[ship breaking|broken up]] in Italy from 1968 to 1969.\n\n== Design==\n{{main|Richelieu-class battleship}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-1.jpg|left|thumb|Recognition drawing of ''Richelieu'' in her original configuration]]\n\nWhen in 1934 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] announced that it would begin building two {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|1}}s armed with {{cvt|380|mm}} guns, the [[French Navy]] immediately began preparations to counter them. The small {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|1}}s that had been ordered provided the template for the next French battleship design, but it needed to be scaled up to match the new Italian vessels, both in terms of offensive and defensive characteristics. The design staff considered 380 and {{cvt|406|mm|0}} guns, but the latter could not be incorporated in a design that remained within the {{cvt|35000|LT|MT|-1|lk=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and was quickly discarded. The ''Dunkerque''s carried their armament in two quadruple [[gun turret]]s arrayed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] forward of the [[superstructure]], and the designers experimented with other arrangements, including combinations of triple and twin turrets, but the need to minimize the length of the armor belt (and thus its weight) necessitated the ''Dunkerque'' layout.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=94\u201397}}\n\n''Richelieu'' displaced {{convert|37250|LT|MT|abbr=on}} [[Standard displacement|standard]] and {{convert|44698|MT|LT|order=flip}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|247.85|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33.08|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbines]] and six oil-fired Sural [[water-tube boiler]]s, which developed a total of {{convert|155000|shp|lk=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. At a cruising speed of {{convert|15|kn}}, the ship could steam for {{convert|9500|nmi|lk=in}}. Her crew numbered 1,569&nbsp;officers and men. The ship carried four [[Loire 130]] [[seaplane]]s on the [[quarterdeck]], and the aircraft facilities consisted of a steam [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] and a crane to handle the floatplanes.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|380 mm/45 Mod\u00e8le (Mle) 1935 guns]] arranged in two quadruple gun turrets,{{efn|/45 refers to the length of the gun in terms of [[caliber (artillery)|calibers]]; a /45 gun is 45 times long as it is in bore diameter.}} both of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of nine [[Canon de 152 mm Mod\u00e8le 1930|{{convert|152|mm|abbr=on|0}} /55 Mle 1930 guns]] mounted in three triple turrets, arranged on the rear superstructure. Heavy [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) defense consisted of twelve {{cvt|100|mm}} /45 Mle 1930 anti-aircraft guns in twin turrets. Close range anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of eight [[Canon de 37 mm Mod\u00e8le 1925|{{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] guns in twin mounts and twenty [[Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] machine guns in four quadruple and two twin mounts. The ship's [[belt armor]] was {{convert|330|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships, and the main battery turrets were protected by {{convert|430|mm|abbr=on}} of armor plate on the faces. The main armored deck was {{convert|170|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and the [[conning tower]] had {{convert|340|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=99}}\n\n== Service ==\n\n===Construction===\nThe contract for ''Richelieu'' was awarded to the [[Arsenal de Brest]] on 31 August 1935, and the [[keel]] for the new ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 22 October in the No. 4 dock that had recently built {{ship|French battleship|Dunkerque||2}}. The [[slipway]] was not long enough to accommodate the entire length of the new battleship, and so the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] had to be built in pieces. The main section of the hull, which amounted to {{cvt|197|m}}, was built on the slipway, while a {{cvt|43|m}} length of the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and an {{cvt|8|m}} length of her [[stern]] were built elsewhere and attached after the rest of the ship was [[ship launching|launched]] on 17 January 1939. The French decision to lay down ''Richelieu'' in 1935 put the country in violation of the Washington Treaty, which was to expire on 31 December 1936, as the combined tonnage of the two ''Dunkerque''s and ''Richelieu'' exceeded the {{cvt|70000|LT|MT}} that had been allotted to France during the moratorium on new battleship construction. France used the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which Britain had unilaterally signed with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in June 1935 to dismiss British objections to the new ship, though they nevertheless slowed construction of ''Richelieu'' to ease British concerns. Work was also slowed by [[Strike action|strikes]] in the shipyards for better pay and working conditions.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=260}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=98, 122}}\n\nBy the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the hull had been assembled; the start of the war led the naval command to decide to slow work on other, less complete vessels to focus efforts on ''Richelieu'' and her [[sister ship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1940|2}}. The ship began initial testing on 15 October while still [[fitting-out]] in an effort to rush the ship into service; the same day, the ship's first commander, [[Ship-of-the-line captain|''Capitaine de vaisseau'']] (''CV''\u2014Ship-of-the-line captain) Marzin came aboard. Engine testing began on 14 January 1940, and a week later her main battery was completed when the last barrel was installed. Further engine testing was carried out between 31 March and 7 April; during this period, she was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 April. Formal [[sea trial|acceptance trials]] began on 14 April. Repair work was conducted in [[Brest, France|Brest]] from 19 to 27 May, and fire control equipment for the main and secondary batteries were installed. ''Richelieu'' conducted full power trials on 13 June, reaching {{convert|32.63|kn}} from {{cvt|179000|shp}}, exceeding her design performance. Test firings of the guns were conducted on 13 and 14 June. Work on the ship was completed on 15 June 1940, days before France surrendered to Germany after the [[Battle of France]].{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\n===World War II===\n====Under Vichy control: 1940\u20131942====\nWith German troops advancing across France by mid-June, the Navy decided to evacuate ''Richelieu'' to [[Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]; while earlier plans had been to send the fleet to British ports to continue the war, when the possibility of a negotiated armistice arose, the government decided that the fleet would be a useful bargaining chip. As a result, vessels should be preserved under French control, away from German occupation. At 06:45, the ship took on a load of ammunition and fuel, though she received only 198&nbsp;quarter charges of propellant for her main battery, which amounted to powder sufficient for 49&nbsp;shots. Material that had not yet been installed was also hastily loaded onto the ship, to be fitted once ''Richelieu'' reached the safety of Dakar. She also took aboard gold reserves from the [[Bank of France]] and 250&nbsp;cadets from the ''[[\u00c9cole Navale]]'' (Naval Academy). There was insufficient time to allow the full complement to assemble and board the ship, and at 04:00 the next morning, ''Richelieu'' got underway while German troops approached Brest. ''Richelieu'' steamed in company with the [[destroyer]]s {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} while German aircraft made several ineffective attacks against the ships. The battleship's anti-aircraft guns returned fire without success. Initially cruising at a speed of {{cvt|22|kn}}, boiler trouble forced the ships to decrease speed to {{cvt|18|kn}}. The motors for her [[rudder]] also repeatedly broke down on the voyage, though the crew was able to repair them. While cruising off [[Casablanca]], [[French Morocco]] at 17:00 on 20 June, the torpedo boats were detached to refuel, their place being taken by the new destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Fleuret|1938|2}}. The two vessels then proceeded on to Dakar, where they arrived at 17:44 on 23 June.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=124\u2013125}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' in Dakar in 1940]]\n\nOn arriving in Dakar, an uneasy situation confronted ''Richelieu'' while armistice negotiations were still underway. The commander of French naval forces in the region, ''[[Contre-amiral]]'' (''CA''\u2014Rear Admiral) Plan\u00e7on and the [[governor-general]] of French West Africa, [[:fr:L\u00e9on Cayla|L\u00e9on Cayla]], were inclined to remain in the war against Germany. Also, significant British naval units were in the area, including the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} moored in Dakar and the British South Atlantic Squadron, which was nearby. At the same time, ''Richelieu'' had used half of her fuel to escape Brest, and she could perform little sustained firing of her main or secondary guns. Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]], sent a telegraph on the night of 23\u201324 June to warn Marzin that the British might attack the vessel to neutralize it in the event of a French surrender, and ordered him to begin preparations to [[scuttling|scuttle]] the ship if the need arose. Meanwhile, on 23 June, the British heavy cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} departed [[Freetown]] to observe ''Richelieu''{{'}}s activities in Dakar.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=125}}\n\nOn 25 June, Marzin received word that the French government had signed the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|Armistice with Germany]]. Darlan instructed him that the ship was to remain under French control, and if that proved to be impossible, he was to scuttle the ship or attempt to escape to the then-neutral United States. Marzin decided that, given the threat of British warships in the area, the best course of action was to try to escape to Casablanca and join the French fleet there, and so at 14:30 ''Richelieu'' got underway in company with ''Fleuret''. ''Hermes'' raised anchor as well and began to follow ''Richelieu'' with her [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s on her [[flight deck]], but the coastal artillery trained their guns on the ship, convincing ''Hermes''{{'}} commander to return to port. ''Dorsetshire'' nevertheless shadowed ''Richelieu'' while she was at sea. The next morning, Darlan, who feared that Marzin was trying to defect to the [[Free French forces]], ordered him to return to Dakar. Marzin complied and turned the ships back to port, but while on the way, he received amended orders instructing him to wait some {{cvt|120|nmi}} north of [[Cape Verde]] to escort the 1st Division of Armed Merchant Cruisers to Dakar, as they were carrying another load of gold reserves from the Bank of France. ''Richelieu'' failed to make contact at the prescribed rendezvous point, and since she had not embarked any of her floatplanes before fleeing Brest, she could not conduct an aerial search. Marzin instead returned to Dakar on 28 June; the convoy arrived, having been significantly delayed, on 4 July.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=29}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nAfter returning to port, work began to prepare the ship for action as quickly as possible. Marzin ordered that a stockpile of 330&nbsp;mm propellant charges that had been stocked for the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}} before France's surrender to be converted into charges that were usable by ''Richelieu''. The secondary guns were readied for action ten days later, but they lacked a director capable of tracking aerial targets, so they could be used against surface ships only. Under the terms of the armistice, ''Richelieu'' was to be returned to Toulon, where she would be demobilized, though the Germans later decided against permitting the move, as they feared the British would try to seize the ship during the passage through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]; the British, meanwhile, were under the mistaken impression that the Germans sought to seize the French fleet for their own use. This led to [[Operation Catapult]], a series of attacks on French warships to neutralize vessels that would not defect to the Free French.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=72, 126}}\n\n=====British attack on 8 July 1940 and repairs=====\n\n[[File:HMS Hermes June 1940.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Hermes'' (center) and ''Dorsetshire'' (background) off Dakar during the operation against ''Richelieu'']]\n\nThe component of Catapult that targeted ''Richelieu'' consisted of the carrier ''Hermes'', which joined the cruisers {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} and ''Dorsetshire'' off Dakar. On 4 July, the day after the British had [[attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|attacked Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]], Plan\u00e7on ordered the [[submarine]]s {{ship|French submarine|Le Glorieux||2}} and {{ship|French submarine|Le H\u00e9ros||2}} to attack ''Dorsetshire'' while it cruised off the port. He also instructed the coastal batteries to open fire if she closed to within {{cvt|15|km}}, though ''Dorsetshire'' remained at a distance. Marzin moved ''Richelieu'' to a position near the island of [[Gor\u00e9e]], pointed south so that the ship's main battery could aim at any vessels that approached Dakar. The British had intended to send [[Force H]] to Dakar after the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, but the need to return to destroy ''Dunkerque'' forced the British to resort to ''Hermes''; on 7 July, the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Milford|L51|6}} was sent to contact Plan\u00e7on and issue the ultimatum to either surrender his ship to British control or be sunk.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=126}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=32}}\n\nMarzin prepared his ship to sortie the next morning; he intended to use the eight rounds loaded in his main guns to attack ''Hermes''. Other forces in Dakar were put on alert and ''Le H\u00e9ros'' again sortied to assist in the attack. While the French preparations were ongoing, the British sent a motorboat from ''Milford'' to drop four [[depth charge]]s under ''Richelieu''{{'}}s stern to disable her screws, though this attempt failed. At 04:15, a group of Swordfish launched from ''Hermes'' as ''Richelieu'' was about to get underway. One of their torpedoes struck the ship aft on the [[starboard]] side and tore a hole that was {{cvt|9.3|by|8.5|m}} between the propeller shafts. The resulting shock disabled many of the ship's systems. Two of her fire control directors were knocked off their tracks, the starboard propeller shafts were bent, and the blast caused significant flooding. Damage control teams pumped fuel out of the bunkers to counteract the loss of buoyancy aft and the ship was towed into port for repairs. [[Anti-torpedo net]]s were set up around the vessel, which had taken on some {{cvt|2400|t|LT}} of water and at low tide rested on the harbor bottom.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=32}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=127}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nLater that afternoon, [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]] came alongside and began pumping oil out of the ship's bunkers to reduce her draft, but water continued to leak into the hull through the cable tunnels. Pumps attached to the ship helped to control the flooding, but the hoses repeatedly pulled loose as ''Richelieu'' rose and fell with the waves. To further complicate the effort to repair the ship, Dakar lacked a dry dock sufficient to accommodate ''Richelieu''; the battleship could not simply be drained and plated over. Instead, damaged [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] had to be patched and pumped out individually; by 28 August, some {{cvt|1300|t|LT}} of water remained aboard the ship. Heavy use of the pumps caused frequent breakdowns, which further slowed work. In his report on the attack and subsequent repairs, Marin criticized faulty design and construction practices that hindered damage control efforts, including insufficient pumping equipment, poor quality control for the welding of bulkheads, and a failure to ensure that critical components like the turret trunks were watertight.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=128, 137}}\n\nWhile work to control and reverse the flooding was ongoing, other repairs were necessary to return the ship to operational status. The fire-control directors needed to be re-seated in their tracks, wiring that had been damaged by flooding or leaking fuel oil had to be replaced, and several of the electrical generators, which had been badly shaken by the blast, needed to be rebuilt. Given the limited ability to repair the damage to the ship, Marzin focused efforts on ensuring that the main and secondary batteries could be effectively used, even if the ship could only be employed as a static [[floating battery]] against an expected second attack from British forces. ''[[Amiral]]'' (Admiral) [[Jean de Laborde]] flew to Dakar to conduct an inspection and help to organize the defenses. As part of these preparations, both Plan\u00e7on and Cayla, who were suspected of being pro-British, were removed from their posts, with Plan\u00e7on's place taken by ''CA'' Platon and then ''CA'' Landriau.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nWorkers in the local shipyard scavenged metal from other ships in the harbor to fabricate an {{cvt|11.5|m}} square patch to cover the torpedo hole, which was planned to be installed by 10 September. This would allow the rear [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] for the 152&nbsp;mm and 37&nbsp;mm guns to be drained. At the same time, the shipyard began building a steel [[cofferdam]] around the ship that was to have been completed by late October, which would allow the rest of the hull to be pumped dry. With the hull pumped out, permanent repairs were to have been completed by January 1941. While this work was being carried out, the crew cleaned and painted the ship and continued to work on readying the armament. A total of 150 complete charges for the main battery were created by remanufacturing the stockpile intended for ''Strasbourg''. Parts of the crew were dispersed for other tasks: 106 were sent to man the armed merchant cruisers in the harbor, whose reservist crews had to be demobilized, and the 64-man crew of the forward gun turret were sent to man the coastal battery at [[Cap Manuel]]. After another 132&nbsp;reservists from ''Richelieu'' were demobilized, a total of 1,039&nbsp;officers and men were left aboard the ship. The 100-, 37-, and 13.2&nbsp;mm guns were kept manned continuously given the threat of further British air attacks.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n=====Battle of Dakar=====\n[[File:HMS Barham FL1472.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Barham|04|6}}, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s primary opponent during the battle]]\n{{main|Battle of Dakar}}\n\nWhile repairs were being carried out in August, the British began preparations for another attack, code-named Operation Menace. British [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] sought to use a contingent of Free French forces led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] to invade the colony and seize the ship for use against Germany. By late August, a [[convoy]] had been assembled with five ships carrying weapons and supplies got underway, later rendezvousing with a second convoy of six [[troop ship]]s carrying some 2,400&nbsp;Free French soldiers and 4,270&nbsp;British soldiers. The naval support force consisted of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and the battleships {{HMS|Barham|04|2}} and {{HMS|Resolution|09|2}}, along with four cruisers and numerous other warships. The plan called for de Gaulle to use his French forces to attempt to secure the colony, only calling on British support if the Vichy forces resisted him. At the same time, several French colonies in Africa defected to Free France, prompting the Vichy government to secure authorization from the [[German Armistice Commission]] to send several [[light cruiser]]s and destroyers to reinforce their holdings in Africa, designated Force Y. Owing to the risk of encountering British vessels on the passage, the destroyers were temporarily left in Casablanca while the three cruisers, carrying supplies and additional men to crew the coastal batteries, raced south at high speed. They reached Dakar on 14 September, and after disembarking the men and supplies, continued on south to [[French Equatorial Africa]] (in what is now present-day Gabon).{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=139\u2013141}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}\n\nThe British believed that the arrival of Force Y indicated that the French were aware of Operation Menace, but de Gaulle decided to proceed with the attack regardless. While Force Y steamed south, two of the three cruisers were intercepted by British cruisers and forced to fall back to Dakar, arriving there again on 20 September, by which time the destroyers had arrived. On 22 September, the liner {{SS|Banfora}} was due to arrive with a load of 380&nbsp;mm shells, and as a result, French search aircraft were arrayed to the north to cover the liner's approach; they were completely surprised by the arrival of the Anglo-Free French force on the morning of 23 September. A small party of Free French troops sent to rally the port to de Gaulle was repulsed with machine-gun fire and ''Richelieu''{{'}}s 100&nbsp;mm guns fired warning shots toward the Free French [[aviso]] {{ship|French aviso|Savorgnan de Brazza||2}} shortly after 07:00. On the approach of the sloops {{ship|French sloop|Commandant Domin\u00e9||2}} and {{ship|French sloop|Commandant Duboc||2}} at 08:10, ''Richelieu'' again fired warning shots from her 100&nbsp;mm guns. The British warships approached the port and came under fire from the coastal batteries, leading the Anglo-Free French commanders, de Gaulle and Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]] to conclude that they would have to directly attack the port if the operation was to succeed.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=141}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=109\u2013114}}\n\n''Barham'' and ''Resolution'' opened fire on ''Richelieu'' at 11:05, but poor visibility hampered the British shooting and they checked fire after twenty minutes, having inflicted only splinter damage to the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Montcalm|1935|2}} and the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Le Malin||2}}. The French coastal batteries hit several of the cruisers and destroyers, but ''Richelieu'' was moored facing north, which prevented her from taking part in the initial duel. Following the British withdrawal, Marzin used [[tugboat]]s to turn the ship far enough to enable her to bring her main battery to bear. The defenses of Dakar now alerted, the Free French then attempted to land further east at [[Rufisque]], but the landing there was repulsed as well. The British and Free French withdrew to regroup for another attack the next day. Between 06:25 and 08:00 on 24 September, the British launched three strikes with Swordfish and [[Blackburn Skua]] bombers. These attacks scored no hits on ''Richelieu'' owing to poor visibility, though they made several near-misses that inflicted no damage. In return, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s gunners claimed three of the six aircraft that were shot down, and damaged another. An hour and a half later, the British battleships and two [[heavy cruiser]]s approached and took ''Richelieu'' under fire with their 380&nbsp;mm main batteries.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=141\u2013142}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\n''Richelieu'' returned fire at 09:40, but her No. 7 gun was destroyed by a shell that detonated in the barrel and the No. 8 gun was also badly damaged. This was first traced to the use of the remanufactured propellant from ''Strasbourg'', but during a later inquiry in 1941, it was determined that the explosions were caused by a flaw in the design of the shell base.{{sfn|Dumas|pp=77\u201378}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=143, 149}} Guns Nos. 5 and 6 remained in action but they failed to score any hits. At 09:57, one of ''Richelieu''{{'}}s secondary guns hit ''Barham'', though the British ships inflicted little damage in return, apart from minor splinter damage before breaking off at 10:07. During this period, the French counted some 160 shells that hit near the ship, but they did little damage. The French then laid smoke screens to obscure ''Richelieu'' before the British returned to the action at 12:53, initially targeting a destroyer before bombarding the port for the next half an hour. ''Richelieu'' was not struck in the barrage, during which at 12:56, she used guns 5 and 6 to engage the British cruisers, quickly straddling one of them and convincing them to disengage. She fired four 380&nbsp;mm shells at ''Barham'' at 13:11\u201313:12 but failed to hit with any, though both British battleships had been hit several times by the coastal batteries. After disengaging for the day, de Gaulle decided to abandon the operation, but Cunningham convinced him to allow a final attempt the next morning. In the meantime, Marzin decided to transfer the crews from turret 2 to turret 1, which also required moving the shells and propellant between magazines.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=143\u2013145}}{{sfn|Williams|p=140}}\n\nAs the British approached on the morning of 25 September, Marzin decided to engage ''Barham'' with his main battery and ''Resolution'' with his 152&nbsp;mm guns. While the British were approaching their bombardment positions, ''Richelieu'' shot down one of the reconnaissance planes shortly before 07:00. She opened fire at 09:04 with her main battery, firing two shots that fell short, and the coastal guns and Force Y cruisers followed suit shortly thereafter. While the British battleships were turning to unmask their rear guns, the submarine {{ship|French submarine|B\u00e9v\u00e9ziers|1935|2}} torpedoed and badly damaged ''Resolution''. ''Barham'' avoided the torpedoes and opened fire, quickly straddling ''Richelieu'' and at 09:15, she scored a hit [[amidships]] that penetrated above the side armor, though it caused no casualties. In return, ''Richelieu'' hit ''Barham'' in the bow, but it did little damage. At 09:25, the British disengaged to cover ''Resolution''{{'}}s withdrawal. After the British were gone, the gun crew attempted to clear the shells that had been loaded in guns 5 and 6 and the shell in No. 5 also exploded, leaving No. 6 the only operable gun in the turret. In total, French warships in the harbor lost 100&nbsp;dead and 182&nbsp;wounded, while another 84 were killed and 197 wounded among the civilian population.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=42}}{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=147}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=152\u2013154}}\n\nBeginning on 29 September, the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}} and escorting destroyers were detached from Force H to patrol off Dakar, as the British believed ''Richelieu'' would be transferred to [[metropolitan France]] for repairs. The British ships remained in the area until 1 October when it became clear that the ship would not be moved.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=43}}\n\n=====Repairs and defection to Free France=====\n[[File:Richelieu-3.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' at Dakar in 1941]]\n\nRepair work resumed immediately. The hit from ''Barham'' did little serious damage to the ship, but it nevertheless caused extensive deformation of interior bulkheads, the armor deck was forced down where the shell hit it, and the uptakes from the boilers were damaged. Wiring in the area was also cut by fragments and needed to be replaced. On 10 October, the workers attempted to attach the patch that had been manufactured, but it did not work; it did not create a watertight seal, which meant the compartments could not be pumped out. The patch was abandoned in the hopes that the cofferdam, then nearing completion, would work. The cofferdam was modeled to conform to the hull and was built with an interior void that could be used as a [[ballast tank]] so it could be floated in position and sunk in place. The cofferdam was ready by late December, which allowed the hull to be pumped dry and then sealed with welded plates and cement; the hull was finally sealed by 28 February 1941. Further repairs were hampered by the German Armistice Commission, which attempted to slow progress to prevent the ship from returning to full operational status. They blocked the shipment of new guns or a new propeller shaft, and severely constrained the transfer of other equipment. During this period, on 27 February, ''CV'' Deramond replaced Marzin as the ship's commander.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125, 147\u2013149}}\n\nAs repairs were carried out, the ship saw little activity through late 1942 apart from engaging unidentified aircraft on 28 July and 29 September 1941 and 26 February and 12 May 1942.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}} During this period, in April 1941, the ship received the first [[radar]] set installed on a French battleship. And in July, her Loire seaplanes finally arrived; tests with the catapults were conducted in October.{{sfn|Dumas|pp=34, 50}} On 10 April 1942, the ship conducted a test firing with gun No. 6 to demonstrate that the shell design problem had been corrected; all six shells were fired without incident. On 8 November, American and British forces landed in French North Africa (code-named [[Operation Torch]]), which prompted the Germans to invade the rest of Vichy France, which in turn led Darlan to defect to the Allies with the rest of the fleet.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}}\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] sent a group to evaluate the ships under Darlan's control to determine which should be modernized in the United States. The only French battleship still in service, ''Richelieu'' was an obvious candidate. The US Navy had not initially been interested in repairing ''Richelieu''; while the Germans and Italians retained a number of powerful battleships, the United States had recently commissioned or would soon complete eight fast battleships, more than sufficient to cover US requirements for the [[Pacific War]] and to send to Europe to reinforce the [[Royal Navy]]. In addition, repairing and modernizing a ship the size of ''Richelieu'' would require significant resources that could be used for other purposes. But pressure from Britain and the Free French convinced the Navy to agree to the project. For France, she was the only surviving modern battleship and thus a major symbol of national prestige, while the British had long sought to acquire the vessel to stiffen the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], which at that time had just two new battleships to oppose their three Italian counterparts.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=150, 181}}\n\n[[File:French battleship Richelieu in New York.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' in the United States for repairs]]\n\nShe ran sea trials from 25 to 29 January 1943 to evaluate the state of her engines, which had not been used since July 1940. Her aircraft facilities and anti-aircraft armament were removed during the evaluation period, as they would be replaced by US equipment. On 30 January, she departed Dakar with ''Montcalm'', bound for New York City, where both vessels would be modernized. ''Richelieu'' steamed at a speed of {{cvt|14|kn}} and her rudder had to be held to seven degrees to account for the hull deformation. The ships arrived on 11 February and on the 18th, ''Richelieu'' was taken into Dock No. 5 at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] to begin the modernization.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=150}}{{sfn|Dumas|pp=37, 50}}\n\n====Free-French career: 1943\u20131945====\n=====Refit in New York City=====\nPolitical tensions between the United States and France played a major role in determining how much ''Richelieu'' would be modernized. The US Navy refused to transfer the latest radar equipment on the basis that it was too sensitive to be released. As a result, much of the improvement was limited to the installation of a new anti-aircraft battery of the latest US weapons and auxiliary equipment in addition to a thorough overhaul and permanent repairs to the torpedo damage. Three shifts of workers, totaling some 2,000&nbsp;men, worked on the ship twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, for five months to rush the ship back into service. The modifications to the ship increased her displacement by about {{cvt|3000|t|LT}}. While the ship was being modernized, ''CV'' Lambert replaced Deramont as the ship's commander on 29 April.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=125, 181\u2013182, 186}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu Ney York.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' arrives in New York with her damaged turret. The uppermost fire control director on the fore tower had to be dismantled for her to pass under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the [[New York Navy Yard]]]]\n\nThe ship's armament required extensive repairs and modifications to bring ''Richelieu'' up to modern standards. First, three of the eight main battery guns had to be replaced, which required removing the turret roof. Since the gun cradles were undamaged, the guns were simply replaced by barrels taken from ''Jean Bart'', which had been recovered at Casablanca during Operation Torch. The shell handling equipment of both the primary and secondary guns was thoroughly overhauled, with wiring being replaced and the shell and propellant lifts being rebuilt\u2014the latter had never been made to function correctly while the ship was in Dakar. Ammunition for the primary and secondary guns was now a problem, as the source, factories in France, was occupied by German forces. Drawings of the plans for the 380&nbsp;mm shells were prepared in Dakar and forwarded to the United States, where a contract to produce 930&nbsp;shells was ordered from [[Crucible Industries|Crucible Steel]]. American 6-inch/47 Mk&nbsp;16 shells were used as a starting point to supply the 152&nbsp;mm guns, as they were the same caliber and required relatively minor modifications for use in the French weapons.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nHer 100&nbsp;mm guns were retained, but her light anti-aircraft battery now consisted of fifty-six [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{cvt|40|mm}} Bofors guns]] in quadruple mounts, all placed with their own Mk&nbsp;51 gun director. These were arranged with two abreast the superfiring turret, two on either side of the forward tower, another two per side of the aft tower, and the remaining four on the [[quarterdeck]], where the aircraft catapults had been. These guns were supplemented with fifty [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{cvt|20|mm}} Oerlikon cannons]], all in individual or twin mounts. Nine were placed on the [[forecastle]] aft of the [[Breakwater (ship)|breakwater]], four were mounted on the superfiring turret, nine were placed on the former aircraft hangar, with the rest dispersed around the superstructure, including on the towers and the shelter deck.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186\u2013188}}\n\n''Richelieu''{{'}}s tower foremast was heavily reconfigured; the upper main battery director (which had never been operational) had been removed to allow the ship to clear the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], was left off. In its place, the [[radome]] for the SF surface search radar was installed, along with the mattress antenna for the SA-2 [[air search radar]]; these were short-range sets that had been designed for small craft, the SA-2 intended for [[PT boat]]s. Most of the command spaces in the tower were converted for other uses. The fire control systems for the main battery had to be replaced and those for the secondary guns were repaired with new wiring and telephones. The ship's original [[Hermann Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe|Ansch\u00fctz]] [[gyrocompass]]es were replaced with [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] models. The ship's propulsion system was thoroughly overhauled: the turbines were thoroughly repaired and the boilers were re-tubed. Much of the wiring throughout the ship was replaced, and a [[degaussing]] cable was installed.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186, 188\u2013189}}\n\nTo repair the hull, the concrete was broken up and removed, the sections that had been most badly damaged by the torpedo were stripped of all fittings, and deformed bulkheads and plating were cut out. After more than two and a half years without being dry-docked in a tropical port, the hull needed maintenance beyond simply repairing the torpedo damage, though given the conditions to which it had been subjected, it was in fairly good condition. It was sandblasted and those sections of plating that exhibited pitting had new plates welded over top. The starboard propeller shafts also required repairs: the mounting brackets were straightened, but the inboard shaft was too badly damaged and had to be replaced. [[Bethlehem Steel]] fabricated a replacement that was installed in June. The bottom row of [[porthole]]s were closed off, as the increase in displacement pushed them closer to the waterline.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=182}}\n\nBeginning in late August and continuing into mid-September, ''Richelieu'' began firing trials in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]; firing the main battery forward on 29 August revealed the need for a blast screen to protect the forecastle 20&nbsp;mm guns, as the test accidentally destroyed two of the guns and their ammunition lockers. With her normal displacement now at {{cvt|43600|t|LT}} and her hull slightly bowed (possibly caused by the torpedo hit), ''Richelieu'' began machinery trials in late September. On 25 September, the ship reached her new top speed of {{cvt|31.5|kn}}, cruising at that speed for thirty minutes, despite the deformation of her hull and the significant increase in displacement. The following day, she steamed for six hours at {{cvt|26.5|kn}}, for two hours at {{cvt|28.9|kn}}, and finally for fifty minutes at {{cvt|30.2|kn}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=186, 188}}\n\nAs completed, the ship's displacement had grown to {{cvt|43957|t|LT}} normally and {{cvt|47728|t|LT}} fully loaded; draft correspondingly increased to {{cvt|9.22|m}} and {{cvt|10.68|m|0}}, respectively. Compared to her original wartime crew of 1,569&nbsp;officers and men, ''Richelieu'' was now to be manned by a total of 1,930, amounting to 86&nbsp;officers, 287&nbsp;[[petty officer]]s, and 1,557&nbsp;men. The major increase in complement was largely the result of the additional anti-aircraft guns and radar systems. The ship conducted further trials into October, and on the 14th the ship was finally ready to get underway for European waters.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=189}}\n\n=====In European waters=====\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A20935-colourised.jpg|left|thumb|Anti-aircraft gunners aboard ''Richelieu'' during target practice with the British fleet]]\n\nEscorted by the destroyers {{USS|Tarbell}} and {{USS|Ellet||2}}, ''Richelieu'' departed the US on 14 October, nominally bound for [[Gibraltar]]. The destroyers departed while underway, allowing ''Richelieu'' to keep up a speed of {{convert|24|kn}} in heavy seas. The ship stopped in the [[Azores]], Portugal, where she met the French destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Le Fantasque||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Le Terrible||2}} and the British destroyer {{HMS|Active|H14|2}}, which was limited to a speed of {{cvt|20|kn}}; ''Active'' quickly left the group, which proceeded not to Gibraltar, but to [[Mers El K\u00e9bir]]. There, she replenished supplies; it had been intended to deploy the ship with the Mediterranean Fleet, but Italy had surrendered in September, removing the threat posed by the Italian ''Littorio''-class battleships. ''Richelieu'' was instead sent north to join the [[Home Fleet]], which included the four surviving {{sclass-|King George V|battleship|1||1939}}s. When ''Richelieu'' departed the Mediterranean, Cunningham, now the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, recommended to the Admiralty that she be fitted with gunnery radars. The ship was escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Musketeer|G86|6}} and {{HMS|Scourge|G01|6}}, and on arrival in [[Scapa Flow]], Admiral [[Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape|Bruce Fraser]], the Home Fleet commander, inspected the battleship on 24 November. Work began immediately on installing a Type&nbsp;284 gunnery radar while the ship began an intensive period of training to acclimate the ship's crew to operating with British units.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=190}}\n\nThe ship saw little activity over the winter of 1943\u20131944 until February 1944, when she took part in [[Operation Posthorn]]. ''Richelieu'', the battleship {{HMS|Anson|79|2}}, and the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} departed Scapa Flow on 10 February for a raid on German shipping off occupied Norway. The objective was to lure the German heavy cruisers in the area so that the two battleships could destroy them. The carrier aircraft achieved little, sinking a single [[Cargo ship|freighter]] of 3,000&nbsp;tons and damaging a [[repair ship]] while trading one of the [[Supermarine Seafire]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] for a German [[Bf 109]] fighter. The fleet returned to port on the 12th, and ''Richelieu'' thereafter went to [[Rosyth]] for ten days to rest the crew. A repeat sweep was to have taken place at the end of the month, but two of the escorting destroyers collided while leaving Scapa Flow, leading to a postponement that became permanent as a result of bad weather. In March, the Allies determined that five battleships to counter the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} (which had been damaged in September 1943) was excessive. As a result, ''Richelieu'' was detached for other operations. The Allied command initially considered employing her to support the [[invasion of Normandy]], but as she was only supplied with armor-piercing shells, she was instead sent to reinforce the British [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]], along with a group of [[escort aircraft carrier]]s.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=190\u2013191}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=307, 313}}\n\nThe ship accordingly steamed to [[Greenock]] to take on fuel and ammunition, before cruising south to the Mediterranean with an escort of three British destroyers. She stopped in [[Algiers]] on 26 March to take on additional supplies; there, she was visited by General [[Henri Giraud]] and Admiral [[Andr\u00e9 Lemonnier]]. ''Richelieu'' thereafter departed for the [[Suez Canal]], steaming at a speed of {{cvt|25|kn}}; while underway, she began to experience significant boiler problems. The boiler blowers were not providing sufficient oxygen, so the boilers were not fully burning the fuel. As a result, the boiler tubes quickly became fouled and caused overheating. ''Richelieu'' stopped in [[Aden]] for repairs to the boiler tubes, but the problem was not corrected.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=192}}\n\n=====First deployment with the British Eastern Fleet=====\n[[File:Renown-9.jpg|thumb|left|''Richelieu'' (top left) with the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} (center) and the battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} (top right) during [[Operation Transom]] on 12 May 1944]]\n\nOn entering the [[Indian Ocean]], ''Richelieu'' picked up an escort consisting of the destroyers {{HMS|Rotherham||2}}, {{HMS|Racehorse|H11|2}}, and {{HMS|Quadrant||2}}. The four ships arrived in [[Trincomalee]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] on 10 April, where they joined an Allied fleet that included the carriers {{HMS|Illustrious|87|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, the battleships {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} and {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}}, and numerous cruisers and destroyers, commanded by Admiral [[James Somerville]]. On 16 April, the Eastern Fleet got underway for [[Operation Cockpit]], a diversionary raid to distract the Japanese while American forces [[Battle of Hollandia|landed at Hollandia]] in [[New Guinea]]. Somerville divided his fleet into two squadrons; ''Richelieu'' served in Force 69, the main element, with ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Valiant'', while ''Renown'' operated with the two carriers. The plan for Operation Cockpit called for carrier strikes on the port of [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]], [[Netherlands East Indies]]. The fleet arrived in position early on 19 April, and after the carrier aircraft struck the port, Japanese bombers counter-attacked and ''Richelieu'' engaged the aircraft with her 100&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm batteries.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=192\u2013193}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=319}}\n\nThe next major operation conducted by the Eastern Fleet, [[Operation Transom]], was timed to coincide with American operations in the Central Pacific to keep the attention of the Japanese fleet based in [[Singapore]] focused away from the American fleet. For this operation, the target was the major base at [[Surabaya]], which also had significant oil refinery facilities. The Eastern Fleet got underway on 7 May and stopped to refuel on 15 May before arriving two days later. The strike proceeded uneventfully for ''Richelieu'' and on 18 May the American contingent detached to rejoin the main American fleet in the Pacific while the Eastern Fleet returned to Trincomalee, arriving on 27 May. Two days later, ''Richelieu'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and six destroyers steamed to [[Colombo]] to rest their crews. While there, ''Richelieu'' was visited by Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], Supreme Allied Commander of the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South-East Asia Theatre]]. On 31 May, ''CV'' Merveilleux du Vignaux replaced Marzin as the ship's commander.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=193\u2013194, 199}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=204\u2013205}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=323}}\n\nSomerville planned another raid for mid-June: [[Operation Pedal]], a carrier attack on the harbor of [[Port Blair]] in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman Islands]]. The purpose of the attack was to again distract the Japanese fleet units in Singapore while American forces embarked on [[Operation Forager]], the invasion of the [[Marianas Islands]]. For the Anglo-French operation, Somerville took only the fast ships, including ''Richelieu'', ''Renown'', and ''Illustrious'' with their accompanying cruiser and destroyer screens. These ships, designated Force 60, sortied on 19 June and two days later, ''Illustrious''{{'}} aircraft struck Japanese targets in the port. The ships arrived back in Trincomalee on 23 June. [[Operation Crimson]] followed in July, and given the lack of a response from the Japanese fleet to the earlier raids, Somerville decided to use his battleships and battlecruiser to bombard Sabang and [[Sumatra]]. ''Richelieu'' and the other ships conducted shooting practice on 7, 14\u201315, and 17 July in preparation for the raid. The plan called for ''Richelieu'', ''Valiant'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and ''Renown'', supported by cruisers, to shell the port at longer range while the Dutch cruiser {{ship|HNMS|Tromp|1937|2}} led a group of destroyers in a close-range attack. ''Illustrious'', joined by the carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}, which had recently arrived, provided air cover to the fleet.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=194}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=206\u2013207, 209\u2013214}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=334, 344}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu from Saratoga May 1944.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' on 18 May 1944 after the conclusion of Operation Transom, taken from USS ''Saratoga'']]\n\nThe Eastern Fleet departed on 22 July and reached the target on the morning of 25 July; the carriers launched their [[combat air patrol]]s and the surface combatants steamed to approach their targets. ''Richelieu'' was the last vessel in the line, astern of ''Renown''. ''Queen Elizabeth'', the leading battleship, opened fire at 06:54 at a range of {{cvt|6000|m}}. The other ships quickly followed suit and [[F4U Corsair]] fighters circled overhead to spot for the ships' guns. ''Richelieu'' fired four-gun salvos, with two guns per turret, and she scored hits with the second salvo, demolishing several buildings and damaging the [[power station]]. Her secondary turrets neutralized a Japanese coastal artillery battery that had been engaging ''Tromp''. At 07:15, the ships ceased firing, and in the brief bombardment, ''Richelieu'' had fired 81&nbsp;main battery shells\u2014this amounted to a [[rate of fire]] of a salvo every 50&nbsp;seconds, nearly twice as fast as the British ships. Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet as it withdrew, but they were kept at bay by the carriers' fighters and heavy anti-aircraft fire from the ships. The fleet arrived back in Trincomalee on 27 July.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nBy this time, ''Richelieu'' was beginning to suffer from reduced speed, the result of continued boiler trouble and [[biofouling]] of her hull. Admiral [[Laurence E. Power]], who had replaced Somerville as the fleet commander, detached ''Richelieu'' for a refit. The British had initially offered the floating dry-dock ''AFD-28'', but Merveilleux du Vignaux believed that the dry-dock would not be able to accommodate a vessel the size of his ship (he proved to be correct when on 8 August, ''AFD-28'' nearly [[capsize]]d with ''Valiant'' aboard). ''Richelieu'' left on 6 September, bound for Algiers with three escorting destroyers. ''Le Terrible'' and ''Le Fantasque'' took over escort duties after ''Richelieu'' passed through the Suez Canal, and on 23 September the three ships arrived in Algiers. ''Richelieu'' then steamed north to Toulon on 1 October where she was visited again by Lemonnier, but the shipyard there was in ruins, so she moved to Casablanca on 10 October to be refitted. In addition to the hull cleaning and boiler repairs, she had new fire control and search radars installed, including a US SG-1 search radar, British Type-281B air search radar, and Type-285P fire control radars, in addition to other equipment, including an FV1 [[Radio jamming|jammer]] and [[high-frequency direction finding]] gear.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=195}}{{sfn|Lepotier|p=217}}\n\n=====Second deployment with the British Eastern Fleet=====\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A23486.jpg|thumb|Seen from the deck of {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} are ''Valiant'' (center-right) and ''Richelieu'' (right background)]]\n\nOn 23 January 1945, ''Richelieu'' left Casablanca for Gibraltar, arriving there two days later to have her hull cleaned and repainted. The French sought to deploy an independent task force consisting of ''Richelieu'', the four light cruisers still in service, and four destroyers, with a view toward reestablishing French control in [[Indochina]]. But the United States opposed the move and refused to allocate the necessary aircraft carriers and support ships that would have been necessary for another independent fleet, and so ''Richelieu'' could only be sent, alone, back to the Eastern Fleet. The ship conducted trials in February that revealed the problem with her boilers had finally been corrected and she thereafter got underway for Trincomalee, arriving on 20 March. By this time, the modern elements of the Eastern Fleet had been detached to form the [[British Pacific Fleet]], with the Eastern Fleet being renamed the East Indies Fleet. This unit, still under Power's command, consisted of ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Renown'', nine cruisers, ten [[escort carrier]]s, and twenty destroyers. Japanese naval strength at Singapore had also significantly decreased to just four heavy cruisers and several destroyers.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=196}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=195\u2013217}}\n\nFor the next few weeks, ''Richelieu'' was occupied with shooting drills with her primary and secondary batteries and tests for the anti-aircraft radars and command systems. Now assigned to Force 63 of the East Indies Fleet, ''Richelieu'' sortied on 8 April to take part in [[Operation Sunfish]], another bombardment of Sabang while aircraft scouted possible landing beaches near the city of [[Padang]] on the coast of Sumatra. The ships allocated for the operation consisted of ''Richelieu'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', two heavy cruisers, two escort carriers, and five destroyers. Early on 11 April, the two battleships, one of the cruisers, and three destroyers bombarded the island while the other vessels conducted the reconnaissance operation. ''Richelieu'' fired seven salvos with her main battery and used her secondary guns to once again silence the coastal battery on the island. Japanese aircraft launched a poorly-coordinated attack on the battleships but they failed to score any hits. After further carrier operations around Padang, the fleet returned to port on 20 April.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=197}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=408}}\n\nThe next major operation followed a week later. Operation Bishop, a strike against Japanese airfields in the [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] and [[Andaman Islands]], was to cover British Army landings at [[Rangoon]] in Burma. The plan called for the East Indies Fleet to be divided into multiple groups, each with escorting cruisers and destroyers: four of the escort carriers were to directly support the landings, ''Richelieu'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' each formed independent surface action groups, and another pair of escort carriers provided air protection for the surface groups. The fleet got underway on 27 April and reached [[Car Nicobar]] two days later. ''Richelieu'' bombarded the airfields at a range of {{cvt|23600|m}}, firing a total of 80&nbsp;main and 45&nbsp;secondary shells. She incurred minor damage to her bow 20&nbsp;mm guns from the blast effects of firing the main battery nearly directly forward. The fleet then proceeded to the Andamans, and at 17:30, ''Richelieu'' opened fire at Port Blair; poor visibility hampered her shooting, and she ceased fire at 18:07, by now having expended the main battery ammunition that had been allotted for the bombardment. She nevertheless returned on 2 May to shell the harbor with her secondary guns, firing 120&nbsp;rounds and inflicting significant damage to the harbor facilities. The fleet steamed north to Rangoon to support the landings, but it was discovered that the Japanese had already withdrawn, allowing the fleet to return to Trincomalee on 8 May.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=198\u2013199}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=412}}\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A23483 cropped.jpg|thumb|''Richelieu'' astern of ''Valiant'' during [[Operation Bishop (1945)|Operation Bishop]]]]\n\nA decrypted Japanese radio signal revealed that the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Haguro||2}} and the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kamikaze|1922|2}} were to steam from Singapore to Port Blair to evacuate the garrison there on the night of 12\u201313 May while another transport vessel would pick up the troops at Car Nicobar. On 9 May, a pair of British submarines spotted ''Haguro'' was it passed through the [[Malacca Strait]], so the East Indies Fleet launched [[Operation Dukedom]] to intercept the Japanese ships. ''Richelieu'' steamed with the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Cumberland|57|6}} as Group 3 of Force 61. Aware that Allied ships were at sea, ''Haguro'' and ''Kamikaze'' turned back, though they were spotted by aircraft from the escort carriers and then sunk by destroyers of the [[26th Destroyer Flotilla]] before ''Richelieu'' and ''Cumberland'' could arrive. Japanese aircraft attacked the fleet as it withdrew back to Trincomalee but were, once again, poorly coordinated and they failed to damage the ships. ''Richelieu'' arrived in port on 18 May.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=199}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=417}}\n\nOn arrival, the ship took on additional ammunition and fuel, and over the coming weeks, she underwent repairs to her boilers and took part in shooting practice. The bombardments carried out earlier in the year had revealed excessive dispersion of the main battery shells, particularly if both guns on one side of the turret were fired at the same time. The crew at that time was unable to determine the cause of the problem, though tests with the remanufactured ''Strasbourg'' charges reduced the problem. On 3 June, the destroyer {{ship|French destroyer|Le Triomphant||2}} arrived with spare equipment for ''Richelieu'', which was sent to [[Durban]] for another refit. Her hull again needed to be scraped and her boilers required a re-tubing. The ship had to stop in [[Diego-Suarez|Diego Suarez]] on the way to disembark non-white crewmen at the request of the racist government of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]; though this caused resentment among the crew, the French nevertheless complied. ''Richelieu'' arrived on 18 July and work lasted from 31 July to 10 August. Thirteen of the ship's 20&nbsp;mm guns were replaced with four 40&nbsp;mm guns, as the lighter weapons had proved to be ineffective against [[kamikaze]]s. The ship conducted training and trials of South Africa before departing for Diego Suarez, ultimately arriving back in Trincomalee on 18 August, by which time [[surrender of Japan|Japan had surrendered]].{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Sarnet & Le Vaillant|pp=325, 329}}\n\n=== Postwar era===\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, French and British forces began their attempts to reassert control in their Japanese-occupied colonies. On 7 September, ''Richelieu'' got underway in company with the British battleship {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} to take part in [[Operation Zipper]], the amphibious landing on Sumatra. Two days later, ''Richelieu'' detonated a magnetic mine, though she suffered only minor damage; the force of the blast pushed in some hull plates by {{cvt|10|to|12|cm}} and inflicted minor shock damage to the lighting system, but the vessel remained with the fleet. After landing the troops with no opposition, ''Richelieu'' moved to Singapore on 11 September to participate in [[Operation Tiderace]], the liberation of the city, the following day. She returned to Trincomalee on 16 September before getting underway again on 27 September, bound for Indochina. She steamed with ''Le Triomphant'' as escorts for the transport ships {{SS|Queen Emma||2}} and {{SS|Princess Beatrix||2}}, which carried French soldiers to restore colonial rule in Indochina. French rule was opposed by the [[Viet Minh]], and on arrival ''Richelieu'' was used to support the forces ashore in a variety of capacities: she served as a staging area, hospital, artillery support, and troop transport. She also contributed a landing party to the forces fighting to reassert French control.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Sarnet & Le Vaillant|pp=330\u2013334}}{{sfn|Rohwer|pp=429, 432}}\n\n''Richelieu'', ''Le Triomphant'', and ''Le Fantasque'' took part in [[Operation Mapor]] at [[Nha Trang]] from 20 to 26 November, providing heavy fire support to soldiers fighting in the area. By this time, a French squadron consisting of the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|B\u00e9arn||2}} and the cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Gloire|1935|2}}, {{ship|French cruiser|Suffren||2}}, and {{ship|French cruiser|\u00c9mile Bertin||2}} had arrived in mid-October, allowing ''Richelieu'' to be returned to France. Before leaving, ''Richelieu'' sent her four single 40&nbsp;mm guns and most of her 20&nbsp;mm guns ashore, along with a considerable stockpile of ammunition for the guns and 152&nbsp;mm shells. She departed on 29 December and arrived in Toulon on 11 February 1946, thereafter taking part in the transport effort to send French soldiers back from France to North Africa. With that completed, she steamed north to [[Cherbourg]], arriving to be dry-docked on 16 March. Repairs lasted until 20 July, and consisted of replacing the starboard propeller, correcting the hull damage from the mine in September 1945, and thoroughly overhauling her boilers.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Rohwer|p=432}}\n\nWith the repairs completed, ''Richelieu'' sailed to Britain to carry the crew for the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Colossus|R15|6}}, which was to be loaned to the French for five years, serving as ''Arromanches''. ''Richelieu'' thereafter began a training cruise that included stops in Casablanca, Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, and Dakar. Later that year, she visited Portugal in company with ''Arromanches''. She returned to Brest for modifications to the secondary battery from February to March 1947. The ship thereafter formed the core of a battle group that included three ex-German destroyers, based in Cherbourg. The group, along with a carrier group centered on ''Arromanches'' and cruiser group, both based in Toulon, were combined to form the ''Force d'Intervention'', with ''Richelieu'' as the flagship of ''[[Vice Amiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Robert Jaujard]]. The unit embarked on a training cruise to Africa in May and June, beginning with the three groups assembling in Casablanca on 8 May. ''Richelieu'' arrived back in Cherbourg on 13 June and began a period of maintenance and training of new crew members. Another training cruise to North Africa followed late in 1947, and while there she conducted shooting practice to try to determine the cause of the excessive shell dispersion. The subsequent installation of 60-millisecond delays to the firing circuits of the outer guns in the turrets created enough space between the shells that they did not disrupt each other in flight, significantly improving the issue.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=201\u2013204}}{{sfn|Lepotier|pp=285\u2013289}}{{sfn|Dumas|pp=43, 74}}\n\nThe ''Force d'Intervention'' was reactivated for another cruise in early 1948; the three constituent groups rendezvoused at Toulon and then conducted training exercises off North Africa. While in Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, the ship was slightly damaged while being moored in the port. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers, the force was disbanded and ''Richelieu'' steamed north to Brest, arriving on 29 May. The ship was in need of a thorough refit, and she was dry-docked in Cherbourg from August to September to survey the work that would be needed to be done. Jaujard left the ship and her crew was reduced to 750&nbsp;men. Since the French naval budget was in a very limited state owing to the wrecked French economy in the immediate postwar years, ''Richelieu''{{'}}s refit was postponed to allow the funds to be used to complete ''Jean Bart'' instead. ''Richelieu'' was accordingly placed in reserve on 1 April 1949. The refit eventually began on 1 January 1950 and lasted until 24 October 1951, and it included a thorough overhaul of her propulsion machinery, replacement of her worn main and secondary battery guns, and repairs to her anti-aircraft battery, along with other modifications.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Canon Richelieu Brest.jpg|thumb|One of the two remaining 380 mm guns of ''Richelieu'', by the Penfeld river in [[Brest, France|Brest]]]]\n\nDuring the refit, it was decided that the ship's anti-aircraft battery was too dated to allow the ship to operate in the era of jet aircraft; coupled with the need to update the ship's radar and electronics and install more capable command spaces, the costs would have been prohibitively high for the French Navy. Instead of fully modernizing the vessel, the navy decided to employ ''Richelieu'' as a [[training ship]] in the gunnery school in February 1951. After completing the refit, the ship underwent trials in November that involved firing nine rounds per gun from the main battery; this would be the last time ''Richelieu'' fired the 380&nbsp;mm guns. Beginning in May 1952, the ship was based in Toulon as the flagship of ''CA'' Champion, and she spent the next few years conducting shooting practice with the secondary and smaller weapons to train the fleet's gunners. Another refit followed from October 1953 to February 1954. This involved replacing the British gunnery radar with a French-built set.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=205\u2013206}}\n\nFor the first and last time of either of their careers, ''Richelieu'' and ''Jean Bart'' cruised together on 30 January 1956. The ship's career as a sea-going gunnery ship ended in February, when she was [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] in Brest. To prepare ''Richelieu'' for [[reserve fleet|reserve]], dehumidifiers were installed in the secondary turrets to inhibit rust and the 100&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm quad mounts were covered. The single 40&nbsp;mm guns and all of the 20&nbsp;mm guns still aboard the vessel were removed. She was thereafter used as a stationary school ship for reserve officers and as a [[barracks ship|floating barracks]] until 30 September 1967, when she was struck from the [[naval register]]. Renamed ''Q432'', she was condemned on 16 January 1968 and sold to the Genoa-based [[ship breaker]] Cantieri Navali Santa Maria in September. Before departing Brest, her 380&nbsp;mm guns were removed and two were later preserved, one in Brest and the other in Ruelle. ''Richelieu'' was then towed to [[La Spezia]], where she was broken up for [[scrap]] over the course of the following year.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=206}}{{sfn|Dumas|p=60}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n===Notes===\n\n{{notes}}\n\n===Citations===\n\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite book\n  |last=Dumas\n  |first=Robert\n  |title=Le cuirass\u00e9 Richelieu 1935\u20131968\n  |language=fr\n  |trans-title=The Battleship Richelieu 1935\u20131968\n  |year=2001\n  |publisher=Marines \u00e9dition\n  |location=Nantes\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Dumas}}\n  |oclc=248848350\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | editor1-last = Gardiner\n  | editor1-first = Robert\n  | editor2-last = Chesneau\n  | editor2-first = Roger\n  | year = 1980\n  | title = Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1922\u20131946\n  | location = Annapolis\n  | publisher = Naval Institute Press\n  | isbn = 978-0-87021-913-9\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Gardiner & Chesneau}}\n  | lastauthoramp = y\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last1=Jordan\n  |first1=John\n  |last2=Dumas\n  |first2=Robert\n  |title=French Battleships 1922\u20131956\n  |publisher=Seaforth Punblishing\n  |isbn=978-1-84832-034-5\n  |year=2009\n  |location=Barnsley\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Jordan & Dumas}}\n  | lastauthoramp = y\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last=Lepotier\n  |first= Adolphe\n  |language=fr\n  |title= Les Derniers Cuirass\u00e9s\n  |trans-title=The Last Battleships\n  |year=1967\n  |publisher=\u00c9ditions France-Empire\n  |location=Paris\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Lepotier}}\n  |oclc=491030583\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Rohwer\n  | first = J\u00fcrgen\n  | year = 2005\n  | title = Chronology of the War at Sea 1939\u20131945 \u2013 The Naval History of World War Two\n  | publisher = Chatham Publishing\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 978-1-59114-119-8\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Rohwer}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |language=fr\n  |title=Richelieu\n  |last1=Sarnet\n  |first1=Ren\u00e9\n  |last2=Le Vaillant\n  |first2=Eric\n  |year=1997\n  |publisher=Marines \u00e9dition\n  |location=Nantes\n  |isbn=978-2-909675-32-9\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Sarnet & Le Vaillant}}\n  | lastauthoramp = y\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last=Williams\n  |first=John\n  |title=The Guns of Dakar: September 1940\n  |year=1976 \n  |location=London\n  |publisher=William Heinemann Ltd\n  |isbn=978-0-434-86630-4\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Williams}}\n  }}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|Richelieu (ship, 1939)}}\n* * [http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/france/battleships/richelieu/richelieu.htm Maritimequest Richelieu Photo Gallery]\n\n{{Richelieu class battleship}}\n{{WWIIFrenchShips}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Richelieu (1939)}}\n[[Category:Richelieu-class battleships]]\n[[Category:World War II battleships of France]]\n[[Category:Cold War battleships of France]]\n[[Category:Ships built in France]]\n[[Category:1939 ships]]\n", "name_user": "Piggs mcginty", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRefit in New York City", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_battleship_Richelieu"}

Spoken as a [[first language]] by around two million people, it serves as the official language of [[North Macedonia]]. Most speakers can be found in the country and [[Macedonian diaspora|its diaspora]], with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Macedonian is also a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] and spoken by emigrant communities predominantly in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\nMacedonian developed out of the western dialects of the East South Slavic [[dialect continuum]], whose earliest recorded form is \"[[Old Church Slavonic]]\". During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called \"Bulgarian\" although in the 19th century the western dialects came to be known separately as \"Macedonian\". [[Standard Macedonian]] was codified in 1945 and has developed [[Macedonian literature#Modern literature|modern literature]] since.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Harvnb|Thornburg|Fuller|2006|page=213}}</ref> As it is part of a dialect continuum with other [[South Slavic language]]s, Macedonian has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]]. \n\nLinguists distinguish 29 [[dialects of Macedonian]], with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of [[Macedonian grammar]] are the use of a dynamic [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed [[deixis|deictic articles]] that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and several simple and complex verb tenses. [[Macedonian orthography]] is phonemic with a correspondence of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the [[Cyrillic script]] with several original letters. Macedonian syntax is of the [[subject-object-verb]] (SOV) type and has flexible [[word order]].\n\nMacedonian vocabulary has been historically influenced by [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Somewhat less prominent vocabulary influences also came from neighboring and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige languages]]. Since Macedonian and Bulgarian are mutually intelligible and socio-historically related, some [[political views on the Macedonian language|linguists are divided in their views]] of the two as separate languages or as a single [[pluricentric language]].\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|left|alt=Language-tree graph|Classification of Macedonian within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family]]\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the [[East South Slavic languages|eastern group]] of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] branch of [[Slavic languages]] in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, together with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Some authors also classify the [[Torlakian dialects]] in this group.

standardization process of the Macedonian language, the dialectal base selected was primarily based on the West-Central dialects, which spans the triangle of the communities [[Makedonski Brod]], [[Ki\u010devo]], [[Demir Hisar (town)|Demir Hisar]], [[Bitola]], [[Prilep]], and [[Veles]]. These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in Krste Petkov Misirkov's works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighboring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref name=\"Dedaic13\">{{Harvnb|Dedai\u0107|Mi\u0161kovi\u0107-Lukovi\u0107|2010|page=13}}</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups. The boundary between them geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and [[Crna River (Vardar)|Crna]].<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonant pronunciation occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

For the pronunciation of the middle vowels /''\u0435''/ and /''\u043e''/ by native Macedonian speakers, various vowel sounds can be produced ranging from [\u025b] to [\u1eb9] and from [o] to [\u1ecd]. Unstressed vowels are not [[vowel reduction|reduced]], although they are pronounced more weakly and shortly than stressed ones, especially if they are found in a stressed syllable.{{sfn|Friedman|1998|p=252}}<ref name=\"gramatika\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001}}</ref> The five vowels and the letter ''\u0440'' (/r/) which acts as a [[semivowel]] when found between two consonants (e.g. ''\u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430'', \"church\"), can be syllable-forming.<ref name=\"usikova111\" /> \n\nThe [[schwa]] is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to {{IPAblink|\u028c}} or {{IPAblink|\u0268}}) but its use in the standard language is marginal.<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\"/> When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an [[apostrophe]] is used; for example, {{angbr|\u043a\u2019\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442}}, {{angbr|\u0441\u2019\u043d\u0446\u0435}}, etc. When spelling words letter-by-letters, each consonant is followed by the schwa sound. The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}). The lexicalized acronyms {{angbr|[[USSR|\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]]}} ({{IPA|[\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025br]}}) and {{angbr|\u041c\u0422}} ({{IPA|[\u025bm.t\u025b]}}) (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions. [[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'. The sequence {{IPA|/aa/}} is often realized phonetically as {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}; e.g. {{angbr|\u0441\u0430\u0430\u0442}} {{IPA|/saat/}} {{IPA|[sa\u02d0t]}} '''colloq.'' hour', {{angbr|\u0437\u043c\u0438\u0438}} - snakes. In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/\u026b/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|\u045a\u0443\u0442\u043d}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0272utn\u0329]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u043b}} {{IPA|[p\u0254p\u0254ka\u02c8t\u025bp\u025bt\u026b\u0329]}} '[[Popocat\u00e9petl]]', etc. The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[\u0271]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0458}} {{IPA|[\u02c8tra\u0271vaj]}} '[[tram]]').

The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels. [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: ''\u0434\u00e9\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8d\u025bt\u025b]}}: child), ''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8majka]}}): mother) and ''\u0442\u00e1\u0442\u043a\u043e'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8tatk\u0254]}}: father).

The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]]. Macedonian distinguishes at least 12 major [[part of speech|word classes]], five of which are modifiable and include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers and verbs and seven of which are non-modifiable and include [[adverb]]s, prepositions, connectors, [[interjection]]s, particles and modal words.<ref name=\"opsta\" /> \n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{Harvnb|Bogdanoska|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills). Irregular plural forms also exist in the language: ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 - \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'' (child - children).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Definiteness====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+The definite articles\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" |\n!colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n!colspan=\"3\" | Plural\n|-\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n|-\n!Unspecified\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0442''''' \n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0442\u0430''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0442\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0442\u0435''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0442\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Proximate\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0432'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0432o'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''\n|  ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Distal\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u043d'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043do'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n|}\n\nA characteristic feature of the nominal system is the indication of [[definiteness]]. As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives accompany nouns and serve to provide additional information about their referents. Macedonian adjectives [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify and are thus are thus inflected for gender, number and definiteness and  ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432'' changes to ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'', a beautiful woman) when used to describe a feminine noun, ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e'' when used to describe a neuter noun (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', a beautiful childd) and ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438'' when used to form the plural (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'').<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nAdjectives can be analytically inflected for degree of [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] with the prefix ''\u043f\u043e-'' marking the [[comparative]] and the prefix ''\u043d\u0430\u0458-'' marking the [[superlative]].

Case relations are marked in pronouns. Personal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative]] and [[conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long).

Spoken as a [[first language]] by around two million people, it serves as the official language of [[North Macedonia]]. Most speakers can be found in the country and [[Macedonian diaspora|its diaspora]], with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Macedonian is also a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] and spoken by emigrant communities predominantly in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\nMacedonian developed out of the western dialects of the East South Slavic [[dialect continuum]], whose earliest recorded form is \"[[Old Church Slavonic]]\". During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called \"Bulgarian\" although in the 19th century the western dialects came to be known separately as \"Macedonian\". [[Standard Macedonian]] was codified in 1945 and has developed [[Macedonian literature#Modern literature|modern literature]] since.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Harvnb|Thornburg|Fuller|2006|page=213}}</ref> As it is part of a dialect continuum with other [[South Slavic language]]s, Macedonian has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]]. \n\nLinguists distinguish 29 [[dialects of Macedonian]], with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of [[Macedonian grammar]] are the use of a dynamic [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed [[deixis|deictic articles]] that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and several simple and complex verb tenses. [[Macedonian orthography]] is phonemic with a correspondence of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the [[Cyrillic script]] with several original letters. Macedonian syntax is of the [[subject-object-verb]] (SOV) type and has flexible [[word order]].\n\nMacedonian vocabulary has been historically influenced by [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Somewhat less prominent vocabulary influences also came from neighboring and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige languages]]. Since Macedonian and Bulgarian are mutually intelligible and socio-historically related, some [[political views on the Macedonian language|linguists are divided in their views]] of the two as separate languages or as a single [[pluricentric language]].\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|left|alt=Language-tree graph|Classification of Macedonian within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family]]\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the [[East South Slavic languages|eastern group]] of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] branch of [[Slavic languages]] in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, together with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]].

The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels.

Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms or the future particle ''\u045c\u0435'' are used in-between (''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u043c\u0443  \u035c  \u0458\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435'', did not give it to him; ''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u045c\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he will not come).<ref name=\"matura\" /> Other uses include the [[imperative form]] accompanied by short pronoun forms (''\u0434\u00e1\u0458  \u035c  \u043c\u0438'': give me), the expression of possessives (''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430  \u035c  \u043c\u0438''), prepositions followed by a noun (''\u0437\u00e1\u0434  \u035c  \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430''), question words followed by verbs (''\u043a\u043e\u0433\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435''), some compound nouns (''\u0441\u0443\u0432\u00f3  \u035c  \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0458\u0435'' - raisins, ''\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u00f3  \u035c  \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e'' - yoghurt) and others.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic [[case system]]. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]]. Macedonian distinguishes at least 12 major [[part of speech|word classes]], five of which are modifiable and include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers and verbs and seven of which are non-modifiable and include [[adverb]]s, prepositions, connectors, [[interjection]]s, particles and modal words.<ref name=\"opsta\" /> \n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{Harvnb|Bogdanoska|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills). Irregular plural forms also exist in the language: ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 - \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'' (child - children).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Definiteness====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+The definite articles\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" |\n!colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n!colspan=\"3\" | Plural\n|-\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n|-\n!Unspecified\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0442''''' \n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0442\u0430''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0442\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0442\u0435''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0442\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Proximate\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0432'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0432o'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''\n|  ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Distal\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u043d'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043do'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n|}\n\nA characteristic feature of the nominal system is the indication of [[definiteness]]. As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives accompany nouns and serve to provide additional information about their referents. Macedonian adjectives [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify and are thus are thus inflected for gender, number and definiteness and  ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432'' changes to ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'', a beautiful woman) when used to describe a feminine noun, ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e'' when used to describe a neuter noun (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', a beautiful childd) and ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438'' when used to form the plural (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'').<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nAdjectives can be analytically inflected for degree of [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] with the prefix ''\u043f\u043e-'' marking the [[comparative]] and the prefix ''\u043d\u0430\u0458-'' marking the [[superlative]].

Case relations are marked in pronouns. Personal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

These pronouns are inflected for gender and number and other word forms can be derived from them (''\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0458'' - nobody, ''\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - something, ''\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458'' - everybody's). There are three groups of demonstrative pronouns that can indicate proximate (''\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0458'' - this one (mas.)), distal (''\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0430'' - the one there (fem.)) and unspecific (''\u0442\u043e\u0430'' - that one (neut.)) objects.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative]] and [[conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax and prepositions===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''
