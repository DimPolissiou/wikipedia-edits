{"title_page": "Constituent (linguistics)", "text_new": "In [[syntax|syntactic]] analysis, a '''constituent''' is a word or a group of words that functions as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\nConstituency tests can be grouped in one of two ways, namely in terms of how widely used they (i.e. their relative frequency) or in terms of which constituent they they test for.\n\n==Tests grouped how commonly used they are in English==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Coordination===\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n===Proform substitution (replacement)===\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Topicalization (fronting)===\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===''Do-so''-substitution===\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.   \n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n===''One''-substitution===\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n===Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)===\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Clefting===\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers. \n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===VP-ellipsis (verb phrase ellipsis)===\nThe VP-ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n===Pseudoclefting===\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n===Passivization===\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n===Omission (deletion)===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n===Intrusion===\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n===Wh-fronting===\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents.\n\n===General substitution===\nThe general substitution test replaces the test string with some other word or phrase.<ref>For examples of the general substitution test, see Allerton 1979: 113; Brown and Miller 1980: 38; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 11; Radford 1988: 89\u201391; Moravcsik 2006: 123\u20134; Culicover 2009: 37; Quirk et al. 2010: 41; M\u00fcller 2016: 7\u20138.</ref> It is similar to proform substitution, the only difference being that the replacement word or phrase is not a proform, e.g. \n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. There is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents, e.g. \n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. This is contrary to what the other tests reveal and to what most theories of sentence structure assume. The value of general substitution as test for constituents is therefore suspect. It is like the coordination test in that it suggests that too many strings are constituents.\n\n===Right node raising (RNR)===\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''. \n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be. \n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''. \n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n==Tests grouped in terms of how they test for the constituent ==\n\n=== Deletion tests ===\nDeletion tests includes ellipsis and answer-fragments.\n\n=== Substitution tests ===\nSubstitution tests include: general substitution, coordination, pro-form substitution, VP substitution (with do so), and NP substitution (with one).\n\n=== Displacements tests ===\nDisplacements tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, heavy shift, passivization, and intrusion.\n\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\nConstituency tests can be grouped in one of two ways, namely in terms of how widely used they (i.e. their relative frequency) or in terms of which constituent they they test for.\n\n==Constituency tests grouped by frequency==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Coordination===\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n===Proform substitution (replacement)===\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Topicalization (fronting)===\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===''Do-so''-substitution===\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.   \n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n===''One''-substitution===\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n===Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)===\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Clefting===\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers. \n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===VP-ellipsis (verb phrase ellipsis)===\nThe VP-ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n===Pseudoclefting===\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n===Passivization===\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n===Omission (deletion)===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n===Intrusion===\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n===Wh-fronting===\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents.\n\n===General substitution===\nThe general substitution test replaces the test string with some other word or phrase.<ref>For examples of the general substitution test, see Allerton 1979: 113; Brown and Miller 1980: 38; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 11; Radford 1988: 89\u201391; Moravcsik 2006: 123\u20134; Culicover 2009: 37; Quirk et al. 2010: 41; M\u00fcller 2016: 7\u20138.</ref> It is similar to proform substitution, the only difference being that the replacement word or phrase is not a proform, e.g. \n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. There is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents, e.g. \n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. This is contrary to what the other tests reveal and to what most theories of sentence structure assume. The value of general substitution as test for constituents is therefore suspect. It is like the coordination test in that it suggests that too many strings are constituents.\n\n===Right node raising (RNR)===\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''. \n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be. \n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''. \n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n\n==Tests grouped in terms of how they test for the constituent ==\n\n=== Deletion tests ===\nDeletion tests includes ellipsis and answer-fragments.\n\n=== Substitution tests ===\nSubstitution tests include: general substitution, coordination, pro-form substitution, VP substitution (with do so), and NP substitution (with one).\n\n=== Displacements tests ===\nDisplacements tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, heavy shift, passivization, and intrusion.\n\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 14th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Scott Derrickson]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[C. Robert Cargill]], and stars<!-- Order based on billing block --> [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as surgeon Stephen Strange along with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Benedict Wong]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Scott Adkins]], [[Mads Mikkelsen]], and [[Tilda Swinton]]. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.\n\nVarious incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s, until [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. [[Principal photography]] on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong Kong, and wrapping up in New York City in April 2016.\n\n''Doctor Strange'' had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 4, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. The film grossed over $677 million worldwide, was met with praise for its visuals and cast, and received awards attention, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A sequel, ''[[#Sequel|Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', is scheduled for release on November 5, 2021.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[Kathmandu]], the sorcerer [[Kaecilius]] and his zealots enter the secret compound [[Kamar-Taj]] and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the [[Ancient One]], a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.\n\nIn [[New York City]], [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant [[neurosurgeon]], severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]] tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]], a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the [[astral plane]] and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius.\n\nStrange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctums]], in New York City, [[London]], and [[Hong Kong]], which are all directly accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical [[Eye of Agamotto]]. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.\n\nKaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact [[Dormammu]] of the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the [[Cloak of Levitation]], only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain her long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates a [[time loop]] around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he permanently leave Earth alone and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the loop.\n\nDisillusioned by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Strange decides to help [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], who has brought his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] to Earth to search for their father, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]].{{refn|name=Ragnarok|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Doctor Strange cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Left to right: Cumberbatch, Derrickson, Swinton, McAdams, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen, and Wong at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n<!--Do NOT add cast members unless they are confirmed by a reliable source.

Strange is also aided by a [[Cloak of Levitation]] for flight, and the [[Eye of Agamotto]], a relic containing an [[Infinity Stone]] that can [[List of time travel works of fiction#Time travel in films|manipulate time]].<ref name=\"FeigePowersObjects\" /><ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> Cumberbatch took great care in defining the physical movements and gestures for the spells, knowing that they would be noted and studied by fans.<ref name=\"CumberbatchGestures\" /> He described these gestures as \"balletic\" and \"very dynamic\",<ref name=\"CumberbatchGestures2\" /> and received help with [[finger-tutting]] movements from dancer JayFunk.<ref name=\"FingerTutting\" />\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as [[Baron Mordo|Karl Mordo]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, close to the [[Ancient One]] and a mentor to Strange. This version of Mordo is a combination of different characters from the Doctor Strange mythos, and unlike in the comics is not introduced as villainous.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /><ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> Ejiofor noted this, calling Mordo \"a very complex character that, really, I don't think can be nailed down either way\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> Director [[Scott Derrickson]] added that the change in character stemmed from casting Ejiofor and conversations the director had with him.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Ejiofor described Mordo's relationship with the Ancient One as \"long and intense\",<ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> while noting a \"growing respect\" between the character and Strange, until \"things get complicated\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Derrickson felt Mordo was a [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], saying \"When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code, the process of breaking out of that is a violent one. He becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One's [moral contradictions]. The difference is Strange can accept that contradiction. Mordo cannot cope with it,\"<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> which leads to the \"antagonism between Mordo and Strange\" to explore in future films.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Discussing the diversity of the film's cast when addressing the controversial casting of the characters the Ancient One and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]], Derrickson was confident that the decision to cast Ejiofor as Mordo, and thus changing the character \"from white to black\", was the right one to make.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]]: <br />An emergency surgeon<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /><ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> initially written as a love interest for Strange, but shortly before filming, Derrickson suggested that this trope be subverted by making the two characters lovers as part of their backstory and coming \"out the other side of it as friends\". McAdams described this dynamic by saying, \"The love is between them no matter what stage they're at in the actual relationship.\"<ref name=\"NoLoveInterest\" /> With this change in characterization, producer [[Kevin Feige]] described Palmer as a \"lynchpin to [Strange's] old life, once he steps into the role of a sorcerer. She is someone he connects with at the beginning, and reconnects with, and helps anchor his humanity.\"<ref name=\"McAdams3\" /> He explained that having this character be a \"connection to Strange's life in New York City, in the normal world\" after his journey was important to the studio, which is why Palmer was chosen for the character over the more prominent, but more fantastical character [[Clea]].<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg3\" /> Palmer is also known as the hero [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]] in the comics, a storyline that does not play into the film, but that Feige hinted could be explored in future films. [[Rosario Dawson]] portrays another Night Nurse character, [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], in Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Netflix television series]].<ref name=\"NightNurse\" />\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]:<ref name=\"Wong\" /> <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of [[Kamar-Taj]]'s most valuable relics and books.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> The character is depicted in the comics as Strange's Asian, \"tea-making manservant\", a [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotype]] that Derrickson did not want in the film,<ref name=\"WongCut\" /><ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> and so the character was not included in the film's script. After the non-Asian actress [[Tilda Swinton]] was cast as the other significant Asian character from the ''Doctor Strange'' comics, the Ancient One\u2014which was also done to avoid the comics' racial stereotypes\u2014Derrickson felt obligated to find a way to include Wong in the film. The character as he ultimately appears is \"completely subverted as a character and reworked into something that didn't fall into any of the stereotypes of the comics\",<ref name=\"WongCut\" /> which Derrickson was pleased gave an Asian character \"a strong presence in the movie\".<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Actor Wong was also pleased with the changes made to the character, and described him as \"a drill sergeant to Kamar-Taj\" rather than a manservant. He does not practice martial arts in the film, avoiding another racial stereotype.<ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> Derrickson added that Wong will have \"a strong presence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" moving forward.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Nicodemus West]]: A rival surgeon to Strange.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" />\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Jonathan Pangborn: A [[paraplegic]] who learned from the Ancient One how to heal himself through the mystic arts.<ref name=\"Bratt\" /><ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /><ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Lucian: One of Kaecilius' followers.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Lucian\"/>\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Kaecilius]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts who broke away from the Ancient One.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> A combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including \"certain individuals who live in other dimensions\". Derrickson compared this dynamic to that of [[Saruman]] and [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', giving the film a \"huge and fantastical\" villain like Sauron, but also having \"human relateability\" with Kaecilius, like Saruman, for Strange to face throughout the film.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> Derrickson admitted that Marvel's villains are often criticized, and noted that MCU films dedicate little time to developing antagonists. For ''Doctor Strange'', he just hoped to show \"Kaecilius's point of view and what makes him tick\" in the time that he could,<ref name=\"DerricksonVillainOct2016\" /> feeling that the character is a \"man of ideas\" with \"watertight logic\" like John Doe from ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|the Joker]] from ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> On these motivations, Feige explained that Kaecilius believes the Ancient One is a hypocrite, protecting her own power base, and that the world may be better off \"if we were to allow some of these other things through.\"<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Mikkelsen's makeup took between 2\u20133 hours to apply.<ref name=\"MikkelsenMakeup\" />\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as the [[Ancient One]]: <br />A [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] mystic<ref name=\"MarvelAncientOneResponse\" /> who becomes Strange's mentor.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> The character in the comics is a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] man, a situation which co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]] compared to the [[Kobayashi Maru]], an unwinnable training exercise in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. He explained that adapting the character as the comics portrayed him would be realizing the major Asian [[Fu Manchu]] stereotype, and would involve the film with the [[Tibetan sovereignty debate]], but not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor would also understandably be received negatively.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /><ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Derrickson wanted to change the character to be an Asian woman, but felt that an older Asian woman would invoke the [[Dragon Lady]] stereotype, while a younger Asian woman would be perceived as exploiting [[Asian fetish]] and \"a fanboy's dream girl\". To avoid the character filling any of those three stereotypes, or enabling the stereotype of a \"Western character coming to Asia to learn about being Asian\",<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Derrickson decided to cast a non-Asian actor in the role, but to still take the opportunity to cast \"an amazing actress in a male role\".<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Feeling that Swinton was the obvious choice to play \"domineering, secretive, ethereal, enigmatic, [and] mystical\", Derrickson wrote the Ancient One in the film specifically for the actress, before she was offered the role.<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> Additionally, though the film uses the terms \"her\" and \"she\", Swinton chose to portray the character as [[Androgyny|androgynous]], while Feige explained that the Ancient One and Sorcerer Supreme are mantles in the film held by multiple characters through time, so a more comic-accurate Ancient One could exist within the MCU.<ref name=\"SwintonDec2015\" /><ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Still, Swinton's casting was widely criticized as [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]].<ref name=\"SwintonResponse\" /> In response to this, Derrickson said that though he was pleased with the diversity of the film's cast, in terms of both gender and ethnicity, \"Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change. What I did was the lesser of two evils, but it is still an evil.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n\nCumberbatch also portrays, uncredited, the villainous entity [[Dormammu]]. The actor suggested he take on the role to Derrickson, feeling that having the character be a \"horrific\" reflection of Strange would work better than just \"being a big ghoulish monster\". The director agreed, elaborating that the casting implies that Dormammu does not have a normal physical form in his own dimension, and so is simply imitating Strange for their confrontation. To create the character, Cumberbatch provided motion-capture reference for the visual effects team, and his voice was blended with that of another uncredited British actor, whom Derrickson described as having \"a very deep voice\".<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /><ref name=\"DormammuVoice\" /> The producers also had [[Tony Todd]] record voice over for Dormammu as an alternative to Cumberbatch, but ultimately decided on using Cumberbatch for the voice.<ref name=\"ToddDormammu\" />\n\n[[Chris Hemsworth]] reprises his role of [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] from previous MCU films in the film's mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> Additionally, [[Linda Louise Duan]] appears, unnamed, as [[Tina Minoru]],<ref name=\"Duan\" /><ref name=\"MinoruUnnamed\" /> Mark Anthony Brighton portrays [[Daniel Drumm]],<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One. The latter is based on [[Hamir the Hermit]], Wong's father in the comics, who was the Ancient One's personal manservant. The character is neither a manservant nor Wong's father in the film.<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> Zara Phythian, Alaa Safi, and Katrina Durden portray zealots under Kaecilius,<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"Phythian\" /> and [[Pat Kiernan]] appears as himself.<ref name=\"KiernanCameo\" /> Doctor Strange co-creator [[Stan Lee]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as a bus rider reading [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]''.<ref name=\"StanLee\" /><ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" /> [[Amy Landecker]] was cast as anesthesiologist Bruner, but the majority of her role was cut from the finished film.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nA film based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Doctor Strange]] was initially listed as being in development at [[New World Pictures]],<ref name=\"NewWorld\" /> with a script dated January 21, 1986 by [[Bob Gale]].<ref name=\"IGNGale\" /> For unknown reasons, Gale's film never went further into production.<ref name=\"IGNGale\" /> By 1989, [[Alex Cox]] had co-written a script with Doctor Strange co-creator [[Stan Lee]]. The script had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain [[Dormammu]] on [[Easter Island]], [[Chile]]. A film using this script was almost made by [[Regency Enterprises|Regency]], but the company's films were [[Film distributor|distributed]] by [[Warner Bros.]] at the time, which was in a dispute with Marvel over merchandising.<ref name=\"AlexCox\" /> By December 1992, [[Wes Craven]] had signed to write and direct ''Doctor Strange'' for release in either 1994 or 1995, with [[Savoy Pictures]] distributing.<ref name=\"Variety\" /><ref name=\"Variety2\" /> In 1995, [[David S. Goyer]] had completed a script for the film.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> By April 1997, [[Columbia Pictures]] had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch was working on a new screenplay, with [[Bernie Brillstein]] and [[Brad Grey]] producing.<ref name=\"Variety3\" />\n\nBy April 2000, Columbia dropped ''Doctor Strange'', which then had [[Michael France]] attached to write a script and interest from [[Chuck Russell]] and [[Stephen Norrington]] to direct.<ref name=\"ColumbiaDrop\" /> By June 2001, [[Dimension Films]] acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of ''[[Murder Mysteries]]'',<ref name=\"Goyer\" /> and promised not to be highly dependent on [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"IGN\" /> However, by August 2001, [[Miramax]] acquired the film rights from Dimension,<ref name=\"Miramax\" /> and by March 2002, Goyer had dropped out of the project.<ref name=\"GoyerDrop\" /> A 2005 release date was announced the next March,<ref name=\"2005release\" /> while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. [[Marvel Studios]] CEO [[Avi Arad]] stated, \"We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. We are trying to find the real [[Jerry Garcia]] of the writing community.\"<ref name=\"AradWriter\" /> In April 2005, [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired ''Doctor Strange'' from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Paramount\" /> In 2007, [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] pitched a version of the film to Marvel, with Gaiman writing and del Toro directing. Gaiman was especially interested in including the character [[Clea]], but the studio was not interested.<ref name=\"IndieWiredelToro\" />\n\nIn March 2009, Marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, including Doctor Strange.<ref name=\"Writers2009\" /> In June 2010, Marvel Studios hired [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] to write ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"MarvelStudios\" /> While promoting ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' in April 2011, actor [[Patrick Dempsey]] indicated he was lobbying to play the title character.<ref name=\"Dempsey\" /> In January 2013, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that Doctor Strange would appear in some capacity as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"PhaseThreeMTV\" /> Feige then reiterated that a Doctor Strange feature film was in development at Marvel Studios that May,<ref name=\"FeigeMay2013\" /><ref name=\"HollywoodReporterMay2013\" /> and again in November.<ref name=\"FeigeNov2013\" /> In February 2014, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that Marvel was considering [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]], [[Jonathan Levine]], [[Nikolaj Arcel]] and [[Dean Israelite]] to direct the film, and was considering [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger]] to rewrite the film's script.<ref name=\"THRFeb2014\" /> Feige denied this report, but confirmed that Marvel was considering prospective candidates.<ref name=\"IGNFeb2014\" /> By March, Marvel was considering Andrews, Levine, and [[Scott Derrickson]] to direct the film.<ref name=\"IGNMarch2014\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=I think when you consider the work that I've done it makes sense that he'd be my favorite comic book character, at least in the Marvel universe.

The entire history of the comics is extraordinary.|source=\u2014Scott Derrickson, director of ''Doctor Strange''<ref name=\"DerricksonQuote\" />}}\nIn June 2014, Derrickson was chosen to direct the film.<ref name=\"Derrickson\" /> He had written a 12-page scene for the film featuring Strange and an assailant fighting in the [[astral plane]] while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic ''[[Doctor Strange: The Oath]]''. Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an [[Storyboards#Animatics|animatic]], which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an \"obnoxious amount\" of his own money, but he felt it necessary to prove \"that I wanted [the job] more than anyone\", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct ''Doctor Strange'' than any of their other films.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> On transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, \"It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my headspace in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie\". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use \"real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... [to] encounter the fantastical\", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for ''Doctor Strange'' through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" />\n\nDerrickson and Marvel had originally discussed him writing the film alongside his ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'' co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]], with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel felt that they would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer,<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> with [[Jon Spaihts]] hired to rewrite the script instead.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Spaihts\" /> Spaihts, a big fan of ''Doctor Strange'' as a child, had started \"pestering\" Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked \"all afternoon, and the fit was right\",<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not \"take that answer. Call them back, tell them there's a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room\", and after talking with Marvel for \"another three or four hours\" he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a \"fully-formed\" sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that \"the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it.\" Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as \"little things\" from Spaihts, \"like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple.\"<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> Derrickson wanted [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of \"nightmares themselves as being a dimension\",<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /><ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> but Feige felt \"getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension\" would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, \"the most present villain in the comics\", became the film's main villain.<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" />\n\nDuring the early development process, Marvel, Derrickson, and Spaihts all envisioned [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] playing the title role.<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> By the end of June, Marvel had reportedly been looking at [[Tom Hardy]] and [[Jared Leto]] for the film's lead as well,<ref name=\"Spaihts\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineJun2014\" /> while [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]], who worked with Derrickson on 2014's ''[[Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)|Deliver Us from Evil]]'', had discussed a possible role with the director.<ref name=\"Ramirez\" /> In July, after fans and the media had also championed Cumberbatch for the role of Doctor Strange, the actor explained at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] that he would be unable to accept the role due to commitments to other projects.<ref name=\"CumberbatchConflicts\" /> Feige stated that a lead actor would be announced \"relatively quickly\",<ref name=\"JulyCasting\" /> and by the end of that month [[Joaquin Phoenix]] entered talks to play the character.<ref name=\"Phoenix\" /><ref name=\"Phoenix2\" /> By September 2014, Marvel Studios was in negotiations to shoot ''Doctor Strange'' at [[The Pinewood Studios Group|Pinewood-Shepperton]] in England, with crews being assembled for a move into [[Shepperton Studios]] in late 2014/early 2015, for filming in May 2015.<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /> Negotiations with Phoenix ended in October 2014,<ref name=\"Phoenix3\" /> as the actor felt that blockbuster films would never be \"fulfilling\", with \"too many requirements that went against [his] instincts for character.\"<ref name=\"PhoenixReason\" /> Marvel then placed Leto, [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[Keanu Reeves]] on their shortlist for the character.<ref name=\"OctCasting\" /><ref name=\"OctCasting2\" /> [[Ryan Gosling]] also had discussions to play the character,<ref name=\"Gosling\" /> while Reeves was not approached about the role,<ref name=\"Reeves\" /> and Cumberbatch was still considered to be in contention.<ref name=\"OctCasting\" /><ref name=\"OctCasting2\" /> In October, Cumberbatch entered negotiations to play the character,<ref name=\"Cumberbatch\" /> and was officially cast in December.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /> Feige explained that Marvel had kept returning to him for the role while considering other actors,<ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" /> with Derrickson noting that even during discussions with Phoenix, he and Marvel still wanted to cast Cumberbatch in the role.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> The company eventually decided to change the film's production schedule to fit around Cumberbatch's commitments, allowing him to join the project.<ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" />\n\n[[File:Scott Derrickson by Gage Skidmore (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Derrickson promoting ''Doctor Strange'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nWith the film's new production schedule, its intended release date was pushed back to November 2016,<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and Derrickson was able to do some work on the script himself. He brought Cargill in to work with him on this as was originally planned. Describing the film, Cargill called it both a superhero film and a fantasy film, saying \"it's a very magical fantasy universe, but at the same time it plays by some of the superhero tropes that people enjoy.\"<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Spaihts returned later in the process to \"do some more writing and help bring the movie home\", and said he was \"delighted\" by the work that Derrickson and Cargill had done in the interim.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Feige and Derrickson have noted that, in addition to ''The Oath'' and Steve Ditko's original work on Doctor Strange, an influence on all the film's writers was the Doctor Strange comic book ''Into Shamballa''.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" />\n\nIn January 2015, [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] entered preliminary talks with Marvel for a role in the film,<ref name=\"Ejiofor\" /> later revealed to be [[Baron Mordo]].<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> Ejiofor's role was confirmed during the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]].<ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> In April, Derrickson and members of the production team visited [[New York City]] to scout potential filming locations, while Feige revealed that filming would begin that November.<ref name=\"NYCScoutingNovFilming\" /> A month later, [[Tilda Swinton]] was in talks to play the [[Ancient One]].<ref name=\"Swinton\" /> In June 2015, Derrickson announced that he was going to London to begin work on the film,<ref name=\"DerricksonLondon\" /> and Feige confirmed that Strange's [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] would appear, located on [[Bleecker Street]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], as in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Swinton confirmed her role in the film in July,<ref name=\"SwintonConfirmed\" /> when [[Rachel McAdams]] was being considered for the female lead. McAdams cautioned that \"it's still super-early, and I don't know where that's gonna go, if it's gonna go anywhere at all\",<ref name=\"McAdams\" /> but she ultimately confirmed her role during the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /> [[Jessica Chastain]] had been approached for the role before McAdams, but turned down the opportunity because she felt she was \"only going to get one shot at being in a Marvel film\" and wanted to be a lead character.<ref name=\"Chastain\" /> [[Mads Mikkelsen]] entered into early negotiations to play a villain in August,<ref name=\"VarietyMikkelsen\" /> \"one of a number of actors being considered for the unspecified villainous role.\"<ref name=\"DeadlineMikkelsen\" />\n\nIn September 2015, ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn]] stated that many of the crew that worked on that film were unable to return for [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2|its sequel]], because they had committed to ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"Crew\" /> Derrickson also revealed that Gunn had provided notes on the script, beyond the general conversing the MCU directors have between themselves for their films.<ref name=\"GunnNotes\" /> At the end of the month, Feige stated that additional casting announcements would be made \"before the end of the year\",<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\" /> and by early November, [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] entered negotiations to appear in the film as Nicodemus West, a rival of Strange.<ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" /> Derrickson had offered the role to Stuhlbarg because he was interested in working with the actor, and he agreed to join the cast after reading some Doctor Strange comics and being drawn to the character's \"guilt-ridden arc\" where West \"blames himself for ruining the surgery on Strange's hands and robbing him of his ability to operate\".<ref name=\"StuhlbargReasons\" />\n\nFeige felt that the visuals of the film needed \"to be a [[Steve Ditko|Ditko]]/[[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]]/[[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]/''[[The Matrix]]'' mind-trip\",<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> and said that \"You don't get into it in ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', but if a scientist went to [[Hogwarts]] he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not going to spend a lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds.\"<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''Harry Potter'', wanting \"to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Feige called ''Doctor Strange'' the \"doorway\" into the supernatural side of the MCU,<ref name=\"FeigeAprilSupernatural\" /> a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the ''Doctor Strange'' comics \"broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel multiverse]]\".<ref name=\"MCUMultiverse\" /> Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' \"[[Earth-616]] and Earth 617\", but would instead feature \"dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them\",<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.<ref name=\"DarkDimension\" /><ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\n[[Astrophysicist]] [[Adam Frank]] served as a scientific consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood.<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" /> Frank advised on \"the human experience of space and time\", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or \"had this enlarged perspective.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant\" /> He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate that \"amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities\u2014people are used to that in their lives. So I think it makes sense to them, and it's exciting to them\". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a \"great thing ... speaking as a scientist\", saying that \"they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Nepal]] on November 4, 2015, under the [[working title]] ''Checkmate''.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /><ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]], serving as cinematographer for the film after doing the same on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', described ''Doctor Strange'' as Marvel's ''Fantasia'', and noted that a lot of [[previsualization]] was required to figure out how to shoot the \"[[Psychedelia|psychedelic]]\", [[M. C.

[[Vision Research Phantom]] Flex 4Ks, which shoot up to 1000 [[Frame rate|fps]], were used for high speed sequences like Strange's car crash.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\n[[File:Benedict Cumberbatch on the set of Doctor Strange.jpg|thumb|Cumberbatch filming ''Doctor Strange'' in [[Kathmandu]], November 2015]]\nDerrickson chose Nepal as a location to feature an \"Eastern city\" that would not be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]]. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event \"was all the more reason to shoot there\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was \"absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it's so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It's important to a film like this\u2014which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension\u2014that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The eventual filming locations around the [[Kathmandu Valley]] included the [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Swayambhunath]] Temples;<ref name=\"NepalShooting\" /> [[Thamel]] and [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]] in [[Kathmandu]];<ref name=\"NepalShooting4\" /> and the [[Patan Durbar Square]] in [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]].<ref name=\"NepalShooting3\" /><ref name=\"NepalShooting5\" />\n\nProduction moved to [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England on November 11,<ref name=\"Longcross\" /> and was scheduled to stay there until March 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingScheduledEnd\" /> The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as \"very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it's steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with the shape of the streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge.\" For authenticity, the set was dressed with real food, and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people who live on the real Kathmandu street.<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The inside of [[Kamar-Taj]] was also constructed at Longcross, with \"sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary.\" Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a \"truly spiritual, truly magical\" feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu. This and the Kathmandu street were two of twenty-one sets that the crew built at Longcross. Others included Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, and a Hong Kong street \"complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep the rain out.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> [[Citypoint]] on Ropemaker Street, London, doubled as the New York City building where the Ancient One falls to her death.<ref name=\"Citypoint\" />\n\nFilming also took place in Hong Kong,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> and in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /> Additional New York City-set scenes were shot at Shepperton Studios,<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /><ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> and later in London.<ref name=\"LondonFilming\" /> By the end of November, the casting of Mikkelsen and Stuhlbarg was confirmed,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> alongside [[Amy Landecker]] and [[Scott Adkins]] in unspecified roles.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Landecker\" /> Additionally, [[Benedict Wong]] heard about the film from his friend Ejiofor, and sought a role in it himself.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> He was cast as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in January,<ref name=\"Wong\" /> and immediately joined the production for filming.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> [[Lamborghini]] provided six [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n#Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4 Spyder (2016\u2013)|Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4s]] for use in the film, one of which the production wrecked during filming.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> Lamborghini said that they felt \"there are a lot of characteristics of Doctor Strange that are connected with the Lamborghini philosophy.\"<ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> The Lamborghini crash scene was filmed at [[Northfleet]], Kent by the [[River Thames]].<ref name=\"KentFilming\" /> Also in January 2016, filming took place at [[Exeter College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> The next month, Feige revealed that the film originally had a prologue that took place in [[CERN]], due to the real world research being done at the facility on alternate dimensions and parallel universes.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> Production moved to New York City's [[Flatiron District]] in April,<ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> where set photos revealed that Zara Phythian had joined the cast.<ref name=\"Phythian\" /> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in New York City on April 3, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn June 2016, a [[Diamond Select Toys]] press release for ''Doctor Strange'' toys, in their Marvel [[Minimates]] line, named Mikkelsen's character [[Kaecilius]] and McAdams' character [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]].<ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> Mikkelsen's role was confirmed in an official tie-in comic for the film,<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> while McAdams' was confirmed at San Diego Comic Con 2016.<ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> Additionally, [[Benjamin Bratt]] was revealed to have been cast<ref name=\"Bratt\" /> as Jonathan Pangborn;<ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /> Adkins' role was revealed to be Lucian, a follower of Kaecilius;<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> and Landecker's role was later revealed to be anesthesiologist Dr. Bruner.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> The latter was mostly cut from the film,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> with Landecker explaining that she had been cast in the small role, for two scenes at the beginning of the film, because Derrickson was a fan of her performance in ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which also starred Stuhlbarg. After filming her first scene, in which she assists Strange with a surgery, Landecker asked not to be involved in the other scene because she had no lines for it and was only seen from behind, and instead wished to attend a special premiere at the [[White House]] for her series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''. The actress believed she was later cut from the first scene, but she is still credited for a brief appearance.<ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> Also, Derrickson revealed that [[Lulu Wilson]] had been cast as Strange's sister, for a scene depicting her drowning at a young age. The scene had been shot, and Derrickson thought it was \"great [as a] self-contained scene\", but it \"didn't work\" with the rest of the film, and was cut.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" />\n\nAlso at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson noted that there were still \"a couple pickup shoots\" to do for the film to \"clarify the logic\".<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> Further content for the film's training sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences \"loved [the training portion of the film] and wanted more\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August.<ref name=\"WongReshootWrap\" /> [[Dan Harmon]] wrote material for these additional scenes,<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> which Derrickson described as \"script analysis and dialogue work\", not enough to receive credit in the film.<ref name=\"Harmon2\" /> Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to \"give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts.\"<ref name=\"Harmon3\" /> Before the film's sets were demolished, ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' director [[Taika Waititi]] took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting [[Chris Hemsworth]]'s [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. The scene was for ''Ragnarok'' and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to ''Doctor Strange'' as a mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" /> A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential ''Doctor Strange'' sequel.<ref name=\"PostCreditScene\" /> Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective ''Doctor Strange'' scene, and \"kept throwing lines at\" Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film.<ref name=\"GunnCameos\" /> Additional options Gunn filmed included Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word [[wikt:excelsior|excelsior]] meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being \"totally crazy\"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a ''[[Garfield]]'' book, noting how the character \"HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!\". Gunn felt the ''Garfield'' option was originally meant to appear in the final version of the film, but ended up being too long for the scene.<ref name=\"GunnLeeOptions\" /> By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.<ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" />\n\nFeige described the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, \"hopefully it helps bend people's minds even more than with just the flat screen.\"<ref name=\"Feige3DUse\" /> He said that \"there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional story that is happening through visuals\". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.<ref name=\"Feige3DCollider\" /> Over one hour of footage in the film was \"specially formatted\" for IMAX.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\nVisual effects for ''Doctor Strange'' were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Method Studios]], [[Framestore]], Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV,<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> contributing to 1450 effects shots. [[Previsualization]] was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals).<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> Visual effects supervisor [[Stephane Ceretti]], who also worked on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', explained the similarities and differences between the two films, saying, \"there's some resemblance in some of the things that we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In [''Guardians''], it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. ''Guardians'' was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" />\n\nFurther discussing the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as \"the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [which] were all about these weird visuals\",<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> as well as \"a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher\".<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from \"a bunch of experimental, [[fractal]] videos from [[YouTube]]\" that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game ''[[Monument Valley (video game)|Monument Valley]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesVisuals\" /> Derrickson's \"ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects to do things that are fresh and new\u2014to not just blow things up.\"<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them \"to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning...\" Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action \"in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we've seen in any other movies.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on ''The Oath'' comic, while adding that the end fight was \"an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork\" from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take ''[[Inception]]'' \"to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of \"a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it\", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing \"which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder\".<ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" />\n\n[[File:Doctor Strange mirror dimension.jpg|thumb|left|The Manhattan mirror sequence was mostly filmed on green screen (top), with visual effects added by [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]] (bottom).<ref name=\"FXguide\" />]]\nILM worked on the folding Manhattan mirror sequence (chosen because of their work creating a digital New York in ''The Avengers'') and the time fight sequence in Hong Kong, which consisted of 200 and 150 shots, respectively. They began work on the film 10 months before filming began to plan out the Manhattan sequence; it was mainly CGI, though some New York location shots were used. The sequence was mainly handled by ILM's San Francisco and Vancouver offices. The Hong Kong time sequence was done mainly by ILM's London office. ILM also created digital doubles for many of the actors, which were shared with the other vendors. Method Studios, who worked on the [[Microverse|Quantum Realm]] in ''Ant-Man'', worked on the \"magical mystery tour\" sequence, with Strange hurtling through various dimensions. The sequence was handled by Method's Los Angeles studio, with their Vancouver studio contributing the opening shot of the sequence. The only shot Method did not work on in the sequence was the one that linked to Dormammu, as Luma Pictures assisted in his creation (they handled his other appearances in the film). Method created 7 dimensions for the sequence: the initial wormhole to the \"Speaker Cone\"; the Bioluminesce world; the fractals of \"soft solid\" world; a version of the Quantum Realm; Strange falling through his own eye and Cosmic Scream; the Dark Dimension; and the Shape Shifting realm. The Shape Shifting realm originally had Strange morphing and changing shape, but that was ultimately removed as Derrickson felt the audience needed to see Cumberbatch. Method's Vancouver studio created Strange's car crash, the rooftop training, and the sequence in which Strange experiments with time on an apple in the Kamar-Taj library. The car crash blended the high speed photography and some green screen sequences, with digital assets for both Cumberbatch and the car. In total, Method worked on 270 effects shots.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\nFramestore was chosen to work on the Cloak of Levitation, due to their work creating [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Ceretti called Cloak's actions \"kind of scripted but not as deeply\" as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process \"we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" /> Framestore also worked on environment shots, the [[Mandelbrot set]] sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form \"one of the hardest effects we've had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful.\" Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a [[geode]]. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as \"it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [When he is talking to Strange] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff\u2026 these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [a] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [look] of the entire space.\" On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, \"We tried to make it alive all the time\u2014the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment,\" with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit \"with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [with] colors, crazy blacklight colors.\" He continued, \"It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [that] we really tried to be faithful to.\"<ref name=\"IGNVFX2\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Doctor Strange (soundtrack)}}\nIn May 2016, [[Michael Giacchino]] revealed that he would score the film.<ref name=\"Giacchino\" /> Derrickson called the score \"magic in the literal sense of the word,\" adding Giacchino \"is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with [[Temp track|temp music]].\"<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"AbbeyRoad\" /> During a recording session, [[Paul McCartney]] heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to [[The Beatles]] song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\".<ref name=\"Walrus\" /> Derrickson, a [[Bob Dylan]] fan, looked for a place in the film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song \"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name=\"BobDylanPinkFloyd\" /><ref name=\"PinkFloyd\" /> Derrickson had hoped to use either \"Interstellar Overdrive\" or [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s \"[[Are You Experienced?

The images showed artwork of Cumberbatch in a traditional Doctor Strange outfit from the comics, as well as a rough sequence of the plot, highlighting points such as Strange's car crash, his journey for healing, and fighting Ejiofor as Mordo (before the character was moved away from a villainous role in the film per discussions between Derrickson and the actor).<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"D232015\" /> The trailer was met with \"a very big reaction from the gathered crowd.\"<ref name=\"D232015\" />\n\nOn April 12, 2016, the first teaser trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.<ref name=\"KimmelTrailer\" /><ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared the \"series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes\" featured in the trailer to the film ''Inception'',<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> as did Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]''. Forbes added that the structure of the trailer resembled early marketing for the film ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to ''The Matrix'' and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of [[Hugh Laurie]]'s [[Gregory House]] from ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', calling them not \"necessarily a real problem, of course ... [but] there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: due to the nature of the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material.\" McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of \"Tilda Swinton literally knock[ing] Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body,\" but concluded, \"as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured\" than the first trailer for ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Marvel Comics]] released a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|prelude tie-in comic]] written by Will Corona Pilgrim, with art by Jorge Forn\u00e9s.<ref name=\"PreludeComic\" /> The issue sees four Masters of the Mystic Arts\u2013Kaecilius, Wong, Tina Minoru and Daniel Drumm\u2013pursue a woman who has stolen a mystical relic.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> A second issue, centered on the [[Ancient One]] training apprentices in the magical arts at [[Kamar-Taj]], was released a month later.<ref name=\"PreludeComic2\" /> Derrickson, Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor, McAdams, Mikkelsen, and Wong attended San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where they debuted an exclusive clip and the second trailer for the film.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> The next month, the same Comic-Con clip was screened at the [[Asia Pop Comic Convention Manila]].<ref name=\"AsiaPopClip\" /> In September 2016, an additional prelude comic was released, centered on Kaecilius,<ref name=\"InfinitePrelude\" /> while behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' Blu-ray.<ref name=\"CapCWHomeMedia\" /> Also in September, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Broadcom]], [[Synchrony Financial|Synchrony Bank]], and [[Society for Science & the Public]], announced \"The Magic of STEM Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in [[STEM fields|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields]]. The challenge was for contestants to submit videos of them finding mentors to explore ideas once thought to only be possible with magic. Five winners would attend the world premiere of the film, and receive a tour of [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], as well as a $1,000 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving a mentorship with Walt Disney Studio's Digital Team.<ref name=\"ScienceContest\" />\n\nOn October 10, 2016, approximately 15 minutes of footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" /> Umberto Gonzales of [[TheWrap]] called the footage \"stunning to behold\". He added that a sequence shown in which the Ancient One sends Strange \"on his first trippy tour through the multiverse\" was \"where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really is something to behold in IMAX 3D,\" concluding that \"after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film.\"<ref name=\"TheWrapIMAXReaction\" /> Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was \"dizzying\" and \"far weirder and wilder than [the] trailers are letting on,\" though felt it was a bit difficult \"to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)\". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, \"[[Seth Rogen]]'s comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushIMAXReaction\" /> [[IGN]]'s Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where \"Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through\".<ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\nMarvel provided [[Twitter]] stickers, [[Giphy]] content, [[Facebook]] Live, [[Snapchat]] lenses and filter, [[Tumblr]] stunts, and [[Instagram]] special content related to the film. Additionally, [[Microsoft Surface]] had a promotional sponsorship of the film, due to the use of the device in the filmmaking process.

Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" /> Mara Reinstein of ''[[US Weekly]]'' called the film \"joyless\" and wrote, \"Despite [Benedict Cumberbatch's] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here \u2013 save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations.\"<ref name=\"USWeeklyReview\" /> [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' called ''Doctor Strange'' \"an awkwardly clich\u00e9-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality\" and said, \"None of it makes any sense...

There's so much progress that can be made.\" He would like to follow the example of ''The Dark Knight'' and \"bring in a villain where you really got to go deep [and have] a more visceral experience\". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more ''Doctor Strange'' solo film.<ref name=\"DenofGeekOct2016\" /> Derrickson hoped to feature<!--NIGHTMARE IS ALREADY WIKILINKED TO THE COMIC CHARACTER ABOVE--> Nightmare in a potential sequel,<ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is being \"kept in the loop\" about how the ''Avengers'' films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]].<ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" /> Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing [[Clea]] appear in a potential sequel.<ref name=\"CleaSequelPotential\" /> By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, ''[[Locke & Key (TV series)|Locke & Key]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelReturn\" /> Despite no official announcements, Wong said in October 2018 that he expected filming on a sequel to begin by the end of that year.<ref name=\"WongSequelFilming\" /> By December 2018, Derrickson had \"quietly\" finalized a deal to return to direct the sequel, and Cumberbatch and Wong were confirmed to reprise their roles from the first film, with McAdams stated as likely to return.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed2\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the sequel was announced as ''Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'' with a release date of May 7, 2021. Feige and Derrickson revealed that the sequel would have more of a horror tone than the first film, that [[Elizabeth Olsen]] would reprise her MCU role of [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch]], and that her [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' would tie into the events of the film.<ref name=\"SequelHorror\" /><ref name=\"SequelReleaseDate\" /> The film would also tie into the Disney+ series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.<ref name=\"LokiSequel\" /> In October 2019, ''Collider'' reported that Jade Bartlett would be the film's screenwriter.<ref name=\"SequelBartlett\" /> In January 2020, Marvel and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences, but would remain an executive producer on the film.

was shooting some stunt work with Zoe Saldana \u2013 I run between sets on one soundstage. Stan laughing at The Doors of Perception was what ended up in the film, but we shot other options, such as \u2013 Stan reading a book and leaning into the guy next to him, saying, 'Do you know what excelsior means?' \u2013 Stan throwing his head back and laughing as hard as he can, yelling, 'I'm laughing for no reason! I'm totally crazy!' \u2013 And, my favorite, Stan laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, hooting, 'He HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!' Supposedly that one was in the film for a while, but it ended up being too long for the scene.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 14th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Scott Derrickson]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[C. Robert Cargill]], and stars<!-- Order based on billing block --> [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as surgeon Stephen Strange along with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Benedict Wong]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Scott Adkins]], [[Mads Mikkelsen]], and [[Tilda Swinton]]. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.\n\nVarious incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s, until [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. [[Principal photography]] on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong Kong, and wrapping up in New York City in April 2016.\n\n''Doctor Strange'' had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 4, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. The film grossed over $677 million worldwide, was met with praise for its visuals and cast, and received awards attention, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A sequel, ''[[#Sequel|Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', is scheduled for release on November 5, 2021.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[Kathmandu]], the sorcerer [[Kaecilius]] and his zealots enter the secret compound [[Kamar-Taj]] and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the [[Ancient One]], a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.\n\nIn [[New York City]], [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant [[neurosurgeon]], severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]] tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]], a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the [[astral plane]] and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius.\n\nStrange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctums]], in New York City, [[London]], and [[Hong Kong]], which are all directly accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical [[Eye of Agamotto]]. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.\n\nKaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact [[Dormammu]] of the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the [[Cloak of Levitation]], only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain her long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates a [[time loop]] around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he permanently leave Earth alone and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the loop.\n\nDisillusioned by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Strange decides to help [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], who has brought his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] to Earth to search for their father, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]].{{refn|name=Ragnarok|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Doctor Strange cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Left to right: Cumberbatch, Derrickson, Swinton, McAdams, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen, and Wong at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n<!--Do NOT add cast members unless they are confirmed by a reliable source.

Strange is also aided by a [[Cloak of Levitation]] for flight, and the [[Eye of Agamotto]], a relic containing an [[Infinity Stone]] that can [[List of time travel works of fiction#Time travel in films|manipulate time]].<ref name=\"FeigePowersObjects\" /><ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> Cumberbatch took great care in defining the physical movements and gestures for the spells, knowing that they would be noted and studied by fans.<ref name=\"CumberbatchGestures\" /> He described these gestures as \"balletic\" and \"very dynamic\",<ref name=\"CumberbatchGestures2\" /> and received help with [[finger-tutting]] movements from dancer JayFunk.<ref name=\"FingerTutting\" />\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as [[Baron Mordo|Karl Mordo]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, close to the [[Ancient One]] and a mentor to Strange. This version of Mordo is a combination of different characters from the Doctor Strange mythos, and unlike in the comics is not introduced as villainous.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /><ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> Ejiofor noted this, calling Mordo \"a very complex character that, really, I don't think can be nailed down either way\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> Director [[Scott Derrickson]] added that the change in character stemmed from casting Ejiofor and conversations the director had with him.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Ejiofor described Mordo's relationship with the Ancient One as \"long and intense\",<ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> while noting a \"growing respect\" between the character and Strange, until \"things get complicated\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Derrickson felt Mordo was a [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], saying \"When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code, the process of breaking out of that is a violent one. He becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One's [moral contradictions]. The difference is Strange can accept that contradiction. Mordo cannot cope with it,\"<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> which leads to the \"antagonism between Mordo and Strange\" to explore in future films.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Discussing the diversity of the film's cast when addressing the controversial casting of the characters the Ancient One and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]], Derrickson was confident that the decision to cast Ejiofor as Mordo, and thus changing the character \"from white to black\", was the right one to make.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]]: <br />An emergency surgeon<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /><ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> initially written as a love interest for Strange, but shortly before filming, Derrickson suggested that this trope be subverted by making the two characters lovers as part of their backstory and coming \"out the other side of it as friends\". McAdams described this dynamic by saying, \"The love is between them no matter what stage they're at in the actual relationship.\"<ref name=\"NoLoveInterest\" /> With this change in characterization, producer [[Kevin Feige]] described Palmer as a \"lynchpin to [Strange's] old life, once he steps into the role of a sorcerer. She is someone he connects with at the beginning, and reconnects with, and helps anchor his humanity.\"<ref name=\"McAdams3\" /> He explained that having this character be a \"connection to Strange's life in New York City, in the normal world\" after his journey was important to the studio, which is why Palmer was chosen for the character over the more prominent, but more fantastical character [[Clea]].<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg3\" /> Palmer is also known as the hero [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]] in the comics, a storyline that does not play into the film, but that Feige hinted could be explored in future films. [[Rosario Dawson]] portrays another Night Nurse character, [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], in Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Netflix television series]].<ref name=\"NightNurse\" />\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]:<ref name=\"Wong\" /> <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of [[Kamar-Taj]]'s most valuable relics and books.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> The character is depicted in the comics as Strange's Asian, \"tea-making manservant\", a [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotype]] that Derrickson did not want in the film,<ref name=\"WongCut\" /><ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> and so the character was not included in the film's script. After the non-Asian actress [[Tilda Swinton]] was cast as the other significant Asian character from the ''Doctor Strange'' comics, the Ancient One\u2014which was also done to avoid the comics' racial stereotypes\u2014Derrickson felt obligated to find a way to include Wong in the film. The character as he ultimately appears is \"completely subverted as a character and reworked into something that didn't fall into any of the stereotypes of the comics\",<ref name=\"WongCut\" /> which Derrickson was pleased gave an Asian character \"a strong presence in the movie\".<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Actor Wong was also pleased with the changes made to the character, and described him as \"a drill sergeant to Kamar-Taj\" rather than a manservant. He does not practice martial arts in the film, avoiding another racial stereotype.<ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> Derrickson added that Wong will have \"a strong presence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" moving forward.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Nicodemus West]]: A rival surgeon to Strange.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" />\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Jonathan Pangborn: A [[paraplegic]] who learned from the Ancient One how to heal himself through the mystic arts.<ref name=\"Bratt\" /><ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /><ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Lucian: One of Kaecilius' followers.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Lucian\"/>\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Kaecilius]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts who broke away from the Ancient One.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> A combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including \"certain individuals who live in other dimensions\". Derrickson compared this dynamic to that of [[Saruman]] and [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', giving the film a \"huge and fantastical\" villain like Sauron, but also having \"human relateability\" with Kaecilius, like Saruman, for Strange to face throughout the film.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> Derrickson admitted that Marvel's villains are often criticized, and noted that MCU films dedicate little time to developing antagonists. For ''Doctor Strange'', he just hoped to show \"Kaecilius's point of view and what makes him tick\" in the time that he could,<ref name=\"DerricksonVillainOct2016\" /> feeling that the character is a \"man of ideas\" with \"watertight logic\" like John Doe from ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|the Joker]] from ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> On these motivations, Feige explained that Kaecilius believes the Ancient One is a hypocrite, protecting her own power base, and that the world may be better off \"if we were to allow some of these other things through.\"<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Mikkelsen's makeup took between 2\u20133 hours to apply.<ref name=\"MikkelsenMakeup\" />\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as the [[Ancient One]]: <br />A [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] mystic<ref name=\"MarvelAncientOneResponse\" /> who becomes Strange's mentor.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> The character in the comics is a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] man, a situation which co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]] compared to the [[Kobayashi Maru]], an unwinnable training exercise in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. He explained that adapting the character as the comics portrayed him would be realizing the major Asian [[Fu Manchu]] stereotype, and would involve the film with the [[Tibetan sovereignty debate]], but not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor would also understandably be received negatively.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /><ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Derrickson wanted to change the character to be an Asian woman, but felt that an older Asian woman would invoke the [[Dragon Lady]] stereotype, while a younger Asian woman would be perceived as exploiting [[Asian fetish]] and \"a fanboy's dream girl\". To avoid the character filling any of those three stereotypes, or enabling the stereotype of a \"Western character coming to Asia to learn about being Asian\",<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Derrickson decided to cast a non-Asian actor in the role, but to still take the opportunity to cast \"an amazing actress in a male role\".<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Feeling that Swinton was the obvious choice to play \"domineering, secretive, ethereal, enigmatic, [and] mystical\", Derrickson wrote the Ancient One in the film specifically for the actress, before she was offered the role.<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> Additionally, though the film uses the terms \"her\" and \"she\", Swinton chose to portray the character as [[Androgyny|androgynous]], while Feige explained that the Ancient One and Sorcerer Supreme are mantles in the film held by multiple characters through time, so a more comic-accurate Ancient One could exist within the MCU.<ref name=\"SwintonDec2015\" /><ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Still, Swinton's casting was widely criticized as [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]].<ref name=\"SwintonResponse\" /> In response to this, Derrickson said that though he was pleased with the diversity of the film's cast, in terms of both gender and ethnicity, \"Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change. What I did was the lesser of two evils, but it is still an evil.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n\nCumberbatch also portrays, uncredited, the villainous entity [[Dormammu]]. The actor suggested he take on the role to Derrickson, feeling that having the character be a \"horrific\" reflection of Strange would work better than just \"being a big ghoulish monster\". The director agreed, elaborating that the casting implies that Dormammu does not have a normal physical form in his own dimension, and so is simply imitating Strange for their confrontation. To create the character, Cumberbatch provided motion-capture reference for the visual effects team, and his voice was blended with that of another uncredited British actor, whom Derrickson described as having \"a very deep voice\".<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /><ref name=\"DormammuVoice\" /> The producers also had [[Tony Todd]] record voice over for Dormammu as an alternative to Cumberbatch, but ultimately decided on using Cumberbatch for the voice.<ref name=\"ToddDormammu\" />\n\n[[Chris Hemsworth]] reprises his role of [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] from previous MCU films in the film's mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> Additionally, [[Linda Louise Duan]] appears, unnamed, as [[Tina Minoru]],<ref name=\"Duan\" /><ref name=\"MinoruUnnamed\" /> Mark Anthony Brighton portrays [[Daniel Drumm]],<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One. The latter is based on [[Hamir the Hermit]], Wong's father in the comics, who was the Ancient One's personal manservant. The character is neither a manservant nor Wong's father in the film.<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> Zara Phythian, Alaa Safi, and Katrina Durden portray zealots under Kaecilius,<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"Phythian\" /> and [[Pat Kiernan]] appears as himself.<ref name=\"KiernanCameo\" /> Doctor Strange co-creator [[Stan Lee]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as a bus rider reading [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]''.<ref name=\"StanLee\" /><ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" /> [[Amy Landecker]] was cast as anesthesiologist Bruner, but the majority of her role was cut from the finished film.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nA film based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Doctor Strange]] was initially listed as being in development at [[New World Pictures]],<ref name=\"NewWorld\" /> with a script dated January 21, 1986 by [[Bob Gale]].<ref name=\"IGNGale\" /> For unknown reasons, Gale's film never went further into production.<ref name=\"IGNGale\" /> By 1989, [[Alex Cox]] had co-written a script with Doctor Strange co-creator [[Stan Lee]]. The script had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain [[Dormammu]] on [[Easter Island]], [[Chile]]. A film using this script was almost made by [[Regency Enterprises|Regency]], but the company's films were [[Film distributor|distributed]] by [[Warner Bros.]] at the time, which was in a dispute with Marvel over merchandising.<ref name=\"AlexCox\" /> By December 1992, [[Wes Craven]] had signed to write and direct ''Doctor Strange'' for release in either 1994 or 1995, with [[Savoy Pictures]] distributing.<ref name=\"Variety\" /><ref name=\"Variety2\" /> In 1995, [[David S. Goyer]] had completed a script for the film.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> By April 1997, [[Columbia Pictures]] had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch was working on a new screenplay, with [[Bernie Brillstein]] and [[Brad Grey]] producing.<ref name=\"Variety3\" />\n\nBy April 2000, Columbia dropped ''Doctor Strange'', which then had [[Michael France]] attached to write a script and interest from [[Chuck Russell]] and [[Stephen Norrington]] to direct.<ref name=\"ColumbiaDrop\" /> By June 2001, [[Dimension Films]] acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of ''[[Murder Mysteries]]'',<ref name=\"Goyer\" /> and promised not to be highly dependent on [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"IGN\" /> However, by August 2001, [[Miramax]] acquired the film rights from Dimension,<ref name=\"Miramax\" /> and by March 2002, Goyer had dropped out of the project.<ref name=\"GoyerDrop\" /> A 2005 release date was announced the next March,<ref name=\"2005release\" /> while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. [[Marvel Studios]] CEO [[Avi Arad]] stated, \"We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. We are trying to find the real [[Jerry Garcia]] of the writing community.\"<ref name=\"AradWriter\" /> In April 2005, [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired ''Doctor Strange'' from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Paramount\" /> In 2007, [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] pitched a version of the film to Marvel, with Gaiman writing and del Toro directing. Gaiman was especially interested in including the character [[Clea]], but the studio was not interested.<ref name=\"IndieWiredelToro\" />\n\nIn March 2009, Marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, including Doctor Strange.<ref name=\"Writers2009\" /> In June 2010, Marvel Studios hired [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] to write ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"MarvelStudios\" /> While promoting ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' in April 2011, actor [[Patrick Dempsey]] indicated he was lobbying to play the title character.<ref name=\"Dempsey\" /> In January 2013, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that Doctor Strange would appear in some capacity as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"PhaseThreeMTV\" /> Feige then reiterated that a Doctor Strange feature film was in development at Marvel Studios that May,<ref name=\"FeigeMay2013\" /><ref name=\"HollywoodReporterMay2013\" /> and again in November.<ref name=\"FeigeNov2013\" /> In February 2014, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that Marvel was considering [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]], [[Jonathan Levine]], [[Nikolaj Arcel]] and [[Dean Israelite]] to direct the film, and was considering [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger]] to rewrite the film's script.<ref name=\"THRFeb2014\" /> Feige denied this report, but confirmed that Marvel was considering prospective candidates.<ref name=\"IGNFeb2014\" /> By March, Marvel was considering Andrews, Levine, and [[Scott Derrickson]] to direct the film.<ref name=\"IGNMarch2014\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=I think when you consider the work that I've done it makes sense that he'd be my favorite comic book character, at least in the Marvel universe.

The entire history of the comics is extraordinary.|source=\u2014Scott Derrickson, director of ''Doctor Strange''<ref name=\"DerricksonQuote\" />}}\nIn June 2014, Derrickson was chosen to direct the film.<ref name=\"Derrickson\" /> He had written a 12-page scene for the film featuring Strange and an assailant fighting in the [[astral plane]] while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic ''[[Doctor Strange: The Oath]]''. Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an [[Storyboards#Animatics|animatic]], which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an \"obnoxious amount\" of his own money, but he felt it necessary to prove \"that I wanted [the job] more than anyone\", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct ''Doctor Strange'' than any of their other films.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> On transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, \"It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my headspace in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie\". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use \"real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... [to] encounter the fantastical\", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for ''Doctor Strange'' through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" />\n\nDerrickson and Marvel had originally discussed him writing the film alongside his ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'' co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]], with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel felt that they would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer,<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> with [[Jon Spaihts]] hired to rewrite the script instead.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Spaihts\" /> Spaihts, a big fan of ''Doctor Strange'' as a child, had started \"pestering\" Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked \"all afternoon, and the fit was right\",<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not \"take that answer. Call them back, tell them there's a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room\", and after talking with Marvel for \"another three or four hours\" he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a \"fully-formed\" sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that \"the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it.\" Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as \"little things\" from Spaihts, \"like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple.\"<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> Derrickson wanted [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of \"nightmares themselves as being a dimension\",<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /><ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> but Feige felt \"getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension\" would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, \"the most present villain in the comics\", became the film's main villain.<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" />\n\nDuring the early development process, Marvel, Derrickson, and Spaihts all envisioned [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] playing the title role.<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> By the end of June, Marvel had reportedly been looking at [[Tom Hardy]] and [[Jared Leto]] for the film's lead as well,<ref name=\"Spaihts\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineJun2014\" /> while [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]], who worked with Derrickson on 2014's ''[[Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)|Deliver Us from Evil]]'', had discussed a possible role with the director.<ref name=\"Ramirez\" /> In July, after fans and the media had also championed Cumberbatch for the role of Doctor Strange, the actor explained at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] that he would be unable to accept the role due to commitments to other projects.<ref name=\"CumberbatchConflicts\" /> Feige stated that a lead actor would be announced \"relatively quickly\",<ref name=\"JulyCasting\" /> and by the end of that month [[Joaquin Phoenix]] entered talks to play the character.<ref name=\"Phoenix\" /><ref name=\"Phoenix2\" /> By September 2014, Marvel Studios was in negotiations to shoot ''Doctor Strange'' at [[The Pinewood Studios Group|Pinewood-Shepperton]] in England, with crews being assembled for a move into [[Shepperton Studios]] in late 2014/early 2015, for filming in May 2015.<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /> Negotiations with Phoenix ended in October 2014,<ref name=\"Phoenix3\" /> as the actor felt that blockbuster films would never be \"fulfilling\", with \"too many requirements that went against [his] instincts for character.\"<ref name=\"PhoenixReason\" /> Marvel then placed Leto, [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[Keanu Reeves]] on their shortlist for the character.<ref name=\"OctCasting\" /><ref name=\"OctCasting2\" /> [[Ryan Gosling]] also had discussions to play the character,<ref name=\"Gosling\" /> while Reeves was not approached about the role,<ref name=\"Reeves\" /> and Cumberbatch was still considered to be in contention.<ref name=\"OctCasting\" /><ref name=\"OctCasting2\" /> In October, Cumberbatch entered negotiations to play the character,<ref name=\"Cumberbatch\" /> and was officially cast in December.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /> Feige explained that Marvel had kept returning to him for the role while considering other actors,<ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" /> with Derrickson noting that even during discussions with Phoenix, he and Marvel still wanted to cast Cumberbatch in the role.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> The company eventually decided to change the film's production schedule to fit around Cumberbatch's commitments, allowing him to join the project.<ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" />\n\n[[File:Scott Derrickson by Gage Skidmore (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Derrickson promoting ''Doctor Strange'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nWith the film's new production schedule, its intended release date was pushed back to November 2016,<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and Derrickson was able to do some work on the script himself. He brought Cargill in to work with him on this as was originally planned. Describing the film, Cargill called it both a superhero film and a fantasy film, saying \"it's a very magical fantasy universe, but at the same time it plays by some of the superhero tropes that people enjoy.\"<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Spaihts returned later in the process to \"do some more writing and help bring the movie home\", and said he was \"delighted\" by the work that Derrickson and Cargill had done in the interim.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Feige and Derrickson have noted that, in addition to ''The Oath'' and Steve Ditko's original work on Doctor Strange, an influence on all the film's writers was the Doctor Strange comic book ''Into Shamballa''.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" />\n\nIn January 2015, [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] entered preliminary talks with Marvel for a role in the film,<ref name=\"Ejiofor\" /> later revealed to be [[Baron Mordo]].<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> Ejiofor's role was confirmed during the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]].<ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> In April, Derrickson and members of the production team visited [[New York City]] to scout potential filming locations, while Feige revealed that filming would begin that November.<ref name=\"NYCScoutingNovFilming\" /> A month later, [[Tilda Swinton]] was in talks to play the [[Ancient One]].<ref name=\"Swinton\" /> In June 2015, Derrickson announced that he was going to London to begin work on the film,<ref name=\"DerricksonLondon\" /> and Feige confirmed that Strange's [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] would appear, located on [[Bleecker Street]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], as in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Swinton confirmed her role in the film in July,<ref name=\"SwintonConfirmed\" /> when [[Rachel McAdams]] was being considered for the female lead. McAdams cautioned that \"it's still super-early, and I don't know where that's gonna go, if it's gonna go anywhere at all\",<ref name=\"McAdams\" /> but she ultimately confirmed her role during the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /> [[Jessica Chastain]] had been approached for the role before McAdams, but turned down the opportunity because she felt she was \"only going to get one shot at being in a Marvel film\" and wanted to be a lead character.<ref name=\"Chastain\" /> [[Mads Mikkelsen]] entered into early negotiations to play a villain in August,<ref name=\"VarietyMikkelsen\" /> \"one of a number of actors being considered for the unspecified villainous role.\"<ref name=\"DeadlineMikkelsen\" />\n\nIn September 2015, ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn]] stated that many of the crew that worked on that film were unable to return for [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2|its sequel]], because they had committed to ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"Crew\" /> Derrickson also revealed that Gunn had provided notes on the script, beyond the general conversing the MCU directors have between themselves for their films.<ref name=\"GunnNotes\" /> At the end of the month, Feige stated that additional casting announcements would be made \"before the end of the year\",<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\" /> and by early November, [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] entered negotiations to appear in the film as Nicodemus West, a rival of Strange.<ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" /> Derrickson had offered the role to Stuhlbarg because he was interested in working with the actor, and he agreed to join the cast after reading some Doctor Strange comics and being drawn to the character's \"guilt-ridden arc\" where West \"blames himself for ruining the surgery on Strange's hands and robbing him of his ability to operate\".<ref name=\"StuhlbargReasons\" />\n\nFeige felt that the visuals of the film needed \"to be a [[Steve Ditko|Ditko]]/[[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]]/[[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]/''[[The Matrix]]'' mind-trip\",<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> and said that \"You don't get into it in ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', but if a scientist went to [[Hogwarts]] he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not going to spend a lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds.\"<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''Harry Potter'', wanting \"to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Feige called ''Doctor Strange'' the \"doorway\" into the supernatural side of the MCU,<ref name=\"FeigeAprilSupernatural\" /> a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the ''Doctor Strange'' comics \"broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel multiverse]]\".<ref name=\"MCUMultiverse\" /> Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' \"[[Earth-616]] and Earth 617\", but would instead feature \"dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them\",<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.<ref name=\"DarkDimension\" /><ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\n[[Astrophysicist]] [[Adam Frank]] served as a scientific consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood.<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" /> Frank advised on \"the human experience of space and time\", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or \"had this enlarged perspective.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant\" /> He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate that \"amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities\u2014people are used to that in their lives. So I think it makes sense to them, and it's exciting to them\". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a \"great thing ... speaking as a scientist\", saying that \"they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Nepal]] on November 4, 2015, under the [[working title]] ''Checkmate''.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /><ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]], serving as cinematographer for the film after doing the same on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', described ''Doctor Strange'' as Marvel's ''Fantasia'', and noted that a lot of [[previsualization]] was required to figure out how to shoot the \"[[Psychedelia|psychedelic]]\", [[M. C. Escher]]-inspired imagery.<ref name=\"DP\" /> Davis used the [[Arri Alexa#Alexa 65|Arri Alexa 65]] camera for the film,<ref name=\"DavisArriAlexa\" /> along with the [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT Plus]]. [[Vision Research Phantom]] Flex 4Ks, which shoot up to 1000 [[Frame rate|fps]], were used for high speed sequences like Strange's car crash.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\n[[File:Benedict Cumberbatch on the set of Doctor Strange.jpg|thumb|Cumberbatch filming ''Doctor Strange'' in [[Kathmandu]], November 2015]]\nDerrickson chose Nepal as a location to feature an \"Eastern city\" that would not be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]]. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event \"was all the more reason to shoot there\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was \"absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it's so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It's important to a film like this\u2014which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension\u2014that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The eventual filming locations around the [[Kathmandu Valley]] included the [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Swayambhunath]] Temples;<ref name=\"NepalShooting\" /> [[Thamel]] and [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]] in [[Kathmandu]];<ref name=\"NepalShooting4\" /> and the [[Patan Durbar Square]] in [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]].<ref name=\"NepalShooting3\" /><ref name=\"NepalShooting5\" />\n\nProduction moved to [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England on November 11,<ref name=\"Longcross\" /> and was scheduled to stay there until March 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingScheduledEnd\" /> The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as \"very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it's steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with the shape of the streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge.\" For authenticity, the set was dressed with real food, and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people who live on the real Kathmandu street.<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The inside of [[Kamar-Taj]] was also constructed at Longcross, with \"sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary.\" Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a \"truly spiritual, truly magical\" feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu. This and the Kathmandu street were two of twenty-one sets that the crew built at Longcross. Others included Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, and a Hong Kong street \"complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep the rain out.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> [[Citypoint]] on Ropemaker Street, London, doubled as the New York City building where the Ancient One falls to her death.<ref name=\"Citypoint\" />\n\nFilming also took place in Hong Kong,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> and in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /> Additional New York City-set scenes were shot at Shepperton Studios,<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /><ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> and later in London.<ref name=\"LondonFilming\" /> By the end of November, the casting of Mikkelsen and Stuhlbarg was confirmed,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> alongside [[Amy Landecker]] and [[Scott Adkins]] in unspecified roles.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Landecker\" /> Additionally, [[Benedict Wong]] heard about the film from his friend Ejiofor, and sought a role in it himself.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> He was cast as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in January,<ref name=\"Wong\" /> and immediately joined the production for filming.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> [[Lamborghini]] provided six [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n#Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4 Spyder (2016\u2013)|Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4s]] for use in the film, one of which the production wrecked during filming.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> Lamborghini said that they felt \"there are a lot of characteristics of Doctor Strange that are connected with the Lamborghini philosophy.\"<ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> The Lamborghini crash scene was filmed at [[Northfleet]], Kent by the [[River Thames]].<ref name=\"KentFilming\" /> Also in January 2016, filming took place at [[Exeter College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> The next month, Feige revealed that the film originally had a prologue that took place in [[CERN]], due to the real world research being done at the facility on alternate dimensions and parallel universes.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> Production moved to New York City's [[Flatiron District]] in April,<ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> where set photos revealed that Zara Phythian had joined the cast.<ref name=\"Phythian\" /> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in New York City on April 3, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn June 2016, a [[Diamond Select Toys]] press release for ''Doctor Strange'' toys, in their Marvel [[Minimates]] line, named Mikkelsen's character [[Kaecilius]] and McAdams' character [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]].<ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> Mikkelsen's role was confirmed in an official tie-in comic for the film,<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> while McAdams' was confirmed at San Diego Comic Con 2016.<ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> Additionally, [[Benjamin Bratt]] was revealed to have been cast<ref name=\"Bratt\" /> as Jonathan Pangborn;<ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /> Adkins' role was revealed to be Lucian, a follower of Kaecilius;<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> and Landecker's role was later revealed to be anesthesiologist Dr. Bruner.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> The latter was mostly cut from the film,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> with Landecker explaining that she had been cast in the small role, for two scenes at the beginning of the film, because Derrickson was a fan of her performance in ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which also starred Stuhlbarg. After filming her first scene, in which she assists Strange with a surgery, Landecker asked not to be involved in the other scene because she had no lines for it and was only seen from behind, and instead wished to attend a special premiere at the [[White House]] for her series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''. The actress believed she was later cut from the first scene, but she is still credited for a brief appearance.<ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> Also, Derrickson revealed that [[Lulu Wilson]] had been cast as Strange's sister, for a scene depicting her drowning at a young age. The scene had been shot, and Derrickson thought it was \"great [as a] self-contained scene\", but it \"didn't work\" with the rest of the film, and was cut.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" />\n\nAlso at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson noted that there were still \"a couple pickup shoots\" to do for the film to \"clarify the logic\".<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> Further content for the film's training sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences \"loved [the training portion of the film] and wanted more\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August.<ref name=\"WongReshootWrap\" /> [[Dan Harmon]] wrote material for these additional scenes,<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> which Derrickson described as \"script analysis and dialogue work\", not enough to receive credit in the film.<ref name=\"Harmon2\" /> Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to \"give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts.\"<ref name=\"Harmon3\" /> Before the film's sets were demolished, ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' director [[Taika Waititi]] took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting [[Chris Hemsworth]]'s [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. The scene was for ''Ragnarok'' and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to ''Doctor Strange'' as a mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" /> A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential ''Doctor Strange'' sequel.<ref name=\"PostCreditScene\" /> Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective ''Doctor Strange'' scene, and \"kept throwing lines at\" Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film.<ref name=\"GunnCameos\" /> Additional options Gunn filmed included Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word [[wikt:excelsior|excelsior]] meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being \"totally crazy\"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a ''[[Garfield]]'' book, noting how the character \"HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!\". Gunn felt the ''Garfield'' option was originally meant to appear in the final version of the film, but ended up being too long for the scene.<ref name=\"GunnLeeOptions\" /> By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.<ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" />\n\nFeige described the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, \"hopefully it helps bend people's minds even more than with just the flat screen.\"<ref name=\"Feige3DUse\" /> He said that \"there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional story that is happening through visuals\". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.<ref name=\"Feige3DCollider\" /> Over one hour of footage in the film was \"specially formatted\" for IMAX.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\nVisual effects for ''Doctor Strange'' were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Method Studios]], [[Framestore]], Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV,<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> contributing to 1450 effects shots. [[Previsualization]] was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals).<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> Visual effects supervisor [[Stephane Ceretti]], who also worked on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', explained the similarities and differences between the two films, saying, \"there's some resemblance in some of the things that we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In [''Guardians''], it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. ''Guardians'' was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" />\n\nFurther discussing the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as \"the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [which] were all about these weird visuals\",<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> as well as \"a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher\".<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from \"a bunch of experimental, [[fractal]] videos from [[YouTube]]\" that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game ''[[Monument Valley (video game)|Monument Valley]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesVisuals\" /> Derrickson's \"ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects to do things that are fresh and new\u2014to not just blow things up.\"<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them \"to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning...\" Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action \"in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we've seen in any other movies.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on ''The Oath'' comic, while adding that the end fight was \"an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork\" from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take ''[[Inception]]'' \"to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of \"a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it\", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing \"which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder\".<ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" />\n\n[[File:Doctor Strange mirror dimension.jpg|thumb|left|The Manhattan mirror sequence was mostly filmed on green screen (top), with visual effects added by [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]] (bottom).<ref name=\"FXguide\" />]]\nILM worked on the folding Manhattan mirror sequence (chosen because of their work creating a digital New York in ''The Avengers'') and the time fight sequence in Hong Kong, which consisted of 200 and 150 shots, respectively. They began work on the film 10 months before filming began to plan out the Manhattan sequence; it was mainly CGI, though some New York location shots were used. The sequence was mainly handled by ILM's San Francisco and Vancouver offices. The Hong Kong time sequence was done mainly by ILM's London office. ILM also created digital doubles for many of the actors, which were shared with the other vendors. Method Studios, who worked on the [[Microverse|Quantum Realm]] in ''Ant-Man'', worked on the \"magical mystery tour\" sequence, with Strange hurtling through various dimensions. The sequence was handled by Method's Los Angeles studio, with their Vancouver studio contributing the opening shot of the sequence. The only shot Method did not work on in the sequence was the one that linked to Dormammu, as Luma Pictures assisted in his creation (they handled his other appearances in the film). Method created 7 dimensions for the sequence: the initial wormhole to the \"Speaker Cone\"; the Bioluminesce world; the fractals of \"soft solid\" world; a version of the Quantum Realm; Strange falling through his own eye and Cosmic Scream; the Dark Dimension; and the Shape Shifting realm. The Shape Shifting realm originally had Strange morphing and changing shape, but that was ultimately removed as Derrickson felt the audience needed to see Cumberbatch. Method's Vancouver studio created Strange's car crash, the rooftop training, and the sequence in which Strange experiments with time on an apple in the Kamar-Taj library. The car crash blended the high speed photography and some green screen sequences, with digital assets for both Cumberbatch and the car. In total, Method worked on 270 effects shots.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\nFramestore was chosen to work on the Cloak of Levitation, due to their work creating [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Ceretti called Cloak's actions \"kind of scripted but not as deeply\" as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process \"we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" /> Framestore also worked on environment shots, the [[Mandelbrot set]] sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form \"one of the hardest effects we've had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful.\" Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a [[geode]]. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as \"it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [When he is talking to Strange] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff\u2026 these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [a] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [look] of the entire space.\" On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, \"We tried to make it alive all the time\u2014the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment,\" with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit \"with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [with] colors, crazy blacklight colors.\" He continued, \"It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [that] we really tried to be faithful to.\"<ref name=\"IGNVFX2\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Doctor Strange (soundtrack)}}\nIn May 2016, [[Michael Giacchino]] revealed that he would score the film.<ref name=\"Giacchino\" /> Derrickson called the score \"magic in the literal sense of the word,\" adding Giacchino \"is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with [[Temp track|temp music]].\"<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"AbbeyRoad\" /> During a recording session, [[Paul McCartney]] heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to [[The Beatles]] song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\".<ref name=\"Walrus\" /> Derrickson, a [[Bob Dylan]] fan, looked for a place in the film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song \"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name=\"BobDylanPinkFloyd\" /><ref name=\"PinkFloyd\" /> Derrickson had hoped to use either \"Interstellar Overdrive\" or [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\" for the film's credits, but the [[Royalty payment#Music royalties|royalties]] to use either in the credits were too expensive, resulting in Giacchino creating the track \"The Master of the Mystic End Credits\".<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> A soundtrack album from [[Hollywood Records]] was released digitally on October 21, 2016, with a physical release on November 18, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn August 2015, a concept art trailer narrated by Derrickson was shown at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]]. The images showed artwork of Cumberbatch in a traditional Doctor Strange outfit from the comics, as well as a rough sequence of the plot, highlighting points such as Strange's car crash, his journey for healing, and fighting Ejiofor as Mordo (before the character was moved away from a villainous role in the film per discussions between Derrickson and the actor).<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"D232015\" /> The trailer was met with \"a very big reaction from the gathered crowd.\"<ref name=\"D232015\" />\n\nOn April 12, 2016, the first teaser trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.<ref name=\"KimmelTrailer\" /><ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared the \"series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes\" featured in the trailer to the film ''Inception'',<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> as did Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]''. Forbes added that the structure of the trailer resembled early marketing for the film ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to ''The Matrix'' and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of [[Hugh Laurie]]'s [[Gregory House]] from ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', calling them not \"necessarily a real problem, of course ... [but] there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: due to the nature of the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material.\" McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of \"Tilda Swinton literally knock[ing] Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body,\" but concluded, \"as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured\" than the first trailer for ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Marvel Comics]] released a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|prelude tie-in comic]] written by Will Corona Pilgrim, with art by Jorge Forn\u00e9s.<ref name=\"PreludeComic\" /> The issue sees four Masters of the Mystic Arts\u2013Kaecilius, Wong, Tina Minoru and Daniel Drumm\u2013pursue a woman who has stolen a mystical relic.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> A second issue, centered on the [[Ancient One]] training apprentices in the magical arts at [[Kamar-Taj]], was released a month later.<ref name=\"PreludeComic2\" /> Derrickson, Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor, McAdams, Mikkelsen, and Wong attended San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where they debuted an exclusive clip and the second trailer for the film.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> The next month, the same Comic-Con clip was screened at the [[Asia Pop Comic Convention Manila]].<ref name=\"AsiaPopClip\" /> In September 2016, an additional prelude comic was released, centered on Kaecilius,<ref name=\"InfinitePrelude\" /> while behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' Blu-ray.<ref name=\"CapCWHomeMedia\" /> Also in September, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Broadcom]], [[Synchrony Financial|Synchrony Bank]], and [[Society for Science & the Public]], announced \"The Magic of STEM Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in [[STEM fields|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields]]. The challenge was for contestants to submit videos of them finding mentors to explore ideas once thought to only be possible with magic. Five winners would attend the world premiere of the film, and receive a tour of [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], as well as a $1,000 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving a mentorship with Walt Disney Studio's Digital Team.<ref name=\"ScienceContest\" />\n\nOn October 10, 2016, approximately 15 minutes of footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" /> Umberto Gonzales of [[TheWrap]] called the footage \"stunning to behold\". He added that a sequence shown in which the Ancient One sends Strange \"on his first trippy tour through the multiverse\" was \"where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really is something to behold in IMAX 3D,\" concluding that \"after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film.\"<ref name=\"TheWrapIMAXReaction\" /> Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was \"dizzying\" and \"far weirder and wilder than [the] trailers are letting on,\" though felt it was a bit difficult \"to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)\". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, \"[[Seth Rogen]]'s comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushIMAXReaction\" /> [[IGN]]'s Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where \"Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through\".<ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\nMarvel provided [[Twitter]] stickers, [[Giphy]] content, [[Facebook]] Live, [[Snapchat]] lenses and filter, [[Tumblr]] stunts, and [[Instagram]] special content related to the film. Additionally, [[Microsoft Surface]] had a promotional sponsorship of the film, due to the use of the device in the filmmaking process. A partnership with [[Google]]'s [[Tilt Brush]] app featured a \"Mixed Reality\" \"stunt with artists across Los Angeles, London and Hong Kong, inspired by different dimensions in ''Doctor Strange'' and recreating the worlds in VR for an immersive visual experience.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Doctor Strange'' held its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016,<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> and had its premiere in Hollywood at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] and [[El Capitan Theatre]] on October 20, 2016.<ref name=\"HollywoodPremiere\" /><ref name=\"HollywoodPremiere2\" /> The film was released in the United Kingdom on October 25, 2016,<ref name=\"UKRelease\" /> alongside a total of 33 markets in its first weekend, with 213 IMAX screens in 32 of those markets.<ref name=\"DeadlineIntWknd1\" /> It was screened at the [[Entertainment Weekly|EW PopFest]] on October 28, 2016 in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"EWPopFest\" /> ''Doctor Strange''{{'}}s North America release on November 4 took place in 3,882 venues, of which 3,530 were in 3D, along with 379 IMAX theaters, 516 premium large-format (Disney's biggest release in that format to date), and 189 [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] locations.<ref name=\"DeadlineBOProjections3\" /> Overall, ''Doctor Strange'' had the widest IMAX release ever globally, along with being the first film to release on more than 1,000 IMAX screens.<ref name=\"DeadlineIntWknd1\" /> It was previously reported to have been scheduled for a July 8, 2016 release,<ref name=\"Phoenix2\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> before the production schedule shifted to accommodate Cumberbatch's other commitments.<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /><ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" /> ''Doctor Strange'' is part of Phase Three of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseThree\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''Doctor Strange'' was released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on February 14, 2017, and on [[Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray 3D]] and [[DVD]] on February 28, 2017.

Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" /> Mara Reinstein of ''[[US Weekly]]'' called the film \"joyless\" and wrote, \"Despite [Benedict Cumberbatch's] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here \u2013 save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations.\"<ref name=\"USWeeklyReview\" /> [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' called ''Doctor Strange'' \"an awkwardly clich\u00e9-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality\" and said, \"None of it makes any sense...

There's so much progress that can be made.\" He would like to follow the example of ''The Dark Knight'' and \"bring in a villain where you really got to go deep [and have] a more visceral experience\". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more ''Doctor Strange'' solo film.<ref name=\"DenofGeekOct2016\" /> Derrickson hoped to feature<!--NIGHTMARE IS ALREADY WIKILINKED TO THE COMIC CHARACTER ABOVE--> Nightmare in a potential sequel,<ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is being \"kept in the loop\" about how the ''Avengers'' films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]].<ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" /> Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing [[Clea]] appear in a potential sequel.<ref name=\"CleaSequelPotential\" /> By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, ''[[Locke & Key (TV series)|Locke & Key]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelReturn\" /> Despite no official announcements, Wong said in October 2018 that he expected filming on a sequel to begin by the end of that year.<ref name=\"WongSequelFilming\" /> By December 2018, Derrickson had \"quietly\" finalized a deal to return to direct the sequel, and Cumberbatch and Wong were confirmed to reprise their roles from the first film, with McAdams stated as likely to return.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed2\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the sequel was announced as ''Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'' with a release date of May 7, 2021. Feige and Derrickson revealed that the sequel would have more of a horror tone than the first film, that [[Elizabeth Olsen]] would reprise her MCU role of [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch]], and that her [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' would tie into the events of the film.<ref name=\"SequelHorror\" /><ref name=\"SequelReleaseDate\" /> The film would also tie into the Disney+ series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.<ref name=\"LokiSequel\" /> In October 2019, ''Collider'' reported that Jade Bartlett would be the film's screenwriter.<ref name=\"SequelBartlett\" /> In January 2020, Marvel and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences, but would remain an executive producer on the film. No delays were expected for the start of filming that May.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelExit\" /> By February, it was reported that [[Sam Raimi]] was in negotiations to take over as director, Ejiofor would return whereas McAdams would not,<ref name=\"Raimi\" /> and ''Loki'' head writer  Michael Waldron was hired to rewrite the script.<ref name=\"WaldronTHR\" /><ref name=\"WaldronCollider\" /> Due

was shooting some stunt work with Zoe Saldana \u2013 I run between sets on one soundstage. Stan laughing at The Doors of Perception was what ended up in the film, but we shot other options, such as \u2013 Stan reading a book and leaning into the guy next to him, saying, 'Do you know what excelsior means?' \u2013 Stan throwing his head back and laughing as hard as he can, yelling, 'I'm laughing for no reason! I'm totally crazy!' \u2013 And, my favorite, Stan laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, hooting, 'He HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!' Supposedly that one was in the film for a while, but it ended up being too long for the scene.

He also wrote children's plays, radio dramas, and dramatisations of ''Gormenghast'' and ''The Mosquito Coast'' for the David Glass Ensemble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unitedagents.co.uk/john-constable#profile-4 |title=John Constable |publisher=United Agents |date=2000-04-23 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986 he moved to The Borough, in Southwark, then a poor and much maligned part of south London. The area had a profound influence on his work, which draws freely on its 2,000 year history and the far-reaching changes that saw it reinvented as prime real estate in the heart of London. In Sicily in 1994 he met his companion Katharine Nicholls, a craftworker and community outreach worker. In their activism and esoteric work at Crossbones and with outsiders, she also became known as Katy Kaos. One of the poems in ''The Southwark Mysteries'' is entitled ''kateEkaos''.<ref>[Constable, John. 1999. The Southwark Mysteries London: Oberon Books pp. 92, 288]</ref> She stage-managed his solo shows and site-specific events, co-produced the epic productions of ''The Southwark Mysteries'' and created the original \u201cHand-Maid\u201d limited edition of ''The Book of The Goose''.\n\nIn 1995 he wrote and performed a solo show ''I Was An Alien Sex God''. This inaugurated a new phase of experimental writing which produced his best-known work, ''The Southwark Mysteries''. These began in 1996 as a cycle of mystical poems revealed to his shamanistic alter-ego, John Crow, by \u201cThe Goose\u201d, who claimed to have been buried in the unconsecrated Cross Bones Graveyard. The Winchester Geese were medieval sex workers in the Bankside brothels licensed by the Bishop of Winchester under Ordinances dating back to 1161. ''The Southwark Mysteries'' grew from a poem cycle to a contemporary mystery play, first performed in Shakespeare's Globe and Southwark Cathedral on 23 April 2000.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2012 he was artistic director of the community arts group Southwark Mysteries, conducting guided walks, workshops and site-specific performances inspired by the work. The Halloween of Cross Bones, conducted annually from 1998 to 2010, ended with a candle-lit procession to the gates of Crossbones, the outcasts' burial ground. He led a long campaign to protect the burial ground and to establish a garden of remembrance on the site. A new production of The Southwark Mysteries was staged in Southwark Cathedral in 2010.<ref>[Constable. rev. ed. 2011.

It explores the adventures of two white British musicians visiting Trinidad for fresh inspiration and getting out of their depth under the heady influence of Carnival.  The Guardian's Robin Thornber wrote: \"It's a powerful piece that works on many levels, using the exotic trappings of its setting to cast its spell, but probing incessantly into the murky depths of racial and sexual mythology.\"<ref>[Thornber, Robin. 1984. The Guardian]</ref>  The play, directed by Roland Rees for Foco Novo, opened at the [[New End Theatre]], Hampstead followed by a UK tour.  Other early work includes ''The Fit Up'' (Nuffield Theatre Southampton) and ''The Complete Casanova'' (Proteus-Horshoe Theatre, Croydon Warehouse).  He was commissioned by RADA to write ''Hot Fondue'', a contemporary play loosely based on Schnitzler's ''La Ronde'', directed by Roland Rees14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/hidden/plays-directed-roland-rees/ |title=Plays directed by Roland Rees \u2013 Unfinished Histories |publisher=Unfinishedhistories.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, having worked with physical theatre director [[David Glass (director)|David Glass]] on the devised show ''Bozo's Dead'', he was commissioned to write the stage adaptation of ''[[Gormenghast (series)|Gormenghast]]'' for the David Glass Ensemble.  His 1994 play ''Tulip Futures'' concerned [[Tulip mania]], the seventeenth century speculation on tulips which nearly bankrupt the Dutch economy.  Tulip Futures was nominated for the [[Peggy Ramsay Award]].\n\n''Iceman'' is a black comedy about the war on drugs: an undercover policeman gets so deep into his cover, he winds up busting himself. It was short-listed for the [[Verity Bargate Award]] and produced by Brute Farce at the [[White Bear Theatre]], Kennington.\n\nIn 1995, Constable wrote and performed ''I Was an Alien Sex God'', directed by Di Sherlock.  The show opened in London at [[Battersea Arts Centre]], followed by a popular and critically acclaimed run on the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].  Ian Shuttleworth's review began by quoting its most memorable line: '... \"Let's get this straight, Commissioner - you're saying that if David Bowie and I have sex, it'll destroy the universe?\"  John Constable fully exploits his passing resemblance to the Thin White Duke in his mind-blowingly weird one-man show which takes in acid trips, mind-body transference, quantum physics, Berlin gay clubs and the end of the world as we know it.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/i-was-an-alien-sex-god-1596842.html |title=I Was an Alien Sex God |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-08-19 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nConstable's subsequent work seems intent on dissolving the lines between art and life.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}  In the introduction to Sha-Manic Plays, he acknowledged John Crow as a literary persona appearing in his work in various guises.  In his next work, John Crow took on a life of his own.  According to Constable, The Southwark Mysteries was \"revealed by The Goose to John Crow at Crossbones... on the night of the 23rd November 1996.  My shamanic double had somehow raised the Spirit of a medieval Whore, licensed by a Bishop, yet allegedly denied Christian burial.\"<ref>[Constable, John. 1999. The Southwark Mysteries London: Oberon Books pg.9]</ref>  In ''The Book of The Constable'', one of the poems of ''The Southwark Mysteries'', 'The Goose and the Crow' seem to prophesy the chain of coincidences that  lead Constable to write a contemporary mystery play with the support of the Very Rev'd [[Colin Slee]], Dean of [[Southwark Cathedral]], and the actor [[Mark Rylance]], then artistic director of [[Shakespeare's Globe]].  In the play, Jesus ('The Son of Man in the street') returns to Southwark to save its lost souls, the heretic John Crow, and The Goose in the guise of Mary Magdalene.  The play premi\u00e8red in [[Shakespeare's Globe]] \u2013 with the climactic Harrowing of Hell scene staged in [[Southwark Cathedral]] \u2013 on Easter Sunday, 23 April 2000.  The Dean defended the performance of this controversial work in the Cathedral.  A headline in The Sunday Telegraph read: 'Dean rejects critics of Southwark's \"swearing Jesus\" Mystery Play'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwarkmysteries.co.uk/#/mysteries-2000/4541728558 |title=Southwark Mysteries \u2013 Crossbones |publisher=Southwarkmysteries.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nSelected texts from The Southwark Mysteries featured in his site-specific ritual dramas - ''The Anatomy Class'' ([[The Old Operating Theatre]]), The Goose At Liberty ([[Southwark Playhouse]]), The Halloween of Cross Bones, conducted annually from 1998 to 2010, which culminated at the gates of the former burial ground.\n\nConstable's later work similarly drew on the history and contemporary culture of his south London neighbourhood.  He wrote the libretto for ''South of the River'', the [[English National Opera|ENO]] community opera performed in a big top in [[Potters Fields]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/222 |title=South of the River - a \"no soap\" opera about Southwark [10 June 2002&#93; |publisher=London-se1.co.uk |date=2002-06-10 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, he wrote a one-man show ''Spare'' - inspired by the life and work of the south London artist and magician [[Austin Osman Spare]] \u2013 which he performed in [[Treadwell's Bookshop]] and in the White Bear Theatre, Kennington, where Spare himself used to drink and had once exhibited his paintings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://internationaltimes.it/spare/ |title=Spare &#124; It |publisher=Internationaltimes.it |date=2013-10-17 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe first part of The Southwark Mysteries comprises a cycle of mystical poems, seven Vision Books in which The Goose initiates John Crow into her \u201cSecret History\u201d and \u201cMysteries\u201d. These two literary personas guide the reader on a journey through 2,000 years of Southwark's history, reimagined through the eyes of outcasts and outsiders. The verses range freely, from archaic ballad form to contemporary rap..The Glossolalia asserts that these are magical texts, including \u201cThe Goose's Heresy\u201d, an \u201cHermetic tradition passed down by Bankside actors and whores\u201d.\n\nIn the lead-up to the millennium, Constable performed poetry and ritual dramas at The Warp, a series of fortnightly 24-hour parties in the caverns under London Bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cosmictriggerplay.com/the-festival/avant-garden/ |title=Avant Garden &#124; Cosmic Trigger |publisher=Cosmictriggerplay.com |date=1996-11-23 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref> In the first decade of the 21st century, he appeared, often as John Crow, in theatres, clubs and festivals worldwide.

He adapted the John Wyndham novels ''The Kraken Wakes'' and ''Chocky'' for [[BBC Radio 4]] - subsequently released on DVD in the BBC Classic Radio Sci-Fi series. He has been interviewed many times on the radio about his literary work and appears in many films about the work at Crossbones.

He was artistic director of the company during 1989. In the 1990s, he wrote many children's plays for Proteus, including adaptations of ''Maeterlinck's The Bluebird'', Thackeray's ''The Rose and The Ring'', Dickens' ''A Christmas Carol'', ''Rumpelstiltskin'' and ''The Emperor's New Clothes''.<ref>[http://www.proteustheatre.com/?page=archive ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}</ref> As artistic director of the community arts group, Southwark Mysteries, he conducted children's workshops in schools and community centres. His popular workshops included the ''Our Place and Our Story'' programmes, which used local history and cultural identity as springboards for the participants' own devised work. His ''George And The Dragon'' workshops, first performed in schools in south London, were taken to Cumbria as part of an anti-racist programme. In 2014, he was the dramaturg for Half Moon Young People's Theatre's #LimehouseLandmark programme, featuring devised performances inspired by the history of their building in Limehouse.<ref>[https://www.halfmoon.org.uk/limehouselandmark-programme/]</ref>\n\n==Walks, talks and activism==\nSince 1998, Constable has conducted guided walks around his Borough and Bankside neighbourhood.

He performed his poetry at the SFC's 1998 \u201cSex Symposium\u201d<ref>[15 August 1998. Freedom. \u201cSexual Freedom Parade\u201d.]</ref> and escorted Dr Tuppy Owens to present their petition at No 10 Downing Street.\n\nSince 1998, he has led a campaign by \u201cFriends of Crossbones\u201d to protect the site of the Crossbones burial ground and to establish a garden of remembrance on the site. He and Katharine Nicholls curate a shrine to \u201cthe outcast dead\u201d at the gates in Redcross Way, to which hundreds of people have contributed mementos. He performed The Halloween of Crossbones every year from 1998 to 2010, and has led vigils at the gates on the 23rd of every month since June 2004.<ref>[Lipson, Faye. Cross Bones. Fortean Times. December 2014. pg. 38]</ref> Having raised public awareness of Crossbones' historic and cultural importance, he lobbied the site owners Transport for London (TfL) to open a public garden there. 2014 marked an important new phase in this work, when TfL granted a lease for a 'meanwhile garden' to Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).<ref>[Evening Standard. 11 December 2014. ]</ref>\n\n==Urban shamanism, magic and mysticism==\nBeginning in 1998 Constable began conducting The Halloween of Crossbones and other ritual dramas. In this capacity he himself became widely known as John Crow, the south London shaman who channels The Goose, the spirit of a medieval prostitute he encountered at Cross Bones cemetery.<ref>[http://www.planetslade.com/cross-bones-04.html]</ref> Constable's work is inherently syncretic.\n\nIn the Glossolalia he states that shamanism is not a fixed belief-system. The Southwark Mysteries explicitly honour the poetic \u201cSpirit\u201d above \u201cthe letter of the law\u201d, art over religion, \u201cLiberty\u201d as a spiritual state in which contrary energies find creative expression. His essay Transgressive Shamanism<ref>[http://internationaltimes.it/transgressive-shamanism/]</ref> considers how the West has appropriated the practices of indigenous shamans, especially relating to the use of psychoactive sacraments. It charts the transgressive use of such substances by artists, suggesting alternative \u201clines of transmission\u201d in art. His Shamanic Playhouse workshops explore other ways of effecting altered mind-states. He speaks of \u201crepatterning reality\u201d and of the associations of the number 23 with \u201crevelation and transformation\u201d.<ref>[Constable. 1999. pg. 278]</ref>\n\nInterviewed about his 2013 play, Spare, Constable expresses a sense of kinship with the south London artist and magician Austin Osman Spare and his intuitive approach to magic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://inthechimehours.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221150009/http://inthechimehours.com/ |archive-date=21 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 poetry book 'Spark In The Dark' is prefaced by Blake's epigram: \u201cWithout Contraries is no progression\u201d - and this idea is implicit in many of the poems.

The area had a profound influence on his work, which draws freely on its 2,000 year history and the far-reaching changes that saw it reinvented as prime real estate in the heart of London. In Sicily in 1994 he met his companion Katharine Nicholls, a craftworker and community outreach worker. In their activism and esoteric work at Crossbones and with outsiders, she also became known as Katy Kaos. One of the poems in ''The Southwark Mysteries'' is entitled ''kateEkaos''.<ref>[Constable, John. 1999. The Southwark Mysteries London: Oberon Books pp. 92, 288]</ref> She stage-managed his solo shows and site-specific events, co-produced the epic productions of ''The Southwark Mysteries'' and created the original \u201cHand-Maid\u201d limited edition of ''The Book of The Goose''.\n\nIn 1995 he wrote and performed a solo show ''I Was An Alien Sex God''. This inaugurated a new phase of experimental writing which produced his best-known work, ''The Southwark Mysteries''. These began in 1996 as a cycle of mystical poems revealed to his shamanistic alter-ego, John Crow, by \u201cThe Goose\u201d, who claimed to have been buried in the unconsecrated Cross Bones Graveyard. The Winchester Geese were medieval sex workers in the Bankside brothels licensed by the Bishop of Winchester under Ordinances dating back to 1161. ''The Southwark Mysteries'' grew from a poem cycle to a contemporary mystery play, first performed in Shakespeare's Globe and Southwark Cathedral on 23 April 2000.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2012 he was artistic director of the community arts group Southwark Mysteries, conducting guided walks, workshops and site-specific performances inspired by the work. The Halloween of Cross Bones, conducted annually from 1998 to 2010, ended with a candle-lit procession to the gates of Crossbones, the outcasts' burial ground. He led a long campaign to protect the burial ground and to establish a garden of remembrance on the site. A new production of The Southwark Mysteries was staged in Southwark Cathedral in 2010.<ref>[Constable. rev. ed. 2011.

It explores the adventures of two white British musicians visiting Trinidad for fresh inspiration and getting out of their depth under the heady influence of Carnival.  The Guardian's Robin Thornber wrote: \"It's a powerful piece that works on many levels, using the exotic trappings of its setting to cast its spell, but probing incessantly into the murky depths of racial and sexual mythology.\"<ref>[Thornber, Robin. 1984. The Guardian]</ref>  The play, directed by Roland Rees for Foco Novo, opened at the [[New End Theatre]], Hampstead followed by a UK tour.  Other early work includes ''The Fit Up'' (Nuffield Theatre Southampton) and ''The Complete Casanova'' (Proteus-Horshoe Theatre, Croydon Warehouse).  He was commissioned by RADA to write ''Hot Fondue'', a contemporary play loosely based on Schnitzler's ''La Ronde'', directed by Roland Rees14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/hidden/plays-directed-roland-rees/ |title=Plays directed by Roland Rees \u2013 Unfinished Histories |publisher=Unfinishedhistories.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, having worked with physical theatre director [[David Glass (director)|David Glass]] on the devised show ''Bozo's Dead'', he was commissioned to write the stage adaptation of ''[[Gormenghast (series)|Gormenghast]]'' for the David Glass Ensemble.  His 1994 play ''Tulip Futures'' concerned [[Tulip mania]], the seventeenth century speculation on tulips which nearly bankrupt the Dutch economy.  Tulip Futures was nominated for the [[Peggy Ramsay Award]].\n\n''Iceman'' is a black comedy about the war on drugs: an undercover policeman gets so deep into his cover, he winds up busting himself. It was short-listed for the [[Verity Bargate Award]] and produced by Brute Farce at the [[White Bear Theatre]], Kennington.\n\nIn 1995, Constable wrote and performed ''I Was an Alien Sex God'', directed by Di Sherlock.  The show opened in London at [[Battersea Arts Centre]], followed by a popular and critically acclaimed run on the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].  Ian Shuttleworth's review began by quoting its most memorable line: '... \"Let's get this straight, Commissioner - you're saying that if David Bowie and I have sex, it'll destroy the universe?\"  John Constable fully exploits his passing resemblance to the Thin White Duke in his mind-blowingly weird one-man show which takes in acid trips, mind-body transference, quantum physics, Berlin gay clubs and the end of the world as we know it.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/i-was-an-alien-sex-god-1596842.html |title=I Was an Alien Sex God |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-08-19 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nConstable's subsequent work seems intent on dissolving the lines between art and life.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}  In the introduction to Sha-Manic Plays, he acknowledged John Crow as a literary persona appearing in his work in various guises.  In his next work, John Crow took on a life of his own.  According to Constable, The Southwark Mysteries was \"revealed by The Goose to John Crow at Crossbones... on the night of the 23rd November 1996.  My shamanic double had somehow raised the Spirit of a medieval Whore, licensed by a Bishop, yet allegedly denied Christian burial.\"<ref>[Constable, John. 1999. The Southwark Mysteries London: Oberon Books pg.9]</ref>  In ''The Book of The Constable'', one of the poems of ''The Southwark Mysteries'', 'The Goose and the Crow' seem to prophesy the chain of coincidences that  lead Constable to write a contemporary mystery play with the support of the Very Rev'd [[Colin Slee]], Dean of [[Southwark Cathedral]], and the actor [[Mark Rylance]], then artistic director of [[Shakespeare's Globe]].  In the play, Jesus ('The Son of Man in the street') returns to Southwark to save its lost souls, the heretic John Crow, and The Goose in the guise of Mary Magdalene.  The play premi\u00e8red in [[Shakespeare's Globe]] \u2013 with the climactic Harrowing of Hell scene staged in [[Southwark Cathedral]] \u2013 on Easter Sunday, 23 April 2000.  The Dean defended the performance of this controversial work in the Cathedral.  A headline in The Sunday Telegraph read: 'Dean rejects critics of Southwark's \"swearing Jesus\" Mystery Play'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwarkmysteries.co.uk/#/mysteries-2000/4541728558 |title=Southwark Mysteries \u2013 Crossbones |publisher=Southwarkmysteries.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nSelected texts from The Southwark Mysteries featured in his site-specific ritual dramas - ''The Anatomy Class'' ([[The Old Operating Theatre]]), The Goose At Liberty ([[Southwark Playhouse]]), The Halloween of Cross Bones, conducted annually from 1998 to 2010, which culminated at the gates of the former burial ground.\n\nConstable's later work similarly drew on the history and contemporary culture of his south London neighbourhood.  He wrote the libretto for ''South of the River'', the [[English National Opera|ENO]] community opera performed in a big top in [[Potters Fields]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/222 |title=South of the River - a \"no soap\" opera about Southwark [10 June 2002&#93; |publisher=London-se1.co.uk |date=2002-06-10 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, he wrote a one-man show ''Spare'' - inspired by the life and work of the south London artist and magician [[Austin Osman Spare]] \u2013 which he performed in [[Treadwell's Bookshop]] and in the White Bear Theatre, Kennington, where Spare himself used to drink and had once exhibited his paintings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://internationaltimes.it/spare/ |title=Spare &#124; It |publisher=Internationaltimes.it |date=2013-10-17 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe first part of The Southwark Mysteries comprises a cycle of mystical poems, seven Vision Books in which The Goose initiates John Crow into her \u201cSecret History\u201d and \u201cMysteries\u201d. These two literary personas guide the reader on a journey through 2,000 years of Southwark's history, reimagined through the eyes of outcasts and outsiders. The verses range freely, from archaic ballad form to contemporary rap..The Glossolalia asserts that these are magical texts, including \u201cThe Goose's Heresy\u201d, an \u201cHermetic tradition passed down by Bankside actors and whores\u201d.\n\nIn the lead-up to the millennium, Constable performed poetry and ritual dramas at The Warp, a series of fortnightly 24-hour parties in the caverns under London Bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cosmictriggerplay.com/the-festival/avant-garden/ |title=Avant Garden &#124; Cosmic Trigger |publisher=Cosmictriggerplay.com |date=1996-11-23 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref> In the first decade of the 21st century, he appeared, often as John Crow, in theatres, clubs and festivals worldwide. He hosted The Palace of Wisdom, an all-night poetry tent at the Glastonbury Festival,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwarkmysteries.co.uk/#/john-constable/4535403213 |title=Southwark Mysteries \u2013 Crossbones |publisher=Southwarkmysteries.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref> where he was a regular performer in the legendary underground Irish Piano Bar.\n\nIn 2014, Spark In The Dark was published by [[Thin Man Press]].<ref name=\"thinmanpress1\"/> This first collection of Constable's poetry ranges from satirical Burlesques to lyrical Spirit Songs. In Mrs God the poet draws on his Welsh Borders upbringing in a \u201cburlesque\u201d that comically subverts the image of a Divine patriarch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMH0ducPFw8 |title=Mrs God |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref> The book also features two experimental prose-poems. Winchester Cathedral:Time Out Of Mind, written during an Arts Council residency at Winchester Cathedral, evokes the misadventures of a medieval monk troubled by visions of the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-architecture.co.uk/architexts/?location_id=21 |title=archiTEXTS - The Texts - John Constable |publisher=Art-architecture.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref> Wennefer is \u201ca cautionary tale\u201d, a visceral retelling of the Isis-Osiris myth set in south London club culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wz08acxw_0 |title=Seth's Oration |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==Songs==\nSongs from The Southwark Mysteries with music by Richard Kilgour featured in the 2000 and 2010 stage productions. Others, with music by Niall McDevitt, were performed at The Halloween of Crossbones. Constable subsequently wrote a number of his own songs - released on goose & crow : spirit songs, featuring Nigel Hoyle and Katy Carr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/artist_921831/bio |title=John Crow |publisher=ReverbNation |date=2018-09-12 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>  On the Gemini City album, Nigel of Bermondsey covered his song The Green Man Is Come.<ref>[http://www.nigelofbermondsey.com/nigelofbermondsey_wp/the-green-man/]</ref> His texts for Beltane, Lammas and Samhain featured on the MegaT album with music by Universal Mind Sound System. His poems ''Spark In the Dark'' and ''I Am The Wind'' featured on Hawklords' 2012 album ''We Are One''. He also contributed lyrics for songs on Hawklords' next two albums -  ''White Rag on Dream'', and ''Damned on Censored''.<ref>[[Hawklords (2008)]]</ref>\n\n==Radio, television and film==\nConstable wrote ''Undesirable Activities'' for the BBC drama series ''Black Silk''. He adapted the John Wyndham novels ''The Kraken Wakes'' and ''Chocky'' for [[BBC Radio 4]] - subsequently released on DVD in the BBC Classic Radio Sci-Fi series. He has been interviewed many times on the radio about his literary work and appears in many films about the work at Crossbones. In the lead-up to the 2010 production of ''The Southwark Mysteries'' he and the Dean of Southwark Cathedral were interviewed on the BBCs Songs of Praise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmqW0odrY7c |title=John Constable praise sings The Southwark Mysteries |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==Children's plays and workshops==\nIn 1987, for Proteus Theatre Company, Constable devised ''Forgotten But Not Gone'' for actors with learning difficulties. He was artistic director of the company during 1989. In the 1990s, he wrote many children's plays for Proteus, including adaptations of ''Maeterlinck's The Bluebird'', Thackeray's ''The Rose and The Ring'', Dickens' ''A Christmas Carol'', ''Rumpelstiltskin'' and ''The Emperor's New Clothes''.<ref>[http://www.proteustheatre.com/?page=archive ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}</ref> As artistic director of the community arts group, Southwark Mysteries, he conducted children's workshops in schools and community centres. His popular workshops included the ''Our Place and Our Story'' programmes, which used local history and cultural identity as springboards for the participants' own devised work. His ''George And The Dragon'' workshops, first performed in schools in south London, were taken to Cumbria as part of an anti-racist programme. In 2014, he was the dramaturg for Half Moon Young People's Theatre's #LimehouseLandmark programme, featuring devised performances inspired by the history of their building in Limehouse.<ref>[https://www.halfmoon.org.uk/limehouselandmark-programme/]</ref>\n\n==Walks, talks and activism==\nSince 1998, Constable has conducted guided walks around his Borough and Bankside neighbourhood. In 2007, Oberon Books published ''Secret Bankside \u2013 Walks In The Outlaw Borough'', a collection of his walks exploring alternative histories of the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oberonbooks.com/secret-bankside |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221517/http://oberonbooks.com/secret-bankside |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> He has been commissioned every year since 2003 to create unusual themed walks for the City of London Festival.<ref>[http://www.barbican.org.uk/film/event-detail.asp?ID=7586]</ref>  He has given talks for groups as diverse as Southwark Council, The Moot With No Name, South East London Folklore Society, Radical Anthropology Group and The Salon For The City.<ref>[http://salonforthecity.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/salon-number-3-london-bone.html]</ref>\n\nHe is the patron of REWRITE, a Southwark-based charity bringing together young people from different backgrounds to fight prejudice and injustice through the power of drama and creative writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rewrite.org.uk/about-us/staff |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213205420/http://www.rewrite.org.uk/about-us/staff |archivedate=2015-02-13 }}</ref> He championed community involvement and local identity in the face of the redevelopment of The Borough and wrote a scathing report on the MIPIM Global Property Fair in Cannes.<ref>[http://johncrowseyeview.wordpress.com/2014/03/12/mipim-my-mipim/]</ref> A long-standing advocate of decriminilisation, he strongly criticised the \u201cWar On Drugs\u201d,<ref>[Ellison, Michael.  23 August 1995. The Guardian. \u201cSpaced-out Oddity\u201d.]</ref> and supported the Sexual Freedom Coalition (SFC)'s campaign for sexual freedom between consenting adults. He performed his poetry at the SFC's 1998 \u201cSex Symposium\u201d<ref>[15 August 1998. Freedom. \u201cSexual Freedom Parade\u201d.]</ref> and escorted Dr Tuppy Owens to present their petition at No 10 Downing Street.\n\nSince 1998, he has led a campaign by \u201cFriends of Crossbones\u201d to protect the site of the Crossbones burial ground and to establish a garden of remembrance on the site. He and Katharine Nicholls curate a shrine to \u201cthe outcast dead\u201d at the gates in Redcross Way, to which hundreds of people have contributed mementos. He performed The Halloween of Crossbones every year from 1998 to 2010, and has led vigils at the gates on the 23rd of every month since June 2004.<ref>[Lipson, Faye. Cross Bones. Fortean Times. December 2014. pg. 38]</ref> Having raised public awareness of Crossbones' historic and cultural importance, he lobbied the site owners Transport for London (TfL) to open a public garden there. 2014 marked an important new phase in this work, when TfL granted a lease for a 'meanwhile garden' to Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).<ref>[Evening Standard. 11 December 2014. ]</ref>\n\n==Urban shamanism, magic and mysticism==\nBeginning in 1998 Constable began conducting The Halloween of Crossbones and other ritual dramas. In this capacity he himself became widely known as John Crow, the south London shaman who channels The Goose, the spirit of a medieval prostitute he encountered at Cross Bones cemetery.<ref>[http://www.planetslade.com/cross-bones-04.html]</ref> Constable's work is inherently syncretic.\n\nIn the Glossolalia he states that shamanism is not a fixed belief-system. The Southwark Mysteries explicitly honour the poetic \u201cSpirit\u201d above \u201cthe letter of the law\u201d, art over religion, \u201cLiberty\u201d as a spiritual state in which contrary energies find creative expression. His essay Transgressive Shamanism<ref>[http://internationaltimes.it/transgressive-shamanism/]</ref> considers how the West has appropriated the practices of indigenous shamans, especially relating to the use of psychoactive sacraments. It charts the transgressive use of such substances by artists, suggesting alternative \u201clines of transmission\u201d in art. His Shamanic Playhouse workshops explore other ways of effecting altered mind-states. He speaks of \u201crepatterning reality\u201d and of the associations of the number 23 with \u201crevelation and transformation\u201d.<ref>[Constable. 1999. pg. 278]</ref>\n\nInterviewed about his 2013 play, Spare, Constable expresses a sense of kinship with the south London artist and magician Austin Osman Spare and his intuitive approach to magic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://inthechimehours.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221150009/http://inthechimehours.com/ |archive-date=21 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 poetry book 'Spark In The Dark' is prefaced by Blake's epigram: \u201cWithout Contraries is no progression\u201d - and this idea is implicit in many of the poems. The last part of the book, Spirit Songs, draws freely on British traditions like the Queen of the May at Beltane.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9quNixlNkk]</ref> By contrast, the final poem Queen of the Moon ('Queen of the vision revealed in the vine / And the leaves of the Shining Tree...') evokes the Brazilian Santo Daime tradition.\n\n==List of works==\n===Plays===\n* Black Mas 1984 Foco Novo tour, New End Theatre Hampstead and Albany Theatre Deptford\n* The Fit Up 1988 Nuffield Theatre Southampton\n* The Complete Casanova 1991 Proteus-Horseshoe Theatre Company, Croydon Warehouse\n* Hot Fondue 1992 RADA\n* Tulip Futures 1994 Soho Theatre Company\n* Dead Man's Handle 1994 Soho Theatre Company\n* Iceman 1997 Brute Farce, White Bear Kennington\n* The False Hairpiece 1997 Proteus Theatre Company, Southwark Playhouse\n* The Goose At Liberty 2000 Southwark Playhouse\n* [[The Southwark Mysteries]] 2000, 2010 Shakespeare's Globe and Southwark Cathedral\n\n===Solo shows===\n* I Was An Alien Sex God 1995 Edinburgh Festival, BAC and Grahamstown Festival (SA)\n* Raingods Become Me 2002 BAC\n* Spare 2013 Treadwells and White Bear Theatre, Kennington\n\n===Stage adaptations===\n* A Christmas Carol 1986 Proteus Theatre Company\n* The Bluebird 1988 Proteus Theatre Company\n* The Rose and The Ring 1990 Proteus Theatre Company\n* Rumpelstiltskin 1991 Proteus Theatre Company\n* The Emperor's New Clothes 1992 Proteus Theatre Company\n* Gormenghast 1992 David Glass Ensemble\n* The Mosquito Coast 1994 David Glass Ensemble\n\n===Devised work===\n* Forgotten But Not Gone 1987 Proteus Theatre Company\n* Bozo's Dead 1991 David Glass Ensemble\n* South of the River 2002 libretto for English National Opera community opera\n\n===Books===\n* Sha-Manic Plays (Black Mas, Dead Man's Handle, Iceman,The False Hairpiece) 1997 Oberon Books\n* The Southwark Mysteries 1999 Oberon Books\n* Gormenghast 2006 Oberon Books\n* Secret Bankside \u2013 Walks In The Outcast Borough 2007 Oberon Books\n* Spark In The Dark 2014 Thin Man Press\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Constable, John}}\n[[Category:1952 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Shropshire]]\n[[Category:People educated at Oswestry School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:20th-century English poets]]\n[[Category:English male poets]]\n[[Category:20th-century British male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Constable_(writer)"}

Established in 1960, The NTS receives its principal funding from grants awarded by the [[Government of Canada]] and from cultural ministries in each of the provinces, with added financial support from private and corporate donors.\n\nThe NTS offers intensive, highly specialized theatre arts training in both English and French languages in a setting that unites all the related disciplines: acting, playwriting, directing, set and costume design, and production.\n\n==Buildings and features==\n[[Image:Monument National.jpg|thumb|The [[Monument-National]] in 2008]]\nThe National Theatre School occupies a historic landmark in Montreal, the [[Monument-National]]  on [[Saint Lawrence Boulevard]], as well as a building in [[The Plateau]] district, at the corner of [[Saint Denis Street]] and Laurier Street.\n\n===Monument-National===\n{{main|Monument-National}}\nThe campus of the National Theatre School stretches all the way to the Monument-National in the core of downtown Montreal. This hundred-year-old theatre, owned and operated by the NTS, has been classified as a heritage building. Situated in the heart of the Quartier des spectacles (Performing Arts District), on the famous \u201cMain\u201d of Boulevard St-Laurent and close to the St-Laurent metro station, is one of the first multi-functional buildings constructed in Canada. Recently restored and renovated, the Monument-National is composed of three performance halls, including a number of spaces offering unlimited conversion and transformation possibilities.\n\nThe Monument-National\u2019s two stages can accommodate every kind of production, from small concerts to large-scale shows. The Ludger-Duvernay Theatre ingeniously integrates the latest technology into a 19th-century architectural gem, while the Studio Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, with its clean lines and Meccano-like permutations, offers exciting flexibility. On the third floor is La Balustrade, a 55-seat cabaret style theatre.\n\n===Michel and Suria Saint-Denis Pavilion===\n\nOnce a juvenile courthouse, the school\u2019s main home, the Michel and Suria Saint-Denis Pavilion, sits on the border between the Plateau Mont-Royal and Mile End neighbourhoods.\n\nThe Pavilion houses rehearsal halls, classrooms (including specially converted spaces for voice, dance, movement, set and costume design and writing), the Andr\u00e9-Pag\u00e9 Studio (a flexible studio space with a 150-seat capacity), the Pauline McGibbon Studio (80-seat capacity), a small costume shop, a sound studio, a lighting laboratory, a projection room, a computer room, a school supplies store, a cafeteria, and a common space equipped with refrigerators and microwaves for the students.\n\n====The Bleviss Family Library====\n\nThe Pavilion also houses Canada's largest collection of theatre related books and manuscripts, both published and unpublished, and audio visual materials available in both official languages. This outstanding collection was founded by [[Alan Bleviss]], a graduate of NTS.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bleviss Family Library|url=http://thalia.ent-nts.ca/in/faces/details.xhtml?id=7b6ff1e7-d7f9-49a5-9621-acb681fa5f29|publisher=NTS|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe notion of a national theatre school first received focused attention as an indirect result of the \"Massey Report\" (the report of the Massey-Levesque [[Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences]] of 1951).<ref>{{cite web|title=Massey Report|url=http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/essays/massey.cfm|publisher=Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref> [[Robertson Davies]], writing the section of the report devoted to theatre, complained that \"facilities for advanced training in the arts of the theatre are non-existent in Canada,\" and that, consequently, \"young actors, producers and technicians [...] must leave the country for advanced training, and only rarely return.\" Notwithstanding widespread acknowledgement of the validity of Davies' complaint, not until 1958-59 was a committee of 16 of the leading members of the Canadian theatrical community formed through the Canadian Theatre Centre / Centre du th\u00e9\u00e2tre Canadien (CTC). Actor and CBC television producer, David Gardner chaired the committee that included Colonel Yves Bourassa, [[Donald Davis (actor)|Donald Davis]], [[Jean Gascon]], [[Gratien G\u00e9linas]], [[Michael Langham]], [[Pauline McGibbon]], [[Mavor Moore]], [[David Onley]], [[Tom Patterson (theatre producer)|Tom Patterson]], [[Jean Pelletier]], [[Jean-Louis Roux]], [[Roy Stewart]], [[Powys Thomas]], Vincent Tovell and Herbert Whittaker. Internationally renowned director-teacher [[Michel Saint-Denis]] was brought in from Britain to act as senior advisor. He was a leading authority on theatre training who had created the [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]] and later co-founded the [[Juilliard School]] Drama Division in New York City.\n\nIn fact, French-born Saint-Denis had what many regarded as an ideal background to offer guidance to Canada's national co-lingual theatre school project (he gives details of his employment as a consultant for this project, and the involvement of his wife Suria, in their co-authored book \"Training for the Theatre: Premises and Promises\").<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Premises and Promises by Michel & Suria Saint Denis\">|publisher=New York: \\Theatre Arts Books; London:Heinemann, \u00a91982|oclc=9194850}}</ref> In the 1920s, he worked closely with his uncle, the remarkable French theatre director Jacques Copeau, to revolutionize theatrical practice and training in France through the Vieux-Colombier troupe. In the 1930s, Saint-Denis moved to London, England, where he became one of the most highly regarded stage directors of the decade, being responsible for a series of landmark productions featuring such stars of the British stage as John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier and Alec Guinness. The engagement of Saint-Denis also symbolically expressed a central hope for the new Canadian school: that it would embrace that fusion of the best of French and English theatrical training that seemed embodied by Saint-Denis himself.\n\nThe CTC committee had been formed with a mandate to create a \"truly bilingual school, located in Toronto.\" The committee decided that Montr\u00e9al, as a more \"truly bilingual\" city, was a better location and the National Theatre School of Canada / \u00c9cole nationale de th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Canada officially opened on 2 Nov 1960 in premises owned by the Canadian Legion at 1191 Mountain Street in Montr\u00e9al. The school changed locations several times over the next decade until in 1970 it settled at 5030 rue Saint-Denis. Beginning in 1965, it also rented performing space in the Monument-National, which it purchased outright in 1978. This historic theatre (built 1891-94) was then in a dilapidated state; a major renovation in the early 1990s restored the beauty of the old Monument-National and introduced many modernizations, resulting in 2 theatres- the 804-seat Ludger-Duvernay theatre and a smaller flexible Studio theatre, which seats as many as 180 spectators.\n\nFounding principals, [[Jean Gascon]] was the first Director-General (Principal) at the NTS and head of the school's Francophone programs while [[Powys Thomas]] headed up the English programming section. [[James de Beaujeu Domville]] took over the role of Director-General from 1964 until 1968.<ref name=\"archives\">{{cite web|url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=106941|title=Domville, James de Beaujeu, 1933-|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130101035601/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=106941|archivedate=January 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, the first year of its operation, the National Theatre School only offered classes in acting for its Francophone and English students. They had been selected from hundreds of auditions conducted in every province and territory across the country to participate in thirty months of rigorous training conducted over three years, with eight months annually spent in Montreal and the two summer months in Stratford, Ontario, where students were afforded unparalleled access to the facilities and professional influences of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. In 1961, a bilingual production program was inaugurated. In 1978, a French program in playwriting was added to the French acting section of the school and in 1980, an equivalent English playwriting program was added to its English acting section. Directing has been the most changeable program at the school. Beginning in the early 1980s, various attempts were made to create programs in English and French for the instruction of directing; but for both financial and pedagogical reasons, these programs have not always succeeded, and the English and French sections of the school have apparently abandoned the pursuit of synchronized objectives in this area. Indeed, while the integration of anglophone and francophone students has been fairly thorough in the production program, in other programs it has been more usual to see the English and French sections of the school operating autonomously.\n\nWhile the history of the National Theatre School has generally been prestigious, the institution has not been without controversy. For example, in 1968, which was dubbed \"the year of the barricades\" because of the many student protests that swept across Europe and North America, the National Theatre School experienced its own uprising. The 8 graduating acting students in the French section resigned en masse in protest against the school's disregard of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois playwrights, particularly as exemplified in statements made by the director of the French acting section, Andr\u00e9 Muller. As a result of the protest, the school pointedly reversed its neglect of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois plays. In 1971, Muller's successor, Andr\u00e9 Pag\u00e9, had the students perform a selection of work from various Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois writers and began a program of commissioning work for the school from prominent Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois playwrights. In 1998, the 8 students who had resigned were sent a letter from the school declaring that they had been reinstated as alumni and recognizing that their protest had resulted in progressive change in school policy.\n\n==Programs==\nIt offers professional training in all the major theatre arts in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], making it one of the only co-lingual theatre schools in the world.

Established in 1960, The NTS receives its principal funding from grants awarded by the [[Government of Canada]] and from cultural ministries in each of the provinces, with added financial support from private and corporate donors.\n\nThe NTS offers intensive, highly specialized theatre arts training in both English and French languages in a setting that unites all the related disciplines: acting, playwriting, directing, set and costume design, and production.\n\n==Buildings and features==\n[[Image:Monument National.jpg|thumb|The [[Monument-National]] in 2008]]\nThe National Theatre School occupies a historic landmark in Montreal, the [[Monument-National]]  on [[Saint Lawrence Boulevard]], as well as a building in [[The Plateau]] district, at the corner of [[Saint Denis Street]] and Laurier Street.\n\n===Monument-National===\n{{main|Monument-National}}\nThe campus of the National Theatre School stretches all the way to the Monument-National in the core of downtown Montreal. This hundred-year-old theatre, owned and operated by the NTS, has been classified as a heritage building. Situated in the heart of the Quartier des spectacles (Performing Arts District), on the famous \u201cMain\u201d of Boulevard St-Laurent and close to the St-Laurent metro station, is one of the first multi-functional buildings constructed in Canada. Recently restored and renovated, the Monument-National is composed of three performance halls, including a number of spaces offering unlimited conversion and transformation possibilities.\n\nThe Monument-National\u2019s two stages can accommodate every kind of production, from small concerts to large-scale shows. The Ludger-Duvernay Theatre ingeniously integrates the latest technology into a 19th-century architectural gem, while the Studio Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, with its clean lines and Meccano-like permutations, offers exciting flexibility. On the third floor is La Balustrade, a 55-seat cabaret style theatre.\n\n===Michel and Suria Saint-Denis Pavilion===\n\nOnce a juvenile courthouse, the school\u2019s main home, the Michel and Suria Saint-Denis Pavilion, sits on the border between the Plateau Mont-Royal and Mile End neighbourhoods.\n\nThe Pavilion houses rehearsal halls, classrooms (including specially converted spaces for voice, dance, movement, set and costume design and writing), the Andr\u00e9-Pag\u00e9 Studio (a flexible studio space with a 150-seat capacity), the Pauline McGibbon Studio (80-seat capacity), a small costume shop, a sound studio, a lighting laboratory, a projection room, a computer room, a school supplies store, a cafeteria, and a common space equipped with refrigerators and microwaves for the students.\n\n====The Bleviss Family Library====\n\nThe Pavilion also houses Canada's largest collection of theatre related books and manuscripts, both published and unpublished, and audio visual materials available in both official languages. This outstanding collection was founded by [[Alan Bleviss]], a graduate of NTS.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bleviss Family Library|url=http://thalia.ent-nts.ca/in/faces/details.xhtml?id=7b6ff1e7-d7f9-49a5-9621-acb681fa5f29|publisher=NTS|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe notion of a national theatre school first received focused attention as an indirect result of the \"Massey Report\" (the report of the Massey-Levesque [[Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences]] of 1951).<ref>{{cite web|title=Massey Report|url=http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/essays/massey.cfm|publisher=Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref> [[Robertson Davies]], writing the section of the report devoted to theatre, complained that \"facilities for advanced training in the arts of the theatre are non-existent in Canada,\" and that, consequently, \"young actors, producers and technicians [...] must leave the country for advanced training, and only rarely return.\" Notwithstanding widespread acknowledgement of the validity of Davies' complaint, not until 1958-59 was a committee of 16 of the leading members of the Canadian theatrical community formed through the Canadian Theatre Centre / Centre du th\u00e9\u00e2tre Canadien (CTC). Actor and CBC television producer, David Gardner chaired the committee that included Colonel Yves Bourassa, [[Donald Davis (actor)|Donald Davis]], [[Jean Gascon]], [[Gratien G\u00e9linas]], [[Michael Langham]], [[Pauline McGibbon]], [[Mavor Moore]], [[David Onley]], [[Tom Patterson (theatre producer)|Tom Patterson]], [[Jean Pelletier]], [[Jean-Louis Roux]], [[Roy Stewart]], [[Powys Thomas]], Vincent Tovell and Herbert Whittaker. Internationally renowned director-teacher [[Michel Saint-Denis]] was brought in from Britain to act as senior advisor. He was a leading authority on theatre training who had created the [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]] and later co-founded the [[Juilliard School]] Drama Division in New York City.\n\nIn fact, French-born Saint-Denis had what many regarded as an ideal background to offer guidance to Canada's national co-lingual theatre school project (he gives details of his employment as a consultant for this project, and the involvement of his wife Suria, in their co-authored book \"Training for the Theatre: Premises and Promises\").<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Premises and Promises by Michel & Suria Saint Denis\">|publisher=New York: \\Theatre Arts Books; London:Heinemann, \u00a91982|oclc=9194850}}</ref> In the 1920s, he worked closely with his uncle, the remarkable French theatre director Jacques Copeau, to revolutionize theatrical practice and training in France through the Vieux-Colombier troupe. In the 1930s, Saint-Denis moved to London, England, where he became one of the most highly regarded stage directors of the decade, being responsible for a series of landmark productions featuring such stars of the British stage as John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier and Alec Guinness. The engagement of Saint-Denis also symbolically expressed a central hope for the new Canadian school: that it would embrace that fusion of the best of French and English theatrical training that seemed embodied by Saint-Denis himself.\n\nThe CTC committee had been formed with a mandate to create a \"truly bilingual school, located in Toronto.\" The committee decided that Montr\u00e9al, as a more \"truly bilingual\" city, was a better location and the National Theatre School of Canada / \u00c9cole nationale de th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Canada officially opened on 2 Nov 1960 in premises owned by the Canadian Legion at 1191 Mountain Street in Montr\u00e9al. The school changed locations several times over the next decade until in 1970 it settled at 5030 rue Saint-Denis. Beginning in 1965, it also rented performing space in the Monument-National, which it purchased outright in 1978. This historic theatre (built 1891-94) was then in a dilapidated state; a major renovation in the early 1990s restored the beauty of the old Monument-National and introduced many modernizations, resulting in 2 theatres- the 804-seat Ludger-Duvernay theatre and a smaller flexible Studio theatre, which seats as many as 180 spectators.\n\nFounding principals, [[Jean Gascon]] was the first Director-General (Principal) at the NTS and head of the school's Francophone programs while [[Powys Thomas]] headed up the English programming section. [[James de Beaujeu Domville]] took over the role of Director-General from 1964 until 1968.<ref name=\"archives\">{{cite web|url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=106941|title=Domville, James de Beaujeu, 1933-|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130101035601/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=106941|archivedate=January 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, the first year of its operation, the National Theatre School only offered classes in acting for its Franophone and English students. They had been selected from hundreds of auditions conducted in every province and territory across the country to participate in thirty months of rigorous training conducted over three years, with eight months annually spent in Montreal and the two summer months in Stratford, Ontario, where students were afforded unparalleled access to the facilities and professional influences of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. In 1961, a bilingual production program was inaugurated. In 1978, a French program in playwriting was added to the French acting section of the school and in 1980, an equivalent English playwriting program was added to its English acting section. Directing has been the most changeable program at the school. Beginning in the early 1980s, various attempts were made to create programs in English and French for the instruction of directing; but for both financial and pedagogical reasons, these programs have not always succeeded, and the English and French sections of the school have apparently abandoned the pursuit of synchronized objectives in this area. Indeed, while the integration of anglophone and francophone students has been fairly thorough in the production program, in other programs it has been more usual to see the English and French sections of the school operating autonomously.\n\nWhile the history of the National Theatre School has generally been prestigious, the institution has not been without controversy. For example, in 1968, which was dubbed \"the year of the barricades\" because of the many student protests that swept across Europe and North America, the National Theatre School experienced its own uprising. The 8 graduating acting students in the French section resigned en masse in protest against the school's disregard of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois playwrights, particularly as exemplified in statements made by the director of the French acting section, Andr\u00e9 Muller. As a result of the protest, the school pointedly reversed its neglect of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois plays. In 1971, Muller's successor, Andr\u00e9 Pag\u00e9, had the students perform a selection of work from various Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois writers and began a program of commissioning work for the school from prominent Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois playwrights. In 1998, the 8 students who had resigned were sent a letter from the school declaring that they had been reinstated as alumni and recognizing that their protest had resulted in progressive change in school policy.\n\n==Programs==\nIt offers professional training in all the major theatre arts in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], making it one of the only co-lingual theatre schools in the world. The programs include Acting, Directing, Production, Playwrighting and Scenography.\n\n==Intake==\nStudents are auditioned and or interviewed from all across the country, and NTS accepts international students as well.
