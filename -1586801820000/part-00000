Fessenden was a [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] (later a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) and member of the [[List of United States political families#The Fessendens|Fessenden political family]]. He served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] before becoming [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]].\n\nA lawyer, he was a leading antislavery Whig in Maine; in Congress, he fought the [[Slave Power]] (the plantation owners who controlled southern states). He built an antislavery coalition in the state legislature that elected him to the U.S. Senate; it became Maine's Republican organization. In the Senate, Fessenden played a central role in the debates on Kansas, denouncing the expansion of slavery. He led [[Radical Republicans]]  in attacking Democrats [[Stephen Douglas]], [[Franklin Pierce]], and [[James Buchanan]]. Fessenden's speeches were read widely, influencing Republicans such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] and building support for  Lincoln's 1860 Republican presidential nomination.  During the war, Senator Fessenden helped shape the Union's taxation and financial policies. He moderated his earlier radicalism, and supported Lincoln against the Radicals, becoming Lincoln's Treasury Secretary.<ref>Landis (2008)</ref> After the war, Fessenden was back in the Senate, as chair of the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which established terms for resuming congressional representation for the southern states, and which drafted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Later, Fessenden provided critical support that prevented Senate conviction of President [[Andrew Johnson]], who had been impeached by the House. He was the first Republican Senator to ring out \"...''not guilty''\" followed by six other Republican Senators resulting in the acquittal of President Johnson.\n\nHe is the only person to have three streets in Portland named for him: William, Pitt and Fessenden streets in the city's Oakdale neighborhood.\n\n==Youth and early career==\nFessenden was born in [[Boscawen, New Hampshire]], on October 16, 1806.  His father was attorney and legislator [[Samuel Fessenden]].  His mother was Ruth Greene. The parents were unmarried. William was separated from his mother at his birth, and he was raised by his paternal grandmother for seven years.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}\n\nHe graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1823 and then studied law.

He practiced with his father, who was also a prominent anti-slavery activist. He practiced law first in Bridgton, [[Maine]], a year in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and afterward in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]. He was a member of the [[Maine House of Representatives]] in 1832 and was its leading debater. He refused nominations to Congress in 1831 and in 1838, and served in the Maine legislature again in 1840, becoming chairman of the house committee to revise the statutes of the state.\n\nHe was elected for one term in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a Whig in 1840. During this term, he moved to repeal the rule that excluded anti-slavery petitions and spoke upon the loan and bankrupt bills, and the army. At the end of his term in Congress, he turned his attention wholly to his law business until he was again in the Maine legislature in 1845\u201346. He acquired a national reputation as a lawyer and an anti-slavery Whig, and in 1849 prosecuted before the [[United States Supreme Court]] an appeal from an adverse decision of Judge [[Joseph Story]], and gained a reversal by an argument which [[Daniel Webster]] pronounced the best he had heard in twenty years. He was again in the Maine legislature in 1853 and 1854.\n\n==Service in U.S. Senate and Cabinet==\n[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|280px|''Running the \"Machine\"''<br />An 1864 cartoon featuring Fessenden, [[Edwin M. Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[William H.

Upon taking office, he immediately began speaking against the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. His speech on the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]], in 1856, received the highest praise, and in 1858 his speech on the [[Lecompton Constitution]] of Kansas, and his criticisms of the opinion of the supreme court in the [[Dred Scott case]], were considered the ablest discussion of those topics. He participated in the organization of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], being re-elected to the Senate from that group in 1860, this time without the formality of a nomination.\n\nIn 1861, he was a member of the Peace Congress. By the secession of the Southern senators, the Republicans acquired control of the senate and placed Fessenden at the head of the finance committee. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he was the most conspicuous senator in sustaining the national credit. He opposed the [[Legal Tender Act]] as unnecessary and unjust. As chairman of the finance committee, Fessenden prepared and carried through the senate all measures relating to revenue, taxation, and appropriations, and, as declared by [[Charles Sumner]], was \"in the financial field all that our best generals were in arms.\"\n[[File:FESSENDEN, William P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Fessenden as Treasury Secretary]]\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed Fessenden [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] upon [[Salmon P. Chase]]'s resignation.  It was the darkest hour of national finances of the United States.{{According to whom|date=March 2018}} Chase had just withdrawn a loan from the market for want of acceptable bids, and the capacity of the country to lend seemed exhausted. The currency had been enormously inflated:  the paper dollar was worth only 34 cents; gold was at $280/ounce. Fessenden at first refused the office, but at last, accepted in obedience to the universal public pressure. When his acceptance became known, gold fell to $225/ounce. He declared that no more currency should be issued, and, making an appeal to the people, he prepared and put upon the market the seven-thirty loan, which proved a triumphant success. This loan was in the form of bonds bearing interest at the rate of 7.30%, which were issued in denominations as low as $50 so that people of moderate means could take them. He also framed and recommended the measures, adopted by congress, which permitted the subsequent consolidation and funding of the government loans into the 4% and 4.5% bonds.\n[[File:US-Fractional (3rd Issue)-$0.25-Fr.1294.jpg|thumb|left|Fessenden was one of only three people [[List of people on United States banknotes|depicted]] on United States [[Fractional currency]] during their lifetime.]]\nFessenden began his service as Secretary of the Treasury on July 5, 1864. The financial situation becoming favorable, in accordance with his expressed intention, he resigned the secretaryship, leaving on March 3, 1865, to return to the Senate, to which he had now for the third time been elected.\n\nFrom 1865 to 1867, he headed the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which was responsible for overseeing the readmission of states from the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] into the Union. He wrote its report, which vindicated the power of congress over the rebellious states, showed their relations to the government under the constitution and the law of nations, and recommended the constitutional safeguards made necessary by the rebellion. At this point, Fessenden was the acknowledged leader in the senate of the Republicans. He was considered a moderate, rather than Radical, Republican.\n\n[[File:Portrait of William P. Fessenden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederic Porter Vinton]]'s portrait of Fessenden, posthumous. Circa. 1870]]\nDuring President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]] in 1868, Fessenden broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators, and in a brazen act of political betrayel, voted for acquittal. These seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. He, [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html \"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\".]</ref> and [[Edmund G. Ross]]<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm \"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\".]</ref> defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction. As a result, a 35-19 vote in favor of removing the President from office failed by a single vote of reaching a 2/3 majority.  After the trial, Congressman [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal.  In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards.<ref>David O. Stewart, ''Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy'' (2009), pp. 240\u2013249, 284\u2013299.</ref>\n\nHe served as chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] during the [[37th United States Congress|37th]] through [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]]es (from 1861 to 1867), which led to his Cabinet appointment. He also served as a chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds]] during the [[40th United States Congress|40th Congress]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] during the [[41st United States Congress|41st Congress]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Library]], also during the 41st Congress. In 1867, he was one of two senators (the other was Senator [[Justin S. Morrill]] of Vermont) who voted against the purchase of [[Alaska]] from Russia.<ref>http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llej&fileName=017/llej017.db&recNum=249</ref> His last speech in the Senate was upon the bill to strengthen the public credit. He advocated the payment of the principal of the public debt in gold and opposed the notion that it might lawfully be paid in depreciated greenbacks.\n\nFor several years, he was a regent of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He received the degree of [[LL.D.]] from Bowdoin in 1858, and from [[Harvard University]] in 1864.\n\nFessenden died on September 8, 1869, while serving in the U.S. Senate. He was interred at the [[Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in Portland, Maine.  On December 14, 1869, [[George Henry Williams]] addressed the U.S. Senate to deliver a tribute to his friend and fellow Senator.<ref>Williams, George H. (1895). Occasional Addresses.

Fessenden|Thomas Amory Deblois Fessenden]], were also Congressmen. \n\nFessenden married Ellen M. Deering in 1832, and she died in 1857.  They had three sons who served in the [[American Civil War]]: Samuel Fessenden, who was killed at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], the Brigadier-General [[James Deering Fessenden]], and the Major-General [[Francis Fessenden]], the latter of whom wrote a two-volume biography of his father, ''The Life and Services of William Pitt Fessenden,'' which was published in 1907.  A fourth son, [[William Howard Fessenden]], stayed in Maine to take care of the law practice his father had established.

He participated in the organization of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], being re-elected to the Senate from that group in 1860, this time without the formality of a nomination.\n\nIn 1861, he was a member of the Peace Congress. By the secession of the Southern senators, the Republicans acquired control of the senate and placed Fessenden at the head of the finance committee. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he was the most conspicuous senator in sustaining the national credit. He opposed the [[Legal Tender Act]] as unnecessary and unjust. As chairman of the finance committee, Fessenden prepared and carried through the senate all measures relating to revenue, taxation, and appropriations, and, as declared by [[Charles Sumner]], was \"in the financial field all that our best generals were in arms.\"\n[[File:FESSENDEN, William P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Fessenden as Treasury Secretary]]\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed Fessenden [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] upon [[Salmon P. Chase]]'s resignation.  It was the darkest hour of national finances of the United States.{{According to whom|date=March 2018}} Chase had just withdrawn a loan from the market for want of acceptable bids, and the capacity of the country to lend seemed exhausted. The currency had been enormously inflated:  the paper dollar was worth only 34 cents; gold was at $280/ounce. Fessenden at first refused the office, but at last, accepted in obedience to the universal public pressure. When his acceptance became known, gold fell to $225/ounce. He declared that no more currency should be issued, and, making an appeal to the people, he prepared and put upon the market the seven-thirty loan, which proved a triumphant success. This loan was in the form of bonds bearing interest at the rate of 7.30%, which were issued in denominations as low as $50 so that people of moderate means could take them. He also framed and recommended the measures, adopted by congress, which permitted the subsequent consolidation and funding of the government loans into the 4% and 4.5% bonds.\n[[File:US-Fractional (3rd Issue)-$0.25-Fr.1294.jpg|thumb|left|Fessenden was one of only three people [[List of people on United States banknotes|depicted]] on United States [[Fractional currency]] during their lifetime.]]\nFessenden began his service as Secretary of the Treasury on July 5, 1864. The financial situation becoming favorable, in accordance with his expressed intention, he resigned the secretaryship, leaving on March 3, 1865, to return to the Senate, to which he had now for the third time been elected.\n\nFrom 1865 to 1867, he headed the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which was responsible for overseeing the readmission of states from the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] into the Union. He wrote its report, which vindicated the power of congress over the rebellious states, showed their relations to the government under the constitution and the law of nations, and recommended the constitutional safeguards made necessary by the rebellion. At this point, Fessenden was the acknowledged leader in the senate of the Republicans. He was considered a moderate, rather than Radical, Republican.\n\n[[File:Portrait of William P. Fessenden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederic Porter Vinton]]'s portrait of Fessenden, posthumous. Circa. 1870]]\nDuring President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]] in 1868, Fessenden broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators, and in a courageous act of political suicide, voted for acquittal. These seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. He, [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html \"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\".]</ref> and [[Edmund G. Ross]]<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm \"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\".]</ref> defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction. As a result, a 35-19 vote in favor of removing the President from office failed by a single vote of reaching a 2/3 majority.  After the trial, Congressman [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal.  In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards.<ref>David O. Stewart, ''Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy'' (2009), pp. 240\u2013249, 284\u2013299.</ref>\n\nHe served as chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] during the [[37th United States Congress|37th]] through [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]]es (from 1861 to 1867), which led to his Cabinet appointment. He also served as a chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds]] during the [[40th United States Congress|40th Congress]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] during the [[41st United States Congress|41st Congress]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Library]], also during the 41st Congress. In 1867, he was one of two senators (the other was Senator [[Justin S. Morrill]] of Vermont) who voted against the purchase of [[Alaska]] from Russia.<ref>http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llej&fileName=017/llej017.db&recNum=249</ref> His last speech in the Senate was upon the bill to strengthen the public credit. He advocated the payment of the principal of the public debt in gold and opposed the notion that it might lawfully be paid in depreciated greenbacks.\n\nFor several years, he was a regent of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He received the degree of [[LL.D.]] from Bowdoin in 1858, and from [[Harvard University]] in 1864.\n\nFessenden died on September 8, 1869, while serving in the U.S. Senate. He was interred at the [[Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in Portland, Maine.  On December 14, 1869, [[George Henry Williams]] addressed the U.S. Senate to deliver a tribute to his friend and fellow Senator.<ref>Williams, George H. (1895). Occasional Addresses. Portland, Oregon: F.W. Baltes and Company. pp. 21-28.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nTwo of his brothers, [[Samuel C. Fessenden|Samuel Clement Fessenden]] and [[T. A. D. Fessenden|Thomas Amory Deblois Fessenden]], were also Congressmen. \n\nFessenden married Ellen M. Deering in 1832, and she died in 1857.  They had three sons who served in the [[American Civil War]]: Samuel Fessenden, who was killed at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], the Brigadier-General [[James Deering Fessenden]], and the Major-General [[Francis Fessenden]], the latter of whom wrote a two-volume biography of his father, ''The Life and Services of William Pitt Fessenden,'' which was published in 1907.  A fourth son, [[William Howard Fessenden]], stayed in Maine to take care of the law practice his father had established.  Their fifth child was Mary Elizabeth Deering Fessenden who died in childhood. \n\nActress [[Beverly Garland]] is his great-great-granddaughter who dropped her real name Fessenden and went by her married name Garland. \n\n{{Fessenden family tree}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the 2012 film ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'', Fessenden is played by actor Walt Smith.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Congress members who died in office (1790\u20131899)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Cook, Robert J.  \"'The Grave of All My Comforts': William Pitt Fessenden as Secretary of the Treasury, 1864-65.\" ''Civil War History'' 41.3 (1995): 208-226.</ref>\n* Cook, Robert J.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

It was first established in Spain following the Christian recovery of their territories under Muslim rule (known as the ''[[Reconquista]]''), and it was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of [[indigenous peoples]], held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.<ref>James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.</ref>\n\nEncomiendas devolved from their original Iberian form into a form of \"communal\" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[pork]], or other agricultural products.\n\nWith the ousting of [[Christopher Columbus]], the Spanish crown sent a royal governor, Fray [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]], who established the formal ''encomienda'' system.<ref>Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 47</ref> In many cases natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.<ref name=\"encslav\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion|page=184|volume=1|first=Junius P.|last=Rodriguez|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33272-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_kuS42BxIYC&pg=PA184}}</ref> However, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] forbade slavery of the native population and deemed the indigenous to be \"free vassals of the crown\".<ref>Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, 143</ref> Various versions of the ''Leyes de Indias'' or [[Laws of the Indies]] from 1512 onwards attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives.

However, coerced labor continued in other forms throughout the Spanish colonies.\n\n== History ==\nThe heart of ''encomienda'' and ''encomendero'' lies in the Spanish verb ''encomendar'', \"to entrust\". The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. This system originated in the Catholic South of Spain to extract labor and tribute from Muslims (Moors) before they were exiled in 1492 after the Moors were defeated in the battle in Granada.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref> This system was a method of rewarding soldiers and moneymen who defeated the Moors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77348-5 |pages=388}}</ref> The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.\n\nThe ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; native lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.<ref>Scott, Meredith, \"[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}\".</ref>\n\n==''Encomenderos''==\n[[File:Hern\u00e1n_Cort\u00e9s_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]\nThe first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.\n\nIn his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]' original expedition, calling them \"first conquerors\", and those who were members of the later [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez|Narv\u00e1ez]] expedition, calling them \"conquerors\". The latter were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers) a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.\n\nIn the New World, the Crown granted conquistadores as encomendero, which is the right to extract labor and tribute from natives who were under Spanish rule. Christopher Columbus established the encomienda system after his arrival and settlement on the island of Hispaniola requiring them to pay tributes or face brutal punishments. Tributes were required to be paid in gold however during this time gold was scarce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>\n\nHolders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite.

It was the first major organizational law instituted on the continent, which was affected by war, widespread disease epidemics caused by Eurasian diseases, and resulting turmoil.<ref>[[Inga Clendinnen|Clendinnen, Inga]]; ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucat\u00e1n, 1517\u20131570''.

This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.\nIn 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.\n\nEach ''reducci\u00f3n'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]].\n\nIn Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, \"I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order.\"<ref>Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.</ref> The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.\n\nThe ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepci\u00f3n, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=onepage&q=15%2C000&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.\n\nLater, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=snippet&q=three%20thousand%20islanders&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders <!-- where are we?

The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.<ref>''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254</ref>\n\nOnce natives committed themselves to Spanish authority, Columbus, and Spanish overlords, they also were forced to get baptized and attend Catholic Church services. Religion allowed conquistadores to label the native population as barbaric and in need of saving. The encomienda system perpetuated because many conquistadores believed they were being altruistic and were doing God\u2019s work. Religion encouraged the expansion of conquest through the encomienda system throughout the New World.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"''sin indios no hay Indias''\" (without Indians, there are no Indies \u2013 i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]].

It was first established in Spain following the Christian recovery of their territories under Muslim rule (known as the ''[[Reconquista]]''), and it was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of [[indigenous peoples]], held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.<ref>James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.</ref>\n\nEncomiendas devolved from their original Iberian form into a form of \"communal\" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure.

However, coerced labor continued in other forms throughout the Spanish colonies.\n\n== History ==\nThe heart of ''encomienda'' and ''encomendero'' lies in the Spanish verb ''encomendar'', \"to entrust\". The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. This system originated in the Catholic South of Spain to extract labor and tribute from Muslims (Moors) before they were exiled in 1492 after the Moors were defeated in the battle in Granada <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>. This system was a method of rewarding soldiers and moneymen who defeated the Moors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77348-5 |pages=388}}</ref>. The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.\n\nThe ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; native lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.<ref>Scott, Meredith, \"[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}\".</ref>\n\n==''Encomenderos''==\n[[File:Hern\u00e1n_Cort\u00e9s_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]\nThe first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.\n\nIn his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]' original expedition, calling them \"first conquerors\", and those who were members of the later [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez|Narv\u00e1ez]] expedition, calling them \"conquerors\". The latter were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers) a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.\n\nIn the New World, the Crown granted conquistadores as encomendero, which is the right to extract labor and tribute from natives who were under Spanish rule. Christopher Columbus established the encomienda system after his arrival and settlement on the island of Hispaniola requiring them to pay tributes or face brutal punishments. Tributes were required to be paid in gold however during this time gold was scarce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>\n\nHolders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite.

This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.\nIn 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.\n\nEach ''reducci\u00f3n'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]].\n\nIn Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, \"I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order.\"<ref>Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.</ref> The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.\n\nThe ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepci\u00f3n, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=onepage&q=15%2C000&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.\n\nLater, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.<ref>{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&pg=PA122&dq=guarionex+revolt#v=snippet&q=three%20thousand%20islanders&f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143| isbn=9781113147608 | date=July 2009 }}</ref> Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders <!-- where are we?

The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.<ref>''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254</ref>\n\nOnce natives committed themselves to Spanish authority, Columbus, and Spanish overlords, they also were forced to get baptized and attend Catholic Church services. Religion allowed conquistadores to label the native population as barbaric and in need of saving. The encomienda system perpetuated because many conquistadores believed they were being altruistic and were doing God\u2019s work. Religion encouraged the expansion of conquest through the encomienda system throughout the New World.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |title=A History of Modern Latin America 1800 to the Present |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |pages=388}}</ref>  \n\nThe phrase \"''sin indios no hay Indias''\" (without Indians, there are no Indies \u2013 i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]].

By the time the new laws were passed, 1543, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war.

The ''repartimiento'' was an attempt \"to reduce the abuses of forced labour\".<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> As the number of [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives declined]] and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the [[hacienda]], or large landed estates in which laborers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (''hacendados''), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labor.<ref>Tindall, George Brown & David E.

In 1937, ''The Hobbit'' was first illustrated by professional draughtsmen for the American edition. Tolkien was very critical of these, and in 1946 he rejected illustrations by [[Horus Engels]] for the German edition of the ''Hobbit'' as \"too '[[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]]'\".<ref>7 December 1946, ''The Letters of J.R.R.

In 1968, Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of ''The Lord of the Rings'', mostly in coloured ink, by English artist [[Mary Fairburn]]; Tolkien said of her pictures: \"They ... show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me.... I am beginning to ... think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing.\" For various reasons the project went no further, and Fairburn's illustrations were unknown until 2012.<ref>Tankard, Paul, \"An Unknown Vision of Middle-earth: Mary Fairburn: Tolkien Illustrator\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 14 September 2012. http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1124297.ece</ref> Crown Princess Margrethe (now [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]]) of Denmark, an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter, was inspired to illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s.

Some of the work done was resurrected for the film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' in 1981.\n\n[[Ralph Bakshi]] directed an animated movie adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1978 (partly made with the [[rotoscope]] technique), which covered only the first half of ''The Lord of the Rings''. [[Rankin-Bass]] covered the second half with a children's TV animation ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980); earlier they had made a TV animation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977).\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'' was adapted as a [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|trilogy of films]] (2001\u201303), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''The Hobbit'' was also adapted as a [[The Hobbit (film series)|trilogy]] (2012\u201314), with some elements adapted from ''The Return of the King'''s Appendices, resulting in noticeable divergences with the novel.\n\nThe split of Tolkien's works between [[Tolkien Enterprises]] and the [[Tolkien Estate]] means that none of the Tolkien Enterprises' products can include source material from outside ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', and therefore a film or stage version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is highly unlikely.\n\n[[Babylon 5#Influences|Comparisons]] have been made to the plot of the [[science fiction]] [[television show]] ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and Tolkien's works.\n\n==Games==\nThere are multiple model-based games, trading card games, board games and [[video game]]s that take place in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from ''The Lord of the Rings.''  In a broader sense, many fantasy [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' and ''[[DragonQuest]]'' were strongly influenced by Tolkien's works. Such games feature creatures such as Orcs, Trolls, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Ents which are common to Tolkien's mythos even if they do not take place in Middle-earth.\n\n===Video games===\n{{Main|Middle-earth in video games}}\nThe books have been reproduced in video game form a number of times during the 1980s and 2000s, including [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'', ''Shadows of Mordor'', ''[[War in Middle-earth]]''; [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 1'' and ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 2.''; [[Electronic Arts]]' action [[platformer]] adaptations of ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King'', [[real-time strategy game]]s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', and the [[role-playing game]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]],'' all based on the Jackson films; and [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s action platformer based on ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. There is also a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] Game titled ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]'' based on the Jackson films, a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] by [[Turbine Inc|Turbine]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online|The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. [[The Two Towers (MUD)]] is also set in Tolkien's world. [[Lego]]'s licensed theme game version had Japanese anime graphics.\n\n===Other games===\n[[Games Workshop]] have made a [[miniature wargame]] called ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'', which, while part of the film trilogy's merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films. Many of Games Workshop's other battle games that are not directly related to the books have had some key background based on it.\n\nSeveral other games have been based directly on ''The Lord of the Rings'' and related works, including, amongst many, [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' game (1982\u20131999) and ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'' (1995\u20131999), as well as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' ([[2001 in games|2001]]) made by [[Decipher, Inc.]] All of these predate Jackson's film trilogy except for Decipher's card game, which is part of the latter's merchandise.\n\nDecipher also created the ''[[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'', a role-playing game based on the Jackson films.\n\nBoard games include ''[[Risk: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition]]'' and another simply entitled ''[[Lord of the Rings (board game)|Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as the ''Middle Earth Games'' from [[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]  containing the games ''War of the Ring'' (strategic, covering all three books), ''Gondor'' (tactical, covering the siege of Minas Tirith) and ''Sauron'' (covering the decisive battle of the Second Age) in [[1977 in games|1977]]. A more recent strategic game covering all three books, called ''[[War of the Ring (board game)|War of the Ring]]'', was released in [[2004 in games|2004]]. There are also ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' editions based on ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as a ''The Lord of the Rings Trivia Game'' quiz game. Chess sets have also been created with the figures based on people and other characters from ''The Lord of the Rings''. there has also been a game on the Nintendo WII. It was \"The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn's Quest\" which is a third person game based on Aragon's role in the book.\n\n===Homages===\n{{original research|section|date=September 2010}}\nThe creators of the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]] were also strongly influenced by Tolkien. The game has (clearly Tolkien-influenced) dwarves and elves as playable characters, and formerly had hobbits as well. After being threatened with a lawsuit by the [[Saul Zaentz]] company, [[Tolkien Enterprises]], they replaced hobbits with the similar \"halflings\" \u2014 a term also used in ''The Lord of the Rings'', balrogs with 'balor-demons' and other genericized names. In most versions of the game, halflings were especially good at being thieves/rogues, a nod to Bilbo the thief in ''The Hobbit''. His works also indirectly inspired the [[Warcraft]] series via their use in [[Games Workshop]]'s battle games.\n\nEqually common is the use of the term [[orc]] for a variety of hobgoblin type creatures in later fantasy although Tolkien popularized this modern usage of the word. Even more removed genre games such as ''[[Shadowrun]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' use the term, therein spelt Ork, possibly to sidestep possible legal issues (though Tolkien actually preferred ''-k'' in late writings).\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Prose===\n[[File:Lucca Comics 2010 - Terry Brooks 03.jpg|thumb|Fantasy writer Terry Brooks, among others, was heavily influenced by Tolkien]]\nMany authors have found inspiration in Tolkien's work as well. Following the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the 1960s, publishers were quick to try to meet a new demand for literate fantasy in the American marketplace.<ref name=\"ts\">[[Tom Shippey]], \"Literature,Twentieth Century: Influence of Tolkien\", in Michael D.

In 2004, Lee won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction for his work on the film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/76academyawards/nomswins.html| title=76th Academy Awards|work =Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=29 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060219061720/http://www.oscars.org/76academyawards/nomswins.html |archivedate = 19 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nOther artists who have found inspiration in Tolkien's works include Catherine Karina Chmiel, [[Inger Edelfeldt]], [[Anke Ei\u00dfmann]], [[Roger Garland (artist)|Roger Garland]], [[Michael Hague]], [[Tove Jansson]] (of [[Moomin]] fame, illustrator of Swedish and Finnish translations of ''[[The Hobbit]]''), Jay Johnstone, [[Paul R Gregory|Paul Raymond Gregory]], [[Tim Kirk]], [[Angus McBride]], [[Jef Murray]], [[Kay Miner]], [[Billy Mosig]], [[Colleen Doran]], [[Jenny Dolfen]], [[Mat\u011bj \u010cadil]] and [[Peter Xavier Price]].\n\n==Film==\n[[File:Hobbiton.jpg|thumb|New Zealand's \"[[Hobbiton]]\" where ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy was filmed.]]\n[[File:Sir Peter Jackson.jpg|thumb|Peter Jackson, director of six Tolkien adaptations, at the site of filming of the ''The Hobbit'' trilogy.]]\n{{Main|Middle-earth in film}}\nTolkien originally sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968, but they never made a film, and in 1976 the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company.\n\nIn the early seventies [[John Boorman]] was planning a film of ''The Lord of the Rings'', but the plans never went further because of movie studio politics. Some of the work done was resurrected for the film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' in 1981.\n\n[[Ralph Bakshi]] directed an animated movie adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1978 (partly made with the [[rotoscope]] technique), which covered only the first half of ''The Lord of the Rings''. [[Rankin-Bass]] covered the second half with a children's TV animation ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980); earlier they had made a TV animation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977).\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'' was adapted as a [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|trilogy of films]] (2001\u201303), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''The Hobbit'' was also adapted as a [[The Hobbit (film series)|trilogy]] (2012\u201314), with some elements adapted from ''The Return of the King'''s Appendices, resulting in noticeable divergences with the novel.\n\nThe split of Tolkien's works between [[Tolkien Enterprises]] and the [[Tolkien Estate]] means that none of the Tolkien Enterprises' products can include source material from outside ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', and therefore a film or stage version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is highly unlikely.\n\n[[Babylon 5#Influences|Comparisons]] have been made to the plot of the [[science fiction]] [[television show]] ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and Tolkien's works.\n\n==Games==\nThere are multiple model-based games, trading card games, board games and [[video game]]s that take place in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from ''The Lord of the Rings.''  In a broader sense, many fantasy [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' and ''[[DragonQuest]]'' were strongly influenced by Tolkien's works. Such games feature creatures such as Orcs, Trolls, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Ents which are common to Tolkien's mythos even if they do not take place in Middle-earth.\n\n===Video games===\n{{Main|Middle-earth in video games}}\nThe books have been reproduced in video game form a number of times during the 1980s and 2000s, including [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'', ''Shadows of Mordor'', ''[[War in Middle-earth]]''; [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 1'' and ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 2.''; [[Electronic Arts]]' action [[platformer]] adaptations of ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King'', [[real-time strategy game]]s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', and the [[role-playing game]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]],'' all based on the Jackson films; and [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s action platformer based on ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. There is also a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] Game titled ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]'' based on the Jackson films, a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] by [[Turbine Inc|Turbine]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online|The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. [[The Two Towers (MUD)]] is also set in Tolkien's world. [[Lego]]'s licensed theme game version had Japanese anime graphics.\n\n===Other games===\n[[Games Workshop]] have made a [[miniature wargame]] called ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'', which, while part of the film trilogy's merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films. Many of Games Workshop's other battle games that are not directly related to the books have had some key background based on it.\n\nSeveral other games have been based directly on ''The Lord of the Rings'' and related works, including, amongst many, [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' game (1982\u20131999) and ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'' (1995\u20131999), as well as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' ([[2001 in games|2001]]) made by [[Decipher, Inc.]] All of these predate Jackson's film trilogy except for Decipher's card game, which is part of the latter's merchandise.\n\nDecipher also created the ''[[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'', a role-playing game based on the Jackson films.\n\nBoard games include ''[[Risk: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition]]'' and another simply entitled ''[[Lord of the Rings (board game)|Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as the ''Middle Earth Games'' from [[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]  containing the games ''War of the Ring'' (strategic, covering all three books), ''Gondor'' (tactical, covering the siege of Minas Tirith) and ''Sauron'' (covering the decisive battle of the Second Age) in [[1977 in games|1977]]. A more recent strategic game covering all three books, called ''[[War of the Ring (board game)|War of the Ring]]'', was released in [[2004 in games|2004]]. There are also ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' editions based on ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as a ''The Lord of the Rings Trivia Game'' quiz game. Chess sets have also been created with the figures based on people and other characters from ''The Lord of the Rings''. there has also been a game on the Nintendo WII. It was \"The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn's Quest\" which is a third person game based on Aragon's role in the book.\n\n===Homages===\n{{original research|section|date=September 2010}}\nThe creators of the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]] were also strongly influenced by Tolkien. The game has (clearly Tolkien-influenced) dwarves and elves as playable characters, and formerly had hobbits as well. After being threatened with a lawsuit by the [[Saul Zaentz]] company, [[Tolkien Enterprises]], they replaced hobbits with the similar \"halflings\" \u2014 a term also used in ''The Lord of the Rings'', balrogs with 'balor-demons' and other genericized names. In most versions of the game, halflings were especially good at being thieves/rogues, a nod to Bilbo the thief in ''The Hobbit''. His works also indirectly inspired the [[Warcraft]] series via their use in [[Games Workshop]]'s battle games.\n\nEqually common is the use of the term [[orc]] for a variety of hobgoblin type creatures in later fantasy although Tolkien popularized this modern usage of the word. Even more removed genre games such as ''[[Shadowrun]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' use the term, therein spelt Ork, possibly to sidestep possible legal issues (though Tolkien actually preferred ''-k'' in late writings).\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Prose===\n[[File:Lucca Comics 2010 - Terry Brooks 03.jpg|thumb|Fantasy writer Terry Brooks, among others, was heavily influenced by Tolkien]]\nMany authors have found inspiration in Tolkien's work as well.

Stirling's [[The Emberverse series|\"Emberverse\"]] series includes a character obsessed with ''The Lord of the Rings'' who creates a post-apocalyptic community based upon the Elves and D\u00fanedain of Middle-earth.

Another Russian writer, [[Kirill Eskov]], wrote ''[[The Last Ringbearer]]'', about the events in ''Lord of the Rings'' from the perspective of Sauron. [[Stephen King]], best known for horror novels, has acknowledged Tolkien's influence on his novel ''[[The Stand]]'' as well as his fantasy series ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''. Several other prominent fantasy writers, including [[George R. R. Martin]], [[Michael Swanwick]], [[Raymond E.

A range of diseases can cause cachexia, most commonly [[cancer]], [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure,]] [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[AIDS]]. Systemic inflammation from these conditions can cause detrimental changes to metabolism and body composition. In contrast to weight loss from inadequate caloric intake, cachexia causes mostly muscle loss instead of fat loss. Diagnosis of cachexia can be difficult due to the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria. Cachexia can improve with treatment of the underlying illness but other treatment approaches have limited benefit. Cachexia is associated with increased mortality and poor quality of life.\n\nThe term is from [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''kakos'', \"bad\", and \u1f15\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ''hexis'', \"condition\".\n\n==Causes==\nCachexia can be caused by diverse medical conditions, but is most often associated with end-stage [[cancer]], known as ''cancer cachexia''. About 50% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia. Those with upper gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers have the highest frequency of developing a cachexic symptom. Prevalence of cachexia rises in more advanced stages and is estimated to affect 80% of terminal cancer patients.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fearon KC, Moses AG | title = Cancer cachexia | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 73\u201381 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12163211 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00235-8 }}</ref> \n\n[[Congestive heart failure]], [[AIDS]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,]] and [[chronic kidney disease]] are other conditions that often cause cachexia.<ref name=Ebner-2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebner N, Springer J, Kalantar-Zadeh K, Lainscak M, Doehner W, Anker SD, von Haehling S | title = Mechanism and novel therapeutic approaches to wasting in chronic disease | journal = Maturitas | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 199\u2013206 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23664695 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.03.014 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/3420540 }}</ref> Cachexia can also be the result of advanced stages of [[cystic fibrosis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[motor neuron disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[dementia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[multiple system atrophy]], [[mercury poisoning]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[celiac disease]] as well as other systemic diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meresse B, Ripoche J, Heyman M, Cerf-Bensussan N | title = Celiac disease: from oral tolerance to intestinal inflammation, autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis | journal = Mucosal Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8\u201323 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19079330 | doi = 10.1038/mi.2008.75 }}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Morley JE, Thomas DR, Wilson MM | title = Cachexia: pathophysiology and clinical relevance | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 735\u201343 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16600922 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/83.4.735 }}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\nThe exact mechanism in which these diseases cause cachexia is poorly understood, and likely is multifactorial with multiple disease pathways involved. [[Inflammatory cytokine|Inflammatory cytokines]] appear to play a central role including [[TNF-alpha]] (which is also nicknamed 'cachexin' or 'cachectin'), [[Interferon|interferon gamma]]<!-- not needed (IFN\u03b3),--> and [[interleukin 6]]<!-- not needed (IL-6)-->. [[TNF-alpha]] has been shown to have direct catabolic effect on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through the [[ubiquitin proteasome pathway]]. This mechanism involves the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] leading to upregulation of the transcription factor [[NF-\u03baB]]. NF-\u03baB is a known regulator of the genes that encode cytokines and cytokine receptors. The increased production of cytokines induces proteolysis and breakdown of [[myofibrillar]] proteins.<ref name=Kumar/> Systemic inflammation also causes reduced protein synthesis through inhibition of the Akt/[[mTOR]] pathway.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Argil\u00e9s|first=Josep M.|last2=Campos|first2=Nefertiti|last3=Lopez-Pedrosa|first3=Jos\u00e9 M.|last4=Rueda|first4=Ricardo|last5=Rodriguez-Ma\u00f1as|first5=Leocadio|date=2016|title=Skeletal Muscle Regulates Metabolism via Interorgan Crosstalk: Roles in Health and Disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Directors Association|volume=17|issue=9|pages=789\u2013796|doi=10.1016/j.jamda.2016.04.019|issn=1538-9375|pmid=27324808}}</ref>\n\nAlthough many different tissues and cell types may be responsible for the increase in circulating cytokines, evidence indicates tumors themselves are an important source of factors that may promote cachexia in cancer.

A range of diseases can cause cachexia, most commonly [[cancer]], [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure,]] [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[AIDS]]. Systemic inflammation from these conditions can cause detrimental changes to metabolism and body composition. In contrast to weight loss from inadequate caloric intake, cachexia causes mostly muscle loss instead of fat loss. Diagnosis of cachexia can be difficult due to the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria. Cachexia can improve with treatment of the underlying illness but other treatment approaches have limited benefit. Cachexia is associated with increased mortality and poor quality of life.\n\nThe term is from [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''kakos'', \"bad\", and \u1f15\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ''hexis'', \"condition\".\n\n==Causes==\nCachexia can be caused by diverse medical conditions, but is most often associated with end-stage [[cancer]], known as ''cancer cachexia''. About 50% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia. Those with upper gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers have the highest frequency of developing a cachexic symptom. Prevalence of cachexia rises in more advanced stages and is estimated to affect 80% of terminal cancer patients.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fearon KC, Moses AG | title = Cancer cachexia | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 73\u201381 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12163211 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00235-8 }}</ref> \n\n[[Congestive heart failure]], [[AIDS]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,]] and [[chronic kidney disease]] are other conditions that often cause cachexia.<ref name=Ebner-2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebner N, Springer J, Kalantar-Zadeh K, Lainscak M, Doehner W, Anker SD, von Haehling S | title = Mechanism and novel therapeutic approaches to wasting in chronic disease | journal = Maturitas | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 199\u2013206 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23664695 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.03.014 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/3420540 }}</ref> Cachexia can also be the result of advanced stages of [[cystic fibrosis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[motor neuron disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[dementia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[multiple system atrophy]], [[mercury poisoning]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[celiac disease]] as well as other systemic diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meresse B, Ripoche J, Heyman M, Cerf-Bensussan N | title = Celiac disease: from oral tolerance to intestinal inflammation, autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis | journal = Mucosal Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8\u201323 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19079330 | doi = 10.1038/mi.2008.75 }}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Morley JE, Thomas DR, Wilson MM | title = Cachexia: pathophysiology and clinical relevance | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 735\u201343 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16600922 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/83.4.735 }}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\nThe exact mechanism in which these diseases cause cachexia is poorly understood, and likely is multifactorial with multiple disease pathways involved. [[Inflammatory cytokine|Inflammatory cytokines]] appear to play a central role including [[TNF-alpha]] (which is also nicknamed 'cachexin' or 'cachectin'), [[Interferon|interferon gamma]]<!-- not needed (IFN\u03b3),--> and [[interleukin 6]]<!-- not needed (IL-6)-->. [[TNF-alpha]] has been shown to have direct catabolic effect on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through the [[ubiquitin proteasome pathway]]. This mechanism involves the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] leading to upregulation of the transcription factor [[NF-\u03baB]]. NF-\u03baB is a known regulator of the genes that encode cytokines and cytokine receptors. The increased production of cytokines induces proteolysis and breakdown of [[myofibrillar]] proteins.<ref name=Kumar/> Systemic inflammation also causes reduced protein synthesis through inhibition of the Akt/[[mTOR]] pathway.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Argil\u00e9s|first=Josep M.|last2=Campos|first2=Nefertiti|last3=Lopez-Pedrosa|first3=Jos\u00e9 M.|last4=Rueda|first4=Ricardo|last5=Rodriguez-Ma\u00f1as|first5=Leocadio|date=2016|title=Skeletal Muscle Regulates Metabolism via Interorgan Crosstalk: Roles in Health and Disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Directors Association|volume=17|issue=9|pages=789\u2013796|doi=10.1016/j.jamda.2016.04.019|issn=1538-9375|pmid=27324808}}</ref>\n\nAlthough many different tissues and cell types may be responsible for the increase in circulating cytokines, evidence indicates tumors themselves are an important source of factors that may promote cachexia in cancer.

However, laboratory metrics and cut-off values are not standardized across different diagnostic criteria. [[Acute phase reactant|Acute phase reactants]] (IL-6, IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-8, interferon-g) are sometimes measured but correlate poorly with outcomes. There are no [[biomarkers]] to identify people with cancer who may develop cachexia.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nIn the effort to better classify cachexia severity, several scoring systems have been proposed including the Cachexia Staging Score (CSS) and Cachexia Score (CASCO). The CSS takes into account weight loss, subjective reporting of muscle function, performance status, appetite loss, and laboratory changes to categorize patients into non-cachexia, pre-cachexia, cachexia and refractory cachexia. The Cachexia SCOre (CASCO) is another validated score that includes evaluation of body weight loss and composition, inflammation, metabolic disturbances, immunosuppression, physical performance, anorexia, and quality of life.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nEvaluation of changes in body composition is limited by the difficulty in measuring muscle mass and health in a non-invasive and cost-effective way.
