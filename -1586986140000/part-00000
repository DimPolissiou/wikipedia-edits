Reiber''', born on June 9, 2000, is introduced as the child intended to be adopted by [[Abe Carver]] ([[James Reynolds (actor)|James Reynolds]]) and [[Lexie Carver]] ([[Ren\u00e9e Jones]]). However, Lexie's father [[Stefano DiMera]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]) switches the infant at birth with [[Bo Brady and Hope Williams|Bo and Hope]]'s ([[Peter Reckell]] and [[Kristian Alfonso]]) son. After years of trying for a baby the natural way, Abe and Lexie Carver decide that they will adopt a child. When Lexie's father Stefano DiMera hears about the news, he is over joyed at the prospect of finally becoming a grandfather and asks that Abe and Lexie adopt the child of one of his distant relatives. The birth mother Marlo is in fact the niece of Dr. Rolf, Stefano's longtime assistant. However none the wiser to Lexie and Abe, Stefano is planning a plot whereby Marlo's baby would be switched with the baby of Bo and Hope's who Stefano at the time thought might be his or John Black's. After the births of the babies, Stefano has Dr. Rolf switch Hope's and Marlo's babies birth tags. So, the baby is instead taken home by Bo and Hope Brady and named John Thomas, getting his names from family friend [[John Black (Days of Our Lives)|John Black]] ([[Drake Hogestyn]]) and Hope's late grandfather [[Tom Horton]] ([[MacDonald Carey]]). \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Zack Brady==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Zack Brady\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist |\n* Alyssa and Lauren Libby (2000\u201301)\n* Max and Sam Christy (2001)\n* Garrett and Spencer Gray (2001\u201309)\n* Scott Shilstone (2016)\n}}\n| years            = {{Flat list |\n* 2000\u201306\n* 2008\u201309\n* 2016\n}}\n| introducer       = [[Ken Corday]] and Tom Langan\n| classification   = [[List of previous Days of Our Lives cast members|Former, recurring]]\n| first          = June 9, 2000\n| last           = June 8, 2016\n| creator        = [[Tom Langan]]\n| image1         =  \n| caption1       =  \n| image2         =\n| caption2       =\n| family         = {{Plainlist |\n* Horton, Kiriakis\n}} \n| alias            = Isaac Theo Carver<br />Beauregard Isaac Theo Brady\n| father = [[Bo Brady]]\n| mother = [[Hope Williams Brady]]\n| brothers = [[Shawn-Douglas Brady]]\n| sisters = [[Ciara Brady]]\n| halfsisters = [[Chelsea Brady]]\n| grandfathers = [[Victor Kiriakis]]<br />[[Doug Williams (Days of our Lives)|Doug Williams]]\n| grandmothers = [[Caroline Brady]]<br />[[Addie Horton]]\n| aunts = [[Isabella Toscano]]<br />[[Kimberly Brady]]<br />[[Kayla Brady]]<br />[[Julie Olson|Julie Williams]]\n| uncles = [[Philip Kiriakis]]<br />[[Roman Brady]]<br />[[Frankie Brady]] (adoptive)<br />[[Max Brady]] (adoptive)<br />Steve Olson<br />Douglas LeClaire\n| nieces = [[Claire Brady (Days of Our Lives)|Claire Brady]]\n| cousins = [[Brady Black]]<br />[[Tyler Kiriakis]]<br />[[Carrie Brady|Carrie Brady Reed]]<br />[[Sami Brady]]<br />[[Eric Brady]]<br />[[Cassie Brady]]<br />[[Rex Brady]]<br />Andrew Donovan IV<br />[[Theresa Donovan]]<br />[[Stephanie Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Stephanie Johnson]]<br />[[Joey Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Joey Johnson]]<br>Spencer Olson<br>David Banning\n| relatives = [[Eli Grant]]\n}}\n\n'''Zack Brady''' was the second son and child of supercouple [[Hope Williams Brady|Hope]] and [[Bo Brady]], born June 9, 2000. For the longest time, Zack is known as Isaac Theo Carver, the long-awaited and much-beloved son of Abe and Lexie Carver. For years the two had tried unsuccessfully to have a child of their own with no success, until Lexie's father, Stefano, got them in touch with Marlo, a young pregnant woman. Abe and Lexie adopt the baby that Marlo has given birth to, unaware that Stefano had switched Marlo and Hope's sons.\n\nZack dies on January 1, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to [[Abe Carver]]; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight. Zack's death and the revelation of Chelsea as the SUV driver drive a wedge between Bo and Hope \u2013 as well as the rest of the Brady family for most of 2006.\n\nIn June 2016, he returns as an aged ghost (Scott Shilstone) to help his mother [[Hope Williams Brady|Hope]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Who's Coming|department=Comings and Goings|pages=10\u201311|journal=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=June 13, 2016|volume=41|issue=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=Peter Reckell Returns As Bo, Scott Shilstone To Play Grown-Up Zack, In DAYS Hope-Centric Episode!|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/peter-reckell-returns-as-bo-scott-shilstone-to-play-grown-up-zack-in-days-hope-centric-episode/2016/06/02/|website=[[On-Air On-Soaps]]|publisher=Michael Fairman Soaps, Inc.|accessdate=June 2, 2016|location=United States|date=June 2, 2016}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Bonnie Lockhart==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Bonnie Lockhart\n| series           = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer        = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Robin Riker]] (2000)\n* Kathy Connell (2000\u201302)\n* [[Judi Evans]] (2003\u201318)\n}}\n| years            = {{Flatlist |\n* 2000\u201307\n* 2017\u201318\n}}\n| first            = {{Start date|mf=yes|2000|07|11}}\n| last             = November 6, 2018\n| creator          = [[Tom Langan]]\n| introducer       = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Ken Corday]] and Tom Langan (2000)\n* Ken Corday, [[Albert Alarr]] and Greg Meng (2017)\n}}\n| books            = \n| spinoffs         = \n| crossover        = \n| classification   = [[List of Days of Our Lives cast members|Past; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        = \n| caption1         = \n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        = \n| caption2         = \n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        = \n| caption3         =\n| alias            = {{Plainlist |\n* Maureen Lockhart\n* Bonnie Maureen Lockhart\n* Bonnie Horton\n}}\n| occupation       = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Con-artist]]\n* Restaurant manager\n* [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|Housekeeper]]\n}}\n| residence        = [[Prison]]\n| family           =\n| parents          = \n| adoptiveparents  = <!-- Or \"adoptivefather\" and \"adoptivemother\" -->\n| stepparents      = <!-- Or \"stepfather\" and \"stepmother\" -->\n| siblings         = \n| spouse           = {{Plainlist |\n* David Lockhart (until 2003)\n* [[Mickey Horton]] (2004)\n}}\n| civilpartner     = \n| daughters         = [[Mimi Lockhart]]\n| sons = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Patrick Lockhart]]\n* [[Conner Lockhart]]\n}}\n| adoptivechildren = <!-- Or \"adoptivesons\" and \"adoptivedaughters\" -->\n| stepchildren     = <!-- Or \"stepsons\" and \"stepdaughters\" -->\n| grandchildren    = [[Tyler Kiriakis]]<br>Emily Lockhart\n| grandparents     = <!-- Or \"grandfathers\" and \"grandmothers\" -->\n| aunts/uncles     = <!-- Or \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" -->\n| nieces/nephews   = \n| cousins          = <!-- First cousins only -->\n| relatives        = <!-- For any other relative not listed above who is essential to the understanding of the character -->\n}}\n'''Bonnie Lockhart''' is the mother of [[Patrick Lockhart|Patrick]], [[Mimi Lockhart|Mimi]], and [[Conner Lockhart]].

Working as a [[Cleaner|housecleaner]], Bonnie resents her employers and other established families in Salem, even the blue-collar Bradys, because of what she perceives as their [[Social privilege|privilege]].  Bonnie frequently interferes in her daughter Mimi's life. When Mimi's boyfriend [[Rex Brady]] is believed to be a member of the wealthy DiMera family, Bonnie encourages the relationship.  But after Rex's true Brady family heritage is revealed, Bonnie discourages Rex from proposing to Mimi and persuades a pregnant Mimi to have an abortion without telling Rex about the pregnancy. After one of her employers, [[Maggie Horton]], is seemingly murdered in late 2003, Bonnie gets Maggie's widower, [[Mickey Horton]], to marry her. Mickey sets her up as the impresario of Maggie's old restaurant, Chez Rouge, which she reopens as a [[honky-tonk]], Alice's, named after her new mother-in-law, [[Alice Horton]], in hopes of ingratiating herself with Mickey's skeptical family. Mickey ends his marriage to Bonnie to resume his relationship with Maggie after she is found alive. Hoping to extort the Kiriakis family, Bonnie pays Mimi's surrogate Lauren to carry to term after accidentally being implanted with an embryo fathered by [[Philip Kiriakis]] instead of by Mimi's boyfriend Shawn-Douglas Brady. In 2007, the skeleton of David Lockhart's murdered corpse is found buried under a church. Bonnie reveals that Mimi killed her abusive father in self-defense years earlier and [[Post-traumatic amnesia|blacked out]] the incident. To protect Mimi, Bonnie confesses to killing David and sends Mimi to live in Arizona and look after Connor there. Bonnie stands trial offscreen and is jailed. Bonnie's scheme with Lauren comes to light after Bonnie's incarceration ends the payments, so Lauren abandons the baby, Tyler, who is adopted.\n\nBonnie escapes from prison in 2017 with the help of [[Hattie Adams]] and [[Anjelica Deveraux]]. It is established that Bonnie looks identical to Adrienne Kiriakis, which was not addressed in Evans's previous appearances as the characters.  Anjelica abducts Adrienne and leaves her imprisoned in Bonnie's place while Bonnie impersonates Adrienne. Anjelica orders Bonnie to break up with Adrienne's boyfriend [[Lucas Horton]] and reunite with Adrienne's and Angelica's ex-husband, [[Justin Kiriakis]], and then break his heart, enabling Anjelica to seduce him. Bonnie dumps Lucas, despite her attraction to him. This drives recovering alcoholic Lucas to drink, and when he drunkenly returns to Bonnie's hotel room, she welcomes him for a tryst. When Anjelica suddenly dies of a heart attack, Bonnie focuses on getting revenge on Maggie for, as she sees it, stealing Mickey from her. Using Justin to gain access to the Kiriakis mansion, where Maggie lives as [[Victor Kiriakis|Victor Kiriakis's]] wife after Mikey's death, Bonnie obtains incriminating information about Victor and attempts to blackmail him into divorcing Maggie and marrying her. Victor agrees, but secretly informs his loved ones about the blackmail, humoring Bonnie to buy time to eliminate the evidence of his crimes. To prevent parolee Sheila Watkins from honoring Adrienne's request to raise the alarm, Bonnie gives Sheila a job as a housekeeper. Victor rebukes Bonnie at the intended wedding, and Adrienne's brother [[Steve Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Steve Johnson]] detects her impersonation and exposes her. She flees Salem before she can be sent back to jail.\n\nThe next year, Bonnie returns to Salem with a baby, also named Bonnie, she claims was conceived with Lucas in their [[one-night stand]]. A DNA test proves that the baby is Bonnie and Lucas's. Bonnie then hides \"Baby Bonnie\" and refuses to divulge her whereabouts unless Lucas helps extricate her from her legal problems. Bonnie is set to be released when the truth is revealed:  the baby is really Emily, Mimi's daughter by Rex from their own one-night stand in a recent chance meeting. The DNA test produced a [[False positives and false negatives|false positive]] due to the close relationships between Bonnie and her daughter, and between brothers Rex and Lucas. Bonnie's deal is rescinded, and Hattie convinces Bonnie to return to prison and serve out he remainder of her sentence.\n\nIn 2019, after the show's one-year time jump, Bonnie has been released from prison and written a memoir. Bonnie does not appear onscreen, but Hattie reads Bonnie's book, \"Love Made me Loony.\"\n\n<br />\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Angela Moroni==\n'''Angela Moroni''' was portrayed by [[Ayda Field]] from late summer of 2000 until March 2001. Angela Moroni is the daughter of Vincent Moroni, an Italian mob boss. She was introduced during Brandon and Sami's quest to get the tape back with Kate forcing Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly. Angela came into possession of the tape, but she would only give it to Brandon if he married her. When Brandon and Sami went back to Salem, she came with them and kept the tape with her. When they returned to Europe, Brandon and Angela got married. When a spy from her father saw Brandon and Sami kiss, he hired two gunmen to kill Sami and Brandon at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. This backfired however, when Angela dove in front of Brandon. Before her death, Angela finally made her father give Brandon and Sami the tape.\n\n==Vincent Moroni==\n'''Vincent Moroni''' was portrayed by [[Carl Weintraub]] from summer 2000 until March 2001. Vincent Moroni was an Italian mob boss with one daughter, Angela. Upon meeting Brandon and Sami, he was immediately suspicious of them. After Kate told Vincent about the tape (containing Kate telling Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly) he took it from Angela. When Brandon married Angela anyway, Vincent was convinced he loved his daughter. Kate later slept with Vincent to convince him to kill Victor and manipulated him into spying on Sami and Brandon. When his spy told him about the kiss he ordered Victor, Brandon and Sami to be murdered at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. Chaos erupted then and Angela threw herself in front of Brandon, saving his life. Vincent was so upset at the events that he set in motion, that he committed suicide.\n\n==Hattie Adams==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Hattie Adams\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Andrea Hall Gengler|Andrea Hall]] (2000\u201301)\n* [[Deidre Hall]] (2004\u2013)\n}}\n| years            = {{Flat list |\n* 2000\u201301\n* 2004\n* 2016\u201319\n}}\n| introducer       = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Ken Corday]] and [[Tom Langan]] (2000)\n* Ken Corday and Stephen Wyman (2004)\n* Ken Corday, [[Albert Alarr]], and Greg Meng (2016)\n}}\n| classification   = [[Days of Our Lives cast members|Present; regular]]\n| first          = August 17, 2000\n| last           = \n| creator        = [[Tom Langan]]\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| family = \n| alias   = [[Marlena Evans]]\n| residence = [[Salem (Days of Our Lives)|Salem]], [[Wisconsin]]\n| parents     =\n| spouse     = [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]] (2018)\n| children   = \n| grandparents =\n| aunts/uncles = \n| cousins = \n}}\n'''Hattie Adams''' is a woman who bore a resemblance to [[Marlena Evans]]. Under the guidance of [[Wilhelm Rolf]], she had plastic surgery to increase this resemblance. [[Stefano DiMera]] planned to use Hattie against Marlena, but never implemented such a plan. Hattie eventually had further surgery (off-screen) to look identical to Marlena and reappeared briefly in 2004; she was suspected of being a serial killer after Marlena was supposedly witnessed committing the crimes, but it was determined that Marlena had performed the acts under hypnosis and Hattie was not involved. In 2016, an incarcerated [[Hope Williams Brady]] encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him. Hattie explains that she had become a secretary in [[Chicago]], but then a man she was dating stole money from her company and framed her for the theft. Hope agrees to help Hattie clear her name, and in exchange Hattie protects Hope from the prison's dominant clique.\n\nHattie was originally played by [[Andrea Hall-Gengler|Andrea Hall]], the real-life identical twin sister of Marlena's portrayer, [[Deidre Hall]]. From 2004 onward, after the character's final surgery and Andrea Hall's retirement from acting, Hattie was played by Deidre Hall. In November 2016, it was confirmed that Deidre Hall would reprise her portrayal of Hattie.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cushman|first1=Dustin|title=Deidre Hall to portray dual role again on ''Days of our Lives''|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/days-of-our-lives/comings-and-goings/1547/deidre-hall-to-portray-dual-role-again-on-days-of-our-lives|website=Soaps.com|publisher=[[SheKnows Media]]|accessdate=November 20, 2016|location=United States|date=November 13, 2016}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Harold Wentworth==\n'''Harold Wentworth''', played by Ryan Scott from 2001 until 2003, was introduced during a storyline in which [[Jack Deveraux]] pretended to be gay in order to spare Greta von Amberg's feelings, as he didn't return her affection. Greta tried to set Jack up with Harold, an openly gay man. Harold worked with Greta to set up situations where he and Jack could be intimate, but Jack would always find a way to escape. Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in [[Las Vegas]] at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the ''Spectator''. This was the local newspaper, which Jack hoped to run; Jennifer got the job instead, due in part to Harold's recommendation. Harold then worked at the ''Spectator'', and was able to maintain a friendly, professional relationship with Jack. He last appeared during the summer of 2003, shortly before the Salem Stalker storyline started.

The couple went to Salem, identified the sketch, and Glen inquired about the baby Marlo carried.\n\nThough given the runaround by the Carvers, he and Barb found that Marlo gave birth to a boy, in June 2000, and the Carvers had adopted him. [[Jennifer Deveraux]] had a car accident resulting in baby J.T. Brady falling into the river, while strapped in Isaac Carver's baby seat (his name was on it). Barb spotted the baby floating, like Moses in the rushes, and they rescued him. Thinking that he is Isaac, the Reibers fled to his aunt's cabin in the hills. Auntie discovered the surgery scar, and when the baby began to have breathing difficulties, Glen and Barb rushed him to the local hospital, but then returned to Salem. They already had a DNA test to prove Glen was the father of Marlo's child.\n\nAlthough facing kidnapping charges, Bo and Hope only wanted J.T. back safe, and promised not to press charges. The Reibers returned J.T., and went back to Chicago, where the DNA results arrived. Barb read them secretly, realizing Glen was the father of J.T., and not Isaac's father, and went back to Salem to blackmail [[Lexie Carver]]. She succeeded in getting several thousand dollars, and then told Glen that she was pregnant with their child, hoping he will not try to search for the truth. Eventually they both returned to Salem and crashed Lexie's party. When Lexie didn't come up with the million dollars, Barb blew the whistle. Glen sought out a slick attorney, Cameron Reese, to sue for custody of J.T. In the ensuing DNA test, it was proven that Glen was J.T.'s father.\n\nAfter Glen and Barb lost custody of J.T. to Bo and Hope, they returned to Chicago, where they prepared for the birth of their next child.\n\n==Tyler Kiriakis==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Tyler Kiriakis\n| portrayer      = Gabriella & Thalia\n| years            = \n| introducer       = [[Ken Corday]] and Stephen Wyman\n| classification   = [[List of previous Days of Our Lives cast members|Former, recurring]]\n| first          = August 10, 2007\n| last           = October 22, 2007\n| creator        = [[Hogan Sheffer]] and [[Meg Kelly]]\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| family = Kiriakis <br> Roberts\n| alias   = Ty Johnson <br> Tyler Wilkins \n| father     = [[Philip Kiriakis]]  \n| mother = [[Mimi Lockhart]]\n| adoptive parents = Mr. & Mrs. Wilkins\n| siblings   = Emily Lockhart\n| spouse     = \n| children   = \n| grandfathers = [[Victor Kiriakis]]<br />David Lockhart\n| grandmothers = [[Kate Roberts (Days of Our Lives)|Kate Roberts]]<br />[[Bonnie Lockhart]]\n| aunts = [[Isabella Toscano]]<br />[[Billie Reed]]<br />[[Cassie Brady]]\n| uncles = [[Bo Brady]]<br />[[Austin Reed (Days of Our Lives)|Austin Reed]]<br />[[Lucas Horton]]<br />[[Rex Brady]]<br />[[Patrick Lockhart]]<br>Connor Lockhart\n| cousins = [[Brady Black]]<br />[[Shawn-Douglas Brady]]<br />[[Chelsea Brady]]<br />[[Zack Brady]]<br />[[Ciara Brady]]<br />[[Will Horton]]<br />[[Allie Horton]]<br />Noah Reed <br /> Emily Lockhart\n}}\n'''Tyler Kiriakis''' is the son of [[Philip Kiriakis]] and [[Mimi Lockhart]].

Johnny is born with Allie on October 23, 2007. He is originally believed, like Allie, to be the son of [[Lucas Horton]], but after the birth, EJ begins to suspect that the twins might have different fathers because Johnny does not look like his sister, and EJ thinks Johnny looks like himself. A second DNA test confirms EJ to be Johnny's father. With a full name of John Roman DiMera, Johnny is named after his mom's dad and step-dad, [[Roman Brady]] and [[John Black (Days of Our Lives)|John Black]].\n\nJohnny has an older maternal half-brother in [[Will Horton]], and in 2009 he gains a full sister in [[Sydney DiMera]]. In 2013, Johnny becomes an uncle to Will's daughter [[Arianna Horton]].\n\nAfter witnessing a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection by the federal government as a vulnerable witness. Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife [[Nicole Walker]], in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, [[Stefano DiMera]]. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, [[Stefano DiMera|Stefano]] insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because he does not want to betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is ''his'' daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous [[Clyde Weston]].\n\nAfter losing his dad, Johnny goes with his mom and sisters to live in Los Angeles. A year later Sami takes them all on a round-the-world trip, and in the fall of 2017 the children stay with their [[Carrie Brady|Aunt Carrie]] and [[Austin Reed (Days of Our Lives)|Uncle Austin]] in Switzerland. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Crawford Decker==\n'''Crawford Decker''', played by John Sanderford (2007\u201308), was Ford Decker's father.

Upon his arrival in Salem, Daniel has romances with [[Chelsea Brady]] and her grandmother [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]].

Nicole miscarried but pretended to still be pregnant. She planned to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J.

The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather.

Working as a [[Cleaner|housecleaner]], Bonnie resents her employers and other established families in Salem, even the blue-collar Bradys, because of what she perceives as their [[Social privilege|privilege]].  Bonnie frequently interferes in her daughter Mimi's life. When Mimi's boyfriend [[Rex Brady]] is believed to be a member of the wealthy DiMera family, Bonnie encourages the relationship.  But after Rex's true Brady family heritage is revealed, Bonnie discourages Rex from proposing to Mimi and persuades a pregnant Mimi to have an abortion without telling Rex about the pregnancy. After one of her employers, [[Maggie Horton]], is seemingly murdered in late 2003, Bonnie gets Maggie's widower, [[Mickey Horton]], to marry her. Mickey sets her up as the impresario of Maggie's old restaurant, Chez Rouge, which she reopens as a [[honky-tonk]], Alice's, named after her new mother-in-law, [[Alice Horton]], in hopes of ingratiating herself with Mickey's skeptical family. Mickey ends his marriage to Bonnie to resume his relationship with Maggie after she is found alive. Hoping to extort the Kiriakis family, Bonnie pays Mimi's surrogate Lauren to carry to term after accidentally being implanted with an embryo fathered by [[Philip Kiriakis]] instead of by Mimi's boyfriend Shawn-Douglas Brady. In 2007, the skeleton of David Lockhart's murdered corpse is found buried under a church. Bonnie reveals that Mimi killed her abusive father in self-defense years earlier and [[Post-traumatic amnesia|blacked out]] the incident. To protect Mimi, Bonnie confesses to killing David and sends Mimi to live in Arizona and look after Connor there. Bonnie stands trial offscreen and is jailed. Bonnie's scheme with Lauren comes to light after Bonnie's incarceration ends the payments, so Lauren abandons the baby, Tyler, who is adopted.\n\nBonnie escapes from prison in 2017 with the help of [[Hattie Adams]] and [[Anjelica Deveraux]]. It is established that Bonnie looks identical to Adrienne Kiriakis, which was not addressed in Evans's previous appearances as the characters.  Anjelica abducts Adrienne and leaves her imprisoned in Bonnie's place while Bonnie impersonates Adrienne. Anjelica orders Bonnie to break up with Adrienne's boyfriend [[Lucas Horton]] and reunite with Adrienne's and Angelica's ex-husband, [[Justin Kiriakis]], and then break his heart, enabling Anjelica to seduce him. Bonnie dumps Lucas, despite her attraction to him. This drives recovering alcoholic Lucas to drink, and when he drunkenly returns to Bonnie's hotel room, she welcomes him for a tryst. When Anjelica suddenly dies of a heart attack, Bonnie focuses on getting revenge on Maggie for, as she sees it, stealing Mickey from her. Using Justin to gain access to the Kiriakis mansion, where Maggie lives as [[Victor Kiriakis|Victor Kiriakis's]] wife after Mikey's death, Bonnie obtains incriminating information about Victor and attempts to blackmail him into divorcing Maggie and marrying her. Victor agrees, but secretly informs his loved ones about the blackmail, humoring Bonnie to buy time to eliminate the evidence of his crimes. To prevent parolee Sheila Watkins from honoring Adrienne's request to raise the alarm, Bonnie gives Sheila a job as a housekeeper. Victor rebukes Bonnie at the intended wedding, and Adrienne's brother [[Steve Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Steve Johnson]] detects her impersonation and exposes her. She flees Salem before she can be sent back to jail.\n\nThe next year, Bonnie returns to Salem with a baby, also named Bonnie, she claims was conceived with Lucas in their [[one-night stand]]. A DNA test proves that the baby is Bonnie and Lucas's. Bonnie then hides \"Baby Bonnie\" and refuses to divulge her whereabouts unless Lucas helps extricate her from her legal problems.

In 2016, an incarcerated [[Hope Williams Brady]] encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him. Hattie explains that she had become a secretary in [[Chicago]], but then a man she was dating stole money from her company and framed her for the theft.

Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in [[Las Vegas]] at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the ''Spectator''.

It wasn't long until both couples learned the truth that there was a switch in the petri dishes. Philip and Mimi wanted to have both babies aborted but Belle chose not to have her child aborted. Unfortunately, she later had complications and her child was lost. After Shawn and Mimi separated, Mimi signed away their rights to the child and left its fate up to the surrogate mother [[Lauren Doyle|Lauren Chaffee]].  Bonnie Lockhart was paying Lauren with the intent to mother the child but Bonnie was sent to jail and Lauren was left to give birth on her own.\n\nPhilip and his sister Billie have traced Lauren's steps and now believe that \"Pocket\" or Ty Johnson, the baby boy being fostered by [[Kayla Brady]] and [[Steve Johnson (DAYS)|Steve Johnson]], is actually Tyler.<!-- The reference that you are refering to only says that Carrie is pregnant, and the same goes for the reference on the Carrie Brady Reed side -->\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Allie Horton==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Allie Horton\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist |\n* Elle and Ithaca Kremer (2007\u201308)\n* Charlotte and Stella Penfield (2008)\n* Ella and Anna Gietzen (2009)\n* Carolyn and Campbell Rose (2009\u201314)\n}}\n| years            = {{Flat list |\n* 2007\u201314\n}}\n| introducer       = [[Ken Corday]] and [[Edward J.

Allie goes for several weeks without a name until the Thanksgiving Day wedding of [[Shawn Brady and Belle Black|Shawn and Belle]], where Lucas announces her name as Alice Caroline Horton, and \"Allie\" for short. Sami is shocked because she and Lucas haven't yet reached a decision on their baby girl's name together, but happily Sami loves the name. Allie is named after her great-grandmothers, [[Alice Horton]] and [[Caroline Brady]]. Her twin, Johnny DiMera, is her maternal half-brother. Allie has a big brother in [[Will Horton]], and in 2009, she becomes big sister to her new maternal half-sister, [[Sydney DiMera]].\n\nIn February 2011, Allie goes to live in Hong Kong with her father Lucas for a while, after the man who is masquerading as her step-father [[Rafe Hernandez]] is mean to her several times. She returns after it is revealed that the man is an imposter. Sami and the real Rafe try to help Allie understand what has happened.\n\nIn May 2013, Allie becomes an aunt to [[Arianna Horton|Arianna Grace Horton]] (Will's daughter with [[Gabi Hernandez]]), and in April 2014 when Will gets married, Allie gains a brother-in-law in [[Sonny Kiriakis]].\n\nIn May 2014, Allie is walking into the Horton Town Square with [[Jordan Ridgeway]] when she sees her favorite cousin [[Nick Fallon]], who has been shot multiple times and is bleeding from the chest, stumble into the square and collapse. Allie screams and is the first person to notice him. Afterwards, she cannot stop looking at him despite her parents' attempts to get her to look away; and when Nick dies shortly after, she is traumatized by his death.\n\nIn October 2014, Allie moves with Sami, Johnny and Sydney, to live in California.

Johnny is born with Allie on October 23, 2007. He is originally believed, like Allie, to be the son of [[Lucas Horton]], but after the birth, EJ begins to suspect that the twins might have different fathers because Johnny does not look like his sister, and EJ thinks Johnny looks like himself. A second DNA test confirms EJ to be Johnny's father. With a full name of John Roman DiMera, Johnny is named after his mom's dad and step-dad, [[Roman Brady]] and [[John Black (Days of Our Lives)|John Black]].\n\nJohnny has an older maternal half-brother in [[Will Horton]], and in 2009 he gains a full sister in [[Sydney DiMera]]. In 2013, Johnny becomes an uncle to Will's daughter [[Arianna Horton]].\n\nAfter witnessing a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection by the federal government as a vulnerable witness. Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife [[Nicole Walker]], in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, [[Stefano DiMera]]. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, [[Stefano DiMera|Stefano]] insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because he does not want to betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is ''his'' daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous [[Clyde Weston]].\n\nAfter losing his dad, Johnny goes with his mom and sisters to live in Los Angeles.

Nicole miscarried but pretended to still be pregnant. She planned to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J.

Nicole, who has miscarried her fianc\u00e9 E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby.\n\nWhen Nicole learns that Sami had just recently given birth to her and E.J.'s daughter the same day Mia gave birth to hers, Nicole switches the babies, preferring to have E.J.'s biological daughter over an unrelated child. Nicole instantly bonds with Sydney, and vows to always protect her no matter what happens. Sami and E.J. are none the wiser to Nicole's treachery, and Sami and Rafe bond with \"Sami's\" daughter, while EJ and Nicole bond with \"their\" daughter.\n\nE.J. eventually learns that Nicole had a miscarriage and he kicks Nicole and Sydney out of the mansion, not knowing the truth about Sydney. Eventually, Sami also learns that Sydney is her biological daughter. Soon after, E.J. learns that Sydney is his biological child with Sami. However, the family reunion turns into a nightmare when [[Brady Black]] bails Nicole out of jail and she kidnaps Sydney. Nicole has a change of heart and decides to tell E.J. and Sami where Sydney is, but she is knocked out by [[Anna DiMera]], who takes Sydney. It is later revealed that Anna was hired by E.J. to kidnap Sydney.\n\nSydney becomes the subject of many custody battles between E.J. and Sami over the next few years, with Nicole involved, as well, during the time she is married to E.J. They later come to an agreement, though, and Sydney is able to stay with her entire family, including her siblings, [[Johnny DiMera|Johnny]], [[Allie Horton]], and [[Will Horton]]. Sydney became an aunt when Gabi Hernandez gave birth to Will's daughter, [[Arianna Horton]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Nathan Horton==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Nathan Horton\n| series           = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer        = [[Mark Hapka]]\n| years            = 2009\u201311\n| first            = June 18, 2009\n| last             = May 17, 2011\n| creator          = <!-- Only sourced content -->\n| introducer       = <!-- Executive producer at the time -->\n| books            = \n| spinoffs         = \n| crossover        = \n| classification   = [[List of previous Days of Our Lives cast members|Former, regular]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        = \n| caption1         = \n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        = \n| caption2         = \n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        = \n| caption3         =\n| alias            = \n| species          = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| breed            = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| occupation       = Physician\n| residence        = <!-- Or \"home\" -->Baltimore, Maryland\n| family           = Horton\n| owner            = <!-- For non-humans (pets) only -->\n| mother           = [[Melissa Horton]]\n| adoptiveparents  = <!-- Or \"adoptivefather\" and \"adoptivemother\" -->\n| stepparents      = <!-- Or \"stepfather\" and \"stepmother\" -->\n| siblings         = <!-- Or \"brothers\" and \"sisters\" -->\n| spouse           = <!-- Or \"husband\" and \"wife\" -->\n| civilpartner     = \n| children         = <!-- Or \"sons\" and \"daughters\" -->\n| adoptivechildren = <!-- Or \"adoptivesons\" and \"adoptivedaughters\" -->\n| stepchildren     = <!-- Or \"stepsons\" and \"stepdaughters\" -->\n| grandchildren    = <!-- Or \"grandsons\" and \"granddaughters\" -->\n| grandparents     = {{unbulleted list|Jim Philips|Linda Patterson|[[Mickey Horton]] (adoptive)|[[Maggie Horton]] (adoptive)}}\n| aunts/uncles     = {{unbulleted list|Summer Townsend (adoptive)|[[Days of Our Lives characters (2000s)#Daniel Jonas|Daniel Jonas]] (adoptive)|[[Sarah Horton]] (adoptive)}}\n| nieces/nephews   = <!-- Or \"nephews\" and \"nieces\" -->\n| cousins          = <!-- First cousins only -->[[Melanie Jonas]] (adoptive)<br>[[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Parker Jonas|Parker Jonas]] (adoptive)<br>[[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Holly Jonas|Holly Jonas]] (adoptive) Mackenzie Horton (adoptive) \n| relatives        = <!-- For any other relative not listed above who is essential to the understanding of the character -->\n}}\n'''Nathan Horton''', portrayed by [[Mark Hapka]], is a doctor who came to Salem in June 2009 to start an internship at Salem University Hospital.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{under construction |nosection=yes |nocat=true |comment= |category= }}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = \n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], United States\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show'' (also known as ''The Island of Sanity'')\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = {{CAN}}\n|prevshow    =Greenline \n|website     = \n|spouse=Deborah Green|awards=}}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[radio personality]],<ref name=\"OCOct05\">{{cite news | title=Imagine Lowell Green stoned: Then think about farm animals | newspaper=Ottawa Citizen | date=7 October 2005 | page=F1 | first=Kelly | last=Egan }}</ref> [[journalist]], and [[author]], best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] on [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "New heading, Career", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}
