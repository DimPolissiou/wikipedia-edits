It is intended to deter a potential enemy because they cannot ensure eliminating the entire stockpile in a [[first strike]] if a [[ballistic missile submarine]] remains undetected.\n\nSince the [[Strategic Defence Review]] (SDR), the UK has maintained a stockpile of around 215 warheads, with around 120 active (usable). Under the continuous at sea deterrence policy, at least one {{sclass-|Vanguard|submarine|0}} SSBN is kept on patrol with up to 16 [[Trident missile]]s sharing up to 48 warheads from the stockpile at any given time.

It is intended to deter a potential enemy because they cannot ensure eliminating the entire stockpile in a [[first strike]] if a [[ballistic missile submarine]] remains undetected.\n\nSince the [[Strategic Defence Review]] (SDR), the UK has maintained a stockpile of around 215 warheads, with around 120 active (usable). Under the continuous at sea deterrence policy, at least one {{sclass-|Vanguard|submarine|0}} SSBN is kept on patrol with up to 16 [[Trident missile]]s sharing up to 48 warheads from the stockpile at any given time.
