In 1836. he commanded a surveying ship on the north and west coasts of Africa and in the British seas. Belcher took up the work which Beechey had left unfinished on the Pacific coast of [[South America]]. He was on board {{HMS|Sulphur|1826|6}}, which was ordered to return to England in 1839 via the Trans-Pacific route. Belcher made various observations at a number of islands which he visited, having been delayed by being despatched to take part in the [[First Opium War|war in China]] in 1840.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn 25 January 1841, Commander Belcher landed on [[Possession Point]] at the north shore [[Hong Kong Island]] and made the first British survey of [[Hong Kong]] harbour. After the war's end in 1842 he reached home and for his services was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the following year. He was then engaged on {{HMS|Samarang|1822|6}}, in surveying work in the [[East Indies]], the Philippines, [[Port Hamilton]], and other places, until 1847.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Arctic expedition===\nIn 1852 Belcher led the last and largest Admiralty expedition to rescue [[Sir John Franklin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He was also to look for his former surveying officer in Hong Kong, [[Richard Collinson|Sir Richard Collinson]], and [[Robert McClure|Sir Robert McClure]], whose ships had not been seen after entering the Bering Strait. He did a great deal of sledge exploration, rescued McClure and abandoned four of his five ships in the ice.\n\nHe had five ships: {{HMS|Assistance|1850|6}} (Belcher), {{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}} ([[Henry Kellett]], second mate [[George Nares]]), the steam tenders ''Pioneer'' ([[Sherard Osborn]]) and ''Intrepid'' ([[Leopold McClintock|Sir Leopold McClintock]]) and the depot ship {{HMS|North Star|1824|6}} ([[William Pullen]]). Belcher and one tender were to enter [[Wellington Channel]], where Franklin was thought to be, while Kellett was to go west to [[Melville Island (Arctic)|Melville Island]] and look for Collinson and McClure. ''North Star'' was to stay at [[Beechey Island]] as a supply base.\n\nHe left the [[Nore]] in April 1850. By early winter ''Assistance'' and ''Pioneer'' were frozen in at [[Northumberland Sound]] to the north of Wellington Channel while ''Resolute'' and ''Intrepid'' were frozen in off Melville Island &mdash;the first ships this far West since [[Sir William Edward Parry]] in 1819. A great deal of exploration was done by [[manhauling|manhauled]] sledges. In April 1853 [[Leopold McClintock]] and others left ''Resolute'' on sledges and returned 105&nbsp;days later, having covered {{convert|1400|mi|km}} and discovered [[Prince Patrick Island]].\n\nAnother party went West and discovered Robert McClure, whose ship was frozen in at [[Mercy Bay]]. Belcher went north by sledge and found a channel at the northern tip of [[Devon Island]], hinting that Franklin might have used it to escape to [[Baffin Bay]]. When the ice broke up that summer, he pushed his ships up Wellington Channel and became trapped again.\n\nBy February 1854, Belcher was becoming increasingly worried about the safety of his ships and men. In April he ordered Kellett to abandon his ships and return by sledge to ''North Star''. Belcher abandoned his two ships in late July. Aided by two ships that showed up at Beechey Island ({{HMS|Phoenix|1832|2}} and {{ship||Breadalbane|ship|2}}), the whole party returned to England. Belcher went through a [[court martial]], which was automatic for any captain who had lost a ship.\n[[File:WilliamsNorthStar1845.jpg|thumb|right|''H M S North Star destroying Pomare's P\u0101, 1845.''

I-95 continues from the end of I-80 to the [[George Washington Bridge]] for access to [[New York City]]. The highway runs parallel to [[U.S. Route&nbsp;46]] (US&nbsp;46) through rural areas of [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren]] and [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex]] counties before heading into more suburban surroundings in [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]]. As the road continues into [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]] and Bergen counties, it heads into more urban areas. The [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT) identifies I-80 within the state as the '''Christopher Columbus Highway'''.<ref name=sld />\n\nA freeway along the I-80 corridor had been planned in 1936 and again in 1955 to provide relief along US&nbsp;46 between the George Washington Bridge and the [[Delaware Water Gap]]. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, this planned freeway, which had been identified in some planning documents as the '''Bergen-Passaic Expressway''', would be incorporated into I-80. The freeway was built across New Jersey in various stages from the 1960s to 1973. The westernmost four miles in New Jersey was originally a rerouting of [[U.S. Route 611|US&nbsp;611]] when built; that route was later realigned back into Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s had existed on a part of I-80 in Morris County but were opened to regular traffic due to under-use.\n\n== Route description ==\n=== Warren and Sussex counties ===\n[[File:2018-06-28 09 19 00 View east along Interstate 80 just west of Exit 1 within the Delaware Water Gap in Hardwick Township, Warren County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|View east along I-80 just after entering New Jersey within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]]\nI-80 enters [[Hardwick Township, New Jersey|Hardwick Township]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] from Pennsylvania on the [[Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge]] over the [[Delaware River]], maintained by the [[Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission]] (DRJTBC).<ref name=sld /> In addition to carrying I-80, this bridge also carries the [[Appalachian Trail]] over the Delaware River.

In [[New Jersey]], I-80 runs for {{convert|68.54|mi|km}} from the [[Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge]] at the [[Pennsylvania]] state line to its eastern terminus at [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]] in [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]]. I-95 continues from the end of I-80 to the [[George Washington Bridge]] for access to [[New York City]]. The highway runs parallel to [[U.S. Route&nbsp;46]] (US&nbsp;46) through rural areas of [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren]] and [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex]] counties before heading into more suburban surroundings in [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]]. As the road continues into [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]] and Bergen counties, it heads into more urban areas. The [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT) identifies I-80 within the state as the '''Christopher Columbus Highway'''.<ref name=sld />\n\nA freeway along the I-80 corridor had been planned in 1936 and again in 1955 to provide relief along US&nbsp;46 between the George Washington Bridge and the [[Delaware Water Gap]]. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, this planned freeway, which had been identified in some planning documents as the '''Bergen-Passaic Expressway''', would be incorporated into I-80. The freeway was built across New Jersey in various stages from the 1960s to 1973. The westernmost four miles in New Jersey was originally a rerouting of [[U.S. Route 611|US&nbsp;611]] when built; that route was later realigned back into Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s had existed on a part of I-80 in Morris County but were opened to regular traffic due to under-use.\n\n== Route description ==\n=== Warren and Sussex counties ===\n[[File:2018-06-28 09 19 00 View east along Interstate 80 just west of Exit 1 within the Delaware Water Gap in Hardwick Township, Warren County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|View east along I-80 just after entering New Jersey within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]]\nI-80 enters [[Hardwick Township, New Jersey|Hardwick Township]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] from Pennsylvania on the [[Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge]] over the [[Delaware River]], maintained by the [[Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission]] (DRJTBC).<ref name=sld /> In addition to carrying I-80, this bridge also carries the [[Appalachian Trail]] over the Delaware River.

Immediately after the river, the highway reaches the [[County Route 507 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;507]] exit.<ref name=sld /> It continues near suburban neighborhoods, coming to a bridge over [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway]]'s (NYSW) New Jersey Subdivision line, and passes over NJ Transit's [[Bergen County Line]] as it comes to an interchange with the [[Garden State Parkway]] on the border of Elmwood Park and [[Saddle Brook, New Jersey|Saddle Brook]] that also has connections to CR&nbsp;67.<ref name=sld /><ref name=gm /> At the Garden State Parkway, I-80 gains a 2-2 local-express lane configuration eastbound while the westbound direction carries four lanes. The next interchange along the road is with CR&nbsp;79, and is a westbound entrance and an eastbound exit accessible from the local lanes. The freeway passes over the NYSW line again and turns south along the west bank of the [[Saddle River (Passaic River)|Saddle River]], eventually crossing it into [[Lodi, New Jersey|Lodi]].<ref name=sld /> Immediately after, there is a [[diamond interchange]] at Riverview Avenue that provides access to [[New Jersey Route 4|Route&nbsp;4]] and [[New Jersey Route 17|Route&nbsp;17]]. Heading southeast, I-80 passes over NYSW's Lodi Branch line and comes to an interchange at Route&nbsp;17, which provides access to US&nbsp;46 to the south, Route&nbsp;4 to the north, and various local roads. At this point, I-80 runs between the travel lanes of Route&nbsp;17 as it continues into [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]]. Past Route&nbsp;17, I-80 gains a 3-2-2-3 local-express lane configuration and crosses NJ Transit's [[Pascack Valley Line]] before passing through industrial parks and running through a small part of [[South Hackensack, New Jersey|South Hackensack]].<ref name=sld /><ref name=gm /> Here, there is an interchange to Green Street before the highway comes into [[Teterboro, New Jersey|Teterboro]]. Turning east, the freeway runs through South Hackensack before entering Hackensack, where an exit provides access to CR&nbsp;124 (Hudson Street).<ref name=sld /> The road passes near neighborhoods before crossing the [[Hackensack River]] into [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]], where it passes over NYSW's New Jersey Subdivision line and [[CSX]]'s [[River Subdivision (CSX Transportation)|River Subdivision]] line before there is an exit for 2nd Street.<ref name=sld /><ref name=gm /> The freeway passes through a corner of [[Bogota, New Jersey|Bogota]] before it continues into [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]].<ref name=sld /><ref name=gm /> In Teaneck, I-80 reaches its eastern terminus at the interchange with [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]] (the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]).

It is known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in [[oasis]] cities on the northern edge of the [[Tarim Basin]] (now part of [[Xinjiang]] in northwest China) and the [[Lop Desert]]. The discovery of this language family in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family on the [[Centum and satem languages|centum\u2013satem isogloss]], and prompted reinvigorated study of the family. Identifying the authors with the ''Tokharoi'' people of ancient [[Bactria]] (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages \"Tocharian\". Although this identification is now generally considered mistaken, the name has remained.\n\nThe documents record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also ''East Tocharian'', ''Agnean,'' or ''Turfanian'') and Tocharian B (''West Tocharian'' or ''Kuchean''). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from [[Turfan]] in the east to [[Tumshuq]] in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the [[Lop Nur|Lop Nor]] basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (''Kror\u00e4nian''). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in [[Kharosthi|Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b]] script has been discredited.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\" >{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Douglas Q. |title='Tocharian C' Again: The Plot Thickens and the Mystery Deepens |url=https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44503 |website=Language Log |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the 5th or even late 4th century AD, making Tocharian a language of [[Late Antiquity]] contemporary with [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Classical Armenian]] and [[Primitive Irish]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Ronald I. |editor1-last=Rieken |editor1-first=Elisabeth |title=100 Jahre Entzifferung des Hethitischen.

The areas of the squares are proportional to population.]]\n\nThe existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim basin by [[Aurel Stein]] in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.<ref>Deuel, Leo. 1970.

In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between [[centum\u2013satem isogloss|centum and satem languages]] was a simple west\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of [[Hittite language|Hittite]], a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the [[wave model]] of [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]], suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nMost scholars reject [[Walter Bruno Henning]]'s proposed link to [[Gutian language|Gutian]], a language spoken on the [[Iranian plateau]] in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.{{sfnp|Mallory|Mair|2000|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nTocharian probably died out after 840 when the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], expelled from Mongolia by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], moved into the Tarim Basin.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\n\nSome modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, eg.

Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in [[Kucha]] and [[Karasahr]], including many mural inscriptions.\n\nMost of attested Tocharian was written in the [[Tocharian alphabet]], a derivative of the [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] alphabetic syllabary ([[abugida]]) also referred to as North Turkestan Brahmi or slanting Brahmi.

Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a [[liturgical language]], no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern [[Romance languages]], or [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and ''o'' vs. ''e'' distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\n\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE ''\u0113'' in Tocharian B (possibly from the long-vowel perfect found in Latin ''l\u0113g\u012b'', ''f\u0113c\u012b'', etc.).<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\nTocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected.<ref>M. Peyrot, ''Variation and Change in Tocharian B'', Amsterdam and New York, 2008</ref> The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha. There are also the middle (\u2018classical\u2019), and the late stage.<ref>Micha\u00ebl Peyrot (2015), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tocharian-language TOCHARIAN LANGUAGE] iranicaonline.org</ref>\n\n== Tocharian C ==\nBased on 3rd-century Loulan G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b Prakrit documents containing Tocharian loanwords such as ''kilme'' 'district', ''\u1e63o\u1e63tha\u1e43ga'' 'tax collector', and ''\u1e63ilpoga'' 'document', T.

While a full report of what languages these texts represent is not yet available, their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\"/>\n\n==Phonology==\n\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \"[[Centum and satem languages|centum]]\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the [[palatovelar]] consonants {{PIE|(*\u1e31, *\u01f5, *\u01f5\u02b0)}} of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]] with the plain [[velars]] (*k, *g, *g\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe ([[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]]). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]]) seems to have been an isolate in the \"[[Centum-Satem isogloss|satem]]\" (i.e. [[palatovelar]] to [[sibilant]]) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|p=107}}<ref name=\"baldi\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY7-DBWPW4C&pg=PA39 [[Philip Baldi|Baldi, Philip]] ''The Foundations of Latin'' (1999), pg 39]</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

It is clearly phonemic because sequences ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' also exist (from [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] of a former ''\u00e4'' between them).\n\n==Proto-Tocharian==\n\n===Vowels===\nProto-Tocharian shows radical changes in its vowels from [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). Length distinctions eventually disappeared, but prior to that all pairs of long and short vowels had become distinct in quality, and thus have different outcomes. Many pairs of PIE vowels are distinguished in Tocharian only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of palatalization.  For example, PIE ''o'' and ''\u0113'' both evolved into Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (possibly {{IPAslink|\u025b}}), but PIE ''\u0113'' palatalized the preceding consonant, and left a ''y'' when no consonant preceded, while neither of these occurs with PIE ''o''.\n\nReconstructing the changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian vowels is fraught with difficulty, and as a result there are a large number of disagreements among different researchers.  The basic problems are:\n*Tocharian A and B are relatively sparsely attested.\n*The extensive mergers of PIE stop consonants lead to many ambiguities in the potential etymologies underlying particular Tocharian words.\n*The radical restructuring of the vowel system means that few potential sound changes can be rejected as unreasonable, no matter how unlikely they may look on the surface.\n*A large amount of analogical change has occurred in both the nominal and verbal systems, making it difficult to identify which changes are regular.\n\nHistorically, the evolution of the Tocharian vowels was the last part of the diachronic phonology to be understood. In 1938, [[George Sherman Lane|George S. Lane]] remarked of Tocharian that \"the vocalism so far has defied almost every attempt that has been made to bring it to order\",<ref>Lane, George S. \"Problems of Tocharian Phonology\". ''Language'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1938), pp. 20\u201338.</ref> and as late as 1945 still asserted: \"That the subject [of palatalization] is a confused and difficult one is generally recognized\u2014but so are most of the problems of Tocharian phonology.\"<ref>Lane, George S. \"The Tocharian Palatalization (I)\". ''Language'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1945), pp. 18\u201326.</ref> However, rapid progress towards understanding the evolution of the vocalic system, and with it the phonology as a whole, occurred during the period of approximately 1948\u20131960, beginning with Sieg and Siegling (1949).<ref>Sieg, Emil and Wilhelm Siegling (1949), ''Tocharische Sprachreste'', Sprache B. Heft 1. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht.</ref> By 1960, the system was well-enough understood that Krause and Thomas's seminal work of that year{{sfnp|Krause|Thomas|1960}} is still considered one of the most important Tocharian grammatical handbooks.<ref>Ringe, Donald A, Jr. (1990). Review of ''Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology'' by Douglas Q. Adams. ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990).</ref>\n\nDespite the apparent equivalence between the Tocharian A and B vowel systems, in fact a number of vowels are not cognate between the two varieties, and Proto-Tocharian had a different vowel system from both.  For example, Tocharian A ''a'' reflects a merger of two Proto-Tocharian vowels that are distinguished in Tocharian B as ''e'' and ''o'', while Tocharian B ''a'' reflects a stress-based variant of either Proto-Tocharian ''\u0101'' or ''\u00e4'', while Tocharian A preserves original ''\u0101'' and ''\u00e4'' regardless of the position of stress.\n\nAs a general rule, Tocharian B reflects the Proto-Tocharian vowel system more faithfully than Tocharian A, which includes a number of changes not found in Tocharian B, e.g. monophthongization of diphthongs, loss of all absolutely final vowels, loss of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and epenthesis of ''\u00e4'' to break up difficult clusters (esp. word-finally) that resulted from vowel losses.\n\nThe following table describes a typical minimal reconstruction of Late Proto-Tocharian, which includes all vowels that are generally accepted by Tocharian scholars:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

However, Ringe reconstructs three vowels ''*\u00eb, *e, *\u1eb9'' in place of the single vowel ''*e'' in the minimal system.  The primary distinction is between ''*\u00eb'' < PIE ''*o'', which is assumed to be a central rather than a front vowel because it does not trigger palatalization, and ''*e'' < PIE ''*\u0113'', which does trigger palatalization.  Other than palatalization effects, both vowels are reflected identically in both Tocharian A and B, and hence a number of researchers project the merger back to Proto-Tocharian.  However, some umlaut processes are thought to have operated differently on the two vowels, and as a result Ringe (as well as Adams<ref>Douglas Adams, \"Ablaut and Umlaut in the Tocharian Vowel System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 4 (Oct. \u2013 Dec., 1978), pp. 446- 450.</ref> and some other scholars) prefer to distinguish the two in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe's ''*\u1eb9'' vowel, a higher vowel than ''*e'', is fairly rare and appears as ''i'' in Tocharian B but ''e'' in Tocharian A.  This vowel does trigger palatalization, and is thought by Ringe to stem primarily from PIE ''*oy'' and from loanwords.  In general, Ringe's Proto-Tocharian reconstruction reflects an earlier stage than the one described by many researchers.\n\nSome scholars use a different notation from what is given above: e.g. ''\u00e6'' or ''\u00eb'' in place of the ''e'' of the minimal system, ''\u00e5'' or ''\u0254'' in place of the ''o'' of the minimal system, and ''\u01dd'' in place of ''\u00e4''.\n\nThe following table shows the changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Tocharian (PToch) and on to Tocharian B (TB) and Tocharian A (TA), using the notation of the \"minimal\" system above:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

When following a consonant, that consonant is palatalized; otherwise, a ''y'' appears.  Before PIE ''i'', consonants other than dentals are not necessarily palatalized (researchers differ on what exactly happened); this is indicated as (+).\n#A \u2014 sign indicates no vowel; this results from deletion of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables.\n#Tocharian B reflects Proto-Tocharian central vowels (''\u00e4'', ''\u0101'') differently depending on whether they bore stress or not.  This is indicated in the table above: stressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''a \u0101'' while unstressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''\u00e4 a'' (i.e. Tocharian B ''a'' reflects either stressed ''\u00e4'' or unstressed ''\u0101'').  An additional complication is that unstressed ''\u00e4'' is deleted in open syllables.  See below.\n\nProto-Tocharian had phonemic stress, although its position varies depending on the researcher. Many researchers project the Tocharian B stress that is recoverable from ''\u0101''~''a'' and ''a''~''\u00e4'' alternations back to Proto-Tocharian. For the most part, this stress does not reflect PIE stress.  Rather, most bisyllabic words have initial stress, and trisyllabic and longer words usually have stress on the second syllable.  A number of multisyllabic words in Tocharian B appear to indicate that more than one syllable was stressed; it is thought that these reflect clitics or affixes that still behaved phonologically as separate words in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> however, prefers to project the PIE stress unchanged into Proto-Tocharian, and assumes that the radically different system seen in Tocharian B evolved within the separate history of that language.\n\nThe outcome of the PIE sequences ''*iH'' and ''*uH'' when not followed by a vowel is disputed.  It is generally agreed that ''*ih\u2082'' became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101''; a similar change occurred in [[Ancient Greek]].  It is also usually accepted that ''*ih\u2083'' likewise became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101'', although it is unclear whether this reflects a direct change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u0101 /ya/'' or a change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u014d /yo:/ > *y\u0101 /ya/'' (echoing a similar change in Ancient Greek), since PIE ''*\u014d'' is generally thought to have become Proto-Tocharian ''*\u0101'' (which was not a long vowel).  The outcomes of all other sequences are much less clear.  A number of etymologies appear to indicate a parallel change ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'', but some also appear to indicate a change ''*uh\u2082 > *\u016b > *u''. Ringe<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> demonstrates that all the occurrences of ''*w\u0101'' can potentially be explained as due to analogy, and prefers to postulate a general sound change ''*uH > *\u016b > *u'' following the normal outcome of ''*uH'' in other languages, but a number of other researchers (e.g. Krause and Slocum<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>) prefer to see ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'' as the regular sound change.  The outcome of ''*ih\u2081'' is likewise disputed, with Ringe similarly preferring a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *\u012b > i'' while others postulate a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *ye > *y\u00e4''. As elsewhere, the main difficulty is that, relative to other Indo-European languages, Tocharian is sparsely attested and was subject to a particularly large number of analogical changes.\n\nA number of umlaut processes occurred in the Proto-Tocharian period, which tended to increase the number of rounded vowels.  Vowel rounding also resulted from the influence of nearby labiovelars, although this occurred after the Proto-Tocharian period, with differing results in Tocharian A and B, generally with more rounding in Tocharian A (e.g. PIE ''*g\u02b7\u1e43-'' \"come\" > PToch ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' > Tocharian A ''kum-'' but Tocharian B ''k\u00e4m-'').\n\n===Vowel deletion and insertion===\nTocharian A deletes all Proto-Tocharian final vowels, as well as all instances of Proto-Tocharian ''\u00e4'' in [[open syllable]]s (which appears to include vowels followed by ''Cr'' and ''Cl'' sequences).  When this produces impossible consonant sequences, these are rectified by vocalizing ''w'' and ''y'' into ''u'' and ''i'', if possible; otherwise, an epenthetic ''\u00e4'' is inserted.  Note that most consonant sequences are tolerated word-initially, including unexpected cases like ''rt-'', ''ys-'' and ''lks-''.  Example: PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' (Greek ''erythros'') > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch A *''rtr'' > ''rt\u00e4r''.\n\nTocharian B deletes only unstressed ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and leaves all other vowels alone.  Hence PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch B ''ratre''.  If necessary, impossible consonant sequences are rectified as in Tocharian A.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following are the main changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian:\n*[[Centum]] change: PIE \"palatals\" merge with PIE \"plain velars\".\n*Loss of PIE ''d'' (but not other dentals) in a number of words when not followed by a PIE front vocalic.\n*Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration, resulting in (e.g.) the merger of PIE ''k, g, gh''.\n*Palatalization of all consonants before PIE ''e, \u0113, y'' and sometimes ''i'', producing a number of new phonemes (''c'', ''\u015b'', ''\u1e63'', ''ts'', ''\u00f1'', ''ly'').\n*Loss of final consonants other than ''r'', including total loss of certain final clusters (e.g. ''nts'').\n\nThe extant Tocharian languages appear to reflect essentially the same consonant system as in Proto-Tocharian, except in a couple of cases:\n*A new phoneme ''\u1e45'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}} eventually developed.  This was originally an allophone of ''n'' before ''k'', but became phonemic when vowel losses resulted in instances of ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' contrasting with ''\u1e45k'', and occasional loss of ''k'' between consonants resulted in instances of ''\u1e45'' not before ''k''.\n*The Proto-Tocharian labiovelar ''*k\u02b7'' eventually merged with ''k'' in both Tocharian A and B.  However, this clearly post-dated Proto-Tocharian, because the former ''*k\u02b7'' often rounded adjacent vowels prior to its loss, in a way that differed between A and B (e.g. Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' \"come\" > A ''kum-'' but B ''k\u00e4m-''). In addition, according to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-adams\">Donald A. Ringe Jr, \"Review of 'Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology' by Douglas Q. Adams\", ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990), pp. 400\u2013408.</ref> Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7'' is sometimes retained in Tocharian B when directly preceding a voiceless consonant, particularly in western dialect texts.\n\nUnlike in most ''[[centum]]'' languages, Proto-Tocharian maintained separate outcomes of PIE ''*k\u02b7'' and ''*\u1e31w''.<ref name=\"ringe-adams\"/> The latter is still reflected as ''kw'' in Tocharian B, e.g. ''yakwe'' \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos''.\n\n===Palatalization===\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] was a very important process operating in Proto-Tocharian.  Palatalization appears to have operated very early, prior to almost all of the vowel changes that took place between PIE and Proto-Tocharian. Palatalization occurred before PIE ''e'', ''\u0113'', ''y'' and sometimes ''i''; specifically, PIE ''i'' triggered palatalization of dentals but generally not of velars or labials. (According to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> lack of palatalization before PIE ''i'' was actually due to early change of ''i'' > ''w\u01dd'' after certain sounds.) Palatalization, or lack thereof, is the only way to distinguish PIE ''e'' and ''i'' in Tocharian, and the primary way of distinguishing certain other pairs of PIE vowels, e.g. ''e'' vs. ''u'' and ''\u0113'' vs. ''o''. Palatalization appeared to have operated in two stages, an earlier one that affected only the sequences ''ty'' and ''dhy'', and a later more general one \u2014 or at least, the result of palatalization of ''t'' and ''dh'' before ''y'' is different from palatalization before ''e, \u0113'' and ''i'', while other consonants do not show such a dual outcome. (A similar situation occurred in the history of [[Proto-Greek]] and [[Proto-Romance]].) Certain sound changes occurred prior to palatalization:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n#Some changes involving PIE dentals; see below.\n#The development of PIE ''iH'' into ''y'' + vowel.

Palatalization sometimes produces ''c'', sometimes ''ts'', sometimes ''\u015b'', and in some words when a front vocalic does not follow, PIE ''*d'' (but not other dentals) is lost entirely, e.g. e.g. Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' and Toch B ''ime'' \"thought\" < PToch ''*w'\u00e4im\u00eb'' < PIE ''*weid-mo-''.  Many occurrences of ''c'' and ''ts'' can be explained by the differing effects of a following ''y'' vs. a front vowel (see above), but a number of difficult cases remain.\n\nMost researchers agree that some of the PIE dentals are reflected differently from others \u2014 contrary to the situation with all other PIE stops.  This in turn suggests that some sound changes must have operated on particular dentals, but not others, prior to the general loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration.  There is a large amount of disagreement over what exactly the relevant sound changes were, due to the relatively small number of extant forms involved, the operation of analogy, and disagreement over particular etymologies, including both the PIE roots and ablaut forms involved.  Ringe suggests the following changes, in approximate order:<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/>\n#[[Grassmann's Law]], which triggers the change ''dh > d'' when another aspirated consonant occurs later in a word (and which also operated in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]).\n#The change ''d'' > ''dz'', which occurred after Grassmann's Law if it existed.\n#Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration (which may have occurred after palatalization).\n#Palatalization.  The new sound ''ts'' palatalizes to ''\u015b''; this explains cases like Toch B ''\u015bak'', Toch A ''\u015b\u00e4k'' \"ten\" < PIE ''*dek\u1e43(t)''.\n#Loss of ''ts'' before consonants.\n\nEven with this explanation, a lot of words don't have the expected outcomes and require appeal to analogy.  For example, the assumption of Grassmann's Law helps to explain only two words, both verbs, in which PIE ''*dh'' shows up as ''ts''; and in both of these words, palatalization to ''\u015b'' might have been expected, because the present-tense forms both begin with PIE ''*dhe-''. Ringe needs to appeal to an analogical depalatalization, based on other forms of the verb with different ablaut patterns in which palatalization was not triggered. This assumption is reasonable, because a lot of other verbs also show analogical depalatalization; but nonetheless, it is rather slender evidence, and it is not surprising that other researchers have proposed different assumptions (e.g. that PToch ''*ts\u00e4-'' is the expected outcome of PIE ''*dhe-'', with no operation of Grassmann's Law).\n\nLikewise, the loss of PIE ''*d'' in Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' is not explainable by these rules, because it is lost before a vowel rather than a consonant.  Ringe again assumes analogy: In this case, the PIE conjugation was nominative ''*doru'', genitive ''*dreus'', and Ringe assumes that the normal loss of ''*d'' in the genitive before ''*r'' was carried over into the nominative. Again, not all researchers accept this. For example, Krause and Slocum, while accepting the remainder of Ringe's sound changes involving PIE ''*d'', suggest instead that loss eventually occurred before Proto-Tocharian rounded vowels and before Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (from PIE ''o''), as well as before nasals and possibly other consonants.<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\nTocharian has completely re-worked the [[declension|nominal declension]] system of Proto-Indo-European.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=92}} The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, [[accusative case|accusative]], and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the ''oblique'' case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word ''{{IAST|yakwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|yuk}}'' (Toch A) \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos'' is declined as follows:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Grammatical case|Case]]\n! colspan=3|Tocharian B\n! colspan=3|Tocharian A\n|-\n!

An example is ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45k}}'' (Toch A) \"man\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45ka\u1e43}}'' (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43-}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45kn-}}'' (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of ''n''-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the [[Germanic languages]] (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek ''n''-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin ''Cat\u014d'' (genitive ''Cat\u014dnis'') literally \"the sly one\" {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} < ''catus'' \"sly\", Greek ''Pl\u00e1t\u014dn'' literally \"the broad-shouldered one\" < ''plat\u00fas'' \"broad\".<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n===Verbs===\nIn contrast, the verb [[grammatical conjugation|verbal conjugation]] system is quite conservative.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=20}} The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function.<ref>Douglas Q. Adams, \"On the Development of the Tocharian Verbal System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Jul. \u2013 Sep., 1978), pp. 277- 288.</ref> Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, ''-y-'', ''-s\u1e31-'', ''-s-'', ''-n-'' and ''-nH-'' suffixes as well as ''n''-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; ''o''-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\n\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary ''-r'' and secondary ''-i'', effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\n\n====Categories====\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n*Mood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\n*Tense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\n*Voice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\n*Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\n*Number: singular, dual, plural.\n*Causation: basic, causative.\n*Non-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\n\n====Classes====\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Latin]], there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of [[principal parts]].\n\n=====Present indicative=====\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\n*I: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\n*II: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\n*III: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u00eb-''. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE ''o'' theme rather than the normal alternating ''o/e'' theme.\n*IV: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0254-''. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\n*V: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in ''*-eh\u2082-'' (but extended to other verbs).\n*VI: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u0101-'', from PIE verbs in ''*-nH-''.\n*VII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\n*VIII: Thematic with suffix ''-s-'', possibly from PIE ''-s\u1e31-''?\n*IX: Thematic with suffix ''-sk-'' < PIE ''-s\u1e31-''.\n*X: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u00e4sk/n\u0101sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\n*XI: Thematic in PToch suffix ''*-s\u00e4sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\n*XII: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-(\u00e4)\u00f1\u00f1-'' < either PIE ''*-n-y-'' (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE ''*-nH-y-'' (deverbative from PIE ''*-nH-'' verbs).\n\nPalatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel ''e''.\n\n=====Subjunctive=====\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\n\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \"special subjunctive\" classes with differing suffixes and two \"varying subjunctive\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\n\nSpecial subjunctives:\n*iv: Thematic with suffix ''i'' < PIE ''-y-'', with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\n*vii: Thematic (''not'' athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix ''\u00f1'' < PIE ''-n-'' (palatalized by thematic ''e'', with palatalized variant generalized).\n\nVarying subjunctives:\n*i: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE ''o''-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\n*v: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\n\n=====Preterite=====\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\n*I: The most common class, with a suffix ''\u0101'' < PIE ''\u1e24'' (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original ''e''-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\n*II: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE ''\u0113'', along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\n*III: This class has a suffix ''s'' in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with ''s'' in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no ''s'' in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch ''\u00eb'').  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with ''s'' suffix and ''\u0113'' vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with ''o'' vocalism).\n*IV: This class has suffix ''\u1e63\u1e63\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\n*V: This class has suffix ''\u00f1(\u00f1)\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\n*VI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).\n\nAll except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\n\n=====Imperative=====\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with ''p-''.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian ''*p\u00e4-'' but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix ''po-'', although the phonology is difficult to explain.\n\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \"irregular\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\n\n=====Optative and imperfect=====\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding ''i'' onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding ''i'' onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually ''\u0101'' is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either ''\u0101'' or ''s'' is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\n\n====Endings====\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE ''e'' or ''o'') plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between ''-r'' in the present and ''-i'' in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\n\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B.  The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Thematic present active indicative endings\n! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2|Original PIE !! colspan=2|Tocharian B !! colspan=2|Tocharian A !! rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!

It is known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in [[oasis]] cities on the northern edge of the [[Tarim Basin]] (now part of [[Xinjiang]] in northwest China) and the [[Lop Desert]]. The discovery of this language family in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family on the [[Centum and satem languages|centum\u2013satem isogloss]], and prompted reinvigorated study of the family. Identifying the authors with the ''Tokharoi'' people of ancient [[Bactria]] (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages \"Tocharian\". Although this identification is now generally considered mistaken, the name has remained.\n\nThe documents record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also ''East Tocharian'', ''Agnean,'' or ''Turfanian'') and Tocharian B (''West Tocharian'' or ''Kuchean''). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from [[Turfan]] in the east to [[Tumshuq]] in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the [[Lop Nur|Lop Nor]] basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (''Kror\u00e4nian''). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in [[Kharosthi|Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b]] script has been discredited.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\" >{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Douglas Q. |title='Tocharian C' Again: The Plot Thickens and the Mystery Deepens |url=https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44503 |website=Language Log |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the 5th or even late 4th century AD, making Tocharian a language of [[Late Antiquity]] contemporary with [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Classical Armenian]] and [[Primitive Irish]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Ronald I. |editor1-last=Rieken |editor1-first=Elisabeth |title=100 Jahre Entzifferung des Hethitischen.

The areas of the squares are proportional to population.]]\n\nThe existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim basin by [[Aurel Stein]] in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.<ref>Deuel, Leo. 1970.

In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between [[centum\u2013satem isogloss|centum and satem languages]] was a simple west\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of [[Hittite language|Hittite]], a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the [[wave model]] of [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]], suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nMost scholars reject [[Walter Bruno Henning]]'s proposed link to [[Gutian language|Gutian]], a language spoken on the [[Iranian plateau]] in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.{{sfnp|Mallory|Mair|2000|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nTocharian probably died out after 840 when the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], expelled from Mongolia by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], moved into the Tarim Basin.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\n\nSome modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, eg.

Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a [[liturgical language]], no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern [[Romance languages]], or [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and ''o'' vs. ''e'' distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\n\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE ''\u0113'' in Tocharian B (possibly from the long-vowel perfect found in Latin ''l\u0113g\u012b'', ''f\u0113c\u012b'', etc.).<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\nTocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected.<ref>M. Peyrot, ''Variation and Change in Tocharian B'', Amsterdam and New York, 2008</ref> The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha.

While a full report of what languages these texts represent is not yet available, their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\"/>\n\n==Phonology==\n\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \"[[Centum and satem languages|centum]]\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the [[palatovelar]] consonants {{PIE|(*\u1e31, *\u01f5, *\u01f5\u02b0)}} of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]] with the plain [[velars]] (*k, *g, *g\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe ([[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]]). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]]) seems to have been an isolate in the \"[[Centum-Satem isogloss|satem]]\" (i.e. [[palatovelar]] to [[sibilant]]) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|p=107}}<ref name=\"baldi\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY7-DBWPW4C&pg=PA39 [[Philip Baldi|Baldi, Philip]] ''The Foundations of Latin'' (1999), pg 39]</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

It is clearly phonemic because sequences ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' also exist (from [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] of a former ''\u00e4'' between them).\n\n==Proto-Tocharian==\n\n===Vowels===\nProto-Tocharian shows radical changes in its vowels from [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). Length distinctions eventually disappeared, but prior to that all pairs of long and short vowels had become distinct in quality, and thus have different outcomes. Many pairs of PIE vowels are distinguished in Tocharian only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of palatalization.  For example, PIE ''o'' and ''\u0113'' both evolved into Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (possibly {{IPAslink|\u025b}}), but PIE ''\u0113'' palatalized the preceding consonant, and left a ''y'' when no consonant preceded, while neither of these occurs with PIE ''o''.\n\nReconstructing the changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian vowels is fraught with difficulty, and as a result there are a large number of disagreements among different researchers.  The basic problems are:\n*Tocharian A and B are relatively sparsely attested.\n*The extensive mergers of PIE stop consonants lead to many ambiguities in the potential etymologies underlying particular Tocharian words.\n*The radical restructuring of the vowel system means that few potential sound changes can be rejected as unreasonable, no matter how unlikely they may look on the surface.\n*A large amount of analogical change has occurred in both the nominal and verbal systems, making it difficult to identify which changes are regular.\n\nHistorically, the evolution of the Tocharian vowels was the last part of the diachronic phonology to be understood.

For example, Tocharian A ''a'' reflects a merger of two Proto-Tocharian vowels that are distinguished in Tocharian B as ''e'' and ''o'', while Tocharian B ''a'' reflects a stress-based variant of either Proto-Tocharian ''\u0101'' or ''\u00e4'', while Tocharian A preserves original ''\u0101'' and ''\u00e4'' regardless of the position of stress.\n\nAs a general rule, Tocharian B reflects the Proto-Tocharian vowel system more faithfully than Tocharian A, which includes a number of changes not found in Tocharian B, e.g. monophthongization of diphthongs, loss of all absolutely final vowels, loss of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and epenthesis of ''\u00e4'' to break up difficult clusters (esp. word-finally) that resulted from vowel losses.\n\nThe following table describes a typical minimal reconstruction of Late Proto-Tocharian, which includes all vowels that are generally accepted by Tocharian scholars:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

However, Ringe reconstructs three vowels ''*\u00eb, *e, *\u1eb9'' in place of the single vowel ''*e'' in the minimal system.  The primary distinction is between ''*\u00eb'' < PIE ''*o'', which is assumed to be a central rather than a front vowel because it does not trigger palatalization, and ''*e'' < PIE ''*\u0113'', which does trigger palatalization.  Other than palatalization effects, both vowels are reflected identically in both Tocharian A and B, and hence a number of researchers project the merger back to Proto-Tocharian.  However, some umlaut processes are thought to have operated differently on the two vowels, and as a result Ringe (as well as Adams<ref>Douglas Adams, \"Ablaut and Umlaut in the Tocharian Vowel System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 4 (Oct. \u2013 Dec., 1978), pp. 446- 450.</ref> and some other scholars) prefer to distinguish the two in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe's ''*\u1eb9'' vowel, a higher vowel than ''*e'', is fairly rare and appears as ''i'' in Tocharian B but ''e'' in Tocharian A.  This vowel does trigger palatalization, and is thought by Ringe to stem primarily from PIE ''*oy'' and from loanwords.  In general, Ringe's Proto-Tocharian reconstruction reflects an earlier stage than the one described by many researchers.\n\nSome scholars use a different notation from what is given above: e.g. ''\u00e6'' or ''\u00eb'' in place of the ''e'' of the minimal system, ''\u00e5'' or ''\u0254'' in place of the ''o'' of the minimal system, and ''\u01dd'' in place of ''\u00e4''.\n\nThe following table shows the changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Tocharian (PToch) and on to Tocharian B (TB) and Tocharian A (TA), using the notation of the \"minimal\" system above:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

When following a consonant, that consonant is palatalized; otherwise, a ''y'' appears.  Before PIE ''i'', consonants other than dentals are not necessarily palatalized (researchers differ on what exactly happened); this is indicated as (+).\n#A \u2014 sign indicates no vowel; this results from deletion of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables.\n#Tocharian B reflects Proto-Tocharian central vowels (''\u00e4'', ''\u0101'') differently depending on whether they bore stress or not.  This is indicated in the table above: stressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''a \u0101'' while unstressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''\u00e4 a'' (i.e. Tocharian B ''a'' reflects either stressed ''\u00e4'' or unstressed ''\u0101'').  An additional complication is that unstressed ''\u00e4'' is deleted in open syllables.  See below.\n\nProto-Tocharian had phonemic stress, although its position varies depending on the researcher. Many researchers project the Tocharian B stress that is recoverable from ''\u0101''~''a'' and ''a''~''\u00e4'' alternations back to Proto-Tocharian. For the most part, this stress does not reflect PIE stress.  Rather, most bisyllabic words have initial stress, and trisyllabic and longer words usually have stress on the second syllable.  A number of multisyllabic words in Tocharian B appear to indicate that more than one syllable was stressed; it is thought that these reflect clitics or affixes that still behaved phonologically as separate words in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> however, prefers to project the PIE stress unchanged into Proto-Tocharian, and assumes that the radically different system seen in Tocharian B evolved within the separate history of that language.\n\nThe outcome of the PIE sequences ''*iH'' and ''*uH'' when not followed by a vowel is disputed.  It is generally agreed that ''*ih\u2082'' became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101''; a similar change occurred in [[Ancient Greek]].  It is also usually accepted that ''*ih\u2083'' likewise became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101'', although it is unclear whether this reflects a direct change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u0101 /ya/'' or a change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u014d /yo:/ > *y\u0101 /ya/'' (echoing a similar change in Ancient Greek), since PIE ''*\u014d'' is generally thought to have become Proto-Tocharian ''*\u0101'' (which was not a long vowel).  The outcomes of all other sequences are much less clear.  A number of etymologies appear to indicate a parallel change ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'', but some also appear to indicate a change ''*uh\u2082 > *\u016b > *u''. Ringe<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> demonstrates that all the occurrences of ''*w\u0101'' can potentially be explained as due to analogy, and prefers to postulate a general sound change ''*uH > *\u016b > *u'' following the normal outcome of ''*uH'' in other languages, but a number of other researchers (e.g. Krause and Slocum<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>) prefer to see ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'' as the regular sound change.  The outcome of ''*ih\u2081'' is likewise disputed, with Ringe similarly preferring a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *\u012b > i'' while others postulate a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *ye > *y\u00e4''. As elsewhere, the main difficulty is that, relative to other Indo-European languages, Tocharian is sparsely attested and was subject to a particularly large number of analogical changes.\n\nA number of umlaut processes occurred in the Proto-Tocharian period, which tended to increase the number of rounded vowels.  Vowel rounding also resulted from the influence of nearby labiovelars, although this occurred after the Proto-Tocharian period, with differing results in Tocharian A and B, generally with more rounding in Tocharian A (e.g. PIE ''*g\u02b7\u1e43-'' \"come\" > PToch ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' > Tocharian A ''kum-'' but Tocharian B ''k\u00e4m-'').\n\n===Vowel deletion and insertion===\nTocharian A deletes all Proto-Tocharian final vowels, as well as all instances of Proto-Tocharian ''\u00e4'' in [[open syllable]]s (which appears to include vowels followed by ''Cr'' and ''Cl'' sequences).  When this produces impossible consonant sequences, these are rectified by vocalizing ''w'' and ''y'' into ''u'' and ''i'', if possible; otherwise, an epenthetic ''\u00e4'' is inserted.  Note that most consonant sequences are tolerated word-initially, including unexpected cases like ''rt-'', ''ys-'' and ''lks-''.  Example: PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' (Greek ''erythros'') > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch A *''rtr'' > ''rt\u00e4r''.\n\nTocharian B deletes only unstressed ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and leaves all other vowels alone.  Hence PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch B ''ratre''.  If necessary, impossible consonant sequences are rectified as in Tocharian A.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following are the main changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian:\n*[[Centum]] change: PIE \"palatals\" merge with PIE \"plain velars\".\n*Loss of PIE ''d'' (but not other dentals) in a number of words when not followed by a PIE front vocalic.\n*Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration, resulting in (e.g.) the merger of PIE ''k, g, gh''.\n*Palatalization of all consonants before PIE ''e, \u0113, y'' and sometimes ''i'', producing a number of new phonemes (''c'', ''\u015b'', ''\u1e63'', ''ts'', ''\u00f1'', ''ly'').\n*Loss of final consonants other than ''r'', including total loss of certain final clusters (e.g. ''nts'').\n\nThe extant Tocharian languages appear to reflect essentially the same consonant system as in Proto-Tocharian, except in a couple of cases:\n*A new phoneme ''\u1e45'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}} eventually developed.  This was originally an allophone of ''n'' before ''k'', but became phonemic when vowel losses resulted in instances of ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' contrasting with ''\u1e45k'', and occasional loss of ''k'' between consonants resulted in instances of ''\u1e45'' not before ''k''.\n*The Proto-Tocharian labiovelar ''*k\u02b7'' eventually merged with ''k'' in both Tocharian A and B.  However, this clearly post-dated Proto-Tocharian, because the former ''*k\u02b7'' often rounded adjacent vowels prior to its loss, in a way that differed between A and B (e.g. Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' \"come\" > A ''kum-'' but B ''k\u00e4m-''). In addition, according to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-adams\">Donald A. Ringe Jr, \"Review of 'Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology' by Douglas Q. Adams\", ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990), pp. 400\u2013408.</ref> Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7'' is sometimes retained in Tocharian B when directly preceding a voiceless consonant, particularly in western dialect texts.\n\nUnlike in most ''[[centum]]'' languages, Proto-Tocharian maintained separate outcomes of PIE ''*k\u02b7'' and ''*\u1e31w''.<ref name=\"ringe-adams\"/> The latter is still reflected as ''kw'' in Tocharian B, e.g. ''yakwe'' \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos''.\n\n===Palatalization===\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] was a very important process operating in Proto-Tocharian.  Palatalization appears to have operated very early, prior to almost all of the vowel changes that took place between PIE and Proto-Tocharian. Palatalization occurred before PIE ''e'', ''\u0113'', ''y'' and sometimes ''i''; specifically, PIE ''i'' triggered palatalization of dentals but generally not of velars or labials. (According to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> lack of palatalization before PIE ''i'' was actually due to early change of ''i'' > ''w\u01dd'' after certain sounds.) Palatalization, or lack thereof, is the only way to distinguish PIE ''e'' and ''i'' in Tocharian, and the primary way of distinguishing certain other pairs of PIE vowels, e.g. ''e'' vs. ''u'' and ''\u0113'' vs. ''o''. Palatalization appeared to have operated in two stages, an earlier one that affected only the sequences ''ty'' and ''dhy'', and a later more general one \u2014 or at least, the result of palatalization of ''t'' and ''dh'' before ''y'' is different from palatalization before ''e, \u0113'' and ''i'', while other consonants do not show such a dual outcome.

Palatalization sometimes produces ''c'', sometimes ''ts'', sometimes ''\u015b'', and in some words when a front vocalic does not follow, PIE ''*d'' (but not other dentals) is lost entirely, e.g. e.g. Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' and Toch B ''ime'' \"thought\" < PToch ''*w'\u00e4im\u00eb'' < PIE ''*weid-mo-''.  Many occurrences of ''c'' and ''ts'' can be explained by the differing effects of a following ''y'' vs. a front vowel (see above), but a number of difficult cases remain.\n\nMost researchers agree that some of the PIE dentals are reflected differently from others \u2014 contrary to the situation with all other PIE stops.  This in turn suggests that some sound changes must have operated on particular dentals, but not others, prior to the general loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration.  There is a large amount of disagreement over what exactly the relevant sound changes were, due to the relatively small number of extant forms involved, the operation of analogy, and disagreement over particular etymologies, including both the PIE roots and ablaut forms involved.  Ringe suggests the following changes, in approximate order:<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/>\n#[[Grassmann's Law]], which triggers the change ''dh > d'' when another aspirated consonant occurs later in a word (and which also operated in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]).\n#The change ''d'' > ''dz'', which occurred after Grassmann's Law if it existed.\n#Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration (which may have occurred after palatalization).\n#Palatalization.  The new sound ''ts'' palatalizes to ''\u015b''; this explains cases like Toch B ''\u015bak'', Toch A ''\u015b\u00e4k'' \"ten\" < PIE ''*dek\u1e43(t)''.\n#Loss of ''ts'' before consonants.\n\nEven with this explanation, a lot of words don't have the expected outcomes and require appeal to analogy.  For example, the assumption of Grassmann's Law helps to explain only two words, both verbs, in which PIE ''*dh'' shows up as ''ts''; and in both of these words, palatalization to ''\u015b'' might have been expected, because the present-tense forms both begin with PIE ''*dhe-''. Ringe needs to appeal to an analogical depalatalization, based on other forms of the verb with different ablaut patterns in which palatalization was not triggered. This assumption is reasonable, because a lot of other verbs also show analogical depalatalization; but nonetheless, it is rather slender evidence, and it is not surprising that other researchers have proposed different assumptions (e.g. that PToch ''*ts\u00e4-'' is the expected outcome of PIE ''*dhe-'', with no operation of Grassmann's Law).\n\nLikewise, the loss of PIE ''*d'' in Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' is not explainable by these rules, because it is lost before a vowel rather than a consonant.  Ringe again assumes analogy: In this case, the PIE conjugation was nominative ''*doru'', genitive ''*dreus'', and Ringe assumes that the normal loss of ''*d'' in the genitive before ''*r'' was carried over into the nominative. Again, not all researchers accept this. For example, Krause and Slocum, while accepting the remainder of Ringe's sound changes involving PIE ''*d'', suggest instead that loss eventually occurred before Proto-Tocharian rounded vowels and before Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (from PIE ''o''), as well as before nasals and possibly other consonants.<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\nTocharian has completely re-worked the [[declension|nominal declension]] system of Proto-Indo-European.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=92}} The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, [[accusative case|accusative]], and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the ''oblique'' case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word ''{{IAST|yakwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|yuk}}'' (Toch A) \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos'' is declined as follows:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Grammatical case|Case]]\n! colspan=3|Tocharian B\n! colspan=3|Tocharian A\n|-\n!

An example is ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45k}}'' (Toch A) \"man\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45ka\u1e43}}'' (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43-}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45kn-}}'' (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of ''n''-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the [[Germanic languages]] (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek ''n''-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin ''Cat\u014d'' (genitive ''Cat\u014dnis'') literally \"the sly one\" {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} < ''catus'' \"sly\", Greek ''Pl\u00e1t\u014dn'' literally \"the broad-shouldered one\" < ''plat\u00fas'' \"broad\".<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n===Verbs===\nIn contrast, the verb [[grammatical conjugation|verbal conjugation]] system is quite conservative.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=20}} The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function.<ref>Douglas Q. Adams, \"On the Development of the Tocharian Verbal System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Jul. \u2013 Sep., 1978), pp. 277- 288.</ref> Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, ''-y-'', ''-s\u1e31-'', ''-s-'', ''-n-'' and ''-nH-'' suffixes as well as ''n''-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; ''o''-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\n\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary ''-r'' and secondary ''-i'', effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\n\n====Categories====\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n*Mood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\n*Tense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\n*Voice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\n*Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\n*Number: singular, dual, plural.\n*Causation: basic, causative.\n*Non-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\n\n====Classes====\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Latin]], there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of [[principal parts]].\n\n=====Present indicative=====\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\n*I: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\n*II: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\n*III: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u00eb-''. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE ''o'' theme rather than the normal alternating ''o/e'' theme.\n*IV: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0254-''. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\n*V: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in ''*-eh\u2082-'' (but extended to other verbs).\n*VI: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u0101-'', from PIE verbs in ''*-nH-''.\n*VII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\n*VIII: Thematic with suffix ''-s-'', possibly from PIE ''-s\u1e31-''?\n*IX: Thematic with suffix ''-sk-'' < PIE ''-s\u1e31-''.\n*X: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u00e4sk/n\u0101sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\n*XI: Thematic in PToch suffix ''*-s\u00e4sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\n*XII: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-(\u00e4)\u00f1\u00f1-'' < either PIE ''*-n-y-'' (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE ''*-nH-y-'' (deverbative from PIE ''*-nH-'' verbs).\n\nPalatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel ''e''.\n\n=====Subjunctive=====\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\n\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \"special subjunctive\" classes with differing suffixes and two \"varying subjunctive\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\n\nSpecial subjunctives:\n*iv: Thematic with suffix ''i'' < PIE ''-y-'', with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\n*vii: Thematic (''not'' athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix ''\u00f1'' < PIE ''-n-'' (palatalized by thematic ''e'', with palatalized variant generalized).\n\nVarying subjunctives:\n*i: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE ''o''-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\n*v: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\n\n=====Preterite=====\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\n*I: The most common class, with a suffix ''\u0101'' < PIE ''\u1e24'' (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original ''e''-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\n*II: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE ''\u0113'', along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\n*III: This class has a suffix ''s'' in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with ''s'' in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no ''s'' in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch ''\u00eb'').  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with ''s'' suffix and ''\u0113'' vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with ''o'' vocalism).\n*IV: This class has suffix ''\u1e63\u1e63\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\n*V: This class has suffix ''\u00f1(\u00f1)\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\n*VI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).\n\nAll except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\n\n=====Imperative=====\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with ''p-''.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian ''*p\u00e4-'' but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix ''po-'', although the phonology is difficult to explain.\n\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \"irregular\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\n\n=====Optative and imperfect=====\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding ''i'' onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding ''i'' onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually ''\u0101'' is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either ''\u0101'' or ''s'' is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\n\n====Endings====\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE ''e'' or ''o'') plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between ''-r'' in the present and ''-i'' in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\n\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B.  The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Thematic present active indicative endings\n! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2|Original PIE !! colspan=2|Tocharian B !! colspan=2|Tocharian A !! rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!
