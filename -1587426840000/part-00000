As the ice jam breaks apart, a sudden surge of water breaking through can then flood areas downstream of the jam.

Such a surge occurred on the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]] in 1848, when flow over [[Niagara Falls]] was substantially cut off by an ice jam, which then sent a surge of water downstream when the jam broke open.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/0330niagara-falls-stops/|title=March 30, 1848: Niagara Falls Runs Dry|last=Alfred|first=Randy|date=2010-03-30|work=Wired|access-date=2019-11-25|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The third hazard is that the ice buildup and final drive may damage structures in or near the river<ref name=\"Brit\">{{Britannica|281150|ice jam}}</ref> and boats in the river.\n\nIce jams may scour the river bed, causing damage or benefit to wildlife habitats and possibly damage to structures in the river.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Prediction and mitigation==\n[[File:CRREL Ice Engineering Facility model of Cazenovia Creek ice jam control structure.jpg|thumb|Model of a structure built to retain river ice upstream of a site on [[Cazenovia Creek]] that was the cause of ice jams during river thaws.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|url=http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/portals/55/siteimages/121108-A-HB029-011.jpg|title=Cazenovia Creek Ice-Control Structure|last=Lever|first=James H.|last2=Gooch|first2=Gordon|date=August 2000|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|last3=Daly|first3=Steven| journal =CRREL/ERDC Technical Report TR | volume =00 | issue =14}}</ref>]]\nEarly warnings of an ice jam include using trained observers to monitor break-up conditions and ice motion detectors.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe prevention of ice jams may be accomplished by\n# weakening the ice before the break-up by cutting or drilling holes in the ice;\n# weakening the ice by dusting it with a dark colored sand; or\n# controlling the timing of the break-up using [[ice breaker]]s, towboats, hovercraft, or amphibious excavators.

The earlier 1981 population census had also recorded a Serbo-Croatian-speaking majority. However, in the first Communist censuses, the vast majority of the population declared [[Serbian language|Serbian]] to be their native language. Such had also been the case with the first recorded population census in Montenegro, in 1909, when approximately 95% of the population of the [[Principality of Montenegro]] claimed Serbian as their native language. According to the [[Constitution of Montenegro]], the official language of the republic since 1992 has been Serbian of the [[Shtokavian|Shtokavian (Ijekavian) standard]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]] and until 1992, the official language of Montenegro was Serbo-Croatian. Before that, in the previous Montenegrin realm, the language in use was called Serbian. Serbian was the officially used language in Communist Montenegro until after the 1950 [[Novi Sad Agreement]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and Serbo-Croatian was introduced into the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro in 1974. Organizations promoting Montenegrin as a distinct language have appeared only since 2004 when the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] regime introduced usage of the term. The new constitution, adopted on 19 October 2007, deemed Montenegrin to be the official language of Montenegro.\n\nThe most recent [[Demographic history of Montenegro|population census]] conducted in Montenegro was in 2011. According to it, 36.97% of the population (229,251) declared that their native language was Montenegrin, and 42.88% (265,895) declared it to be Serbian.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/popis2011/saopstenje/saopstenje(1).pdf | title=Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Montenegro 2011 | work=Monstat | accessdate=July 12, 2011 | pages=10, 12}}</ref>\n\n[[Mijat \u0160ukovi\u0107]], a prominent Montenegrin lawyer, wrote a draft version of [[Constitution of Montenegro|the constitution]] which passed the parliament's constitutional committee. \u0160ukovi\u0107 suggested that Montenegrin be declared the official language of [[Montenegro]]. The [[Venice Commission]], an advisory body of the [[Council of Europe]], had a generally positive attitude towards the draft of the constitution but did not address the language and church issues, calling them symbolic. The new constitution ratified on 19 October 2007 declared Montenegrin to be the official language of Montenegro, but also gave some recognition to [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and Serbian.\n\nThe ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] stand for simply stating the country's official language to be Montenegrin, but this policy is opposed by the [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]], the [[People's Party (Montenegro)|People's Party]], the [[Democratic Serb Party]], the [[Bosniak Party of Montenegro|Bosniak Party]], and the [[Movement for Changes]] as well as by the [[Serb List (2006)|Serb List]] coalition led by the [[Serb People's Party (Montenegro)|Serb People's Party]]. A referendum was not needed, however, as a two-thirds majority of the parliament voted for the Constitution, including the [[Coalition for a European Montenegro|ruling coalition]], [[Movement for Changes]], the [[Bosniak Party|Bosniaks]], and the [[Liberal Party of Montenegro|Liberals]], while the pro-Serbian parties voted against it and the Albanian minority parties abstained from voting.

The medieval literature was mostly written in [[Old Church Slavonic]] and its [[recension]]s, but most of the 19th century works were written in some of the dialects of Montenegro. They include the folk literature collected by [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] and other authors, as well as the books of writers from Montenegro such as [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]]'s ''[[The Mountain Wreath]]'' (''Gorski vijenac''), [[Marko Miljanov]]'s ''The Examples of Humanity and Bravery'' (''Primjeri \u010dojstva i juna\u0161tva''), etc. In the second half of the 19th century and later, the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]], which served as a basis for the standard [[Serbo-Croatian]] language, was often used instead of the [[Shtokavian dialect#Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka|Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka dialect]] characteristic of most dialects of Montenegro. Petar Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161, one of the most respectable Montenegrin authors, changed many characteristics of the Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka dialect from the manuscript of his ''Gorski vijenac'' to those proposed by Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 as a standard for the [[Serbian language]].\n\nFor example, most of the [[accusative]]s of place used in the Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka dialect were changed by Njego\u0161 to the [[locative]]s used in the Serbian standard. Thus the stanzas ''\"U dobro je lako dobar biti, / na muku se poznaju junaci\"'' from the manuscript were changed to ''\"U dobru je lako dobar biti, / na muci se poznaju junaci\"'' in the printed version. Other works of later Montenegrin authors were also often modified to the East Herzegovinian forms in order to follow the Serbian language literary norm. However, some characteristics of the traditional Montenegrin Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka dialect sometimes appeared. For example, the poem ''[[Onamo namo]]'' by [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]], although it was written in the East Herzegovinian Serbian standard, contains several Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka forms: ''\"Onamo namo, za brda ona\"'' ([[accusative]], instead of [[instrumental case]] ''za brdima onim''), and ''\"Onamo namo, da vi\u0111u'' (instead of ''vidim'') ''Prizren\"'', and so on.\n\n== Language politics ==\n[[File:Original montenegrin language alphabet.gif|thumb|A proposed Montenegrin alphabet which contains three more letters than the Serbian counterpart \u2014 \u015a, \u0417 and \u0179]]\nMost mainstream politicians and other proponents of the Montenegrin language state that the issue is chiefly one of self-determination and the people's right to call the language what they want, rather than an attempt to artificially create a new language when there is none.

However, in the first Communist censuses, the vast majority of the population declared [[Serbian language|Serbian]] to be their native language. Such had also been the case with the first recorded population census in Montenegro, in 1909, when approximately 95% of the population of the [[Principality of Montenegro]] claimed Serbian as their native language.

Before that, in the previous Montenegrin realm, the language in use was called Serbian. Serbian was the officially used language in Communist Montenegro until after the 1950 [[Novi Sad Agreement]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and Serbo-Croatian was introduced into the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro in 1974. Organizations promoting Montenegrin as a distinct language have appeared only since 2004 when the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] regime introduced usage of the term. The new constitution, adopted on 19 October 2007, deemed Montenegrin to be the official language of Montenegro.\n\nThe most recent [[Demographic history of Montenegro|population census]] conducted in Montenegro was in 2011. According to it, 36.97% of the population (229,251) declared that their native language was Montenegrin, and 42.88% (265,895) declared it to be Serbian.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/popis2011/saopstenje/saopstenje(1).pdf | title=Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Montenegro 2011 | work=Monstat | accessdate=July 12, 2011 | pages=10, 12}}</ref>\n\n[[Mijat \u0160ukovi\u0107]], a prominent Montenegrin lawyer, wrote a draft version of [[Constitution of Montenegro|the constitution]] which passed the parliament's constitutional committee. \u0160ukovi\u0107 suggested that Montenegrin be declared the official language of [[Montenegro]]. The [[Venice Commission]], an advisory body of the [[Council of Europe]], had a generally positive attitude towards the draft of the constitution but did not address the language and church issues, calling them symbolic. The new constitution ratified on 19 October 2007 declared Montenegrin to be the official language of Montenegro, but also gave some recognition to [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and Serbian.\n\nThe ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] stand for simply stating the country's official language to be Montenegrin, but this policy is opposed by the [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]], the [[People's Party (Montenegro)|People's Party]], the [[Democratic Serb Party]], the [[Bosniak Party of Montenegro|Bosniak Party]], and the [[Movement for Changes]] as well as by the [[Serb List (2006)|Serb List]] coalition led by the [[Serb People's Party (Montenegro)|Serb People's Party]]. A referendum was not needed, however, as a two-thirds majority of the parliament voted for the Constitution, including the [[Coalition for a European Montenegro|ruling coalition]], [[Movement for Changes]], the [[Bosniak Party|Bosniaks]], and the [[Liberal Party of Montenegro|Liberals]], while the pro-Serbian parties voted against it and the Albanian minority parties abstained from voting. The Constitution was ratified and adopted on 19 October 2007, recognizing Montenegrin as the official language of Montenegro.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,001 Montenegrin citizens conducted by [[Matica crnogorska]] in 2014, the linguistic demographics were:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pobjeda.me/2014/07/03/matica-crnogorska-crnogorskim-jezikom-govori-411-odsto-gradana-srpskim-391/#.VEJZhvmUca4 |title=Pobjeda |publisher=Pobjeda.me |accessdate=2015-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022053115/http://www.pobjeda.me/2014/07/03/matica-crnogorska-crnogorskim-jezikom-govori-411-odsto-gradana-srpskim-391/ |archivedate=2014-10-22 }}</ref>\n{{flowlist|\n* 41.1% Montenegrin\n* 39.1% Serbian\n* 12.3% Serbian, Montenegrin, Bosnian, Croatian and Serbo-Croatian (as one and the same language)\n* 3.9% Serbo-Croatian\n* 1.9% Bosnian\n* 1.7% Croatian}}\n\nAccording to an early 2017 poll, 42.6% of Montenegro's citizens have opted for Serbian as the name of their native language, while 37.9% for Montenegrin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/u-crnoj-gori-za-sfrj-zali-63-odsto-gradana-928817|title=U Crnoj Gori za SFRJ \u017eali 63 odsto gra\u0111ana|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nA declaration of Montenegrin as their native language is not confined to ethnic Montenegrins.

The medieval literature was mostly written in [[Old Church Slavonic]] and its [[recension]]s, but most of the 19th century works were written in some of the dialects of Montenegro. They include the folk literature collected by [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] and other authors, as well as the books of writers from Montenegro such as [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]]'s ''[[The Mountain Wreath]]'' (''Gorski vijenac''), [[Marko Miljanov]]'s ''The Examples of Humanity and Bravery'' (''Primjeri \u010dojstva i juna\u0161tva''), etc. In the second half of the 19th century and later, the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]], which served as a basis for the standard [[Serbo-Croatian]] language, was often used instead of the [[Shtokavian dialect#Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka|Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka dialect]] characteristic of most dialects of Montenegro. Petar Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161, one of the most respectable Montenegrin authors, changed many characteristics of the Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka dialect from the manuscript of his ''Gorski vijenac'' to those proposed by Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 as a standard for the [[Serbian language]].\n\nFor example, most of the [[accusative]]s of place used in the Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka dialect were changed by Njego\u0161 to the [[locative]]s used in the Serbian standard. Thus the stanzas ''\"U dobro je lako dobar biti, / na muku se poznaju junaci\"'' from the manuscript were changed to ''\"U dobru je lako dobar biti, / na muci se poznaju junaci\"'' in the printed version. Other works of later Montenegrin authors were also often modified to the East Herzegovinian forms in order to follow the Serbian language literary norm. However, some characteristics of the traditional Montenegrin Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka dialect sometimes appeared. For example, the poem ''[[Onamo namo]]'' by [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]], although it was written in the East Herzegovinian Serbian standard, contains several Zeta\u2013South Ra\u0161ka forms: ''\"Onamo namo, za brda ona\"'' ([[accusative]], instead of [[instrumental case]] ''za brdima onim''), and ''\"Onamo namo, da vi\u0111u'' (instead of ''vidim'') ''Prizren\"'', and so on.\n\n== Language politics ==\n[[File:Original montenegrin language alphabet.gif|thumb|A proposed Montenegrin alphabet which contains three more letters than the Serbian counterpart \u2014 \u015a, \u0417 and \u0179]]\nMost mainstream politicians and other proponents of the Montenegrin language state that the issue is chiefly one of self-determination and the people's right to call the language what they want, rather than an attempt to artificially create a new language when there is none.

Therefore, in 2017, numerous prominent writers, scientists, journalists, activists and other public figures from Montenegro, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia signed the [[Declaration on the Common Language]], which states that in Montenegro, Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina a common [[Polycentric language|polycentric standard language]] is used, consisting of several standard varieties, such as [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Trudgill|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Trudgill|date=30 November 2017|page=46|title=Time to Make Four Into One|url=https://archive.org/details/PeterTrudgillTimeToMakeFourIntoOne2017|publisher=[[The New European]]|accessdate=2 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Dan|last=Nosovitz|date=11 February 2019|title=What Language Do People Speak in the Balkans, Anyway?|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-language-is-spoken-in-the-balkans|magazine=[[Atlas Obscura]]|archivedate=11 February 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211191959/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-language-is-spoken-in-the-balkans|accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Sven|last=Mileki\u0107|date=30 March 2017|title=Post-Yugoslav 'Common Language' Declaration Challenges Nationalism|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/post-yugoslav-common-language-declaration-challenges-nationalism-03-29-2017|publisher=[[Balkan Insight]]|archivedate=30 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330075725/http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/post-yugoslav-common-language-declaration-challenges-nationalism-03-29-2017|url-status=live|location=London|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=J.|first=T.|date=10 April 2017|title=Is Serbo-Croatian a Language?|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/04/economist-explains-4|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|archivedate=10 April 2017|archiveurl=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2017&mm=04&dd=10&nav_category=12&nav_id=1248942|url-status=live|location=London|issn=0013-0613|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of the Montenegrin language has been supported by other important academic institutions such as the [[Matica crnogorska]], although meeting opposition from the [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

When the demand was not met, Italy declared war and quickly conquered the main cities along the coast of Libya. Some of the Jews of Libya supported Italy, and some actively contributed to the war effort. One of the reasons behind the support of Italy and a regime change began with the Italian influence on Libya through commercial and cultural ties.

During his term in office, the process of modernizing Jewish communities accelerated, and Jews took part in government establishments. Balbo respected the Jewish tradition so long as it did not prevent the progress he brought to Libya. One instance of conflict occurred when Jews closed their shops on the Sabbath, even outside the Jewish community. Balbo sentenced the Jews to be punished by flogging, but later, in October 1937, he admitted at a gathering of the Fascist Party that he had been mistaken and that he did not distinguish between Catholics and Jews - they were all Italian. Earlier that year, [[Benito Mussolini]] came to the Jewish community during a visit to Italian Libya and received a warm reception. He promised that the Jews of Libya would be safe and that Italy would respect the Jewish community and their traditions, religion and leadership.\n\n==During the Holocaust==\n{{The Holocaust sidebar}}\n\n===Worsening status of the Jews===\nItaly's aggressive policies led to its isolation within Europe, and to a pact with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1936. The Rome-Berlin axis forced the countries to operate based on common principles, so the German race laws applied to Italy and its colonies.<ref name=yad-vashem/> In the racial manifesto, which was published in Italy in 1938, racist and anti-semitic laws appeared as representing the Italian Fascist Party's position. The main laws were:\n*Jews with foreign citizenship were banned from leaving the country{{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason= apparently contradicted below in ''Expulsion of Jews with foreign citizenship'' which says foreign Jews were to be expelled under the racial laws}}\n*Jewish students were banned from high schools and higher education establishments\n*Any Jew with a government position was to be fired\n*All Jewish soldiers in the Italian army were to be demoted.\n*Jews were forbidden from participating in government bids.\n\nItalian Libya's governor, Balbo, tried to convince Mussolini to postpone the application of the laws in Libya, claiming that they would destroy the Libyan economy. Mussolini allowed Balbo to apply the laws as he saw fit. Despite the relative protection that the Jews enjoyed under Balbo, Jewish government workers were fired, Jewish children were expelled from schools, and Jews wishing to move between cities required a license. Balbo was killed in July 1940, when an Italian ship shot down his airplane. Italian officials explained the incident as an accident.<ref name=histclo/>\n\nIn the second half of 1940, after Italy joined World War II on the side of Germany, the Jews' situation worsened. Tripoli was in chaos, and the Jewish quarter in Italy {{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason= in Italy? In Tripoli?}} was heavily damaged by Allied bombings, leaving many Jews dead. Some Jews, like the Muslim population, escaped inland. The Jewish community in Tripoli rented homes for the needy, constructed underground bomb shelters and supplied education for the children who were expelled.\n\nAs time went by, the race laws became worse - the Jews of Cyrenaica were sent to a concentration camp in Tripolitania, and most of the community's workforce was sent to labor camps. Jews who were citizens of enemy countries were expelled from the country, and the rest suffered from racist and oppressive laws that hurt them socially and economically. In mid-1942, the governor decreed that Jews were forbidden to enter into real estate deals or commerce outside the community, to publish any material that did not relate to religion, and subject to other oppressive laws.<ref name=c3.ort.org.il/>\n\n===The Jews of Cyrenaica under regime changes===\n\nThe accelerated application of the Race Laws caused the Jews to lose trust in the Italian government and led them to support the British instead. When Britain first conquered Cyrenaica in December 1940, the Jews were freed from the race laws. They did not hide their support of the conquering army, especially due to the meetings between the community and the Jewish soldiers who joined the war as part of the unit of Jewish soldiers.{{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason=Israel did not exist until 1948. Please clarify}} The soldiers met with the Benghazi community many times, renewed Zionist activities, and supported educational activity. On April 3, 1941, the Italian-German forces managed to push the British forces out of Benghazi, and 250 Jews left with them. The Italian citizens who lived in the city during the British control held a grudge towards the Jews, and conducted pogroms during which two Jews were killed, and a great deal of property was pillaged and damaged. When order was restored and [[anti-Semitism]] began to increase,<ref name=frontpagemag/> the Italian government arrested many Jews on charge of assisting enemy forces.\n\nIn November of that year, Britain reconquered [[Cyrenaica]]. The unit of Jewish{{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason= as above, Israel did not exist until 1948}} soldiers tried to support the community, but in February 1942 the Italian-German army returned, and only a small number of Jews managed to escape with the retreating British army. Italy decided to expel all the Jews to [[Tripolitania]] and imposed harsh punishments on the remaining Jews, including the death penalty for three of them. During the last British conquest of Cyrenaica in November 1942, the remaining 360 Jews were deterred from contacting the British army for fear of another regime change. The Jewish {{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason=as above}} soldiers were an important part of the rehabilitation of the community's remains. The blow to the Jewish community was the worst of any Libyan community. Over 500 Jews were killed, out of a community of 4,000. The lives of the survivors were in danger. Close to 2,600 Jews were sent to the Giado concentration camp; some families were sent to other camps. About 200 British citizens were transferred to Italy and some 250 French citizens to [[Tunisia]].<ref name=c3.ort.org.il/>\n\n===Giado concentration camp===\nThe majority of the Jewish community in Cyrenaica was sent to the [[Jado concentration camp|Giado concentration camp]], approximately {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Tripoli. The prosperous urban community of 2,600 people was crammed into booths in an old military camp that had been converted into a concentration camp. The health and sanitation conditions were terrible, and many of the Jews suffered from malnutrition. The camp was run by Italian officers, headed by the anti-Semitic [[Ettore Bastico]], who supplied the detainees with just 100-150 grams of bread a day, in addition to a small weekly allocation of food. The Jews were in charge of distributing this insufficient food supply. After many rejections of the requests by Jewish leaders to increase the food allowance, the camp officers permitted Arab merchants to sell basic food supplies to the Jews, which they did for a high price - one that few could afford. After further requests, they were allowed to receive aid from Tripoli.<ref name=haaretz/>\n\nRabbi Frigia Zuaretz requested permission to set up a synagogue in the camp, and was allocated one of the booths. With the first death in the community, the community leaders needed to make burial arrangements. They found a Jewish cemetery from the 18th century where they were able  to bury their dead - in numbers that grew daily, mainly due to malnutrition and the spread of typhus.\n\nIn January 1943, a few days before the Allies liberated the camp, all the prisoners were called to the plaza and brought before armed soldiers, and it was believed that the order to shoot would come at any moment.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The order wasn't carried out. After a few days, the camp's officers retreated and some of the prisoners escaped. When the British arrived, they found the Jews in an unstable and disorganized state. In March of that year, the British military Rabbi Orbach visited, and received permission to send 60 Jews to Palestine. The camp survivors were sent at first to Tripoli, where they became a burden on the local community, until October 1943 when most of the survivors moved to Benghazi. The community never returned to its previous prosperity, and few managed to return to economic stability. Close to 600 out of the 2600 Jewish residents of the Benghazi camp perished.<ref name=frontpagemag/>\n\n===Forced labor===\nIn June 1942, Italian Libya's governor decreed that the legal status of Libyan and Italian men was the same, which meant that men aged 18\u201345 were drafted into military service. Men from Tripolitania county were sent to work in Sidi Azaz and Bukbuk. In August, 3,000 Jews were sent to the Sidi Azaz labor camp but, due to the lack of infrastructure, most were sent back to their homes, to serve the country and to work camps in Cyrenaica. The Jews were a substantial work force that the community was lacking.<ref name=haaretz>{{cite news|author=Amiram Barkat|title=A new look at Libyan Jewry's Holocaust experience|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/a-new-look-at-libyan-jewry-s-holocaust-experience-1.11501|accessdate=21 September 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=April 30, 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe camp was isolated and desert-like, with few Italian guards and tents. It was an open camp, which allowed the rich to purchase food which they sometimes shared with others. After a while, residents of Tripoli traveled out to meet their family members.<ref name=yad-vashem/>\nThe camp residents started their day at 6:00 am with roll call and it ended at 5:00 pm. They received 500 grams of bread, rice, or pasta as food. Unprecedented consideration was shown when the Italian guards allowed the prisoners to rest on the Sabbath. There was one violent incident, when a prisoner argued with an Italian guard as was shot dead as a result. The guard was transferred and the Jews learned to stay out of arguments with the guards.\n\nThe Bukbuk camp was set up in East Cyrenaica, on the Egyptian border. The prisoners were tasked with paving roads from Libya to Egypt for the army's purposes. The camp was so remote that there were no guards or fences. There was a lack of water, for a supply arrived only every few days. The work day was officially from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, but the lack of supervision allowed the prisoners to work at a leisurely pace and, despite the complaints of the Italian supervisor who came every few days, the camp was short of guards. The camp did have an Italian doctor who ignored the mostly invented diseases and injuries of the prisoners, which allowed them to claim they were not suited for work and be released. In October 1942, Bukbuk was the target of multiple bombings, and only in November, with the retreat of Italian forces, were the prisoners released and allowed to find their own way back to Tripoli, most of them with the aid of passing vehicles.<ref name=yad-vashem/>\n\n[[File:Jewish Holocaust survivors return to Libya from Concentration Camp Bergen-Belsen 1945.jpg|thumb|300px|Jewish Holocaust survivors return to Libya from concentration camp Bergen-Belsen<ref>{{cite web|author=Goel Pinto|title=We Remember the Jews of Libya!|url=http://www.zchor.org/libya/libya.htm|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref>]]\n\n===Expulsion of Jews with foreign citizenship===\nGerman soldiers entered Italian Libya in 1941 after the Italian army was defeated in Cyrenaica, but German influence was felt starting in 1938. Due to the involvement and importance that the foreign Jews had in economy and commerce, they were treated normally, and the Italian government wasn't quick to apply the racial laws and expel the foreign Jews. Yet, there were incidents of German soldiers harassing Jews. After Italy joined the war in June 1940 the Jews' conditions worsened, and in September all the citizens of enemy countries were put in detention camps, in decent conditions. They were all expelled during the second half of 1941, mainly due to the fact that the detention camps became an economic burden. Many of those expelled had lived in Libya their whole lives, holding a second citizenship for convenience only. Approximately 1,600 Jews with French citizenship were expelled to Tunisia. Over 400 with British citizenship were sent to Italy. Those expelled from [[Benghazi]] were allowed to take valuables and were sent to a detention camp in Bologna, while those leaving Tripoli were allowed only personal items, and sent mainly to camps in Siena and Firenze. Living conditions were tight but they were treated well by the guards. In September 1943, Italy fell under German control, and in October Jewish men were sent from Arzo camp, east of Siena, to forced labor. Between February and May 1944, the expellees from Tripoli and some from Benghazi were sent to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] camp, while most of the Benghazi expellees were sent to Innsbruck-Reichenau camp.<ref name=yad-vashem/>\n\nThe food supply in Bergen Belsen was terrible, working conditions were very hard and prisoners were abused and harassed by SS soldiers.\n\nThe [[Innsbruck-Reichenau camp]] was located in western Austria and was an offshoot of the [[Dachau]] camp. It was surrounded by an electric fence, there was separation between men and women and the inmates were all forced to work. Unlike the other prisoners, the Jews of Libya were allowed to stay in their civilian clothes. The SS guards were cruel to the Jews- they were banned from any religious expression or worship, and punishment such as flogging, imprisonment and death by shooting were common.<ref name=histclo/>\n\nBeyond the known horrors of the Holocaust, the [[Jews of Libya]] were a foreign element in frigid Europe, which made survival much harder. Beyond the different climate, the cultural difference was a major obstacle. In both camps the Jews of Libya made an effort to observe Jewish dietary restrictions despite the hardships, and traded their cooked meals for bread. Many of the Jews of Libya perished in the camp, mainly elderly people who couldn't withstand the hunger, torture and disease.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAccording to Maurice Roumani, a Libyan emigrant who was previously the Executive Director of [[WOJAC]],<ref>Yehouda Shenhav.

Moreover, the rise of nationalism and preparations for independence made many members of the community suspicious and apprehensive about their future in Libya.

The British installed the [[Palestine Regiment]] in [[Cyrenaica]], which later became the core of the [[Jewish Brigade]] which was later also stationed in [[Tripolitania]].

Over a period of several days more than 130 Jews (including 36 children) were killed, hundreds were injured, 4,000 were left homeless (displaced) and 2,400 were reduced to poverty. Five synagogues in Tripoli and four in provincial towns were destroyed, and over 1,000 Jewish residences and commercial buildings were plundered in Tripoli alone.<ref name=\"Stillman, 2003, p. 145\">Stillman, 2003, p. 145.</ref> Further [[1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Tripolitania|riots took place in Tripolitania in June 1948]], when 15 Jews were killed and 280 Jewish homes destroyed.<ref>Harris, 2001, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref> In November 1948, a few months after the events in Tripolitania, the American consul in Tripoli Orray Taft Jr. reported that: \"There is reason to believe that the Jewish Community has become more aggressive as the result of the Jewish victories in Palestine. There is also reason to believe that the community here is receiving instructions and guidance from the State of Israel. Whether or not the change in attitude is the result of instructions or a progressive aggressiveness is hard to determine. Even with the aggressiveness or perhaps because of it, both Jewish and Arab leaders inform me that the inter-racial relations are better now than they have been for several years and that understanding, tolerance and cooperation are present at any top level meeting between the leaders of the two communities.\"{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=68}}<ref>NARA RG 84, Libya\u2014 Tripoli, General Records 1948-49; file 800-833, Taft to Secretary of State (November 23, 1948)</ref>\n\nEmigration to Israel began in 1949, following the establishment of a [[Jewish Agency]] office in Tripoli. \n\nUnfounded and anti-Semitic rumors continue to persist, such as what was previous written on this page here: \"According to Harvey E.

The majority of those left between 1948 to 1952, with the exodus continuing thru the 1950s. Following the removal of all of their rights and sustained harassment, the majority of the Jews of Libya left following the 1967 war.

He promised that the Jews of Libya would be safe and that Italy would respect the Jewish community and their traditions, religion and leadership.\n\n==During the Holocaust==\n{{The Holocaust sidebar}}\n\n===Worsening status of the Jews===\nItaly's aggressive policies led to its isolation within Europe, and to a pact with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1936. The Rome-Berlin axis forced the countries to operate based on common principles, so the German race laws applied to Italy and its colonies.<ref name=yad-vashem/> In the racial manifesto, which was published in Italy in 1938, racist and anti-semitic laws appeared as representing the Italian Fascist Party's position. The main laws were:\n*Jews with foreign citizenship were banned from leaving the country{{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason= apparently contradicted below in ''Expulsion of Jews with foreign citizenship'' which says foreign Jews were to be expelled under the racial laws}}\n*Jewish students were banned from high schools and higher education establishments\n*Any Jew with a government position was to be fired\n*All Jewish soldiers in the Italian army were to be demoted.\n*Jews were forbidden from participating in government bids.\n\nItalian Libya's governor, Balbo, tried to convince Mussolini to postpone the application of the laws in Libya, claiming that they would destroy the Libyan economy. Mussolini allowed Balbo to apply the laws as he saw fit. Despite the relative protection that the Jews enjoyed under Balbo, Jewish government workers were fired, Jewish children were expelled from schools, and Jews wishing to move between cities required a license. Balbo was killed in July 1940, when an Italian ship shot down his airplane. Italian officials explained the incident as an accident.<ref name=histclo/>\n\nIn the second half of 1940, after Italy joined World War II on the side of Germany, the Jews' situation worsened. Tripoli was in chaos, and the Jewish quarter in Italy {{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason= in Italy? In Tripoli?}} was heavily damaged by Allied bombings, leaving many Jews dead. Some Jews, like the Muslim population, escaped inland. The Jewish community in Tripoli rented homes for the needy, constructed underground bomb shelters and supplied education for the children who were expelled.\n\nAs time went by, the race laws became worse - the Jews of Cyrenaica were sent to a concentration camp in Tripolitania, and most of the community's workforce was sent to labor camps. Jews who were citizens of enemy countries were expelled from the country, and the rest suffered from racist and oppressive laws that hurt them socially and economically. In mid-1942, the governor decreed that Jews were forbidden to enter into real estate deals or commerce outside the community, to publish any material that did not relate to religion, and subject to other oppressive laws.<ref name=c3.ort.org.il/>\n\n===The Jews of Cyrenaica under regime changes===\n\nThe accelerated application of the Race Laws caused the Jews to lose trust in the Italian government and led them to support the British instead. When Britain first conquered Cyrenaica in December 1940, the Jews were freed from the race laws. They did not hide their support of the conquering army, especially due to the meetings between the community and the Jewish soldiers who joined the war as part of the unit of Jewish soldiers.{{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason=Israel did not exist until 1948. Please clarify}} The soldiers met with the Benghazi community many times, renewed Zionist activities, and supported educational activity. On April 3, 1941, the Italian-German forces managed to push the British forces out of Benghazi, and 250 Jews left with them. The Italian citizens who lived in the city during the British control held a grudge towards the Jews, and conducted pogroms during which two Jews were killed, and a great deal of property was pillaged and damaged. When order was restored and [[anti-Semitism]] began to increase,<ref name=frontpagemag/> the Italian government arrested many Jews on charge of assisting enemy forces.\n\nIn November of that year, Britain reconquered [[Cyrenaica]]. The unit of Jewish{{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason= as above, Israel did not exist until 1948}} soldiers tried to support the community, but in February 1942 the Italian-German army returned, and only a small number of Jews managed to escape with the retreating British army. Italy decided to expel all the Jews to [[Tripolitania]] and imposed harsh punishments on the remaining Jews, including the death penalty for three of them. During the last British conquest of Cyrenaica in November 1942, the remaining 360 Jews were deterred from contacting the British army for fear of another regime change. The Jewish {{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason=as above}} soldiers were an important part of the rehabilitation of the community's remains. The blow to the Jewish community was the worst of any Libyan community. Over 500 Jews were killed, out of a community of 4,000. The lives of the survivors were in danger. Close to 2,600 Jews were sent to the Giado concentration camp; some families were sent to other camps. About 200 British citizens were transferred to Italy and some 250 French citizens to [[Tunisia]].<ref name=c3.ort.org.il/>\n\n===Giado concentration camp===\nThe majority of the Jewish community in Cyrenaica was sent to the [[Jado concentration camp|Giado concentration camp]], approximately {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Tripoli. The prosperous urban community of 2,600 people was crammed into booths in an old military camp that had been converted into a concentration camp. The health and sanitation conditions were terrible, and many of the Jews suffered from malnutrition. The camp was run by Italian officers, headed by the anti-Semitic [[Ettore Bastico]], who supplied the detainees with just 100-150 grams of bread a day, in addition to a small weekly allocation of food. The Jews were in charge of distributing this insufficient food supply. After many rejections of the requests by Jewish leaders to increase the food allowance, the camp officers permitted Arab merchants to sell basic food supplies to the Jews, which they did for a high price - one that few could afford. After further requests, they were allowed to receive aid from Tripoli.<ref name=haaretz/>\n\nRabbi Frigia Zuaretz requested permission to set up a synagogue in the camp, and was allocated one of the booths. With the first death in the community, the community leaders needed to make burial arrangements. They found a Jewish cemetery from the 18th century where they were able  to bury their dead - in numbers that grew daily, mainly due to malnutrition and the spread of typhus.\n\nIn January 1943, a few days before the Allies liberated the camp, all the prisoners were called to the plaza and brought before armed soldiers, and it was believed that the order to shoot would come at any moment.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The order wasn't carried out. After a few days, the camp's officers retreated and some of the prisoners escaped. When the British arrived, they found the Jews in an unstable and disorganized state. In March of that year, the British military Rabbi Orbach visited, and received permission to send 60 Jews to Palestine. The camp survivors were sent at first to Tripoli, where they became a burden on the local community, until October 1943 when most of the survivors moved to Benghazi. The community never returned to its previous prosperity, and few managed to return to economic stability. Close to 600 out of the 2600 Jewish residents of the Benghazi camp perished.<ref name=frontpagemag/>\n\n===Forced labor===\nIn June 1942, Italian Libya's governor decreed that the legal status of Libyan and Italian men was the same, which meant that men aged 18\u201345 were drafted into military service. Men from Tripolitania county were sent to work in Sidi Azaz and Bukbuk. In August, 3,000 Jews were sent to the Sidi Azaz labor camp but, due to the lack of infrastructure, most were sent back to their homes, to serve the country and to work camps in Cyrenaica. The Jews were a substantial work force that the community was lacking.<ref name=haaretz>{{cite news|author=Amiram Barkat|title=A new look at Libyan Jewry's Holocaust experience|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/a-new-look-at-libyan-jewry-s-holocaust-experience-1.11501|accessdate=21 September 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=April 30, 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe camp was isolated and desert-like, with few Italian guards and tents. It was an open camp, which allowed the rich to purchase food which they sometimes shared with others. After a while, residents of Tripoli traveled out to meet their family members.<ref name=yad-vashem/>\nThe camp residents started their day at 6:00 am with roll call and it ended at 5:00 pm. They received 500 grams of bread, rice, or pasta as food. Unprecedented consideration was shown when the Italian guards allowed the prisoners to rest on the Sabbath. There was one violent incident, when a prisoner argued with an Italian guard as was shot dead as a result. The guard was transferred and the Jews learned to stay out of arguments with the guards.\n\nThe Bukbuk camp was set up in East Cyrenaica, on the Egyptian border. The prisoners were tasked with paving roads from Libya to Egypt for the army's purposes. The camp was so remote that there were no guards or fences. There was a lack of water, for a supply arrived only every few days. The work day was officially from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, but the lack of supervision allowed the prisoners to work at a leisurely pace and, despite the complaints of the Italian supervisor who came every few days, the camp was short of guards. The camp did have an Italian doctor who ignored the mostly invented diseases and injuries of the prisoners, which allowed them to claim they were not suited for work and be released. In October 1942, Bukbuk was the target of multiple bombings, and only in November, with the retreat of Italian forces, were the prisoners released and allowed to find their own way back to Tripoli, most of them with the aid of passing vehicles.<ref name=yad-vashem/>\n\n[[File:Jewish Holocaust survivors return to Libya from Concentration Camp Bergen-Belsen 1945.jpg|thumb|300px|Jewish Holocaust survivors return to Libya from concentration camp Bergen-Belsen<ref>{{cite web|author=Goel Pinto|title=We Remember the Jews of Libya!|url=http://www.zchor.org/libya/libya.htm|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref>]]\n\n===Expulsion of Jews with foreign citizenship===\nGerman soldiers entered Italian Libya in 1941 after the Italian army was defeated in Cyrenaica, but German influence was felt starting in 1938. Due to the involvement and importance that the foreign Jews had in economy and commerce, they were treated normally, and the Italian government wasn't quick to apply the racial laws and expel the foreign Jews. Yet, there were incidents of German soldiers harassing Jews. After Italy joined the war in June 1940 the Jews' conditions worsened, and in September all the citizens of enemy countries were put in detention camps, in decent conditions. They were all expelled during the second half of 1941, mainly due to the fact that the detention camps became an economic burden. Many of those expelled had lived in Libya their whole lives, holding a second citizenship for convenience only. Approximately 1,600 Jews with French citizenship were expelled to Tunisia. Over 400 with British citizenship were sent to Italy. Those expelled from [[Benghazi]] were allowed to take valuables and were sent to a detention camp in Bologna, while those leaving Tripoli were allowed only personal items, and sent mainly to camps in Siena and Firenze. Living conditions were tight but they were treated well by the guards. In September 1943, Italy fell under German control, and in October Jewish men were sent from Arzo camp, east of Siena, to forced labor. Between February and May 1944, the expellees from Tripoli and some from Benghazi were sent to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] camp, while most of the Benghazi expellees were sent to Innsbruck-Reichenau camp.<ref name=yad-vashem/>\n\nThe food supply in Bergen Belsen was terrible, working conditions were very hard and prisoners were abused and harassed by SS soldiers.\n\nThe [[Innsbruck-Reichenau camp]] was located in western Austria and was an offshoot of the [[Dachau]] camp. It was surrounded by an electric fence, there was separation between men and women and the inmates were all forced to work. Unlike the other prisoners, the Jews of Libya were allowed to stay in their civilian clothes. The SS guards were cruel to the Jews- they were banned from any religious expression or worship, and punishment such as flogging, imprisonment and death by shooting were common.<ref name=histclo/>\n\nBeyond the known horrors of the Holocaust, the [[Jews of Libya]] were a foreign element in frigid Europe, which made survival much harder. Beyond the different climate, the cultural difference was a major obstacle. In both camps the Jews of Libya made an effort to observe Jewish dietary restrictions despite the hardships, and traded their cooked meals for bread. Many of the Jews of Libya perished in the camp, mainly elderly people who couldn't withstand the hunger, torture and disease.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAccording to Maurice Roumani, a Libyan emigrant who was previously the Executive Director of [[WOJAC]],<ref>Yehouda Shenhav.

Moreover, the rise of nationalism and preparations for independence made many members of the community suspicious and apprehensive about their future in Libya.

The British installed the [[Palestine Regiment]] in [[Cyrenaica]], which later became the core of the [[Jewish Brigade]] which was later also stationed in [[Tripolitania]].

Over a period of several days more than 130 Jews (including 36 children) were killed, hundreds were injured, 4,000 were left homeless (displaced) and 2,400 were reduced to poverty. Five synagogues in Tripoli and four in provincial towns were destroyed, and over 1,000 Jewish residences and commercial buildings were plundered in Tripoli alone.<ref name=\"Stillman, 2003, p. 145\">Stillman, 2003, p. 145.</ref> Further [[1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Tripolitania|riots took place in Tripolitania in June 1948]], when 15 Jews were killed and 280 Jewish homes destroyed.<ref>Harris, 2001, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref> In November 1948, a few months after the events in Tripolitania, the American consul in Tripoli Orray Taft Jr. reported that: \"There is reason to believe that the Jewish Community has become more aggressive as the result of the Jewish victories in Palestine. There is also reason to believe that the community here is receiving instructions and guidance from the State of Israel. Whether or not the change in attitude is the result of instructions or a progressive aggressiveness is hard to determine. Even with the aggressiveness or perhaps because of it, both Jewish and Arab leaders inform me that the inter-racial relations are better now than they have been for several years and that understanding, tolerance and cooperation are present at any top level meeting between the leaders of the two communities.\"{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=68}}<ref>NARA RG 84, Libya\u2014 Tripoli, General Records 1948-49; file 800-833, Taft to Secretary of State (November 23, 1948)</ref>\n\nEmigration to Israel began in 1949, following the establishment of a [[Jewish Agency]] office in Tripoli.

Mills would also write \"Sunshine Man\" with Leonard Pettit, and \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\" with Tom Jenkins. The actual group on the recordings were known as [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]] featuring [[Tom Bahler]] on lead (he would later go on to pen the classic [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\"), [[John Bahler]], [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] and Stan Farber.

They performed two songs per episode which included:\n\n# \"Sunshine Man\"\n# \"Summertime Girl\"\n# \"Oh, How I Love You\"\n# \"Keep in Time\"\n# \"It Should Always Be Saturday\"\n# \"Hop, Skip and a Jump\"\n# \"Flying So High\"\n# \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\"\n# \"Shadow, Shadow\"\n# \"Being With You\"\n# \"Singing Song\"\n# \"Song of the Season\"\n# \"What's Your Sign?\"\n# \"Sunny Sun Day\"\n# \"Rock N Roll Circus\"\n\nThe music was written by various [[Screen Gems]] staffers, which at the time included [[David Gates]] (later of [[Bread (band)|Bread]]) penning the popular \"Summertime Girl\" and Tony Dancy (of Tony's Tygers) writing with Craig Fairchild & Jackie Mills on \"Being With You\". Mills would also write \"Sunshine Man\" with Leonard Pettit, and \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\" with Tom Jenkins. The actual group on the recordings were known as [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]] featuring [[Tom Bahler]] on lead (he would later go on to pen the classic [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\"), [[John Bahler]], [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] and Stan Farber. This lineup would record on hundreds of commercials, TV themes and [[The Partridge Family discography|The Partridge Family]] recordings. Bahler's lead vocals are also prominent with the group [[The Love Generation]] who had a few LPs in the late 1960s as well.\n\n==Episodes==\nEach episode contained two shorts featuring the traditional antics and adventures of '''Fred and Barney''' and one short featuring '''Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm''' with their friends Moonrock, Penny, Wiggy, Schleprock, Cindy and Fabian, and the Bronto Bunch (Bronto, Noodles, Stub and Zonk).\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:20px\"| {{Abbr|N\u00ba|Number}}\n! style=\"background:#FFD700\"| Titles\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:135px\"| Air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Birdbrained / Squawkie Talkies / Bedrock 500\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1972|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary =\n* '''Bird Brained:''' Fred has to birdsit Mr. Slate's pet parrot, Claymore, who causes nothing but trouble for the Flintstones and the Rubbles.\n* '''Squawkie Talkies:''' Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm mistakenly believe that Barney is eaten by a Hipposaurus while using Moonrock's \"squawkie talkie\" gadgets.\n* '''Bedrock 500:''' Bamm-Bamm and Moonrock, Pebbles and her girlfriends participate in the Bedrock 500 car race against the Bronto Bunch.\n| LineColor = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| Title = The Flying Fools / Bedlam in Bedrock / The Stone Ranger Rides Again\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1972|9|16}}\n| ShortSummary =\n* '''The Flying Fools:''' Fred and Barney experience a turbulent afternoon while flying in Moonrock's new self-made airplane.\n* '''Bedlam in Bedrock:''' Pebbles and her friends try to help Radio R.O.C.K.
