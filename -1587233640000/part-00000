He also served as a senior [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the [[Confederate States Army]] in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] of the [[American Civil War]].\n\nChesnut, a lawyer prominent in [[South Carolina]] state politics, served as a Democratic [[United States Senator|senator]] in 1858-60, where he proved moderate on the slavery question. But on Lincoln's election in 1860, Chesnut resigned from the U.S. Senate and took part in the South Carolina secession convention, later helping to draft the [[Confederate States Constitution]].\n\nAs aide to General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], he ordered the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|firing on Fort Sumter]] and served at [[First Manassas]]. Later he was aide to [[Jefferson Davis]] and promoted to Brigadier-General. Chesnut returned to law practice after the war.\n\nHis wife was [[Mary Boykin Chesnut]], whose published diaries reflect the Chesnuts' busy social life and prominent friends such as [[John Bell Hood]], [[Louis T. Wigfall]], [[Wade Hampton III]], and Jefferson Davis.\n\n==Early life and education==\nJames Chesnut Jr., was born the youngest of fourteen children and the only (surviving) son of James Chesnut Sr. (1775&ndash;1866) and his wife, Mary Cox (1777&ndash;1864)<ref>{{cite web|title=Papers of the Cox and Chesnut Families, 1792-1858|url=http://scmemory.org/collection/papers-of-the-cox-and-chesnut-families-1792-1858/|website=South Carolina Digital Library|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> on [[Mulberry Plantation (James and Mary Boykin Chesnut House)|Mulberry Plantation]] near [[Camden, South Carolina]].  Chesnut Sr. was one of the wealthiest [[Plantations in the American South|planters]] in the South, who owned 448 slaves and many large plantations totaling nearly five square miles before the outbreak of the Civil War. Chesnut Jr. graduated from the law department of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) in 1835, and initially rose to prominence in [[South Carolina]] state politics.\n\n==Political career==\n[[Admission to the bar|Admitted to the bar]] in 1837, Chesnut Jr. commenced practice that year in Camden.  He was later elected as a member of the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] (1840&ndash;52) and the [[South Carolina Senate]] (1852&ndash;58, serving as its president 1856&ndash;58). He was a delegate to the [[Nashville Convention|southern convention]] at [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1850.\n\nIn 1858 Chesnut was elected by the [[South Carolina Legislature]] to the [[U.S. Senate]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to replace [[Josiah J. Evans]]. He served there for two years alongside Senator [[James Henry Hammond]] of South Carolina. Although a defender of [[slavery]] and [[states' rights]], Chesnut opposed the re-opening of the [[Atlantic slave trade|African slave trade]] and was not as staunch a [[secessionist]] as most of the South Carolinian politicians. Moderate in his political views, he believed in extending protections for slavery's westward expansion while remaining within the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nBut the political atmosphere tightened towards the [[Presidential election of 1860|Presidential Election of 1860]], since the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and its presidential candidate, [[Abraham Lincoln]], opposed slavery. After the results of the election were known, Chesnut decided that he could no longer stay in his office in the Senate.<ref>Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House'', pp. 277 and 289, Cauthen, ''South Carolina Goes to War'', pp. 49&ndash;50, Sinha, ''The Counterrevolution of the Slavery'', pp. 134, 138, 176&ndash;7.</ref> Shortly after Lincoln's election, he was the first Southern senator to withdraw from the Senate, on November 10, 1860. (He was [[Expulsion from the United States Congress|expelled]] ''in absentia'' from the Senate the next year.)\n\nChesnut participated in the South Carolina secession convention in December 1860 and was subsequently elected to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He was a member of the committee which drafted the Confederate States Constitution.\n\n==American Civil War==\n[[File:James Chesnut, Jr.jpg|thumb|left|110px|Col. James Chesnut, [[Circa|c.]] 1862]]\n\nIn the spring of 1861, he served as an [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] and was sent by the general to demand the surrender of [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. After the commander of the fort, Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] of the [[U.S. Army]] declined to surrender, Chesnut gave orders to the nearby Fort Johnson to open fire on Fort Sumter. In consequence the first shots of the Civil War were fired, on April 12, 1861.<ref>Williams, ''Beauregard'', pp. 57&ndash;58.</ref> In the summer of 1861 Chesnut also took part in the [[First Battle of Bull Run|First Battle of Manassas]] as an aide-de-camp to Beauregard.\n\nIn 1862 Chesnut served as a member of the South Carolina's Executive Council and the Chief of the Department of the Military of South Carolina. Later in the war he served the Confederate Army as a [[colonel]] and an aide to [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]]. In 1864 he was promoted to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]] and given command of South Carolina reserve forces until the end of the war. He was third in command of the confederate forces at the [[Battle of Tulifinny]]. He was in overall command before the arrival of Maj. Gen. [[Samuel Jones (Confederate Army officer)|Samuel Jones]] and later Brig. Gen. [[Lucius Jeremiah Gartrell|Lucius Gartrell]]. After the war, he returned to the practice of law in Camden and formed the [[Conservative Party (South Carolina)|Conservative Party]].\n\n==Personal life==\nAlthough James Chesnut Jr. was the only son, his father had given him little of his extensive property.  Because his father lived to the age of 90 and gave his son but a small allowance, the son James had to live mainly on his law practice. The Chesnut fortune declined in the course of the war and thus, after his father died in 1866, Chesnut inherited little more than the extensive debts that encumbered the Mulberry and Sandy Hill plantations.<ref>Muhlenfeld, ''Mary Boykin Chesnut'', ''passim''.</ref>\n\nChesnut married seventeen-year-old [[Mary Chesnut|Mary Boykin Miller]] (1823&ndash;86), on April 23, 1840. She later became well known for her book on life during the Civil War, published as a diary but revised extensively from 1881 to 1886. The daughter of U.S. Senator [[Stephen Decatur Miller]] (1788&ndash;1838) and Mary Boykin (1804&ndash;85), she was well-educated and intelligent and took part in her husband's career. The Chesnuts' marriage was at times stormy due to difference in temperament (she was hot-tempered and passionate and came occasionally to regard her husband as cool and reserved). Their companionship was mostly warm and affectionate but they had no children.<ref>Chesnut, ''Mary Chesnut's Civil War'', ''passim''.</ref>  The couple resided at [[Chesnut Cottage]] in Columbia during the Civil War period.<ref name = scdah>{{Cite web | title = Chesnut Cottage, Richland County (1718 Hampton St., Columbia) | work = National Register Properties in South Carolina | publisher = South Carolina Department of Archives and History | url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/richland/S10817740016/index.htm | accessdate =2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\nAs Mary Chesnut described in depth in her diary, the Chesnuts had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the society of the South and the Confederacy. Among their friends were, for example, Confederate general [[John Bell Hood]], ex-Governor [[John L. Manning]], Confederate general and politician [[John S. Preston]] and his wife Caroline, Confederate general and politician [[Wade Hampton III]], Confederate politician [[Clement Claiborne Clay|Clement C. Clay]] and his wife [[Virginia Clay-Clopton|Virginia]], and Confederate general and politician [[Louis T. Wigfall]] and his wife Charlotte. The Chesnuts were intimate family friends of President Jefferson Davis and his wife [[Varina Howell]]. James Chesnut was also a first cousin of fellow Confederate general [[Zachariah C. Deas]].\n\n==Death==\nJames Chesnut was \"regarded as an amiable, modest gentleman of decent parts [gifts]\",<ref>Hammond, ''Secret And Sacred'', p.&nbsp;214.</ref> who performed his duties with ability and dignity both in political and military life. He died at home in Camden in 1885; interment was in Chesnut Family Cemetery, [[Kershaw County, South Carolina]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American Civil War generals (Confederate)]]\n* [[List of United States Senators expelled or censured]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Cauthen, Charles E.: ''South Carolina Goes to War: 1860\u20131865''.

{"title_page": "IEC 61508", "text_new": "{{1r|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use British (Oxford) English|date=January 2012}}\n'''IEC 61508''' is an [[international standard]] published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] consisting of methods on how to apply, design, deploy and maintain automatic protection systems called safety-related systems. It is titled '''''Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems''''' ('''E/E/PE,''' or '''E/E/PES''').\n\nIEC 61508 is a basic functional safety standard applicable to all kinds of industry. It defines functional safety as: \u201cpart of the overall safety relating to the EUC (Equipment Under Control) and the EUC control system which depends on the correct functioning of the E/E/PE safety-related systems, other technology safety-related systems and external risk reduction facilities.\u201d The fundamental concept is that any safety-related system must work correctly or fail in a predictable (safe) way.\n\nThe standard has two fundamental principles:\n# An engineering process called the [[safety life cycle]] is defined based on best practices in order to discover and eliminate design errors and omissions.\n# A probabilistic failure approach to account for the safety impact of device failures. \n \nThe safety life cycle has 16 phases which roughly can be divided into three groups as follows:\n# Phases 1\u20135 address analysis\n# Phases 6\u201313 address realisation\n# Phases 14\u201316 address operation.\n\nAll phases are concerned with the safety function of the system.\n\nThe standard has seven parts:\n* Parts 1\u20133 contain the requirements of the standard (normative)\n* Part 4 contains definitions\n* Parts 5\u20137 are guidelines and examples for development and thus informative.\n\nCentral to the standard are the concepts of probabilistic risk for each safety function. The risk is a function of frequency (or likelihood) of the hazardous event and the event consequence severity. The risk is reduced to a tolerable level by applying safety functions which may consist of E/E/PES, associated mechanical devices, or other technologies. Many requirements apply to all technologies but there is strong emphasis on programmable electronics especially in Part 3. \n\nIEC 61508 has the following views on risks:\n* Zero risk can never be reached, only probabilities can be reduced\n* Non-tolerable risks must be reduced ([[ALARP]])\n* Optimal, cost effective safety is achieved when addressed in the entire safety lifecycle\nSpecific techniques ensure that mistakes and errors are avoided across the entire life-cycle. Errors introduced anywhere from the initial concept, risk analysis, specification, design, installation, maintenance and through to disposal could undermine even the most reliable protection. IEC 61508 specifies techniques that should be used for each phase of the life-cycle.\n\n==Hazard and risk analysis==\n\nThe standard requires that hazard and risk assessment be carried out for bespoke systems: 'The EUC (equipment under control) risk shall be evaluated, or estimated, for each determined hazardous event'.\n\nThe standard advises that 'Either qualitative or quantitative hazard and risk analysis techniques may be used' and offers guidance on a number of approaches. One of these, for the qualitative analysis of hazards, is a framework based on 6 categories of likelihood of occurrence and 4 of consequence.\n\n''' Categories of likelihood of occurrence '''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

A risk assessment effort yields a target SIL for each safety function. For any given design the achieved SIL level is evaluated by three measures:\n\n1. Systematic Capability (SC) which is a measure of design quality. Each device in the design has an SC rating. The SIL of the safety function is limited to smallest SC rating of the devices used. Requirement for SC are presented in a series of tables in Part 2 and Part 3. The requirements include appropriate quality control, management processes, validation and verification techniques, failure analysis etc. so that one can reasonably justify that the final system attains the required SIL.\n \n2. Architecture Constraints which are minimum levels of safety redundancy presented via two alternative methods - Route 1h and Route 2h.\n \n3. Probability of Dangerous Failure Analysis<ref>{{cite publication |title=Control Systems Safety Evaluation and Reliability |publisher=ISA |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-934394-80-9}}</ref>\n\n===Probabilistic analysis===\n\nThe probability metric used in step 3 above depends on whether the functional component will be exposed to ''high'' or ''low'' demand:\n* high demand is defined as more than once per year and low demand is defined as less than or equal to once per year (IEC-61508-4).\n* For functions that operate continuously (continuous mode) or functions that operate frequently (high demand mode), SIL specifies an allowable frequency of dangerous failure.\n* For functions that operate intermittently (low demand mode), SIL specifies an allowable probability that the function will fail to respond on demand.\nNote the difference between function and system. The system implementing the function might be in operation frequently (like an ECU for deploying an air-bag), but the function (like air-bag deployment) might be in demand intermittently.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n\n| '''SIL''' || ''' Low demand mode: <br /> average probability of failure on demand ''' || ''' High demand or continuous mode: <br /> probability of dangerous failure per hour '''\n|-\n| 1 || \u2265 10<sup>\u22122</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22121</sup> || \u2265 10<sup>\u22126</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22125</sup>\n|-\n| 2 || \u2265 10<sup>\u22123</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22122</sup> || \u2265 10<sup>\u22127</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\n|-\n| 3 || \u2265 10<sup>\u22124</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22123</sup> || \u2265 10<sup>\u22128</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22127</sup> (1 dangerous failure in 1140 years)\n|-\n| 4 || \u2265 10<sup>\u22125</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22124</sup> || \u2265 10<sup>\u22129</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22128</sup>\n|}\n\n==IEC 61508 certification==\nCertification is third party attestation that a product, process, or system meets all requirements of the certification program. Those requirements are listed in a document called the certification scheme. IEC 61508 certification programs are operated by impartial third party organizations called ''certification bodies'' (CB). These CBs are accredited to operate following other international standards including ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17025. Certification bodies are accredited to perform the auditing, assessment, and testing work by an ''accreditation body'' (AB). There is often one national AB in each country. These ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies. ABs are members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs. IEC 61508 certification programs have been established by several global Certification Bodies. Each has defined their own scheme based upon IEC 61508 and other functional safety standards. The scheme lists the referenced standards and specifies procedures which describes their test methods, surveillance audit policy, public documentation policies, and other specific aspects of their program. IEC 61508 certification programs are being offered globally by several well recognized CBs including exida, T\u00dcV Rheinland, T\u00dcV Sud, and T\u00dcV Nord. Most certifications of currently manufactured automatic protection equipment (sensors, logic solvers, and final element devices) have been completed by exida and T\u00dcV Rheinland.   \n==Industry/application specific variants==\n===Automotive software===\n[[ISO 26262]] is an adaptation of IEC 61508 for Automotive Electric/Electronic Systems. It is being widely adopted by the major car manufacturers.\n\nBefore the launch of ISO 26262, the development of software for safety related automotive systems was predominantly covered by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association guidelines.[1] The MISRA project was conceived to develop guidelines for the creation of embedded software in road vehicle electronic systems. A set of guidelines for the development of vehicle based software was published in November 1994.<ref>{{cite publication |title=Development Guidelines for Vehicle Based Software |publisher=MISRA |year=1994 |isbn=0952415607 }}</ref> This document provided the first automotive industry interpretation of the principles of the, then emerging, IEC 61508 standard.\n\nToday MISRA is most widely known for its guidelines on how to use the C and C++ languages. [[MISRA C]] has gone on to become the de facto standard for embedded C programming in the majority of safety-related industries, and is also used to improve software quality even where safety is not the main consideration. MISRA has also developed guidelines for the use of model based development.\n\n===Rail software===\nIEC 62279 provides a specific interpretation of IEC 61508 for railway applications. It is intended to cover the development of software for railway control and protection including communications, signaling and processing systems.\n\n===Process industries===\nThe process industry sector includes many types of manufacturing processes, such as refineries, petrochemical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, and power. [[IEC 61511]] is a technical standard which sets out practices in the engineering of systems that ensure the safety of an industrial process through the use of instrumentation.\n\n===Nuclear power plants===\nIEC 61513 provides requirements and recommendations for the instrumentation and control for systems important to safety of nuclear power plants. It indicates the general requirements for systems that contain conventional hardwired equipment, computer-based equipment or a combination of both types of equipment.\n\n===Machinery===\n[[IEC 62061]] is the machinery-specific implementation of IEC 61508. It provides requirements that are applicable to the system level design of all types of machinery safety-related electrical control systems and also for the design of non-complex subsystems or devices.\n\n==Testing software==\nSoftware written in accordance with IEC 61508 may need to be [[Unit testing|unit tested]], depending up on the SIL level it needs to achieve. The main requirement in Unit Testing is to ensure that the software is fully tested at the function level and that all possible branches and paths are taken through the software. In some higher [[Safety Integrity Level|SIL level]] applications, the software code coverage requirement is much tougher and an [[Modified Condition/Decision Coverage|MC/DC code coverage]] criterion is used rather than simple branch coverage. To obtain the MC/DC (modified condition/decision coverage) coverage information, one will need a Unit Testing tool, sometimes referred to as a Software Module Testing tool.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Functional safety]]\n* [[Safety standards]]\n* [[FMEDA]]\n* [[Spurious trip level]]\n* [[Time-triggered system]] (A software architecture used to achieve IEC 61508 compliance)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Textbooks ===\n* W.

The system implementing the function might be in operation frequently (like an ECU for deploying an air-bag), but the function (like air-bag deployment) might be in demand intermittently.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n\n| '''SIL''' || ''' Low demand mode: <br /> average probability of failure on demand ''' || ''' High demand or continuous mode: <br /> probability of dangerous failure per hour '''\n|-\n| 1 || \u2265 10<sup>\u22122</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22121</sup> || \u2265 10<sup>\u22126</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22125</sup>\n|-\n| 2 || \u2265 10<sup>\u22123</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22122</sup> || \u2265 10<sup>\u22127</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\n|-\n| 3 || \u2265 10<sup>\u22124</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22123</sup> || \u2265 10<sup>\u22128</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22127</sup> (1 dangerous failure in 1140 years)\n|-\n| 4 || \u2265 10<sup>\u22125</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22124</sup> || \u2265 10<sup>\u22129</sup> to < 10<sup>\u22128</sup>\n|}\n\n==IEC 61508 Certification==\nCertification is third party attestation that a product, process, or system meets all requirements of the certification program.  Those requirements are listed in a document called the certification scheme. IEC 61508 certification programs are operated by impartial third party organizations called Certification Bodies (CB).  These CBs are accredited to operate following other international standards including ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17025. Certification Bodies are accredited to perform the auditing, assessment, and testing work by an Accreditation Body (AB). There is often one national AB in each country. These ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies.  ABs are members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.\nIEC 61508 certification programs have been established by several global Certification Bodies. Each has defined their own scheme based upon IEC 61508 and other functional safety standards. The scheme lists the referenced standards and specifies procedures which describes their test methods, surveillance audit policy, public documentation policies, and other specific aspects of their program. IEC 61508 certification programs are being offered globally by several well recognized CBs including exida, T\u00dcV Rheinland, T\u00dcV Sud, and T\u00dcV Nord.  Most certifications of currently manufactured automatic protection equipment (sensors, logic solvers, and final element devices) have been completed by exida and T\u00dcV Rheinland.   \n\n\n==Industry/application specific variants==\n===Automotive software===\n[[ISO 26262]] is an adaptation of IEC 61508 for Automotive Electric/Electronic Systems. It is being widely adopted by the major car manufacturers.\n\nBefore the launch of ISO 26262, the development of software for safety related automotive systems was predominantly covered by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association guidelines.[1] The MISRA project was conceived to develop guidelines for the creation of embedded software in road vehicle electronic systems. A set of guidelines for the development of vehicle based software was published in November 1994.<ref>{{cite publication |title=Development Guidelines for Vehicle Based Software |publisher=MISRA |year=1994 |isbn=0952415607 }}</ref> This document provided the first automotive industry interpretation of the principles of the, then emerging, IEC 61508 standard.\n\nToday MISRA is most widely known for its guidelines on how to use the C and C++ languages. [[MISRA C]] has gone on to become the de facto standard for embedded C programming in the majority of safety-related industries, and is also used to improve software quality even where safety is not the main consideration. MISRA has also developed guidelines for the use of model based development.\n\n===Rail software===\nIEC 62279 provides a specific interpretation of IEC 61508 for railway applications. It is intended to cover the development of software for railway control and protection including communications, signaling and processing systems.\n\n===Process industries===\nThe process industry sector includes many types of manufacturing processes, such as refineries, petrochemical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, and power. [[IEC 61511]] is a technical standard which sets out practices in the engineering of systems that ensure the safety of an industrial process through the use of instrumentation.\n\n===Nuclear power plants===\nIEC 61513 provides requirements and recommendations for the instrumentation and control for systems important to safety of nuclear power plants. It indicates the general requirements for systems that contain conventional hardwired equipment, computer-based equipment or a combination of both types of equipment.\n\n===Machinery===\n[[IEC 62061]] is the machinery-specific implementation of IEC 61508. It provides requirements that are applicable to the system level design of all types of machinery safety-related electrical control systems and also for the design of non-complex subsystems or devices.\n\n==Testing software==\nSoftware written in accordance with IEC 61508 may need to be [[Unit testing|unit tested]], depending up on the SIL level it needs to achieve. The main requirement in Unit Testing is to ensure that the software is fully tested at the function level and that all possible branches and paths are taken through the software. In some higher [[Safety Integrity Level|SIL level]] applications, the software code coverage requirement is much tougher and an [[Modified Condition/Decision Coverage|MC/DC code coverage]] criterion is used rather than simple branch coverage. To obtain the MC/DC (modified condition/decision coverage) coverage information, one will need a Unit Testing tool, sometimes referred to as a Software Module Testing tool.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Functional safety]]\n* [[Safety standards]]\n* [[FMEDA]]\n* [[Spurious trip level]]\n* [[Time-triggered system]] (A software architecture used to achieve IEC 61508 compliance)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Textbooks ===\n* W.

Successive bishops retained right of [[free warren]] and other manorial privileges into the 19th century.\n\nSeale's medieval [[parish church]] and [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] served equally [[Tongham]] to the north until 1866, however much of the land was owned by the [[Bishop of Winchester]] who owned much of far-west Surrey since the early holder of that position [[Henry of Blois|Henry (of Blois) or Winchester]], who used his power and status to build [[Farnham Castle]].\n\nThe manor farm, evidencing this, were tenants of the Bishops of Winchester \"for three lives\" from 1839 (although they sold this interest in 1856).<ref>[http://www5.surreycc.gov.uk/surrey/surreyhomepage.htm Surrey County Council history pages]</ref>\n\nFrom the [[Tudor period]], as evidenced by memorials in Seale church, the main landowner was the Woodroffe family (of whom two, David and Nicholas, father and son, were [[List of Sheriffs of London#16th century|Sheriffs of London]] in 1554 and 1573 respectively), and later, by descent through a female line, the Chester family. They were seated at Poyle, [[Tongham]], on the other side of the Hog's Back, which was originally part of the parish of Seale; their landholdings also extended south of the Hog's Back into what remained of the parish of Seale after Tongham was split off into a separate parish in 1866. As late as 1899, Henry Chester objected to being asked to give up his pew in Seale Church when a new plan was circulated by the churchwardens. The mansion at Poyle Park is now demolished and its lands subdivided in the twentieth century \u2013 an interior from Poyle Park is on display in the [[Museum of London]].\n\nHampton Lodge (below) was originally a hunting lodge, occupied by the wealthy Long family. In the 19th century, it passed through a female line into the hands of a branch of the Howard family of the Dukes of Norfolk (and Earls of Surrey) who took up residence and enlarged their estate by acquisition until it became, from about 1918, the largest landholding in the parish of Seale. The Hampton Estate was sold by the Howard family to the Thornton family in 1929 and remains in the hands of their descendants.\n\n'Wood' Lane, which runs from the nucleus of Seale up to the top of the Hog's Back, shares its name with that of the family who leased Seale Manor Farm.\n\n==Amenities==\n\n===Village hall===\nA village hall provides regular events, near the old school and hosts parish council meetings.\n\n===Church===\n[[File:Seale Church, Surrey.JPG|thumb|St Laurence's church]]\n{{see also|List of places of worship in Guildford (borough)}}\nThe church was established in the 12th century as an outpost of [[Waverley Abbey]]. The bell tower houses a peal of six bells, the oldest and largest cast in the 16th century. The church was extensively restored and enlarged in about 1860.  It is served by a Rector, who now also has care of the adjacent parishes of [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]] and [[Wanborough, Surrey|Wanborough]].  These three parishes were formally merged in 2004, although they retain their separate places of worship.

The Hampton Estate was acquired by Eustace Thornton in 1929.  He was succeeded by his son, Sir Richard Thornton, [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]], [[OBE]], [[Lord Lieutenant of Surrey]] 1986\u20131997 and then by Sir Richard's daughter and son-in-law, Bridget and Bill Biddell.\n\n===Heathersett, Littleworth and park gardens===\nThe 1873, [[rubble masonry|rubblestone]] built, [[stucco|stone dressed]], Grade II [[listed building]] in its listed park in the far south known as Heathersett, Littleworth has been attributed to R. Norman, architect.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1294453|accessdate=10 November 2013}}</ref> The listed park is due to its later designer, [[Gertrude Jekyll]]. James Mangles, who lived at Valewood, Haslemere, was one of the earliest rhododendron collectors and hybridisers. When James died in 1884, most of his plant collection was brought to Littleworth Cross and Harry continued hybridising and exhibiting rhododendrons, with the help of his sister Clara. Gertrude Jekyll (1843\u20131932), who lived nearby at Munstead, knew the Mangles family and was visiting one afternoon in May 1889 when she was introduced to a young architect, Edwin Lutyens (1869\u20131944) who was designing a gardener's cottage and some garden buildings for Harry Mangles. The meeting was important for both Lutyens and Jekyll: she discovered someone with a similar love of the vernacular architecture of south-west Surrey, who would design her new home, Munstead Wood (qv), and through her, he was introduced to many potential clients. Lutyens and Jekyll began a collaboration of building and garden design that would last until her death in 1932.\n\n;Former landmarks\nSeale Lodge, built in ornate style with surrounding landholdings fell into dilapidation and was demolished {{abbreviation|c.|circa (about)}} 1970.\n\nThe village school has closed and been converted into a private house.\n\n==Transport==\nThe village is well connected by roads but not rail and had approximately 50% of its working population recorded in 2011 as commuting 20\u201340&nbsp;km, living in the rural outer [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] yet commuting to major employment areas such as London, [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]] and [[Aldershot]].<ref name=ons/>\n\nSpecific long-distance roads are the [[A31 road|A31]] and the [[A331 road]]s (the Blackwater Valley Route) dual carriageway; along the entire northern border and {{convert|1|mi}} north-west, respectively.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Seale Chalk Pit]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes \n{{Reflist|group=n}}  \n;References\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anonymous ''The Church of St. Laurence Seale: A Short Guide and History'' [Published by the church]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Seale, Surrey}}\n*[http://www.spw.org.uk/ village website] Run by Seale and Sands Parish Council\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080101083656/http://www.hamptonestate.co.uk/home.html Hampton Estate website]\n*[http://www.francisfrith.com/search/england/surrey/seale/photos/seale_photos.htm Francis Frith]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} historic photographs of Seale\n*[https://flickr.com/photos/34742677@N00/481169011/ Photograph of Seale church and churchyard]\n*[http://www.stainedglassrecords.org/Ch.asp?ChId=19800 Stained Glass Windows at Stained Glass Records: St. Laurence Seale, Surrey]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title     = '''Nearest Settlements'''\n|Centre    = Seale\n|North     = [[Tongham]]<br>[[Ash Green, Surrey|Ash Green]]\n|Northeast = [[Wanborough, Surrey|Wanborough]]\n|East      = [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]]\n|Southeast = [[Shackleford]]\n|South     = [[Elstead]] \n|Southwest = [[Puttenham & Crooksbury Commons]]<br>[[Tilford]]\n|West      = [[Runfold]]\n|Northwest = [[Aldershot]]\n}}\n\n{{Guildford}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Borough of Guildford]]\n[[Category:Villages in Surrey]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{infobox UK place \n|type = [[Village]]\n|country = England\n|coordinates = {{coord|51.221|-0.663|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name= Seale\n|map_type= Surrey  \n|civil_parish= [[Seale and Sands]]\n|static_image_name=Seale village sign, Surrey.jpg\n|static_image_caption=Village sign\n|static_image_2_name=\n|static_image_2_caption=\n| population = 907\n| population_ref =(2001 Civil Parish Census)<ref name=ons>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk Key Statistics; Quick Statistics: Population Density] [[United Kingdom Census 2011]] ''[[Office for National Statistics]]'' Retrieved 6 November 2013</ref>\n |shire_district= [[Guildford (district)|Guildford]]\n|shire_county = [[Surrey]]\n|region= South East England\n|constituency_westminster=  [[Guildford (UK Parliament constituency)|Guildford]]\n|post_town= [[Farnham]]\n|postcode_district = GU10       \n|postcode_area= GU\n|dial_code= 01252\n|os_grid_reference=SU8947\n}}\n \n'''Seale''' is a village in [[Surrey]], England.

Successive bishops retained right of [[free warren]] and other manorial privileges into the 19th century.\n\nSeale's medieval [[parish church]] and [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] served equally [[Tongham]] to the north until 1866, however much of the land was owned by the [[Bishop of Winchester]] who owned much of far-west Surrey since the early holder of that position [[Henry of Blois|Henry (of Blois) or Winchester]], who used his power and status to build [[Farnham Castle]].\n\nThe manor farm, evidencing this, were tenants of the Bishops of Winchester \"for three lives\" from 1839 (although they sold this interest in 1856).<ref>[http://www5.surreycc.gov.uk/surrey/surreyhomepage.htm Surrey County Council history pages]</ref>\n\nFrom the [[Tudor period]], as evidenced by memorials in Seale church, the main landowner was the Woodroffe family (of whom two, David and Nicholas, father and son, were [[List of Sheriffs of London#16th century|Sheriffs of London]] in 1554 and 1573 respectively), and later, by descent through a female line, the Chester family. They were seated at Poyle, [[Tongham]], on the other side of the Hog's Back, which was originally part of the parish of Seale; their landholdings also extended south of the Hog's Back into what remained of the parish of Seale after Tongham was split off into a separate parish in 1866. As late as 1899, Henry Chester objected to being asked to give up his pew in Seale Church when a new plan was circulated by the churchwardens. The mansion at Poyle Park is now demolished and its lands subdivided in the twentieth century \u2013 an interior from Poyle Park is on display in the [[Museum of London]].\n\nHampton Lodge (below) was originally a hunting lodge, occupied by the wealthy Long family. In the 19th century, it passed through a female line into the hands of a branch of the Howard family of the Dukes of Norfolk (and Earls of Surrey) who took up residence and enlarged their estate by acquisition until it became, from about 1918, the largest landholding in the parish of Seale. The Hampton Estate was sold by the Howard family to the Thornton family in 1929 and remains in the hands of their descendants.\n\n'Wood' Lane, which runs from the nucleus of Seale up to the top of the Hog's Back, shares its name with that of the family who leased Seale Manor Farm.\n\n==Amenities==\n\n===Village hall===\nA village hall provides regular events, near the old school and hosts parish council meetings.\n\n===Church===\n[[File:Seale Church, Surrey.JPG|thumb|St Lawrence church]]\n{{see also|List of places of worship in Guildford (borough)}}\nThe church was established in the 12th century as an outpost of [[Waverley Abbey]]. The bell tower houses a peal of six bells, the oldest and largest cast in the 16th century. The church was extensively restored and enlarged in about 1860.  It is served by a Rector, who now also has care of the adjacent parishes of [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]] and [[Wanborough, Surrey|Wanborough]].  These three parishes were formally merged in 2004, although they retain their separate places of worship.  [[Tongham]] was originally part of the parish of Seale, but it became an independent parish in 1866.<ref>[http://www.achurchnearyou.com/seale-st-laurence/ St Lawrence's, Seale] The [[Church of England]] Retrieved 10 November 2013</ref>\n\n===Golf course===\nIn the west of the parish, associated with The Sands which is immediately south-east of it, is Farnham Golf Club.

The Hampton Estate was acquired by Eustace Thornton in 1929.  He was succeeded by his son, Sir Richard Thornton, [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]], [[OBE]], [[Lord Lieutenant of Surrey]] 1986\u20131997 and then by Sir Richard's daughter and son-in-law, Bridget and Bill Biddell.\n\n===Heathersett, Littleworth and park gardens===\nThe 1873, [[rubble masonry|rubblestone]] built, [[stucco|stone dressed]], Grade II [[listed building]] in its listed park in the far south known as Heathersett, Littleworth has been attributed to R. Norman, architect.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1294453|accessdate=10 November 2013}}</ref> The listed park is due to its later designer, [[Gertrude Jekyll]]. James Mangles, who lived at Valewood, Haslemere, was one of the earliest rhododendron collectors and hybridisers. When James died in 1884, most of his plant collection was brought to Littleworth Cross and Harry continued hybridising and exhibiting rhododendrons, with the help of his sister Clara. Gertrude Jekyll (1843\u20131932), who lived nearby at Munstead, knew the Mangles family and was visiting one afternoon in May 1889 when she was introduced to a young architect, Edwin Lutyens (1869\u20131944) who was designing a gardener's cottage and some garden buildings for Harry Mangles. The meeting was important for both Lutyens and Jekyll: she discovered someone with a similar love of the vernacular architecture of south-west Surrey, who would design her new home, Munstead Wood (qv), and through her, he was introduced to many potential clients. Lutyens and Jekyll began a collaboration of building and garden design that would last until her death in 1932.\n\n;Former landmarks\nSeale Lodge, built in ornate style with surrounding landholdings fell into dilapidation and was demolished {{abbreviation|c.|circa (about)}} 1970.\n\nThe village school has closed and been converted into a private house.\n\n==Transport==\nThe village is well connected by roads but not rail and had approximately 50% of its working population recorded in 2011 as commuting 20\u201340&nbsp;km, living in the rural outer [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] yet commuting to major employment areas such as London, [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]] and [[Aldershot]].<ref name=ons/>\n\nSpecific long-distance roads are the [[A31 road|A31]] and the [[A331 road]]s (the Blackwater Valley Route) dual carriageway; along the entire northern border and {{convert|1|mi}} north-west, respectively.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Seale Chalk Pit]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes \n{{Reflist|group=n}}  \n;References\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anonymous ''The Church of St. Laurence Seale: A Short Guide and History'' [Published by the church]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Seale, Surrey}}\n*[http://www.spw.org.uk/ village website] Run by Seale and Sands Parish Council\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080101083656/http://www.hamptonestate.co.uk/home.html Hampton Estate website]\n*[http://www.francisfrith.com/search/england/surrey/seale/photos/seale_photos.htm Francis Frith]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} historic photographs of Seale\n*[https://flickr.com/photos/34742677@N00/481169011/ Photograph of Seale church and churchyard]\n*[http://www.stainedglassrecords.org/Ch.asp?ChId=19800 Stained Glass Windows at Stained Glass Records: St. Lawrence Seale, Surrey]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title     = '''Nearest Settlements'''\n|Centre    = Seale\n|North     = [[Tongham]]<br>[[Ash Green, Surrey|Ash Green]]\n|Northeast = [[Wanborough, Surrey|Wanborough]]\n|East      = [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]]\n|Southeast = [[Shackleford]]\n|South     = [[Elstead]] \n|Southwest = [[Puttenham & Crooksbury Commons]]<br>[[Tilford]]\n|West      = [[Runfold]]\n|Northwest = [[Aldershot]]\n}}\n\n{{Guildford}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Borough of Guildford]]\n[[Category:Villages in Surrey]]\n", "name_user": "Tdls", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling of St Laurence.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seale,_Surrey"}

It is the only [[system of measurement]] with an official status in nearly every country in the world. It comprises a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] system of [[units of measurement]] starting with seven [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, which are the [[second]] (the unit of [[time]] with the symbol s), [[metre]] ([[length]], m), [[kilogram]] ([[mass]], kg), [[ampere]] ([[electric current]], A), [[kelvin]] ([[thermodynamic temperature]], K), [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ([[amount of substance]], mol), and [[candela]] ([[luminous intensity]], cd). The system allows for an unlimited number of additional units, called [[SI derived unit|derived units]], which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units.<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the SI unit of [[velocity]] is the metre per second, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>; of [[acceleration]] is the metre per second squared, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; etc.</ref> Twenty-two derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.<ref group=\"Note\">For example the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the unit of [[force]], equivalent to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; the [[joule]] (J), the unit of [[energy]], equivalent to kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>, etc. The most recently named derived unit, the [[katal]], was defined in 1999.</ref> The seven base units and the 22 derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other derived units,<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the recommended unit for the [[Electric field|electric field strength]] is the volt per metre, V/m, where the [[volt]] is the derived unit for [[Voltage|electric potential difference]]. The volt per metre is equal to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22123</sup>\u22c5A<sup>\u22121</sup> when expressed in terms of base units.</ref> which are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities. The SI system also provides twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying power-of-ten (i.e. decimal) multiples and sub-multiples of SI units. The SI is intended to be an evolving system; units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of [[measurement]] progresses and the precision of measurements improves. \n\nSince 2019, the magnitudes of all SI units have been defined by declaring exact numerical values for seven ''defining constants'' when expressed in terms of their SI units. These defining constants are the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, {{Math|''c''}}, the [[Caesium standard|hyperfine transition frequency of caesium]] {{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}, the [[Planck constant]] {{Math|''h''}}, the [[elementary charge]] {{Math|''e''}}, the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{Math|''k''}}, the [[Avogadro constant]] {{Math|''N''}}<sub>A</sub>, and the [[luminous efficacy]] {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}. The nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as {{Math|''c''}} to the purely technical constant {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}. Prior to 2019, {{math|''h''}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''N''{{sub|A}}}} were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019, their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time, ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. One consequence of the redefinition of the SI is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed, since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants.\n\nThe current way of defining the SI system is a result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the\n[[Realisation (metrology)|realisations]] of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions. A consequence is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the unit.  One problem with artefacts is that they can be lost, damaged, or changed; another is that they introduce uncertainties that cannot be reduced by advancements in science and technology. The last artefact used by the SI was the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]], a cylinder of [[Platinum-iridium alloy|platinum-iridium]].\n \nThe original motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [[centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second]] (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of [[electrostatic units]] and [[electromagnetic units]]) and the lack of coordination between the various [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]s that used them. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures}}'' \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nThe International System of Units, the SI,<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\">{{SIbrochure9th}}</ref>{{rp|123|quote=\u2026 since its establishment in 1960, the International System of Units has always been referred to as \u2018the SI\u2019 in its shortened form.}} is a decimal{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Meaning that different units for a given quantity, such as length, are related by factors of 10.

But if one wishes to talk about driving distances using the SI units, one will normally use kilometres, where one kilometre is 1000 metres.

As a [[system of units]]\u00a0with an [[Metrication|official status]] in most countries,{{refn|group=\"Note\"|This is so even in some countries that, to various degrees, continue to resist [[metrication|the adoption of the SI system]], notably [[Metrication in the United States|including the United States]] and [[Metrication in the United Kingdom|also the United Kingdom]].

Both of these categories of units are also often legally pegged to SI units.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|See e.g. [[catty|here]] for the various definitions of the catty, a traditional Chinese unit of mass, in various places across East and Southeast Asia. Similarly, see [[Japanese units of measurement|this article on the traditional Japanese units of measurement]], as well as [[Indian units of measurement|this one on the traditional Indian units of measurement]].}}\n\n===Controlling body===\n\nThe ultimate authority over the SI rests with the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM{{refn|name=\"French CGPM\"|group=\"Note\"|From [[French language|French]]: ''Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures''}}), although, in practice, the CGPM follows the recommendations of the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), which is the actual body conducting technical deliberations concerning new scientific and technological developments related to the definition of units and the SI.

When that prefactor is one, the unit is called a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|''coherent'']] derived unit.<ref group=\"Note\">Here are some examples of coherent derived SI units: of [[velocity]], the [[metre per second]], m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>; of [[acceleration]], the [[metre per second squared]], m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; etc.</ref> The base and coherent derived units of the SI together form a coherent system of units called ''the set of coherent SI units''.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|A useful property of a coherent system is that when the numerical values of physical quantities are expressed in terms of the units of the system, then the equations between the numerical values have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the physical quantities;<ref name=\"ISO8000-1\">{{cite ISO standard|csnumber=30669|title=ISO 80000-1:2009 Quantities and units \u2014 Part 1: General}}</ref>{{rp|6}} An example may be useful to clarify this.

Namely, the SI provides twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying power-of-ten (i.e. decimal) multiples and sub-multiples of SI units, ranging from 10<sup>\u221224</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup>.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|143\u20134}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Many of the prefixes predate the creation of the SI. The earliest ones were introduced in French in 1795, at the institution of the metric system, and include ''milli-'' (1/1000), ''centi-'' (1/100), ''deci-'' (1/10), ''deca-'' (10), ''hecto-'' (100) and ''kilo-'' (1000). In fact, ''milli-'' and ''centi-'', at least, had appeared in scientific literature in 1793.<ref name=\"OEDmilli\">{{Cite OED|milli|id=118531}}</ref><ref name=\"OEDcenti\">{{Cite OED|centi|id=29650}}</ref>}}\n\nFor example, while the coherent unit of length is the metre,{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The SI base units (like the metre) are also called ''coherent units'', because they belong to the ''set of coherent SI units''.}} the SI provides a full range of smaller and larger units of length, any of which may turn out to be more convenient for any given application. So, driving distances are normally given not in metres but in [[kilometre]]s (symbol {{val|u=km}}). Here the prefix '[[kilo-]]' (symbol 'k') stands for a factor of 1000; thus, one kilometre ({{val|1|u=km}}) is {{val|1000|u=m}}. On the other hand, [[tailor|tailor's]] measurements are more conveniently expressed in [[centimetre]]s (symbol {{val|u=cm}}); the prefix '[[centi-]]' (symbol 'c') stands for a factor of 1/100={{val|0.01}}, so that one centimetre ({{val|1|u=cm}}) is {{val|0.01|u=m}}. \n\nThe grouping formed by a prefix symbol attached to a unit symbol{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The only limitation is that the unit symbol must be either a symbol for one of the seven base units or for one of the 22 derived units with special names and symbols.}} (e.g. '{{val|u=km}}', '{{val|u=cm}}') constitutes a new inseparable unit symbol. This new symbol can be raised to a positive or negative power and can be combined with other unit symbols to form compound unit symbols.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|143}} For example, {{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=km}}{{sup|2}}/{{val|u=s}}{{sup|2}} is an SI unit of enenrgy, where {{val|u=km}}{{sup|2}} should be interpreted as ({{val|u=km}}){{sup|2}}. \n\nAs a consequence of all this, the conversion of units within the SI is always through a power of ten;{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Note, however, that there is a special group of units that are called '[[Non-SI units accepted for use with SI|non-SI units that are accepted for use with the SI]]'.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|145}} Most of these, in order to be converted to the corresponding SI unit, require conversion factors that are not powers of ten.<br> Some common examples of such units are the customary units of time, namely the minute (conversion factor of 60, since 1 min {{=}} {{val|60|u=s}}), the hour ({{val|3600|u=s}}), and the day ({{val|86400|u=s}}); the degree (for measuring plane angles, {{nowrap|{{val|1|u=deg}} {{=}} {{sfrac|{{math|''\u03c0''}}|180}} {{val||u=rad}});}} and the [[electronvolt]] (a unit of energy, {{nowrap|{{val|1|u=eV}} {{=}} {{val|1.602176634e-19|u=J}}).}}}} this is why the SI system (and metric systems more generally) are called ''decimal systems of measurement units''.<ref name=\"DecimalSystem\">{{cite web |url=https://usma.org/decimal-nature-of-the-metric-system |title=Decimal Nature of the Metric System |publisher=[[US Metric Association]] |year=2015 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200415225727/https://usma.org/decimal-nature-of-the-metric-system/ |archive-date=15 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Coherent and non-coherent SI units====\nWhen prefixes are used with the coherent SI units, the resulting units are no longer coherent, because the prefix introduces a numerical factor other than one.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|137}} The one exception is the kilogram, the only coherent SI unit whose name and symbol, for historical reasons, include a prefix.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Names and symbols for decimal multiples and sub-multiples of the unit of mass are formed as if it is the [[gram]] which is the base unit, i.e. by attaching prefix names and symbols, respectively, to the unit name \u201cgram\u201d and the unit symbol \u201cg\u201d.

For example, the joule per kelvin is the coherent SI unit for two distinct quantities: [[heat capacity]] and [[entropy]]. Furthermore, the same coherent SI unit may be a base unit in one context, but a coherent derived unit in another. For example, the ampere is the coherent SI unit for both [[electric current]] and [[magnetomotive force]], but it is a base unit in the former case and a derived unit in the latter.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|140}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|As perhaps a more familiar example, consider rainfall, defined as volume of rain (measured in {{val|u=m3}}) that fell per unit area (measured in {{val|u=m2}}).

For example, one of these defining constants is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, {{Math|''c''}}, which in the SI by definition has the exact value of {{Math|''c''}} = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}. The other six are <math>\\Delta\\nu_\\text{Cs}</math>,  the [[Caesium standard|hyperfine transition frequency of caesium]]; {{Math|''h''}}, the [[Planck constant]]; {{Math|''e''}}, the [[elementary charge]]; {{Math|''k''}}, the [[Boltzmann constant]]; {{Math|''N''}}<sub>A</sub>, the [[Avogadro constant]]; and {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}, the [[luminous efficacy]] of monochromatic radiation of frequency {{val|540e12|u=Hz}}.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|{{nowrap|Their exactly defined values are as follows:<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>\\Delta\\nu_\\text{Cs}</math> {{=}} {{val|9192631770|u=Hz}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>c</math> {{=}} {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>h</math> {{=}} {{val|6.62607015e-34|u=J.s}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>e</math> {{=}} {{val|1.602176634e-19|u=C}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>k</math> {{=}} {{val|1.380649e-23|u=J/K}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>N_{\\text{A}}</math> {{=}} {{val|6.02214076e23|u=mol-1}}}}<br>\n{{nowrap|<math>K_{\\text{cd}}</math> {{=}} {{val|683|u=lm/W}}.}}}} \n\nEach defining constant can be taken as defining the magnitude of that defining constant's unit of measurement;<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128}} for example, the definition of {{Math|''c''}} defines the unit {{val|u=m/s}} as {{val|1|u=m/s}} = {{sfrac|{{math|''c''}}|{{val|299792458}}}}. In this way, the defining constants directly define the [[hertz]] ({{val|u=Hz}}), [[metre per second]] ({{val|u=m/s}}), [[joule-second]] ({{val|u=J.s}}), [[coulomb]] ({{val|u=C}}), [[Joule per Kelvin|joule per kelvin]] ({{val|u=J/K}}), the inverse [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ({{val|u=mol-1}}), and [[lumen (unit)|lumen]] per [[watt]] ({{val|u=lm/W}}).  Further, one can show, using [[dimensional analysis]], that every coherent SI unit (whether base or derived) can be written as a unique product of powers of the units of the defining constants. Therefore, purely ''mathematically'' speaking, the SI units are defined ''as if'' we declared that it is the defining constant's units that are now the base units, with all other SI units being derived units. For example, since {{sfrac|{{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}|{{val|9192631770}}}} = {{val|1|u=Hz}}, {{sfrac|{{math|''c''}}|{{val|299792458}}}} = {{val|1|u=m/s}}, and {{sfrac|{{math|''h''}}|{{val|6.62607015e-34}}}} = {{val|1|u=J.s}}, the three defining constants {{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}, {{math|''c''}}, and {{math|''h''}} define the kilogram because, on the one hand, they respectively define the units {{val|u=Hz}}, {{val|u=m/s}}, and {{val|u=J.s}}, while, on the other hand, the kilogram can be written in terms of these three units, namely, {{nowrap|1={{val|1|u=kg}} = ({{val|1|u=Hz}})({{val|1|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|1|u=J.s}}).}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|To see this, recall that {{nowrap|{{val|u=Hz}} {{=}} {{val|u=s-1}}}} and {{nowrap|{{val|u=J}} {{=}} {{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=m}}{{sup|2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}{{sup|-2}}.}} Thus {{nowrap|({{val|u=Hz}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=J.s}}) {{=}} ({{val|u=s-1}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=m}}{{sup|2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}{{sup|-2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}) {{=}} {{val|u=kg}},}} since all the powers of metres and seconds cancel out. It can further be shown that ({{val|u=Hz}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=J.s}}) is the ''only'' combination of powers of the units of the defining constants (that is, the only combination of powers of {{val|u=Hz}}, {{val|u=m/s}}, {{val|u=J.s}}, {{val|u=C}}, {{val|u=J/K}}, {{val|u=mol-1}}, and {{val|u=lm/W}}) that results in the kilogram.}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The SI Brochure prefers to write the relationship between the kilogram and the defining constants directly, without going through the intermediary step of defining {{val|1|u=Hz}}, {{val|1|u=m/s}}, and {{val|1|u=J.s}}, like this:<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|131}} {{nowrap|{{val|1|u=kg}} {{=}} {{sfrac|({{val|299792458}}){{sup|2}}|({{val|6.62607015e-34}})({{val|9192631770}})}}{{sfrac|{{math|''h''}}&thinsp;{{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}|{{math|''c''}}{{sup|2}}}}.}}}} \n\nThe nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as {{Math|''c''}} to the purely technical constant {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128\u20139}}. Prior to 2019, {{math|''h''}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''N''{{sub|A}}}} were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019, their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time, ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. \n\nOne consequence of the redefinition of the SI is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed, since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants. Nevertheless, the distinction is retained because 'it is useful and historically well established', and also because the [[ISO/IEC 80000]] series of standards{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Which define the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ).}} specifies base and derived quantities that necessarily have the corresponding SI units.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|129}}\n\n===Specifying fundamental constants vs. other methods of definition===\nThe current way of defining the SI system is the result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the\n[[Realisation (metrology)|realisations]] of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|126}} \n\nThe great advantage of doing it this way is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the units.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The sole exception is the definition of the second, which is still given not in terms of fixed values of fundamental constants but in terms of a particular property of a particular naturally occurring object, the caesium atom.

The last artefact used by the SI was the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (IPK), a particular cylinder of [[Platinum-iridium alloy|platinum-iridium]]; from 1889 to 2019, the kilogram was by definition equal to the mass of the IPK. Concerns [[International_Prototype_of_the_Kilogram#Stability_of_the_IPK|regarding its stability]] on the one hand, and  [[Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram|progress in precise measurements of the Planck constant and the Avogadro constant]] on the other, led to a [[2019 redefinition of SI base units|revision of the definition of the base units]], put into effect on 20 May 2019.<ref name=\"NIST 2018-11\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/11/historic-vote-ties-kilogram-and-other-units-natural-constants|title=Historic Vote Ties Kilogram and Other Units to Natural Constants|last=Materese|first=Robin|date=2018-11-16|work=NIST|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> The biggest change in the SI system since it was first formally defined and established in 1960, it resulted in the definitions described above. \n\nIn the past, there were also various other approaches to the definitions of some of the SI units. One made use of a specific physical state of a specific substance (the [[Kelvin#History|triple point of water]], which was used in the definition of the kelvin<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|113-4}}); others referred to idealised experimental prescriptions<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|125}} (as in the case of the ampere<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|113}} and the candela<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|115}}). \n\nIn the future, the set of defining constants used by the SI may be modified as more stable constants are found, or if it turns out that other constants can be more precisely measured.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|As mentioned above, it is all but certain that the defining constant <math>\\Delta\\nu_\\text{Cs}</math> will have to be replaced relatively soon, as it is becoming increasingly clear that atoms other than caesium can provide more precise time standards. However, it is not excluded that some of the other defining constants would eventually have to be replaced as well. For example. the elementary charge {{Math|''e''}} corresponds to the coupling strength of the electromagnetic force via the [[fine-structure constant]] <math>\\alpha</math>, which some theories predict to vary over time. True, the presently known experimental limits of the maximum possible variation of <math>\\alpha</math> are so low that 'any effect on foreseeable practical measurements can be excluded',<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128}} even if one of these theories turns out to be correct. Nevertheless, if the fine-structure constant turns out to slightly vary over time, science and technology may in the future advance to a point where such changes become measurable. At that point, one might consider replacing, for the purposes of defining the SI system, the elementary charge with some other quantity, the choice of which will be informed by what we learn about the time variation of <math>\\alpha</math>.}}\n\n===History===\nThe original motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [[centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second]] (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of [[electrostatic units]] and [[electromagnetic units]]) and the lack of coordination between the various [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]s that used them. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures}}'' \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS.\n\n==Controlling authority==\nThe SI is controlled and regulated by three international organizations that were established in 1875 under the terms of the [[Metre Convention]]: the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM{{refn|name=\"French CGPM\"|group=\"Note\"}}), the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM{{refn|name=\"French CIPM\"|group=\"Note\"}}), and the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM{{refn|name=\"BIPM from French\"|group=\"Note\"}}).

All of these are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, ''kilo-'' denotes a multiple of a thousand and ''milli-'' denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a ''micrometre'', not a millimillimetre.

This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp |134}} and the symbol for degrees Celsius (\u00b0C).<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|133}} Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (\u00b0,&nbsp;&prime;, and&nbsp;&Prime;), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.\n* Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.\n* A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to a unit symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz, \u03bc in \u03bcg). Compound prefixes are not allowed. A prefixed unit is atomic in expressions (e.g., km<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to (km)<sup>2</sup>).\n* Unit symbols are written using roman (upright) type, regardless of the type used in the surrounding text.\n* Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a [[dot operator|centre dot]] (\u22c5) or a non-breaking space; e.g., N\u22c5m or N&nbsp;m.\n* Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (/), or given as a negative [[exponent]]. E.g., the \"metre per second\" can be written m/s, m&nbsp;s<sup>\u22121</sup>, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>, or {{sfrac|m|s}}. A solidus must not be used more than once in a given expression without parentheses to remove ambiguities; e.g., kg/(m\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>) and kg\u22c5m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup> are acceptable, but kg/m/s<sup>2</sup> is ambiguous and unacceptable.\n[[File:981ms2.png|thumb|In the expression of acceleration due to gravity, a space separates the value and the units, both the 'm' and the 's' are lowercase because neither the metre nor the second are named after people, and exponentiation is represented with a [[superscript]] '2'.]]\n* The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in [[upper case]]; otherwise, they are written in [[lower case]]. E.g., the unit of [[pressure]] is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], so its symbol is written \"Pa\", but the symbol for mole is written \"mol\". Thus, \"T\" is the symbol for [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a measure of [[magnetic field strength]], and \"t\" the symbol for [[tonne]], a measure of [[mass]]. Since 1979, the [[litre]] may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase \"L\" or a lowercase \"l\", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter \"l\" to the numeral \"1\", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States \"L\" be used rather than \"l\".\n* Symbols do not have a plural form, e.g., 25&nbsp;kg, but not 25&nbsp;{{Not a typo|kgs}}.\n* Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the quantities 1&nbsp;mW and 1&nbsp;MW represent two different quantities (milliwatt and megawatt).\n* The symbol for the [[decimal marker]] is either a [[full stop|point]] or [[comma]] on the line. In practice, the decimal point is used in most English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of [[Latin America]] and in continental [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=March\u2013April 2008 |title=Period or Comma?

Independently, in 1743, the French physicist [[Jean-Pierre Christin]] described a scale with 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 the boiling point.

Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin, and candela.\n\nThe 9th CGPM also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/7/ |title=Resolution 7 of the 9th meeting of the CGPM (1948): Writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers |access-date=2012-11-06 |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}</ref> These rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit symbols and names, prefix symbols and names, how quantity symbols should be written and used, and how the values of quantities should be expressed.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|104,130}}\n\n===Birth of the SI===\nIn 1960, the 11th CGPM synthesised the results of the 12-year study into a set of 16 resolutions.

[[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]] later identified the need for an electrical base unit, for which the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity) were added later.\n\nThe early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit, while the SI defines an analogous unit of mass. In everyday use, these are mostly interchangeable, but in scientific contexts the difference matters. Mass, strictly the inertial mass, represents a quantity of matter. It relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]], {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''m'' \u00d7 ''a''}}: force equals mass times acceleration. A force of 1&nbsp;N (newton) applied to a mass of 1&nbsp;kg will accelerate it at 1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>. This is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e.g. at the Earth's surface. Weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field, and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight of a 1&nbsp;kg mass at the Earth's surface is {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''g''}}; mass times the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81&nbsp;newtons at the Earth's surface and is about 3.5&nbsp;newtons at the surface of Mars. Since the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies by location and altitude on the Earth, weight is unsuitable for precision measurements of a property of a body, and this makes a unit of weight unsuitable as a base unit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ <big>SI base units</big><ref name=\"NIST330\"/>{{rp|6}}<ref name=\"BIPM1975\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://archive.org/details/internationalbur420page |pages=[https://archive.org/details/internationalbur420page/page/238 238]\u2013244 |title=The International Bureau of Weights and Measures 1875\u20131975: NBS Special Publication 420 |date=1975-05-20 |editor-last1=Page |editor-first1=Chester H. |editor-last2=Vigoureux |editor-first2=Paul |publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}</ref>\n|-\n!Unit<br />name\n!Definition<ref group=\"n\">Interim definitions are given here only when there has been a ''significant'' difference in the definition.</ref> \n|-\n![[second]]\n|\n*'''Prior''': (1675) {{sfrac|1|{{val|86400}}}} of a day of 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds.<sup>TLB</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1956): {{sfrac|{{val|31556925.9747}}}} of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].\n*'''Current''' (1967): The duration of {{val|9192631770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] levels of the [[ground state]] of the [[caesium-133]] atom.\n|-\n![[metre]]\n|\n*'''Prior''' (1793): {{sfrac|{{val|10000000}}}} of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] through Paris between the North Pole and the Equator.<sup>FG</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1889): The Prototype of the metre chosen by the CIPM, at the temperature of melting ice, represents the metric unit of length.\n*'''Interim''' (1960): {{val|1650763.73}} [[wavelength]]s in a [[vacuum]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] corresponding to the transition between the 2p{{sup|10}} and 5d{{sup|5}} quantum levels of the [[krypton-86]] [[atom]].\n*'''Current''' (1983): The distance travelled by light in vacuum in {{sfrac|{{val|299792458}}}} second.\n|-\n![[kilogram]]\n|\n*'''Prior''' (1793): The '''[[grave (unit)|grave]]''' was defined as being the mass (then called ''weight'') of one litre of pure water at its freezing point.<sup>FG</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1889): The mass of a small squat cylinder of \u224847 cubic centimetres of platinum-iridium alloy kept in the Pavillon de Breteuil{{citation needed|reason=Though this is the location of the BIPM in Saint-Cloud, https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram-introduction indicates that [...] the IPK, which is kept by the [BIPM] in S\u00e8vres, France.

The second is a base unit in all of them. The metre is recognized in all of them, either as the base unit of length or as a decimal multiple of the base unit of length. However, not all metric systems recognize the gram or its decimal multiples. In particular, in [[gravitational metric system]]s, the base units are the units of time, length, and force, while mass uses a derived unit; the unit of force was taken to be the [[kilogram-force]], the [[Mass versus weight|weight]] of the standard kilogram under [[standard gravity]]. In some versions of that system, the unit of mass is defined as the mass that is accelerated by one unit of acceleration when acted upon by a net force of one unit force; in these versions, the unit of mass is not a decimal multiple of the gram, but rather, when expressed in kilograms, has the same numerical value as the standard gravity when the latter is expressed in the base units for length and time of the system. So for example, in one system, the coherent unit of mass was the [[Gravitational_metric_system#Mass|hyl]], while the base units of length and time were the metre and the second.

It is the only [[system of measurement]] with an official status in nearly every country in the world. It comprises a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] system of [[units of measurement]] starting with seven [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, which are the [[second]] (the unit of [[time]] with the symbol s), [[metre]] ([[length]], m), [[kilogram]] ([[mass]], kg), [[ampere]] ([[electric current]], A), [[kelvin]] ([[thermodynamic temperature]], K), [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ([[amount of substance]], mol), and [[candela]] ([[luminous intensity]], cd). The system allows for an unlimited number of additional units, called [[SI derived unit|derived units]], which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units.<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the SI unit of [[velocity]] is the metre per second, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>; of [[acceleration]] is the metre per second squared, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; etc.</ref> Twenty-two derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.<ref group=\"Note\">For example the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the unit of [[force]], equivalent to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; the [[joule]] (J), the unit of [[energy]], equivalent to kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>, etc. The most recently named derived unit, the [[katal]], was defined in 1999.</ref> The seven base units and the 22 derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other derived units,<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the recommended unit for the [[Electric field|electric field strength]] is the volt per metre, V/m, where the [[volt]] is the derived unit for [[Voltage|electric potential difference]]. The volt per metre is equal to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22123</sup>\u22c5A<sup>\u22121</sup> when expressed in terms of base units.</ref> which are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities. The SI system also provides twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying power-of-ten (i.e. decimal) multiples and sub-multiples of SI units. The SI is intended to be an evolving system; units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of [[measurement]] progresses and the precision of measurements improves. \n\nSince 2019, the magnitudes of all SI units have been defined by declaring exact numerical values for seven ''defining constants'' when expressed in terms of their SI units. These defining constants are the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, {{Math|''c''}}, the [[Caesium standard|hyperfine transition frequency of caesium]] {{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}, the [[Planck constant]] {{Math|''h''}}, the [[elementary charge]] {{Math|''e''}}, the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{Math|''k''}}, the [[Avogadro constant]] {{Math|''N''}}<sub>A</sub>, and the [[luminous efficacy]] {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}. The nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as {{Math|''c''}} to the purely technical constant {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}. Prior to 2019, {{math|''h''}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''N''{{sub|A}}}} were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019, their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time, ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. One consequence of the redefinition of the SI is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed, since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants.\n\nThe current way of defining the SI system is a result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the\n[[Realisation (metrology)|realisations]] of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions. A consequence is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the unit.  One problem with artefacts is that they can be lost, damaged, or changed; another is that they introduce uncertainties that cannot be reduced by advancements in science and technology. The last artefact used by the SI was the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]], a cylinder of [[Platinum-iridium alloy|platinum-iridium]].\n \nThe original motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [[centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second]] (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of [[electrostatic units]] and [[electromagnetic units]]) and the lack of coordination between the various [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]s that used them. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures}}'' \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nThe International System of Units, the SI,<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\">{{SIbrochure9th}}</ref>{{rp|123|quote=\u2026 since its establishment in 1960, the International System of Units has always been referred to as \u2018the SI\u2019 in its shortened form.}} is a decimal{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Meaning that different units for a given quantity, such as length, are related by factors of 10.

The CCU reports to  the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures#International Committee for Weights and Measures|International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM{{refn|name=\"French CIPM\"|group=\"Note\"|from {{lang-fr|Comit\u00e9 international des poids et mesures}}}}), which, in turn, reports to the CGPM. See [[International System of Units#Controlling authority|below]] for more details. \n\nAll the decisions and recommendations concerning units are collected in a brochure called [[International System of Units#SI_Brochure|''The International System of Units (SI)'']]<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{refn|name=\"SI Brochure short\"|group=\"Note\"|The ''SI Brochure'' for short.}}, which is published by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM{{refn|name=\"BIPM from French\"|group=\"Note\"|from {{lang-fr|Bureau international des poids et mesures}}}}) and periodically updated.\n\n===Overview of the units===\n\n====Base units====\nThe SI selects seven units to serve as [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, corresponding to seven base physical quantities.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The latter are formalised in the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ).<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|129|quote=[T]he ISO/IEC 80000 series of Standards specify base and derived quantities which necessarily correspond to the SI base and derived units.}}}} They are the [[second]], with the symbol {{val|u=s}}, which is the SI unit of the physical quantity of [[time]]; the [[metre]], symbol {{val|u=m}}, the SI unit of [[length]]; [[kilogram]] ({{val|u=m}}, the unit of [[mass]]); [[ampere]] ({{val|u=A}}, [[electric current]]); [[kelvin]] ({{val|u=K}}, [[thermodynamic temperature]]), [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ({{val|u=mol}}, [[amount of substance]]); and [[candela]] ({{val|u=cd}}, [[luminous intensity]]).<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/> Note that 'the choice of the base units was never unique, but grew historically and became familiar to users of the SI.'<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|126}}  All units in the SI can be expressed in terms of the base units, and the base units serve as a preferred set for expressing or analysing the relationships between units.\n\n====Derived units====\nThe system allows for an unlimited number of additional units,  called [[SI derived unit|''derived units'']], which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units, possibly with a nontrivial numerical prefactor. When that prefactor is one, the unit is called a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|''coherent'']] derived unit.<ref group=\"Note\">Here are some examples of coherent derived SI units: of [[velocity]], the [[metre per second]], m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>; of [[acceleration]], the [[metre per second squared]], m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>; etc.</ref> The base and coherent derived units of the SI together form a coherent system of units called ''the set of coherent SI units''.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|A useful property of a coherent system is that when the numerical values of physical quantities are expressed in terms of the units of the system, then the equations between the numerical values have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the physical quantities;<ref name=\"ISO8000-1\">{{cite ISO standard|csnumber=30669|title=ISO 80000-1:2009 Quantities and units \u2014 Part 1: General}}</ref>{{rp|6}} An example may be useful to clarify this. Suppose we are given an equation relating some [[Physical quantity|physical quantities]], e.g. <math>T=\\frac{1}{2}\\,m\\,v^{2}</math>, expressing the [[kinetic energy]] <math>T</math> in terms of the mass <math>m</math> and the velocity <math>v</math>.

For example, the following is not a coherent system: one where energy is measured in [[calories]], while mass and velocity are measured in their SI units. After all, in that case, <math>\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\{m\\}\\,\\{v\\}^{2}</math> will give a numerical value whose meaning is the kinetic energy when expressed in joules, and that numerical value is different, by a factor of {{val|4.184}}, from the numerical value when the kinetic energy is expressed in calories. Thus, in that system, the equation satisfied by the numerical values is instead <math>\\{T\\}=\\frac{1}{4.184}\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\{m\\}\\,\\{v\\}^{2}</math>.}} Twenty-two coherent derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.<ref group=\"Note\">For example the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the unit of [[force]], equal to kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup> when written in terms of the base units; the [[joule]] (J), the unit of [[energy]], equal to kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>, etc. The most recently named derived unit, the [[katal]], was defined in 1999.</ref> The seven base units and the 22 derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other derived units,<ref group=\"Note\">For example, the recommended unit for the [[Electric field|electric field strength]] is the volt per metre, V/m, where the [[volt]] is the derived unit for [[Voltage|electric potential difference]].

Namely, the SI provides twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying power-of-ten (i.e. decimal) multiples and sub-multiples of SI units, ranging from 10<sup>\u221224</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup>.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|143\u20134}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Many of the prefixes predate the creation of the SI. The earliest ones were introduced in French in 1795, at the institution of the metric system, and include ''milli-'' (1/1000), ''centi-'' (1/100), ''deci-'' (1/10), ''deca-'' (10), ''hecto-'' (100) and ''kilo-'' (1000). In fact, ''milli-'' and ''centi-'', at least, had appeared in scientific literature in 1793.<ref name=\"OEDmilli\">{{Cite OED|milli|id=118531}}</ref><ref name=\"OEDcenti\">{{Cite OED|centi|id=29650}}</ref>}}\n\nFor example, while the coherent unit of length is the metre,{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The SI base units (like the metre) are also called ''coherent units'', because they belong to the ''set of coherent SI units''.}} the SI provides a full range of smaller and larger units of length, any of which may turn out to be more convenient for any given application. So, driving distances are normally given not in metres but in [[kilometre]]s (symbol {{val|u=km}}). Here the prefix '[[kilo-]]' (symbol 'k') stands for a factor of 1000; thus, one kilometre ({{val|1|u=km}}) is {{val|1000|u=m}}. On the other hand, [[tailor|tailor's]] measurements are more conveniently expressed in [[centimetre]]s (symbol {{val|u=cm}}); the prefix '[[centi-]]' (symbol 'c') stands for a factor of 1/100={{val|0.01}}, so that one centimetre ({{val|1|u=cm}}) is {{val|0.01|u=m}}. \n\nThe grouping formed by a prefix symbol attached to a unit symbol{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The only limitation is that the unit symbol must be either a symbol for one of the seven base units or for one of the 22 derived units with special names and symbols.}} (e.g. '{{val|u=km}}', '{{val|u=cm}}') constitutes a new inseparable unit symbol.

In this way, the defining constants directly define the [[hertz]] ({{val|u=Hz}}), [[metre per second]] ({{val|u=m/s}}), [[joule-second]] ({{val|u=J.s}}), [[coulomb]] ({{val|u=C}}), [[Joule per Kelvin|joule per kelvin]] ({{val|u=J/K}}), the inverse [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ({{val|u=mol-1}}), and [[lumen (unit)|lumen]] per [[watt]] ({{val|u=lm/W}}).  Further, one can show, using [[dimensional analysis]], that every coherent SI unit (whether base or derived) can be written as a unique product of powers of the units of the defining constants. Therefore, purely ''mathematically'' speaking, the SI units are defined ''as if'' we declared that it is the defining constant's units that are now the base units, with all other SI units being derived units. For example, since {{sfrac|{{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}|{{val|9192631770}}}} = {{val|1|u=Hz}}, {{sfrac|{{math|''c''}}|{{val|299792458}}}} = {{val|1|u=m/s}}, and {{sfrac|{{math|''h''}}|{{val|6.62607015e-34}}}} = {{val|1|u=J.s}}, the three defining constants {{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}, {{math|''c''}}, and {{math|''h''}} define the kilogram because, on the one hand, they respectively define the units {{val|u=Hz}}, {{val|u=m/s}}, and {{val|u=J.s}}, while, on the other hand, the kilogram can be written in terms of these three units, namely, {{nowrap|1={{val|1|u=kg}} = ({{val|1|u=Hz}})({{val|1|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|1|u=J.s}}).}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|To see this, recall that {{nowrap|{{val|u=Hz}} {{=}} {{val|u=s-1}}}} and {{nowrap|{{val|u=J}} {{=}} {{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=m}}{{sup|2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}{{sup|-2}}.}} Thus {{nowrap|({{val|u=Hz}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=J.s}}) {{=}} ({{val|u=s-1}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=kg}}\u22c5{{val|u=m}}{{sup|2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}{{sup|-2}}\u22c5{{val|u=s}}) {{=}} {{val|u=kg}},}} since all the powers of metres and seconds cancel out. It can further be shown that ({{val|u=Hz}})({{val|u=m/s}}){{sup|\u22122}}({{val|u=J.s}}) is the ''only'' combination of powers of the units of the defining constants (that is, the only combination of powers of {{val|u=Hz}}, {{val|u=m/s}}, {{val|u=J.s}}, {{val|u=C}}, {{val|u=J/K}}, {{val|u=mol-1}}, and {{val|u=lm/W}}) that results in the kilogram.}}{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The SI Brochure prefers to write the relationship between the kilogram and the defining constants directly, without going through the intermediary step of defining {{val|1|u=Hz}}, {{val|1|u=m/s}}, and {{val|1|u=J.s}}, like this:<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|131}} {{nowrap|{{val|1|u=kg}} {{=}} {{sfrac|({{val|299792458}}){{sup|2}}|({{val|6.62607015e-34}})({{val|9192631770}})}}{{sfrac|{{math|''h''}}&thinsp;{{math|\u0394''\u03bd''{{sub|Cs}}}}|{{math|''c''}}{{sup|2}}}}.}}}} \n\nThe nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as {{Math|''c''}} to the purely technical constant {{Math|''K''<sub>cd</sub>}}.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|128\u20139}}. Prior to 2019, {{math|''h''}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''k''}}, and {{math|''N''{{sub|A}}}} were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019, their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time, ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. \n\nOne consequence of the redefinition of the SI is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed, since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants. Nevertheless, the distinction is retained because 'it is useful and historically well established', and also because the [[ISO/IEC 80000]] series of standards{{refn|group=\"Note\"|Which define the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ).}} specifies base and derived quantities that necessarily have the corresponding SI units.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|129}}\n\n===Specifying fundamental constants vs. other methods of definition===\nThe current way of defining the SI system is the result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the\n[[Realisation (metrology)|realisations]] of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions.<ref name=\"SIBrochure9thEd\"/>{{rp|126}} \n\nThe great advantage of doing it this way is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the units.{{refn|group=\"Note\"|The sole exception is the definition of the second, which is still given not in terms of fixed values of fundamental constants but in terms of a particular property of a particular naturally occurring object, the caesium atom.

The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures}}'' \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS.\n\n==Controlling authority==\nThe SI is controlled and regulated by three international organizations that were established in 1875 under the terms of the [[Metre Convention]]: the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM{{refn|name=\"French CGPM\"|group=\"Note\"}}), the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM{{refn|name=\"French CIPM\"|group=\"Note\"}}), and the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM{{refn|name=\"BIPM from French\"|group=\"Note\"}}).

All of these are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, ''kilo-'' denotes a multiple of a thousand and ''milli-'' denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a ''micrometre'', not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a ''milligram'', not a microkilogram.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|122}}<ref name=\"NIST811\">{{cite book |author-first1=Ambler |author-last1=Thompson |author-first2=Barry N. |author-last2=Taylor |date=2008 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf |title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) (Special publication 811) |location=Gaithersburg, MD |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}</ref>{{rp|14}} When prefixes are used to form multiples and submultiples of SI base and derived units, the resulting units are no longer coherent.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|7}}\n\nThe BIPM specifies 20 prefixes for the International System of Units (SI):\n\n:{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\n===Non-SI units accepted for use with SI===\n{{Main|Non-SI units accepted for use with SI}}\nMany non-SI units continue to be used in the scientific, technical, and commercial literature.

This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp |134}} and the symbol for degrees Celsius (\u00b0C).<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|133}} Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (\u00b0,&nbsp;&prime;, and&nbsp;&Prime;), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.\n* Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.\n* A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to a unit symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz, \u03bc in \u03bcg). Compound prefixes are not allowed. A prefixed unit is atomic in expressions (e.g., km<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to (km)<sup>2</sup>).\n* Unit symbols are written using roman (upright) type, regardless of the type used in the surrounding text.\n* Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a [[dot operator|centre dot]] (\u22c5) or a non-breaking space; e.g., N\u22c5m or N&nbsp;m.\n* Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (/), or given as a negative [[exponent]]. E.g., the \"metre per second\" can be written m/s, m&nbsp;s<sup>\u22121</sup>, m\u22c5s<sup>\u22121</sup>, or {{sfrac|m|s}}. A solidus must not be used more than once in a given expression without parentheses to remove ambiguities; e.g., kg/(m\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>) and kg\u22c5m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup> are acceptable, but kg/m/s<sup>2</sup> is ambiguous and unacceptable.\n[[File:981ms2.png|thumb|In the expression of acceleration due to gravity, a space separates the value and the units, both the 'm' and the 's' are lowercase because neither the metre nor the second are named after people, and exponentiation is represented with a [[superscript]] '2'.]]\n* The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in [[upper case]]; otherwise, they are written in [[lower case]]. E.g., the unit of [[pressure]] is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], so its symbol is written \"Pa\", but the symbol for mole is written \"mol\". Thus, \"T\" is the symbol for [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a measure of [[magnetic field strength]], and \"t\" the symbol for [[tonne]], a measure of [[mass]]. Since 1979, the [[litre]] may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase \"L\" or a lowercase \"l\", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter \"l\" to the numeral \"1\", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States \"L\" be used rather than \"l\".\n* Symbols do not have a plural form, e.g., 25&nbsp;kg, but not 25&nbsp;{{Not a typo|kgs}}.\n* Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the quantities 1&nbsp;mW and 1&nbsp;MW represent two different quantities (milliwatt and megawatt).\n* The symbol for the [[decimal marker]] is either a [[full stop|point]] or [[comma]] on the line. In practice, the decimal point is used in most English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of [[Latin America]] and in continental [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=March\u2013April 2008 |title=Period or Comma?

Independently, in 1743, the French physicist [[Jean-Pierre Christin]] described a scale with 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 the boiling point.

Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin, and candela.\n\nThe 9th CGPM also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/7/ |title=Resolution 7 of the 9th meeting of the CGPM (1948): Writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers |access-date=2012-11-06 |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}</ref> These rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit symbols and names, prefix symbols and names, how quantity symbols should be written and used, and how the values of quantities should be expressed.<ref name=\"SIBrochure\"/>{{rp|104,130}}\n\n===Birth of the SI===\nIn 1960, the 11th CGPM synthesised the results of the 12-year study into a set of 16 resolutions.

[[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]] later identified the need for an electrical base unit, for which the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity) were added later.\n\nThe early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit, while the SI defines an analogous unit of mass. In everyday use, these are mostly interchangeable, but in scientific contexts the difference matters. Mass, strictly the inertial mass, represents a quantity of matter. It relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]], {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''m'' \u00d7 ''a''}}: force equals mass times acceleration. A force of 1&nbsp;N (newton) applied to a mass of 1&nbsp;kg will accelerate it at 1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>. This is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e.g. at the Earth's surface. Weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field, and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight of a 1&nbsp;kg mass at the Earth's surface is {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''g''}}; mass times the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81&nbsp;newtons at the Earth's surface and is about 3.5&nbsp;newtons at the surface of Mars. Since the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies by location and altitude on the Earth, weight is unsuitable for precision measurements of a property of a body, and this makes a unit of weight unsuitable as a base unit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ <big>SI base units</big><ref name=\"NIST330\"/>{{rp|6}}<ref name=\"BIPM1975\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://archive.org/details/internationalbur420page |pages=[https://archive.org/details/internationalbur420page/page/238 238]\u2013244 |title=The International Bureau of Weights and Measures 1875\u20131975: NBS Special Publication 420 |date=1975-05-20 |editor-last1=Page |editor-first1=Chester H. |editor-last2=Vigoureux |editor-first2=Paul |publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}</ref>\n|-\n!Unit<br />name\n!Definition<ref group=\"n\">Interim definitions are given here only when there has been a ''significant'' difference in the definition.</ref> \n|-\n![[second]]\n|\n*'''Prior''': (1675) {{sfrac|1|{{val|86400}}}} of a day of 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds.<sup>TLB</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1956): {{sfrac|{{val|31556925.9747}}}} of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].\n*'''Current''' (1967): The duration of {{val|9192631770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] levels of the [[ground state]] of the [[caesium-133]] atom.\n|-\n![[metre]]\n|\n*'''Prior''' (1793): {{sfrac|{{val|10000000}}}} of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] through Paris between the North Pole and the Equator.<sup>FG</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1889): The Prototype of the metre chosen by the CIPM, at the temperature of melting ice, represents the metric unit of length.\n*'''Interim''' (1960): {{val|1650763.73}} [[wavelength]]s in a [[vacuum]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] corresponding to the transition between the 2p{{sup|10}} and 5d{{sup|5}} quantum levels of the [[krypton-86]] [[atom]].\n*'''Current''' (1983): The distance travelled by light in vacuum in {{sfrac|{{val|299792458}}}} second.\n|-\n![[kilogram]]\n|\n*'''Prior''' (1793): The '''[[grave (unit)|grave]]''' was defined as being the mass (then called ''weight'') of one litre of pure water at its freezing point.<sup>FG</sup>\n*'''Interim''' (1889): The mass of a small squat cylinder of \u224847 cubic centimetres of platinum-iridium alloy kept in the Pavillon de Breteuil{{citation needed|reason=Though this is the location of the BIPM in Saint-Cloud, https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram-introduction indicates that [...] the IPK, which is kept by the [BIPM] in S\u00e8vres, France.

The second is a base unit in all of them. The metre is recognized in all of them, either as the base unit of length or as a decimal multiple of the base unit of length. However, not all metric systems recognize the gram or its decimal multiples. In particular, in [[gravitational metric system]]s, the base units are the units of time, length, and force, while mass uses a derived unit; the unit of force was taken to be the [[kilogram-force]], the [[Mass versus weight|weight]] of the standard kilogram under [[standard gravity]]. In some versions of that system, the unit of mass is defined as the mass that is accelerated by one unit of acceleration when acted upon by a net force of one unit force; in these versions, the unit of mass is not a decimal multiple of the gram, but rather, when expressed in kilograms, has the same numerical value as the standard gravity when the latter is expressed in the base units for length and time of the system. So for example, in one system, the coherent unit of mass was the [[Gravitational_metric_system#Mass|hyl]], while the base units of lenght and time were the metre and the second.
