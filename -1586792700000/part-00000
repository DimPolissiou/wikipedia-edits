He was the editor of Studies on Asia, a bi-annual journal of the Midwestern Conference on Asian Affairs (2010\u20132015).\nHe was also a public policy scholar at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] at Washington DC during the Fall of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/staff/ali-riaz |title=Ali Riaz |website=Wilson Center}}</ref>\n\n==Early \u200d& Education life==\n\nRiaz was born in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] to Mohabbat Ali, a senior public servant and Bilkis Ara. He earned his baccalaureate and master's degree in Mass Communication and Journalism from the [[University of Dhaka]] in 1981 and 1983, respectively. He was awarded a graduate student fellowship at the [[East West Center]] at Honolulu, Hawaii in 1987, where he earned master's degrees in communication (1989) and in political science (1991) under the EWC fellowship from the [[University of Hawaii]]. He completed his Doctor of Philosophy in political science in 1993 on civil-military relationship in Bangladesh. His study offers a structural-historical interpretation of the causes of and conditions for the military rule in Bangladesh in its first decade, 1972\u20131981.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Career==\n\nRiaz started his career as a lecturer at the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism at the University of Dhaka (DU) in 1984 where he served until 1987. Upon completion of his doctoral degree he returned to the DU as a faculty. In 1994, he received the South-Southeast Asia Fellowship of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies ([[ISEAS]]) at Singapore where he studied the role of telecommunication in economic growth in Singapore and Malaysia.  Between 1995 and 2000, he was a senior broadcast journalist at the BBC World Service at London. Since then he has taught at [[University of Lincoln]] in England, [[Claflin University]] at South Carolina, USA and joined the Department of Politics and Government at Illinois State University in 2002. He became professor in 2008 and in 2012 he is named the University Professor.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nHis works have focused on political Islam and rise of Islamism in Bangladesh. His books ''God Willing: The Politics of Islamism in Bangladesh'' (2004) and ''Islamist Militancy in Bangladesh: A Complex Web (2008)'' focus on the transformation of a country which was founded on the basis of a secular principle, but forsook its secularist tradition of centuries in less than a decade and embraced Islam as state religion. The political actors, their strategies, and methods of instrumentalisation of Islam in the third largest Muslim majority country of the world are indicative of how and why the ideology of Islamism appeals, and how domestic, regional and international events influence the dynamics. The findings that the war in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989, US foreign policy towards the Middle East, and the fifty year  regional rivalry between India and Pakistan facilitated this transformation as much as domestic power jockeying made other analysts take pause before presenting simplistic interpretations such as poverty or Muslim exceptionalism as the causes.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nRiaz's work on madrasas in South Asia has drawn attention of academics and policy-makers alike. In post-2001 Riaz challenged the dominant, at times alarmist, literature produced by policy analysts that madrasas (Islamic seminaries) in Muslim societies are \u201cthe schools of jihad\u201d and \u201cthe breeding grounds of terrorists.\u201d Drawing on the policy documents of the US government, he has demonstrated the shortcomings of US policies towards South Asian madrasas in his book ''Faithful Education: Madrasahs in South Asia'' (2008). The book explores the history of these institutions, their role in contemporary society and politics, and relationships with local militancy and transnational terrorism in three countries namely Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. This book also provides probing analysis of the curriculum of institutions, both historical and contemporary. Underscoring the need for reform, this study also maps the way forward for rendering these institutions relevant to future generations and suggests what policy makers of the United States and other countries can do.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nRiaz has also studied the relationship between state and society and has written extensively on this topic. His co-authored book, ''Paradise Lost? State Failure in Nepal'' (2007) examines the relationship in Nepal while his book ''Unfolding State; The Transformation of Bangladesh'' (2006) looks at Bangladesh's structural transformation in the first 25 years. ''Paradise Lost'' demonstrates that the nature of the state, disjuncture between the state and the society, and the rupture of the ideological hegemony of the ruling class of Nepal have created a situation where existing institutional frameworks are disintegrating and the state is rapidly unraveling. The study analyses the roles of ethnicity, identity, and deprivation, in engendering discontent and the rise of the [[Maoists]] as a formidable political force.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn addition to more than a dozen books in English, he has authored ten books in Bengali.

Cooliekkara Kuppam, a [[slum]] area in [[Chennai]]. He is one such responsible youth who focuses on working for the betterment of his fellow beings, and he works hard for the same. Arivu starts Kuppam [[FM broadcasting|FM]] 90.8, a local radio channel with the help of the area gangster, Kasi ([[Prakash Raj]]). In reality, Arivu tries to free the people of the area from the atrocities of Kasi, who is deliberately preventing them from becoming independent, so that he may continue to dominate the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmibeat.com/tamil/movies/velaikkaran-2017-velaikaran/story.html|title=Velaikkaran (Velaikaran) Preview, Velaikkaran Story & Synopsis, Velaikkaran Tamil Movie|website=FilmiBeat|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref> Arivu succeeds in turning the people of the area against Kasi, thus destroying his support.\n\nLater, Arivu joins a leading [[FMCG]] company called Saffron and joins its sales department under Stella Bruce ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]). He manages to bring his friend Bhagya ([[Vijay Vasanth]]) out of Kasi's gang and gets him a job in Saffron. He meets Aadhi ([[Fahadh Faasil]]), Saffron's brand manager, who teaches him how to progress by doing smart work, and Arivu considers him as his inspiration. On the night of April 1, Kasi and his gang attack and stab Bhagya in Saffron's warehouse, whereupon he dies in Arivu's hands. Arivu, filled with rage, tries to attack Kasi, but Kasi's rival Doss ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]) attacks and  stabs Kasi in retaliation for their previous encounter. Arivu admonishes Kasi for being a paid henchman. Kasi reveals to Arivu that he killed Bhagya on a contract given by Jayaram ([[Anish Kuruvilla]]), the President of Saffron. The motive was that Bhagya tried to help Kasthuri ([[Sneha]]), who filed a case claiming Saffron's products to be [[adulterant|adulterated]], due to which she lost her son. Arivu is addressed by Kasi as being a worse hitman than he himself is. Arivu then saves Kasi, who tells Arivu that all products manufactured by Saffron are adulterated. Arivu takes up a mission to fight such malpractices not only in Saffron, but in all the other five major food companies, including the one owned by Madhav Kurup ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]). Arivu shares all of his plans with Aadhi. Meanwhile, is revealed that Aadhi is actually Adhiban Madhav, Madhav's son. He joined Saffron to know their trade secrets and merge the company with his father's company.\n\nArivu manages to convince his company's staff to manufacture products as per government regulations for two days. At the same time, he convinces the staff of the other companies to wear a kerchief on their dresses for the next two days, thus tricking the owners into believing that their workers have turned against them. However, Aadhi manages to foil Arivu's plan and [[coercion|coerces]] the other owners to write over the major shares of their company to Madhav, thus making him the deciding authority of all their companies. Aadhi manages to turn the employees against Arivu by tricking them into believing that Arivu worked as a spy for Madhav. Stella Bruce then slaps and humiliates Arivu, while Aadhi pretends to defend Arivu, claiming that he is innocent and that it is the new president who conspired all these. After this, Arivu reveals to Aadhi that Stella Bruce was his ally, and he now knows that Aadhi is the true traitor. Aadhi then burns down the godown containing the unadulterated products and reveals to Arivu that he is Madhav's son and will be the next CEO of the company. He also convinces the staff through his clever tactics and makes them propose his name as the new CEO, also revealing to Arivu that he will make them manufacture adulterated products without their knowledge, now that he commands their loyalty, support, and trust.\n\nArivu goes to the [[Radio Mirchi]] radio station on the night before May 1. He reveals that after the fire, one of the injured department heads of Saffron, Karpaga Vinayagam ([[Ramdoss]]), called him into the ambulance and told him that he followed the regulations on the third day too. Arivu learned from the other Saffron team workers - Kennedy ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]), Vinoth ([[Kaali Venkat]]), Ansari ([[Aruldoss]]), and Sivaranjani ([[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]]) - that after manufacturing quality products for two days, they could not bring themselves to manufacture adulterated products on the next day. They confirm they all followed government regulations, thus manufacturing quality products on the next day. Aadhi, now the CEO, hears the workers say that they will rebel against him and depose him if he tries to revert to manufacturing adulterated products. Arivu adds that the loyalty of all the employees in every field should not be wasted by showing it towards unethical employers. Aadhi then vents his frustration about the failure of his plan.\n\nAll the people in the city show their support to Arivu, who celebrates his success with his love interest Mrinalini ([[Nayanthara]]), friends, family, the people of his slum, and the people of the city as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Arivu\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Adhiban Madhav (Aadhi)\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Mrinalini \"Miru\" (voice dubbed by [[Deepa Venkat]])\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Kasi\n* [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Kasthuri\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Stella Bruce\n* [[RJ Balaji]] as Sriram\n* [[Sathish]] as Hari\n* [[Vijay Vasanth]] as Bhagya\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Chinna Thambi\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Ponni\n* [[Charle]] as Murugesan\n* [[Ramdoss]] as Karpaga Vinayagam\n* [[Aruldoss]] as Ansari\n* [[Kaali Venkat]] as Vinoth\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Kennedy\n* [[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]] as Sivaranjani\n* [[Mime Gopi]] as Kishta\n* [[Y.

Cooliekkara Kuppam, a [[slum]] area in [[Chennai]]. He is one such responsible youth who focuses on working for the betterment of his fellow beings, and he works hard for the same. Arivu starts Kuppam [[FM broadcasting|FM]] 90.8, a local radio channel with the help of the area gangster, Kasi ([[Prakash Raj]]). In reality, Arivu tries to free the people of the area from the atrocities of Kasi, who is deliberately preventing them from becoming independent, so that he may continue to dominate the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmibeat.com/tamil/movies/velaikkaran-2017-velaikaran/story.html|title=Velaikkaran (Velaikaran) Preview, Velaikkaran Story & Synopsis, Velaikkaran Tamil Movie|website=FilmiBeat|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref> Arivu succeeds in turning the people of the area against Kasi, thus destroying his support.\n\nLater, Arivu joins a leading [[FMCG]] company called Saffron and joins its sales department under Stella Bruce ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]). He manages to bring his friend Bhagya ([[Vijay Vasanth]]) out of Kasi's gang and gets him a job in Saffron. He meets Aadhi ([[Fahadh Faasil]]), Saffron's brand manager, who teaches him how to progress by doing smart work, and Arivu considers him as his inspiration. On the night of April 1, Kasi and his gang attack and stab Bhagya in Saffron's warehouse, whereupon he dies in Arivu's hands. Arivu, filled with rage, tries to attack Kasi, but Kasi's rival Doss ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]) attacks and  stabs Kasi in retaliation for their previous encounter. Arivu admonishes Kasi for being a paid henchman. Kasi reveals to Arivu that he killed Bhagya on a contract given by Jayaram ([[Anish Kuruvilla]]), the President of Saffron. The motive was that Bhagya tried to help Kasthuri ([[Sneha]]), who filed a case claiming Saffron's products to be [[adulterant|adulterated]], due to which she lost her son. Arivu is addressed by Kasi as being a worse hitman than he himself is. Arivu then saves Kasi, who tells Arivu that all products manufactured by Saffron are adulterated. Arivu takes up a mission to fight such malpractices not only in Saffron, but in all the other five major food companies, including the one owned by Madhav Kurup ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]). Arivu shares all of his plans with Aadhi. Meanwhile, is revealed that Aadhi is actually Adhiban Madhav, Madhav's son. He joined Saffron to know their trade secrets and merge the company with his father's company.\n\nArivu manages to convince his company's staff to manufacture products as per government regulations for two days. At the same time, he convinces the staff of the other companies to wear a kerchief on their dresses for the next two days, thus tricking the owners into believing that their workers have turned against them. However, Aadhi manages to foil Arivu's plan and [[coercion|coerces]] the other owners to write over the major shares of their company to Madhav, thus making him the deciding authority of all their companies. Aadhi manages to turn the employees against Arivu by tricking them into believing that Arivu worked as a spy for Madhav. Stella Bruce then slaps and humiliates Arivu, while Aadhi pretends to defend Arivu, claiming that he is innocent and that it is the new president who conspired all these. After this, Arivu reveals to Aadhi that Stella Bruce was his ally, and he now knows that Aadhi is the true traitor. Aadhi then burns down the godown containing the unadulterated products and reveals to Arivu that he is Madhav's son and will be the next CEO of the company. He also convinces the staff through his clever tactics and makes them propose his name as the new CEO, also revealing to Arivu that he will make them manufacture adulterated products without their knowledge, now that he commands their loyalty, support, and trust.\n\nArivu goes to the [[Radio Mirchi]] radio station on the night before May 1. He reveals that after the fire, one of the injured department heads of Saffron, Karpaga Vinayagam ([[Ramdoss]]), called him into the ambulance and told him that he followed the regulations on the third day too. Arivu learned from the other Saffron team workers - Kennedy ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]), Vinoth ([[Kaali Venkat]]), Ansari ([[Aruldoss]]), and Sivaranjani ([[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]]) - that after manufacturing quality products for two days, they could not bring themselves to manufacture adulterated products on the next day. They confirm they all followed government regulations, thus manufacturing quality products on the next day. Aadhi, now the CEO, hears the workers say that they will rebel against him and depose him if he tries to revert to manufacturing adulterated products. Arivu adds that the loyalty of all the employees in every field should not be wasted by showing it towards unethical employers. Aadhi then vents his frustration about the failure of his plan.\n\nAll the people in the city show their support to Arivu, who celebrates his success with his love interest Mrinalini ([[Nayanthara]]), friends, family, the people of his slum, and the people of the city as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Arivu\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Adhiban Madhav (Aadhi)\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Mrinalini \"Miru\" (voice dubbed by [[Deepa Venkat]])\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Kasi\n* [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Kasthuri\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Stella Bruce\n* [[RJ Balaji]] as Sriram\n* [[Sathish]] as Hari\n* [[Vijay Vasanth]] as Bhagya\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Chinna Thambi\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Ponni\n* [[Charle]] as Murugesan\n* [[Ramdoss]] as Karpaga Vinayagam\n* [[Aruldoss]] as Ansari\n* [[Kaali Venkat]] as Vinoth\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Kennedy\n* [[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]] as Sivaranjani\n* [[Mime Gopi]] as Kishta\n* [[Y.
