The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

By 1998, ''Star Trek'' was Paramount's most important property; the enormous profits of \"the franchise\" funded much of the rest of the studio's operations.<ref name=\"Poe\">{{Cite book|title=A Vision of the Future|last=Poe|first=Stephen Edward|date=April 1998|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|isbn=9780671534813|location=New York|pages=49\u201354}}</ref> ''Voyager'' became the flagship show of the new [[UPN|United Paramount Network]] (UPN) and thus the first major network ''Star Trek'' series since the original.<ref name=\"Levesque\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/upn06.shtml|title=UPN in search of post-'Voyager' flagship|last=Levesque|first=John|date=2001-01-06|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|access-date=2009-06-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205023950/http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/upn06.shtml|archive-date=2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Voyager'' ended, UPN produced ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', a prequel series. ''Enterprise'' did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series' third season. Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the ''Original Series''. Paramount renewed ''Enterprise'' for a fourth season, but moved it to the [[Friday night death slot]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html|title=Fan Groups, Sites Rally on Behalf of Enterprise (UPDATE)|date=2010-01-17|website=StarTrek.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117112055/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html|archive-date=2011-10-19|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> Like the ''Original Series'', ''Enterprise'' ratings dropped during this time slot, and UPN cancelled ''Enterprise'' at the end of its fourth season.

The cancellation of ''Enterprise'' ended an eighteen-year continuous production run of ''Star Trek'' programming on television. The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis|Nemesis]]'' cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise. Paramount relieved Berman, the franchise producer, of control of ''Star Trek''.\n\n=== Film reboots (''Kelvin'' Timeline) (2005\u20132016) ===\nIn 2005, Paramount's parent company [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] split into two companies, the [[CBS Corporation]] owner of [[CBS Television Studios]], and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] owner of Paramount Pictures. CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J. Abrams]] had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. This gave the film and sequels freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline. The eleventh ''Star Trek'' film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, even stating in the film's advertisements that \"this is not your father's ''Star Trek''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103824300|title=Some Older 'Star Trek' Fans May Skip This Voyage|last=Adler|first=Margo|date=2009-05-06|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> It also would not interfere with CBS's franchise.\n\nThe film earned considerable critical and financial success, grossing (in inflation-adjusted dollars) more box office sales than any previous ''Star Trek'' film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airlockalpha.com/6469/star-trek-becomes-highest-grossing-franchise-film-html|title='Star Trek' Becomes Highest Grossing Franchise Film|last=Hinman|first=Michael|date=2009-06-23|website=[[Airlock Alpha]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> The plaudits include the franchise's first [[Academy Award]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|makeup]]).

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu\u2014later [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]], William Shatner, and NBC. However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]]. The studio was reorganized as the [[Paramount Television (original)|television production division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, [[Sumner Redstone]] acquired a controlling stake of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] via his family's theater chain, [[National Amusements]]. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of [[CBS]] responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Viacom then merged with its former parent, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in 1999.\n\n=== Split ownership (2005\u20132019) ===\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]], and the new [[CBS Corporation]].

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel.

CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J.

The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline.

However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide.

In 1919 Barzille Winfred Merrill took the position of department head and worked to create a separate school of music. He campaigned for a new music building as well, which was dedicated in 1937, and renamed Merril Hall in 1989. In 1921 the Department of Music officially became the School of Music. Merrill's daughter, violinist [[Winifred Merrill Warren]], was an artist-in-residence at the school from 1927 to 1938, and on the school's faculty from 1938 to 1961.\n\nIn 1938 Robert L. Sanders was appointed Dean and remains the school's youngest-ever dean. Through his efforts, the school gained membership in the National Association of Schools of Music and built the Hall of Music (now known as the Indiana University Auditorium). In 1941 the Indiana University Auditorium was dedicated and offered 15 events including appearances by the [[Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo]] and the San Carlo Opera Company.\n\nIn 1942 the school staged its first full opera: ''[[Cavalleria Rusticana]]''. That year the [[Metropolitan Opera Company]] visited IU for the first time, performing ''[[Aida]]'', and would return again for the next 15 years, presenting two operas each visit.\n\nIn 1982 [[Leonard Bernstein]] spent six weeks at the school to work on his final opera, ''[[A Quiet Place (opera)|A Quiet Place]]''. In 1980, the School of Music launched a weekly radio chamber music series produced by [[WFIU]]. In its first year, the series featured student and faculty performers and was broadcast on six Indiana stations. By 1981 (and through 1984), \"Music from Indiana\" had achieved national syndication on American Public Radio, and in 1983, the number of stations carrying the program had jumped to 54.\n\nIn 2005 the school announced it had received a gift of $40.6 million from [[Barbara M. Barrow Jacobs|Barbara]] and  [[David H. Jacobs]] for the school of music. [http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/2626.html] At the time, it was the largest single gift for a school of music at a public university and it is also the largest single gift ever given by individuals to IU. The school will use $20 million of the gift to endow graduate student fellowships and $10 million to endow undergraduate scholarships. The gift also establishes endowed faculty positions, including the Dean Charles H. Webb Chair in Music, the Henry A. Upper Chair in Music and the David H. Jacobs Chair in Music.\n\nIn 2009, the school received a gift from the family of Leonard Bernstein that included the entire contents of Bernstein's conducting studio. [http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/10197.html]\n\n==Academics and programs==\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission to the Jacobs School of Music is done by a live or recorded audition only. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090120135135/http://music.indiana.edu/admissions/audition/requirements.shtml] The overall acceptance rate is generally about 25 percent for undergraduate students and about 30 percent for graduate students [http://music.indiana.edu/admissions/faq.shtml#Applying].   However, acceptance rates vary greatly between programs.  Each freshman class contains about 200 new students.\n\n===Ensembles===\nStudents in most degree programs at the school are required to participate in an ensemble during every semester spent at the school.  Depending on the student's degree program, he or she may be required to participate in specific ensembles.  The majority of ensembles are auditioned.\n\nOwing to the large size of the school, there are thirteen choirs, three bands and seven orchestras at the school [https://web.archive.org/web/20080911083907/http://www.music.indiana.edu/docs/ensembles/]. They encompass a broad range size and musical styles and include the Singing Hoosiers, Opera Chorus, Wind Ensemble, Baroque Orchestra, Concentus, Chamber Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as various jazz ensembles. \n\nOutside of organized ensembles, performance majors are required to participate in chamber music. These ensembles are usually student-formed and coached by a faculty member. Student conductors and those wishing to solo with orchestra can also form ad-hoc orchestras.

[http://music.indiana.edu/departments/ensembles/cve/index.shtml NOTUS: IU Contemporary Vocal Ensemble]\n\n====Opera====\nThe Jacobs School of Music has long been known for their operatic history. The school currently produces five operas and one musical each year, three for each semester. The Opera Theater (www.operaballet.indiana.edu) stages works in varying styles and size. They frequently perform classic works by composers such as Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, and Donizetti, but they also perform Baroque operas by Handel, and contemporary works. Cast and chorus members are students, and many of the crew are students as well.\n\n===Programs of study===\nThe school offers Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degrees, Master of Arts (M.A.) degrees, Master of Music (M.M.) degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees, and Doctor of Music (D.M.) degrees, among others, in a large and diverse number of musical fields. The school also awards a \"Performer's Certificate\" or \"Artist's Diploma\" to students who demonstrate exceptionally outstanding performance ability. The school also offers degrees in Historical Performance. Additionally, it is possible for students to enroll in a unique degree program available at Indiana University known as the B.S.O.F. or Bachelor of Science in an Outside Field in some select areas of study so that students may diversify their education outside of the standard prescribed curriculum.\n\n==Awards and honors for the Jacobs School of Music==\nHonors for the school include being ranked first in the nation by ''Change'' magazine, ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', and ''U.S. News & World Report''. The IU School of Music as a whole was recently listed first among the \"Top Ten Voice Schools in America\" by ''Classical Singer''. IU School of Music voice students are frequent winners in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in [[New York City]] each spring. The school has had five grand winners in the last five years and 33 grand winners overall. An unparalleled twenty students and alumni have received BMI Student Composer Awards.

In 1919 Barzille Winfred Merrill took the position of department head and worked to create a separate school of music. He campaigned for a new music building as well, which was dedicated in 1937, and renamed Merril Hall in 1989. In 1921 the Department of Music officially became the School of Music. Merrill's daughter, violinist [[Winifred Merrill Warren]], was an artist-in-residence at the school from 1927 to 1938, and on the school's faculty from 1938 to 1961.\n\nIn 1938 Robert L. Sanders was appointed Dean and remains the school's youngest-ever dean. Through his efforts, the school gained membership in the National Association of Schools of Music and built the Hall of Music (now known as the Indiana University Auditorium). In 1941 the Indiana University Auditorium was dedicated and offered 15 events including appearances by the [[Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo]] and the San Carlo Opera Company.\n\nIn 1942 the school staged its first full opera: ''[[Cavalleria Rusticana]]''. That year the [[Metropolitan Opera Company]] visited IU for the first time, performing ''[[Aida]]'', and would return again for the next 15 years, presenting two operas each visit.\n\nIn 1982 [[Leonard Bernstein]] spent six weeks at the school to work on his final opera, ''[[A Quiet Place (opera)|A Quiet Place]]''. In 1980, the School of Music launched a weekly radio chamber music series produced by [[WFIU]]. In its first year, the series featured student and faculty performers and was broadcast on six Indiana stations. By 1981 (and through 1984), \"Music from Indiana\" had achieved national syndication on American Public Radio, and in 1983, the number of stations carrying the program had jumped to 54.\n\nIn 2005 the school announced it had received a gift of $40.6 million from [[Barbara M. Barrow Jacobs|Barbara]] and  [[David H. Jacobs]] for the school of music. [http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/2626.html] At the time, it was the largest single gift for a school of music at a public university and it is also the largest single gift ever given by individuals to IU. The school will use $20 million of the gift to endow graduate student fellowships and $10 million to endow undergraduate scholarships. The gift also establishes endowed faculty positions, including the Dean Charles H. Webb Chair in Music, the Henry A. Upper Chair in Music and the David H. Jacobs Chair in Music.\n\nIn 2009, the school received a gift from the family of Leonard Bernstein that included the entire contents of Bernstein's conducting studio. [http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/10197.html]\n\n==Academics and programs==\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission to the Jacobs School of Music is done by a live or recorded audition only. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090120135135/http://music.indiana.edu/admissions/audition/requirements.shtml] The overall acceptance rate is generally about 25 percent for undergraduate students and about 30 percent for graduate students [http://music.indiana.edu/admissions/faq.shtml#Applying].   However, acceptance rates vary greatly between programs.  Each freshman class contains about 200 new students.\n\n===Ensembles===\nStudents in most degree programs at the school are required to participate in an ensemble during every semester spent at the school.  Depending on the student's degree program, he or she may be required to participate in specific ensembles.  The majority of ensembles are auditioned.\n\nOwing to the large size of the school, there are thirteen choirs, three bands and seven orchestras at the school [https://web.archive.org/web/20080911083907/http://www.music.indiana.edu/docs/ensembles/]. They encompass a broad range size and musical styles and include the Singing Hoosiers, Opera Chorus, Wind Ensemble, Baroque Orchestra, Concentus, Chamber Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as various jazz ensembles. \n\nOutside of organized ensembles, performance majors are required to participate in chamber music. These ensembles are usually student-formed and coached by a faculty member. Student conductors and those wishing to solo with orchestra can also form ad-hoc orchestras. These are completely student-run.\n\n====Contemporary====\nThe school is home to two of the nation's premier contemporary music ensembles.
