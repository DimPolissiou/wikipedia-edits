The word ''''Sood'''' finds a mention in the Vedas at 23 places (15 places in the Rig Ved, 6 places in the Yajur Ved and twice in the Atharva Ved). Interestingly, Lord Krishna is also known as 'Madhusudan' \u2013 (Sudan means 'sanharak' \u2013 killer of demon Madhu). The Sood community is a very ancient fraternity and some Sood/Sud gotras are merchants as well. \n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the Brahmin Rishis were perturbed by the spread of Buddhism across India, because the old Vedic Hindu Dharma was getting a great set back. Hence, the Rishis performed a sacred Yajna at Mount Abu to revive old Hindu Dharma based on the Vedic traditions. The sacred flames of this Agni Kund, incarnated and baptised four Kshatriyas namely \u2013 the Parmar, the Parihar, the Solanki and the Chouhan. These four took a holy vow to re-establish the ancient glory of Hindu Dharma by fighting against the mass change of faith from Hinduism to Buddhism. These four Kshatriyas spread four new branches of Hinduism all over the country. The second son born to Parmar was named Sood and his descendents formed the Sood community. A reference of 44 descendants of Parmar is also available. These sood descendents formed the Sood Dynasty and the capital city of the Sood Dynasty for eight generations was Patten in Sind, now in Pakistan. The capital was later shifted to Alwar and finally King Jai Singh, (son of King Dahar) shifted his capital to Amar Kot, now in Pakistan. There is a reference of 101 Sood Kings or Rajas ruling in different parts of India. The Soods established themselves in the North and later got concentrated at Soodpur, now renamed Sirhind.  \n\nDue to the seven invasions of India by Ahmed Shah Abdali between 1748 and 1757 A.D., at Soodpur and gradually into Rajasthan and later of entire India, the Soods fled to different villages and towns in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.<ref name=\"originHistory\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#2|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Gotras or Sub Castes==\nBoth the Punjab section and the Hill section of the Sood community have 52 Gotras or Sub Castes each, many of which are named after the villages they settled in. <ref name=\"Gotras or Sub Castes\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#8|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Punjab section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Badhoo, Balgan, Baranwal, Behal, Beri, Bharak, Bhokaha (or Bhokhi), Bhola, Bodhi, Bourie, Brahmi, Dadan, Dauli (or Deli), Dhalli (or Dhati), Dhanda, Dhaunchak, Dhiri, Dhookhi, Dhoop, Dosaj, Gajri, Gajja (or Gajjey), Gondal (Gandel), Gopal, Goyal, Jandpal (or Janpal), Jari, Kajla (or Kajley), Lau, Mahidhar, Mahiyar (or Mayor), Makaura (or Makaurey), Mandal, Mohindra, Mohni, Mukandi, Momman, Nandoo, Nehra, Paal, Phakka, Pharwaha, Phassi, Poora, Rora, Rohnir, Rodher, Sanwal, Sulhan, Tagaley, Teji, Udhar, Ugal-Virk or Virk and Vassan.\n\nThe Hill section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Bahil, Bajwaria, Banta, Bhagley, Bhagra, Basohal, Basalia, Butail, Chakahria, Chakaseday, Chamib, Chaudhri, Chaukand, Chaujar, Chehray, Chimia, Cheemrey, Chhabb, Chonolia, Dagan, Didi, Dhophmal, Doddal, Dogan, Dorela, Dunyal, Indoria, Harail, Haraloo, Indoria, Jallundhroo, Jaiswal, Jandranglu, Jhalya, Jhangra, Jehelghat, Kalandar, Kandal, Karol, Kataway, Kaunsal, Kutharia, Kuthiala, Lahespar, Lakhanty, Lamsay, Lama, Langey, Lasaria, Laserday, Lauriya, Ling, Mahdoodia, Mangwalich, Mariya, Mand, Masoob, Mehtay, Mithoo, Naggal, Nehdal, Pabba, Panbalia, Paptopay, Patopa, Pulkaha, Phagdey, Phalkolia, Sabloria, Sah, Saraup, Sawali, Shall, Takalo and Udhwal.\n\nThe Soods are organized into city specific chapters of their organization in many countries.

Its name commemorates the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], the [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] over France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]].\n\nThe site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]]. After [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved the mews to [[Buckingham Palace]], the area was redeveloped by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], but progress was slow after his death, and the square did not open until 1844. The {{convert|169|ft|adj=on}} [[Nelson's Column]] at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the [[Fourth Plinth]], left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.\n\nThe square has been used for community gatherings and political [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], including [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1887, the culmination of the first [[Aldermaston March]], anti-war protests, and campaigns against [[climate change]]. A [[Christmas tree]] has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on [[New Year's Eve]]. It was well known for its [[feral pigeon]]s until their removals in the early 21st century.\n\n== Name ==\nThe square is named after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], a [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]], southwest Spain, although it was not named as such until 1835.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}}\n\nThe name \"Trafalgar\" is a [[Arabic language influence on the Spanish language|Spanish word]] of [[List of English words of Arabic origin|Arabic origin]], derived from either ''Taraf al-Ghar'' ({{lang|ar|\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631}} 'cape of the cave/laurel')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.usal.es/~joluin/historiadelalengua/toponimos.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215174601/http://web.usal.es/~joluin/historiadelalengua/toponimos.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 December 2004|title=2|date=15 December 2004}}</ref><ref>[http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=algar Entry ''algar''], in [[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|''DRAE'' dictionary]]</ref><ref name='burton'/> or ''Taraf al-Gharb'' ({{lang|ar|\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628}} 'cape of the west').<ref>{{cite web|author=Joseph E.

Its name commemorates the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], the [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] over France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]].\n\nThe site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]].

The {{convert|169|ft|adj=on}} [[Nelson's Column]] at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the [[Fourth Plinth]], left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.\n\nThe square has been used for community gatherings and political [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], including [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1887, the culmination of the first [[Aldermaston March]], anti-war protests, and campaigns against [[climate change]]. A [[Christmas tree]] has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on [[New Year's Eve]]. It was well known for its [[feral pigeon]]s until their removals in the early 21st century.\n\n== Name ==\nThe square is named after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], a [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]], southwest Spain, although it was not named as such until 1835.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}}\n\nThe name \"Trafalgar\" is a [[Arabic language influence on the Spanish language|Spanish word]] of [[List of English words of Arabic origin|Arabic origin]], derived from either ''Taraf al-Ghar'' ({{lang|ar|\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631}} 'cape of the cave/laurel')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.usal.es/~joluin/historiadelalengua/toponimos.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215174601/http://web.usal.es/~joluin/historiadelalengua/toponimos.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 December 2004|title=2|date=15 December 2004}}</ref><ref>[http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=algar Entry ''algar''], in [[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|''DRAE'' dictionary]]</ref><ref name='burton'/> or ''Taraf al-Gharb'' ({{lang|ar|\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628}} 'cape of the west').<ref>{{cite web|author=Joseph E.

As the first spectral lines associated with this series are located in the visible part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], these lines are historically referred to as \"H-alpha\", \"H-beta\", \"H-gamma\", and so on, where H is the element hydrogen.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Balmer equation predicts the four visible spectral lines of hydrogen with high accuracy. Balmer's equation inspired the [[Rydberg equation]] as a generalization of it, and this in turn led physicists to find the [[Lyman series|Lyman]], [[Paschen series|Paschen]], and [[Brackett series]], which predicted other spectral lines of hydrogen found outside the [[visible spectrum]].\n\nThe red [[H-alpha]] spectral line of the Balmer series of atomic hydrogen, which is the transition from the shell ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 to the shell ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, is one of the conspicuous colours of the [[universe]]. It contributes a bright red line to the spectra of [[emission nebula|emission]] or ionisation nebula, like the [[Orion Nebula]], which are often [[H II region]]s found in star forming regions. In true-colour pictures, these nebula have a reddish-pink colour from the combination of visible Balmer lines that hydrogen emits.\n\nLater, it was discovered that when the Balmer series lines of the hydrogen spectrum were examined at very high resolution, they were closely spaced doublets. This splitting is called [[fine structure]]. It was also found that excited electrons from shells with ''n'' greater than 6 could jump to the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 shell, emitting shades of ultraviolet when doing so.\n[[File:Deuterium lamp 1.png|thumb|right|300px|Two of the Balmer lines (\u03b1 and \u03b2) are clearly visible in this emission spectrum of a [[deuterium lamp]]]]\n\n== Balmer's formula ==\nBalmer noticed that a single wavelength had a relation to every line in the hydrogen spectrum that was in the visible [[light]] region. That wavelength was {{val|364.50682|u=nm}}. When any integer higher than 2 was squared and then divided by itself squared minus 4, then that number multiplied by {{val|364.50682|u=nm}} (see equation below) gave the wavelength of another line in the hydrogen spectrum. By this formula, he was able to show that some measurements of lines made in his time by [[spectroscopy]] were slightly inaccurate and his formula predicted lines that were later found although had not yet been observed. His number also proved to be the limit of the series.\nThe Balmer equation could be used to find the [[wavelength]] of the absorption/emission lines and was originally presented as follows (save for a notation change to give Balmer's constant as ''B''):\n\n:<math>\\lambda\\ = B\\left(\\frac{n^2}{n^2 - m^2}\\right) = B\\left(\\frac{n^2}{n^2 - 2^2}\\right)</math>\n\nWhere\n:''\u03bb'' is the wavelength.\n:''B'' is a constant with the value of {{val|3.6450682|e=\u22127|u=m}} or {{val|364.50682|u=nm}}.\n:''m'' is equal to 2\n:''n'' is an integer such that ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''m''.\n\nIn 1888 the physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] generalized the Balmer equation for all transitions of hydrogen. The equation commonly used to calculate the Balmer series is a specific example of the [[Rydberg formula]] and follows as a simple reciprocal mathematical rearrangement of the formula above (conventionally using a notation of '''m''' for '''n''' as the single integral constant needed):\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{4}{B}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) = R_\\mathrm{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) \\quad \\mathrm{for~} n=3,4,5,...</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03bb'' is the wavelength of the absorbed/emitted light and ''R''<sub>H</sub> is the [[Rydberg constant]] for hydrogen. The Rydberg constant is seen to be equal to {{sfrac|4|''B''}} in Balmer's formula, and this value, for an infinitely heavy nucleus, is {{sfrac|4|{{val|3.6450682|e=\u22127|u=m}}}}&nbsp;= {{val|10973731.57|u=m<sup>\u22121</sup>}}.<ref name=\"CODATA\">{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/codata.pdf |title=CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2006 |work=Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) |publisher=[[NIST]]|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n== Role in astronomy ==\nThe Balmer series is particularly useful in [[astronomy]] because the Balmer lines appear in numerous stellar objects due to the abundance of hydrogen in the [[universe]], and therefore are commonly seen and relatively strong compared to lines from other elements.\n\nThe [[stellar classification|spectral classification]] of stars, which is primarily a determination of surface temperature, is based on the relative strength of spectral lines, and the Balmer series in particular is very important. Other characteristics of a star that can be determined by close analysis of its spectrum include [[surface gravity]] (related to physical size) and composition.\n\nBecause the Balmer lines are commonly seen in the spectra of various objects, they are often used to determine [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]] due to [[doppler shift]]ing of the Balmer lines. This has important uses all over astronomy, from detecting [[binary star]]s, [[exoplanet]]s, compact objects such as [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s (by the motion of hydrogen in [[accretion disk]]s around them), identifying groups of objects with similar motions and presumably origins ([[moving group]]s, [[star cluster]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, and debris from collisions), determining distances (actually [[redshift]]s) of galaxies or [[quasar]]s, and identifying unfamiliar objects by analysis of their spectrum.\n\nBalmer lines can appear as [[absorption line|absorption]] or [[emission line|emission]] lines in a spectrum, depending on the nature of the object observed. In [[star]]s, the Balmer lines are usually seen in absorption, and they are \"strongest\" in stars with a surface temperature of about 10,000 [[kelvin]]s ([[spectral type]] A). In the spectra of most spiral and irregular galaxies, [[active galaxy|active galactic nuclei]], [[H II region]]s and [[planetary nebula|planetary]] [[nebula]]e, the Balmer lines are emission lines.\n\nIn stellar spectra, the H-epsilon line (transition 7\u21922, 397.007&nbsp;nm) is often mixed in with another absorption line caused by ionized [[calcium]] known as \"H\" (the [[Fraunhofer lines|original designation]] given by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]]). H-epsilon is separated by 0.16&nbsp;nm from Ca H at 396.847&nbsp;nm, and cannot be resolved in low-resolution spectra. The H-zeta line (transition 8\u21922) is similarly mixed in with a neutral [[helium]] line seen in hot stars.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Astronomical spectroscopy]]\n* [[Bohr model]]\n* [[Hydrogen spectral series]]\n* [[Lyman series]]\n* [[Rydberg formula]]\n* [[Stellar classification]]\n* [[Theoretical and experimental justification for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hydrogen spectral series-footer}}\n\n[[Category:Emission spectroscopy]]\n[[Category:Hydrogen physics]]\n[[Category:History of physics]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Hydrogen spectral series}}\n[[File:Visible spectrum of hydrogen.jpg|600px|thumb|The \"visible\" [[Hydrogen spectral series|hydrogen emission spectrum lines]] in the Balmer series.

The number of these lines is an infinite continuum as it approaches a limit of 364.6&nbsp;nm in the ultraviolet.\n\nAfter Balmer's discovery, five other [[hydrogen spectral series]] were discovered, corresponding to electrons transitioning to values of ''n'' other than 2.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Bohr atom model.svg|thumb|left|210px|In the simplified [[Bohr model|Rutherford Bohr model]] of the [[hydrogen atom]], the Balmer lines result from an electron jump between the second energy level closest to the nucleus, and those levels more distant. Shown here is a photon emission. The 3\u21922 transition depicted here produces [[H-alpha]], the first line of the Balmer series. For hydrogen (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) this transition results in a photon of [[wavelength]] 656&nbsp;nm (red).]]\n\nThe Balmer series is characterized by the [[electron]] transitioning from ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;3 to ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, where ''n'' refers to the [[radial quantum number]] or [[principal quantum number]] of the electron. The transitions are named sequentially by Greek letter: ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 to ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 is called H-\u03b1, 4 to 2 is H-\u03b2, 5 to 2 is H-\u03b3, and 6 to 2 is H-\u03b4. As the first spectral lines associated with this series are located in the visible part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], these lines are historically referred to as \"H-alpha\", \"H-beta\", \"H-gamma\", and so on, where H is the element hydrogen.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Balmer equation predicts the four visible spectral lines of hydrogen with high accuracy. Balmer's equation inspired the [[Rydberg equation]] as a generalization of it, and this in turn led physicists to find the [[Lyman series|Lyman]], [[Paschen series|Paschen]], and [[Brackett series]], which predicted other spectral lines of hydrogen found outside the [[visible spectrum]].\n\nThe red [[H-alpha]] spectral line of the Balmer series of atomic hydrogen, which is the transition from the shell ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 to the shell ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, is one of the conspicuous colours of the [[universe]]. It contributes a bright red line to the spectra of [[emission nebula|emission]] or ionisation nebula, like the [[Orion Nebula]], which are often [[H II region]]s found in star forming regions. In true-colour pictures, these nebula have a reddish-pink colour from the combination of visible Balmer lines that hydrogen emits.\n\nLater, it was discovered that when the Balmer series lines of the hydrogen spectrum were examined at very high resolution, they were closely spaced doublets. This splitting is called [[fine structure]]. It was also found that excited electrons from shells with ''n'' greater than 6 could jump to the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 shell, emitting shades of ultraviolet when doing so.\n[[File:Deuterium lamp 1.png|thumb|right|300px|Two of the Balmer lines (\u03b1 and \u03b2) are clearly visible in this emission spectrum of a [[deuterium lamp]]]]\n\n== Balmer's formula ==\nBalmer noticed that a single wavelength had a relation to every line in the hydrogen spectrum that was in the visible [[light]] region. That wavelength was {{val|364.50682|u=nm}}. When any integer higher than 2 was squared and then divided by itself squared minus 4, then that number multiplied by {{val|364.50682|u=nm}} (see equation below) gave the wavelength of another line in the hydrogen spectrum. By this formula, he was able to show that some measurements of lines made in his time by [[spectroscopy]] were slightly inaccurate and his formula predicted lines that were later found although had not yet been observed. His number also proved to be the limit of the series.\nThe Balmer equation could be used to find the [[wavelength]] of the absorption/emission lines and was originally presented as follows (save for a notation change to give Balmer's constant as ''B''):\n\n:<math>\\lambda\\ = B\\left(\\frac{n^2}{n^2 - m^2}\\right) = B\\left(\\frac{n^2}{n^2 - 2^2}\\right)</math>\n\nWhere\n:''\u03bb'' is the wavelength.\n:''B'' is a constant with the value of {{val|3.6450682|e=\u22127|u=m}} or {{val|364.50682|u=nm}}.\n:''m'' is equal to 2\n:''n'' is an integer such that ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''m''.\n\nIn 1888 the physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] generalized the Balmer equation for all transitions of hydrogen. The equation commonly used to calculate the Balmer series is a specific example of the [[Rydberg formula]] and follows as a simple reciprocal mathematical rearrangement of the formula above (conventionally using a notation of '''m''' for '''n''' as the single integral constant needed):\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{4}{B}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) = R_\\mathrm{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) \\quad \\mathrm{for~} n=3,4,5,...</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03bb'' is the wavelength of the absorbed/emitted light and ''R''<sub>H</sub> is the [[Rydberg constant]] for hydrogen. The Rydberg constant is seen to be equal to {{sfrac|4|''B''}} in Balmer's formula, and this value, for an infinitely heavy nucleus, is {{sfrac|4|{{val|3.6450682|e=\u22127|u=m}}}}&nbsp;= {{val|10973731.57|u=m<sup>\u22121</sup>}}.<ref name=\"CODATA\">{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/codata.pdf |title=CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2006 |work=Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) |publisher=[[NIST]]|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n== Role in astronomy ==\nThe Balmer series is particularly useful in [[astronomy]] because the Balmer lines appear in numerous stellar objects due to the abundance of hydrogen in the [[universe]], and therefore are commonly seen and relatively strong compared to lines from other elements.\n\nThe [[stellar classification|spectral classification]] of stars, which is primarily a determination of surface temperature, is based on the relative strength of spectral lines, and the Balmer series in particular is very important. Other characteristics of a star that can be determined by close analysis of its spectrum include [[surface gravity]] (related to physical size) and composition.\n\nBecause the Balmer lines are commonly seen in the spectra of various objects, they are often used to determine [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]] due to [[doppler shift]]ing of the Balmer lines. This has important uses all over astronomy, from detecting [[binary star]]s, [[exoplanet]]s, compact objects such as [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s (by the motion of hydrogen in [[accretion disk]]s around them), identifying groups of objects with similar motions and presumably origins ([[moving group]]s, [[star cluster]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, and debris from collisions), determining distances (actually [[redshift]]s) of galaxies or [[quasar]]s, and identifying unfamiliar objects by analysis of their spectrum.\n\nBalmer lines can appear as [[absorption line|absorption]] or [[emission line|emission]] lines in a spectrum, depending on the nature of the object observed. In [[star]]s, the Balmer lines are usually seen in absorption, and they are \"strongest\" in stars with a surface temperature of about 10,000 [[kelvin]]s ([[spectral type]] A). In the spectra of most spiral and irregular galaxies, [[active galaxy|active galactic nuclei]], [[H II region]]s and [[planetary nebula|planetary]] [[nebula]]e, the Balmer lines are emission lines.\n\nIn stellar spectra, the H-epsilon line (transition 7\u21922, 397.007&nbsp;nm) is often mixed in with another absorption line caused by ionized [[calcium]] known as \"H\" (the [[Fraunhofer lines|original designation]] given by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]]). H-epsilon is separated by 0.16&nbsp;nm from Ca H at 396.847&nbsp;nm, and cannot be resolved in low-resolution spectra. The H-zeta line (transition 8\u21922) is similarly mixed in with a neutral [[helium]] line seen in hot stars.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Astronomical spectroscopy]]\n* [[Bohr model]]\n* [[Hydrogen spectral series]]\n* [[Lyman series]]\n* [[Rydberg formula]]\n* [[Stellar classification]]\n* [[Theoretical and experimental justification for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hydrogen spectral series-footer}}\n\n[[Category:Emission spectroscopy]]\n[[Category:Hydrogen physics]]\n[[Category:History of physics]]\n", "name_user": "Maria.bergemann", "label": "safe", "comment": "there was a bug in the air wavelengths of H_alpha, H_beta, and H_gamma lines.

He was eventually signed by [[A.C. Milan]] for a [[World football transfer record|world record]] of \u00a313 million in 1992, and was a key part of their side during the [[1992\u201393 Serie A|1992\u201393 season]] under manager Fabio Capello, scoring 7 goals in Serie A as they won the league title, two [[Italian Supercup]]s in [[1992 Supercoppa Italiana|1992]] and [[1993 Supercoppa Italiana|1993]], and as they also reached the [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League Final]], only to be defeated by [[Olympique Marseille|Marseille]].<ref name=retro/><ref name=\"Gianluigi Lentini\"/>\n\nA year after signing for Milan, at the age of 24, Lentini was involved in a serious car crash whilst driving home from a pre-season tournament in [[Genoa]], in August 1993.

The next two seasons would see him make few appearances, although he collected another [[1994 Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Supercup]] with the club, as well as a [[1994 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]], in 1994, also receiving runners-up medals in the [[1994 Intercontinental Cup]] and the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final]].
