Produced since 1953, the E-Class falls midrange in the Mercedes line-up, and has been marketed worldwide across five generations.\n\nBefore 1993, the E in Mercedes-Benz nomenclature was a suffix following a vehicle's model number which stood for ''Einspritzmotor'' (German for [[fuel injection engine]]). It began to appear in the early 1960s, when that feature began to be utilized broadly in the maker's product line, and not just in its upper tier luxury and sporting models.  By the launch of the facelifted [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] in 1993 fuel-injection was ubiquitous in Mercedes engines, and the E was adopted as a prefix (i.e., E 220) and the model line referred to officially as the E-Class (or ''E-Klasse''). All generations of the E-Class have offered either [[rear-wheel drive]] or Mercedes' [[4Matic]] [[four-wheel drive]] system. \n\nHistorically, the E-Class is Mercedes-Benz' best-selling model, with more than 13 million sold by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/history/frist-new-e-class-rolls-off-the-production-line-in-sindelfingen/|title=First new E-Class rolls off the production line in Sindelfingen.|date=4 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref> The first E-Class series was originally available as four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], five-door [[station wagon]], 2 door coupe and 2 door convertible. From 1997 to 2009, the equivalent coupe and convertible were sold under the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class]] nameplate; which was actually based on the mechanical underpinnings of the smaller C-Class while borrowing the styling and some powertrains from the E-Class, a trend continued with the C207 E-Class coupe/convertible which was sold parallel to the W212 E-Class sedan/wagon. With the latest incarnation of the E-Class released for the 2017 model year, all body styles share the same W213 platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/first-drives/a32939/2018-mercedes-e400-coupe-first-drive/|title=The 2018 Mercedes E400 Coupe Is a Modern Take On an Old Formula|date=15 March 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDue to the E-Class's size and durability, it has filled many market segments, from personal cars to frequently serving as [[Mercedes-Benz taxicab|taxis]] in European countries, as well special-purpose vehicles (e.g., police or ambulance modifications) from the factory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/germany/mpc/mpc_germany_website/de/home_mpc/sonderfahrzeuge0/home/products/branch-solutions/taxi0/e-klasse.html |title=Mercedes-Benz Deutschland \u2013 Sonderfahrzeuge \u2013 Taxi \u2013 E-Klasse |accessdate=2008-08-05 |publisher=[[Daimler AG]] |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917033105/http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/germany/mpc/mpc_germany_website/de/home_mpc/sonderfahrzeuge0/home/products/branch-solutions/taxi0/e-klasse.html |archive-date=2008-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Predecessors ==\n[[File:Mercedes 190D (W121).jpg|thumb|160px|Mercedes 190D (W121)]]\n[[File:W110.jpg|thumb|160px|Mercedes Benz (W110)]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz 220D, circa 1974, Schaffen Diest, Fly-Drive 2013.JPG|thumb|160px|Mercedes-Benz (W115)]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz W123 front 20080822.jpg|thumb|160px|Mercedes-Benz (W123)]]\n=== W120 (1953\u20131962) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W120}}\n\nThe first modern midsize Mercedes was the [[Mercedes-Benz W120|W120 'Ponton' 180]] of 1953 and was produced  until 1962. Sharing its engineering with the [[Mercedes-Benz R121|R121]] 190 SL of 1955, the Ponton was a stylish sedan with a [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder engine]]. A larger-engined [[Mercedes-Benz W121|W121 190]] appeared in 1958.\n\n=== W110 (1961\u20131968) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W110}}\n\nMercedes added tailfins to both the big [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]] and the new [[Mercedes-Benz W110|W110 'Fintail' 190]] of 1962. In the 1965 230 model a [[Straight-6]] engine appeared for the first time, and the four cylinder engine grew in displacement.\n\n=== W114, W115 (1968\u20131976) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W114}}\n\nThe midsize Mercedes was redesigned in 1968 as the [[Mercedes-Benz W114|W114/W115 'Stroke-8']]. This time, the 6-cylinder models (The W114s) were most prevalent, with the W115 line making up the bottom of the company's offerings with four \u2013 and [[Straight-5|five-cylinder]] power. [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] engines joined the line-up, as did a [[coup\u00e9]] body.\n\n=== W123 (1976\u20131986) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W123}}\n\nThe popular [[Mercedes-Benz W123|W123]] quickly became a best-seller on its launch in 1976. Especially in [[Diesel engine|diesel powered]] 200D and 240D (also the five-cylinder 300D) guises, the cars enhanced the company's reputation for product quality. Over 2.6 million were produced until the end of production in 1986.\nSaloon/Sedan, Coup\u00e9 and Estate body configurations were offered.\n\nThe engine is an M103 3.2 liter DOHC 4-valve 6-cylinder in-line cylinder with 220 horsepower.It is not a prominent specification at the moment, but at the time it was a 3 liter class engine with a good color appearance and a high performance as a smooth & powerful engine. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://antiquecars.info/mercedes-benz-e-class-320/ |title=Mercedes Benz E Class 320 |publisher=antiquecars.info |accessdate=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== W124 (1986\u20131994) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W124}}\n\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] was presented in 1984 and introduced several new standards for a mid-size Mercedes.  It was the third car to inherit the company's new design theme since the late 1970s, following the flagship [[Mercedes-Benz W126|W126]] and compact [[Mercedes-Benz W201|W201]]. \n\nSimilar to its predecessors, the W124 also offered a coup\u00e9 and estate body styles. A new convertible (internally A124) was also available, making it the first mid-size Mercedes convertible.\n\n== E-Class ==\n\n=== First generation (W124; 1993\u20131995) ===\n\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W124}}\n[[File:94-95 Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan.jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz W124 (sedan)]]\nThe \"E-Class\" name first appeared in with the facelifted [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] in 1993 for the model year 1994 (the W124 was introduced in 1984 but continued with the older naming convention until 1993, when all Mercedes-Benz models switched to a new system, e.g. E 320 instead of 300 E). The diesel versions continued to be the fuel economy option over the four and six-cylinder gasoline engines, and the gasoline [[V8 engine]]s (available after 1992) increased gasoline power outputs further. Four-cylinder gasoline models were not marketed in the United States. The V8 powered sedans/saloons were named 400 E/500 E from 1992\u20131993, and E 420/E 500 after 1993. Likewise, the 3.0-litre cars (e.g. 300 E) were also re-badged to E 320 with the new 3.2-litre ''M104'' engines and naming rationalization of 1994. For the diesel models the name change was less elegant, with the 250 D becoming the E 250 Diesel for example.\n\nSedan (W124), Coup\u00e9 (C124), Convertible (A124) and Estate (S124) body configurations were offered.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Second generation (W210; 1996\u20132002) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W210)}}\n[[File:1998 Mercedes-Benz E200 Elegance Automatic 2.0.jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz E 200 Elegance (United Kingdom; W210)]]\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W210)|W210]] E-Class, launched in 1995, brought the line firmly into the upper end of the mid-size luxury market. In September 1999 the W210 E-class was facelifted. This included visual, mechanical and quality improvements over the earlier versions.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class was ''[[Motor Trend]]'''s [[Import Car of the Year]] for 1996.\n\nWhile the W210 sedan was replaced by the W211 in 2002, the wagon version continued to be sold until March 2003 when the W211 wagon replaced the W210 wagon.\n\n=== Third generation (W211; 2003\u20132009) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W211)}}\n[[File:Mercedes E 220 CDI Classic (W211) front 20100509.jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz E 220 CDI Classic (Europe)]]\nLaunched in 2002, the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W211)|W211]] E-Class was another evolution of the previous model.  \n\nThe W211-based [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class (W219)|W219 CLS-Class]] sedan was introduced as a niche model in 2005, primarily to attract a younger demographic.\n\nThe W211 E-Class was facelifted in June 2006 for the 2007 [[model year]] to address quality and technical issues raised by earlier models, [[Sensotronic]] was dropped, while [[precrash system|Pre-Safe]] (w/o brake support) was made standard. The largest factory built engine in the E-class range is the E500 (badged E550 in the U.S.) which had its engine size increased from 5 litres to 5.5 litres in 2006 along with the facelift. There is also an AMG model badged E63 [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] and other tuning house installations.\n\nIn 2007 the diesel version of the E-Class was rebadged from CDI (Common rail Direct Injection) to Bluetec. While in some of the other Mercedes-Benz diesels urea injection was added, in the W211 E-Class the Bluetec name was only adopted to prevent confusion in the diesel lineup.\n\n=== Fourth generation (2010-2016) ===\n\n==== Sedan and wagon (W212) ====\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W212)}}\n[[File:2009 Mercedes-Benz E 250 CGI (W 212) Avantgarde sedan (2010-07-05).jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz E 250 CGI Avantgarde (Australia; W212)]]\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W212)|W212]] replaced the W211 in 2009 (as a 2010 model).

Produced since 1953, the E-Class falls midrange in the Mercedes line-up, and has been marketed worldwide across five generations.\n\nBefore 1993, the E in Mercedes-Benz nomenclature was a suffix following a vehicle's model number which stood for ''Einspritzmotor'' (German for [[fuel injection engine]]). It began to appear in the early 1960s, when that feature began to be utilized broadly in the maker's product line, and not just in its upper tier luxury and sporting models.  By the launch of the facelifted [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] in 1993 fuel-injection was ubiquitous in Mercedes engines, and the E was adopted as a prefix (i.e., E 220) and the model line referred to officially as the E-Class (or ''E-Klasse''). All generations of the E-Class have offered either [[rear-wheel drive]] or Mercedes' [[4Matic]] [[four-wheel drive]] system. \n\nHistorically, the E-Class is Mercedes-Benz' best-selling model, with more than 13 million sold by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/history/frist-new-e-class-rolls-off-the-production-line-in-sindelfingen/|title=First new E-Class rolls off the production line in Sindelfingen.|date=4 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref> The first E-Class series was originally available as four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], five-door [[station wagon]], 2 door coupe and 2 door convertible. From 1997 to 2009, the equivalent coupe and convertible were sold under the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class]] nameplate; which was actually based on the mechanical underpinnings of the smaller C-Class while borrowing the styling and some powertrains from the E-Class, a trend continued with the C207 E-Class coupe/convertible which was sold parallel to the W212 E-Class sedan/wagon. With the latest incarnation of the E-Class released for the 2017 model year, all body styles share the same W213 platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/first-drives/a32939/2018-mercedes-e400-coupe-first-drive/|title=The 2018 Mercedes E400 Coupe Is a Modern Take On an Old Formula|date=15 March 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDue to the E-Class's size and durability, it has filled many market segments, from personal cars to frequently serving as [[Mercedes-Benz taxicab|taxis]] in European countries, as well special-purpose vehicles (e.g., police or ambulance modifications) from the factory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/germany/mpc/mpc_germany_website/de/home_mpc/sonderfahrzeuge0/home/products/branch-solutions/taxi0/e-klasse.html |title=Mercedes-Benz Deutschland \u2013 Sonderfahrzeuge \u2013 Taxi \u2013 E-Klasse |accessdate=2008-08-05 |publisher=[[Daimler AG]] |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917033105/http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/germany/mpc/mpc_germany_website/de/home_mpc/sonderfahrzeuge0/home/products/branch-solutions/taxi0/e-klasse.html |archive-date=2008-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Predecessors ==\n[[File:Mercedes 190D (W121).jpg|thumb|160px|Mercedes 190D (W121)]]\n[[File:W110.jpg|thumb|160px|Mercedes Benz (W110)]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz 220D, circa 1974, Schaffen Diest, Fly-Drive 2013.JPG|thumb|160px|Mercedes-Benz (W115)]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz W123 front 20080822.jpg|thumb|160px|Mercedes-Benz (W123)]]\n=== W120 (1953\u20131962) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W120}}\n\nThe first modern midsize Mercedes was the [[Mercedes-Benz W120|W120 'Ponton' 180]] of 1953 and was produced  until 1962. Sharing its engineering with the [[Mercedes-Benz R121|R121]] 190 SL of 1955, the Ponton was a stylish sedan with a [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder engine]]. A larger-engined [[Mercedes-Benz W121|W121 190]] appeared in 1958.\n\n=== W110 (1961\u20131968) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W110}}\n\nMercedes added tailfins to both the big [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]] and the new [[Mercedes-Benz W110|W110 'Fintail' 190]] of 1962. In the 1965 230 model a [[Straight-6]] engine appeared for the first time, and the four cylinder engine grew in displacement.\n\n=== W114, W115 (1968\u20131976) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W114}}\n\nThe midsize Mercedes was redesigned in 1968 as the [[Mercedes-Benz W114|W114/W115 'Stroke-8']]. This time, the 6-cylinder models (The W114s) were most prevalent, with the W115 line making up the bottom of the company's offerings with four \u2013 and [[Straight-5|five-cylinder]] power. [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] engines joined the line-up, as did a [[coup\u00e9]] body.\n\n=== W123 (1976\u20131986) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W123}}\n\nThe popular [[Mercedes-Benz W123|W123]] quickly became a best-seller on its launch in 1976. Especially in [[Diesel engine|diesel powered]] 200D and 240D (also the five-cylinder 300D) guises, the cars enhanced the company's reputation for product quality. Over 2.6 million were produced until the end of production in 1986.\nSaloon/Sedan, Coup\u00e9 and Estate body configurations were offered.\n\nThe engine is an M103 3.2 liter DOHC 4-valve 6-cylinder in-line cylinder with 220 horsepower.It is not a prominent specification at the moment, but at the time it was a 3 liter class engine with a good color appearance and a high performance as a smooth & powerful engine. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://antiquecars.info/mercedes-benz-e-class-320|title=Mercedes Benz E Class 320|publisher=antiquecars.info |accessdate=2020-03-21</ref>\n\n=== W124 (1986\u20131994) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W124}}\n\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] was presented in 1984 and introduced several new standards for a mid-size Mercedes.  It was the third car to inherit the company's new design theme since the late 1970s, following the flagship [[Mercedes-Benz W126|W126]] and compact [[Mercedes-Benz W201|W201]]. \n\nSimilar to its predecessors, the W124 also offered a coup\u00e9 and estate body styles. A new convertible (internally A124) was also available, making it the first mid-size Mercedes convertible.\n\n== E-Class ==\n\n=== First generation (W124; 1993\u20131995) ===\n\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz W124}}\n[[File:94-95 Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan.jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz W124 (sedan)]]\nThe \"E-Class\" name first appeared in with the facelifted [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] in 1993 for the model year 1994 (the W124 was introduced in 1984 but continued with the older naming convention until 1993, when all Mercedes-Benz models switched to a new system, e.g. E 320 instead of 300 E). The diesel versions continued to be the fuel economy option over the four and six-cylinder gasoline engines, and the gasoline [[V8 engine]]s (available after 1992) increased gasoline power outputs further. Four-cylinder gasoline models were not marketed in the United States. The V8 powered sedans/saloons were named 400 E/500 E from 1992\u20131993, and E 420/E 500 after 1993. Likewise, the 3.0-litre cars (e.g. 300 E) were also re-badged to E 320 with the new 3.2-litre ''M104'' engines and naming rationalization of 1994. For the diesel models the name change was less elegant, with the 250 D becoming the E 250 Diesel for example.\n\nSedan (W124), Coup\u00e9 (C124), Convertible (A124) and Estate (S124) body configurations were offered.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Second generation (W210; 1996\u20132002) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W210)}}\n[[File:1998 Mercedes-Benz E200 Elegance Automatic 2.0.jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz E 200 Elegance (United Kingdom; W210)]]\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W210)|W210]] E-Class, launched in 1995, brought the line firmly into the upper end of the mid-size luxury market. In September 1999 the W210 E-class was facelifted. This included visual, mechanical and quality improvements over the earlier versions.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class was ''[[Motor Trend]]'''s [[Import Car of the Year]] for 1996.\n\nWhile the W210 sedan was replaced by the W211 in 2002, the wagon version continued to be sold until March 2003 when the W211 wagon replaced the W210 wagon.\n\n=== Third generation (W211; 2003\u20132009) ===\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W211)}}\n[[File:Mercedes E 220 CDI Classic (W211) front 20100509.jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz E 220 CDI Classic (Europe)]]\nLaunched in 2002, the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W211)|W211]] E-Class was another evolution of the previous model.  \n\nThe W211-based [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class (W219)|W219 CLS-Class]] sedan was introduced as a niche model in 2005, primarily to attract a younger demographic.\n\nThe W211 E-Class was facelifted in June 2006 for the 2007 [[model year]] to address quality and technical issues raised by earlier models, [[Sensotronic]] was dropped, while [[precrash system|Pre-Safe]] (w/o brake support) was made standard. The largest factory built engine in the E-class range is the E500 (badged E550 in the U.S.) which had its engine size increased from 5 litres to 5.5 litres in 2006 along with the facelift. There is also an AMG model badged E63 [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] and other tuning house installations.\n\nIn 2007 the diesel version of the E-Class was rebadged from CDI (Common rail Direct Injection) to Bluetec. While in some of the other Mercedes-Benz diesels urea injection was added, in the W211 E-Class the Bluetec name was only adopted to prevent confusion in the diesel lineup.\n\n=== Fourth generation (2010-2016) ===\n\n==== Sedan and wagon (W212) ====\n{{main article|Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W212)}}\n[[File:2009 Mercedes-Benz E 250 CGI (W 212) Avantgarde sedan (2010-07-05).jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz E 250 CGI Avantgarde (Australia; W212)]]\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W212)|W212]] replaced the W211 in 2009 (as a 2010 model).

The school's grounds cover {{convert|36|acre|ha}} situated on the edge of Ascot (actually in [[Bracknell Forest]]), providing access from London, the major airports, the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]] and [[M4 motorway]]s.\n\n==History==\n===Heathfield Ascot===\nThe school stands in 36 acres of grounds on the outskirts of Ascot and has done so since Heathfield School was founded in 1899 by Eleanor Beatrice Wyatt, its first headmistress. In 1882, at the age of 24, Miss Wyatt and her mother had opened [[Queen's Gate School]] in [[South Kensington]], London.<ref>[http://www.heathfieldschool.net/stylesheet.asp?file=121_our_history Our History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312083445/http://www.heathfieldschool.net/stylesheet.asp?file=121_our_history |date=12 March 2012 }}, heathfieldschool.net; accessed 12 November 2014.</ref>\n\nUntil this point Miss Wyatt had been concentrating on educating boys and girls from the lower-middle and lower classes; however, she was convinced that the best way to further education for all was to educate those who could in turn educate others. This coincided with Miss Wyatt's desire to move out of a congested and claustrophobic London. The problem she faced was that, whilst wishing to move to a more spacious country location, she still wanted to maintain a proximity to London and the school's active Old Girl network. In 1899 the solution was found in Ascot, Berkshire, and Heathfield School was founded in a beautiful Italianate building, the original home of the Paravacini family. On 8 May, the school was officially opened and the Chapel blessed. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===St Mary's Wantage===\n{{Main|St Mary's School, Wantage}}\nThe Reverend William John Butler became Vicar of Wantage on 1 January 1847. His main aims were, first, to revive the religious life in England and second, to improve education. He hoped to achieve these aims by setting up an order of teaching sisters, but he faced many disappointments and spent 25 years trying to improve various day schools in the parish before St Mary's School was founded in 1873. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe school was run by the sisters of the [[Community of St. Mary the Virgin]] and was based in the Queen Anne house on Newbury Street. Sister Ellen was the first Sister-in-Charge and Sister Juliana succeeded her in 1887. Sister Juliana had studied at Cambridge and set a high standard for the girls, entering them for the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations.\n\nSister Annie Louisa joined the school in 1898 and started a guide movement called Scout Patrols in 1899 before Boy Scouts had even begun. She succeeded Sister Juliana as Headmistress in 1903. Sister Annie Louisa was responsible for the chief structural improvements at St Mary's including a science wing and the conversion of an old barn into a gymnasium. By the time Sister Annie Louisa left in 1919, St Mary's was recognised as a \u201cpublic school with an unusually high standard of scholarship\u201d.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe school is equipped with teaching, sporting and leisure facilities.  Following the merger of Heathfield School and St Mary's Wantage in 2006, a development plan was launched which delivered new facilities.  Phase one of redevelopment, the enlargement of the main Library, and phase two, a new Cookery building and Performing Arts Centre, were completed in 2009.  The Performing Arts Centre was officially opened in December 2009 as the St Mary's Theatre.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, work started on a new STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) building, providing a hub for the girls to study science subjects.<ref>[http://www.heathfieldschool.net/about-us/new-stem-building/ New STEM Building]</ref>  At the same time, the Spectrum (Learning Support and English as a Foreign Language) facility was moved and greatly expanded into four smart new classrooms and a meeting area.  At the beginning of Michaelmas term 2015, the STEM building was completed and teaching in the new classrooms commenced.  The eight classrooms comprise four Science Labs, two Maths classrooms, Psychology and PE classrooms.  There is also a Science Prep room for the preparation of experiments.  All classrooms are equipped with interactive SMARTboards, the four Labs receiving 65\" HD touch displays.\n\nThe school focuses on keeping the class sizes small which helps to focus on individual learning.\n\n==Academic==\nThe 2018 [[Independent Schools Inspectorate|ISI]] Inspection report noted that \"The quality of pupils' academic and other achievements is excellent\" and commended the pupils' enthusiastic committed approach to their learning.<ref>[http://isischools.devprocess.com/DownloadReport.aspx?t=c&r=EQI6526_20180227.pdf&s=6526 2018 ISI Inspection Report]</ref>  It also found the quality of the pupils' personal development excellent.  \"The overall achievement of the pupils is excellent and represents the successful fulfilment of the school's ambitious aims.\"\n\n==Houses==\nAll girls are placed in one of the four houses upon entry.

in [[Ascot, Berkshire]], [[England]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Schools Guide 2013 - Heathfield School|url=http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2013/public/heathfield-school|publisher=[[Tatler]]}}</ref> In 2006, the school absorbed [[St Mary's School, Wantage]] and was briefly named '''Heathfield St Mary's School''' but reverted to Heathfield School in 2009 to try to avoid confusion with the nearby [[St Mary's School, Ascot]]. The school's grounds cover {{convert|36|acre|ha}} situated on the edge of Ascot (actually in [[Bracknell Forest]]), providing access from London, the major airports, the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]] and [[M4 motorway]]s.\n\n==History==\n===Heathfield Ascot===\nThe school stands in 36 acres of grounds on the outskirts of Ascot and has done so since Heathfield School was founded in 1899 by Eleanor Beatrice Wyatt, its first headmistress. In 1882, at the age of 24, Miss Wyatt and her mother had opened [[Queen's Gate School]] in [[South Kensington]], London.<ref>[http://www.heathfieldschool.net/stylesheet.asp?file=121_our_history Our History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312083445/http://www.heathfieldschool.net/stylesheet.asp?file=121_our_history |date=12 March 2012 }}, heathfieldschool.net; accessed 12 November 2014.</ref>\n\nUntil this point Miss Wyatt had been concentrating on educating boys and girls from the lower-middle and lower classes; however, she was convinced that the best way to further education for all was to educate those who could in turn educate others. This coincided with Miss Wyatt's desire to move out of a congested and claustrophobic London. The problem she faced was that, whilst wishing to move to a more spacious country location, she still wanted to maintain a proximity to London and the school\u2019s active Old Girl network. In 1899 the solution was found in Ascot, Berkshire, and Heathfield School was founded in a beautiful Italianate building, the original home of the Paravacini family. On 8 May, the school was officially opened and the Chapel blessed. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===St Mary's Wantage===\n{{Main|St Mary's School, Wantage}}\nThe Reverend William John Butler became Vicar of Wantage on 1 January 1847. His main aims were, first, to revive the religious life in England and second, to improve education. He hoped to achieve these aims by setting up an order of teaching sisters, but he faced many disappointments and spent 25 years trying to improve various day schools in the parish before St Mary\u2019s School was founded in 1873. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe school was run by the sisters of the [[Community of St. Mary the Virgin]] and was based in the Queen Anne house on Newbury Street. Sister Ellen was the first Sister-in-Charge and Sister Juliana succeeded her in 1887. Sister Juliana had studied at Cambridge and set a high standard for the girls, entering them for the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations.\n\nSister Annie Louisa joined the school in 1898 and started a guide movement called Scout Patrols in 1899 before Boy Scouts had even begun. She succeeded Sister Juliana as Headmistress in 1903. Sister Annie Louisa was responsible for the chief structural improvements at St Mary\u2019s including a science wing and the conversion of an old barn into a gymnasium. By the time Sister Annie Louisa left in 1919, St Mary\u2019s was recognised as a \u201cpublic school with an unusually high standard of scholarship\u201d.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe school is equipped with teaching, sporting and leisure facilities.  Following the merger of Heathfield School and St Mary\u2019s Wantage in 2006, a development plan was launched which delivered new facilities.  Phase one of redevelopment, the enlargement of the main Library, and phase two, a new Cookery building and Performing Arts Centre, were completed in 2009.  The Performing Arts Centre was officially opened in December 2009 as the St Mary's Theatre.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, work started on a new STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) building, providing a hub for the girls to study science subjects.<ref>[http://www.heathfieldschool.net/about-us/new-stem-building/ New STEM Building]</ref>  At the same time, the Spectrum (Learning Support and English as a Foreign Language) facility was moved and greatly expanded into four smart new classrooms and a meeting area.  At the beginning of Michaelmas term 2015, the STEM building was completed and teaching in the new classrooms commenced.  The eight classrooms comprise four Science Labs, two Maths classrooms, Psychology and PE classrooms.  There is also a Science Prep room for the preparation of experiments.  All classrooms are equipped with interactive SMARTboards, the four Labs receiving 65\" HD touch displays.\n\nThe school focuses on keeping the class sizes small which helps to focus on individual learning.\n\n==Academic==\nThe 2018 [[Independent Schools Inspectorate|ISI]] Inspection report noted that \"The quality of pupils' academic and other achievements is excellent\" and commended the pupils' enthusiastic committed approach to their learning.<ref>[http://isischools.devprocess.com/DownloadReport.aspx?t=c&r=EQI6526_20180227.pdf&s=6526 2018 ISI Inspection Report]</ref>  It also found the quality of the pupils' personal development excellent.  \"The overall achievement of the pupils is excellent and represents the successful fulfilment of the school's ambitious aims.\"\n\n==Houses==\nAll girls are placed in one of the four houses upon entry. A Head of House looks after the girls and is the first point of contact for parents and girls on issues.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120802001823/http://www.heathfieldschool.net/stylesheet.asp?file=431_the_house_system House System]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

While the Indian policemen fighting the militants had [[Lee\u2013Enfield|.303 Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles that were popular in the World war II and only a few of them had [[FN FAL|7.62 1A]] self loading rifles. These weapons were outmatched by automatic AK-47s. Modern explosive arms were also supplied by the ISI. According to KPS Gill the terrorists mainly used crude bombs but since 1990s more modern explosives supplied by Pakistan had become widespread in usage among them. The number of casualties also increased with more explosives usage by the terrorists.<ref name=\"Kiessling\"/>\n\nA terrorist from [[Babbar Khalsa]] who had been arrested in early 1990s had informed Indian authorities about Pakistani ISI plans to use aeroplanes for Kamikaze attacks on Indian installations. The Sikhs however refused to participate in such operations on religious grounds as Sikhism prohibits suicide assassinations.<ref name=\"Kiessling\"/> Between 1981 and 1984 the Sikh terrorists had undertaken several aircraft hijackings. In a [[1984 Indian Airlines Airbus A300 hijacking|hijacking in 1984]] a German manufactured pistol was used and during the investigations, the German Intelligence Service BND confirmed that the weapon was part of a weapon consignment for Pakistani government. The American government had then issued warnings over the incident after which the [[List of hijackings of Indian aeroplanes|series of hijackings of Indian aeroplanes]] had stopped.<ref name=\"Kiessling\"/>\n\n==End of Violence==\nBetween 1987 and 1991, [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] was placed under an ineffective President's rule and was governed from [[Delhi]]. [[Elections]] were eventually held in 1992 but the voter turnout was poor. A new Congress(I) government was formed and it gave the [[police]] chief of the state [[KPS Gill|K.P.S. Gill]] a free hand.\n\nThe extremist violence had started with targeting of the Nirankaris and followed by attack on the government machinery and the Hindus. Ultimately the Sikh terrorists also targeted other Sikhs with opposing viewpoints. This led to further loss of public support and the militants were eventually brought under control of law enforcement agencies by 1993.<ref name=\"RediffOsama\"/>\nSince 1993, the Punjab insurgency has petered out, with a last major incident being the [[Beant Singh (Chief Minister)#Assassination|Assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh]] occurring in 1995.<ref name=\"Kiessling\"/>\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{main|Timeline of the Punjab insurgency}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+ '''Punjab Insurgancy Chronology Outline'''\n|-\n!

Ultimately the Sikh terrorists also targeted other Sikhs with opposing viewpoints.
