The [[First Battle of El Alamein]] and the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] had prevented the [[Axis powers|Axis]] from advancing further into Egypt.\n\nIn August 1942, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] had been sacked as Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]] and his successor, Lieutenant-General [[William Gott]] was killed on his way to replace him as commander of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]. [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] was appointed and led the Eighth Army offensive.\n\nThe Allied victory was the beginning of the end of the [[Western Desert Campaign]], eliminating the Axis threat to [[Egypt]], the [[Suez Canal]] and the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields. The battle revived the morale of the Allies, being the first big success against the Axis since [[Operation Crusader]] in late 1941. The battle coincided with the Allied invasion of [[French North Africa]] in [[Operation Torch]] on 8 November, the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}\n{{Further|Second Battle of El Alamein order of battle}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-443-1589-07, Nordafrika, Rommel in Befehlsfahrzeug.jpg|thumb|[[Erwin Rommel]] (left) in his [[Sd.Kfz. 250|Sd.Kfz. 250/3]] command halftrack.]]\n[[Panzer Army Africa]] ({{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}}/{{lang|it|Armata Corazzata Africa}}, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]), composed of German and Italian tank and infantry units, had advanced into [[Egypt]] after its success at the [[Battle of Gazala]] (26 May \u2013 21 June 1942). The Axis advance menaced British control of the [[Suez Canal]], the Middle East and its oil resources. [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] withdrew the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] to within {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[Alexandria]] where the [[Qattara Depression]] was {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[El Alamein]] on the coast. The depression was impassable and meant that any attack had to be frontal; Axis attacks in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] (1\u201327 July) were defeated.\n\nEighth Army counter-attacks in July also failed, as the Axis forces dug in and regrouped. Auchinleck called off the attacks at the end of July to rebuild the army. In early August, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]] and General Sir [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), visited [[Cairo]] and replaced Auchinleck as [[Commander-in-chief]] [[Middle East Command]] with General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]]. [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[William Gott]] was made commander of the Eighth Army but was killed when his transport aircraft was shot down by ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters; Lieutenant-General [[Bernard Montgomery]] was flown from Britain to replace him.\n\nLacking reinforcements and depending on small, underdeveloped ports for supplies, aware of a huge [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] reinforcement operation for the Eighth Army, Rommel decided to attack first. The two armoured divisions of the ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' and the reconnaissance units of {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} led the attack but were repulsed at the Alam el Halfa ridge and Point 102 on 30 August 1942 during the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] and the Axis forces retired to their start lines. The short front line and secure flanks favoured the [[Axis powers|Axis]] defence and Rommel had time to develop the Axis  defences, sowing extensive [[minefield]]s with {{circa|500,000}} mines and miles of [[barbed wire]].{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2003|p=255}} Alexander and Montgomery intended to establish a superiority of force sufficient to achieve a [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] and exploit it to destroy {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}}. Earlier in the [[Western Desert Campaign]], neither side had been able to exploit a local victory sufficiently to defeat its opponent before it had withdrawn and transferred the problem of over-extended supply lines to the victor.\n\nThe British had an intelligence advantage because [[Ultra]] and local sources exposed the Axis order of battle, its supply position and intentions. A reorganisation of military intelligence in Africa in July had also improved the integration of information received from all sources and the speed of its dissemination.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=425}} With rare exceptions, intelligence identified the supply ships destined for North Africa, their location or routing and in most cases their cargoes, allowing them to be attacked.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=423}} By 25 October, {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} was down to three days' supply of fuel, only two days' worth of which were east of Tobruk. [[Harry Hinsley]], the official historian of British intelligence wrote in 1981 that \"The Panzer Army...&nbsp;did not possess the operational freedom of movement that was absolutely essential in consideration of the fact that the British offensive can be expected to start any day\".{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}} Submarine and air transport somewhat eased the shortage of ammunition and by late October, there was sixteen days' supply at the front.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}} After six more weeks, the Eighth Army was ready; {{nowrap|195,000 men}} and {{nowrap|1,029 tanks}} began the offensive against the {{nowrap|116,000 men}} and {{nowrap|547 tanks}} of the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}}.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied plan===\n\n====Operation Lightfoot====\nMontgomery's plan was for a main attack to the north of the line and a secondary attack to the south, involving [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Oliver Leese]]) and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]]), while [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Herbert Lumsden]]) was to exploit the success.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|1994|p=219}} With Operation Lightfoot, Montgomery intended to cut two corridors through the Axis minefields in the north. One corridor was to run south-west through the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] sector towards the centre of Miteirya Ridge, while the second was to run west, passing {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the west end of the Miteirya Ridge across the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian]] and [[51st (Highland) Division]] sectors.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=34}} Tanks would then pass through and defeat the German armour. Diversions at Ruweisat Ridge in the centre and also the south of the line would keep the rest of the Axis forces from moving northwards. Montgomery expected a 12-day battle in three stages: the break-in, the dogfight and the final breaking of the enemy.{{sfn|Dear|2005|p=254}}\n\nFor the first night of the offensive, Montgomery planned for four infantry divisions of XXX Corps to advance on a {{convert|26|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} front to the Oxalic Line, over-running the forward Axis defences. Engineers would clear and mark the two lanes through the minefields, through which the armoured divisions from X Corps would pass to gain the Pierson Line. They would rally and consolidate their position just west of the infantry positions, blocking an Axis tank counter-attack. The British tanks would then advance to ''Skinflint'', astride the north\u2013south Rahman Track deep in the Axis defensive system, to challenge the Axis armour.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=34}} The infantry battle would continue as the Eighth Army infantry \"crumbled\" the deep Axis defensive fortifications (three successive lines of fortification had been constructed) and destroy any tanks that attacked them.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=430\u2013431}}{{efn|The [[Polish Mine Detector]] designed in Scotland in 1941 by the Polish engineer and signals officer, Lieutnant [[J\u00f3zef Kosacki]] was to be used for the first time in action. Five hundred of these were issued to Eighth Army. The apparatus doubled the speed at which heavily mined sands could be cleared, from around {{convert|100|m|yd}} to about {{convert|200|m|yd|abbr=on}} an hour.{{sfn|Modelski|1986|p=221}}}}\n\n====Operation Bertram====\n\n{{main|Operation Bertram}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces practised a number of deceptions in the months before the battle to confuse the Axis command as to the whereabouts of the forthcoming battle and when the battle was likely to occur. This operation was code-named [[Operation Bertram]]. In September, they dumped waste materials (discarded packing cases, etc.) under camouflage nets in the northern sector, making them appear to be ammunition or ration dumps. The Axis naturally noticed these but, as no offensive action immediately followed and the \"dumps\" did not change in appearance, they were subsequently ignored. This allowed Eighth Army to build up supplies in the forward area unnoticed by the Axis, by replacing the rubbish with ammunition, petrol or rations at night. Meanwhile, a dummy pipeline was built, hopefully leading the Axis to believe the attack would occur much later than it, in fact, did and much further south. To further the illusion, dummy tanks consisting of plywood frames placed over jeeps were constructed and deployed in the south. In a reverse [[feint]], the tanks destined for battle in the north were disguised as supply trucks by placing removable plywood superstructures over them.{{sfn|Lucas|1983|p=123}}\n\n====Operation Braganza====\n\n{{main|Operation Braganza}}\n\nAs a preliminary, the [[131st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|131st (Queen's) Infantry Brigade]] of the [[44th (Home Counties) Division|44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division]], supported by tanks from the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th Armoured Brigade]], launched [[Operation Braganza]] attacking the [[185th Airborne Division Folgore]] on the night of 29/30 September in an attempt to capture the Deir el Munassib area. The Italian [[paratrooper]]s repelled the attack, killing or capturing over 300 of the attackers.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=269}} It was wrongly assumed that ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (German paratroopers) had manned the defences and been responsible for the British reverse. The ''Afrika Korps'' war diary notes that the Italian paratroops \"bore the brunt of the attack. It fought well and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.\"<ref>Afrika Korps War Diary, 30 September 1942</ref>\n\n===Axis plan===\n[[File:2 Battle of El Alamein 001.png|thumb|Deployment of forces on the eve of battle.]]\nWith the failure of the offensive at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, the Axis forces went onto the defensive but losses had not been excessive. The Axis supply line from [[Tripoli]] was extremely long and captured Allied supplies and equipment had been exhausted, but Rommel decided to advance into Egypt.{{sfn|Creveld|1997|p=196}}{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=111-116}}\n\nThe Eighth Army was being supplied with men and materials from the United Kingdom, India, Australia and New Zealand, as well as with trucks and the new [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] from the United States. Rommel continued to request equipment, supplies and fuel but the priority of the German war effort was the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and very limited supplies reached North Africa<!--really?-->. Rommel was ill and in early September, arrangements were made for him to return to Germany on sick leave and for ''[[General der Panzertruppe]]'' [[Georg Stumme]] to transfer from the Russian front to take his place. Before he left for Germany on 23 September, Rommel organised the defence and wrote a long appreciation of the situation to ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW armed forces high command), once again setting out the essential needs of the Panzer Army.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=26}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-009-34, Georg Stumme.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|left|[[Georg Stumme]] in 1940.]]\nRommel knew that the British Commonwealth forces would soon be strong enough to attack. His only hope now relied on the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German forces]] fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] quickly to defeat the [[Red Army]], then move south through the [[Caucasus|Trans-Caucasus]] and threaten Iran (Persia) and the Middle East. If successful, large numbers of British and Commonwealth forces would have to be sent from the Egyptian front to reinforce the Ninth Army in Iran, leading to the postponement of any offensive against his army. Rommel hoped to convince OKW to reinforce his forces for the eventual link-up between {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} and the German armies fighting in southern Russia, enabling them finally to defeat the British and Commonwealth armies in North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIn the meantime, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} dug in and waited for the attack by the Eighth Army or the defeat of the Red Army at Stalingrad. Rommel added depth to his defences by creating at least two belts of mines about {{convert|5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} apart, connected at intervals to create boxes ([[Devil's gardens]]) which would restrict enemy penetration and deprive British armour of room for manoeuvre. The front face of each box was lightly held by battle outposts and the rest of the box was unoccupied but sowed with mines and explosive traps and covered by enfilading fire.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=432\u2013433}} The main defensive positions were built to a depth of at least {{convert|2|km|mi}} behind the second mine belt.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=27\u201328}} The Axis laid around half a million mines, mostly [[Teller mine|Teller anti-tank mines]] with some smaller anti-personnel types (such as the [[S-mine]]). (Many of these mines were British, and had been captured at Tobruk). To lure enemy vehicles into the minefields, the Italians dragged an axle and tyres through the fields using a long rope to create what appeared to be well-used tracks.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2003|p=255}}\n\n[[File:Ettore Bastico.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Marshal Ettore Bastico|alt=]]\nRommel did not want the British armour to break out into the open because he had neither the strength of numbers nor fuel to match them in a battle of manoeuvre. The battle had to be fought in the fortified zones; a breakthrough had to be defeated quickly. Rommel stiffened his forward lines by alternating German and Italian infantry formations. Because the Allied deception confused the Axis as to the point of attack, Rommel departed from his usual practice of holding his armoured strength in a concentrated reserve and split it into a northern group ([[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer]] and [[133rd Armoured Division Littorio|''Littorio'' Division]]) and a southern group ([[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer]] and [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|''Ariete'' Division]]), each organised into [[Battlegroup (army)|battle groups]] to be able to make a quick armoured intervention wherever the blow fell and prevent narrow breakthroughs from being enlarged. A significant proportion of his armoured reserve was dispersed and held unusually far forward. The 15th Panzer Division had 125 operational tanks (16 Pz.IIs, 43 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 6 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F) while the 21st Panzer Division had 121 operational combat vehicles (12 Pz.IIs, 38 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 2 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F).{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=8}}\n\nRommel held the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]] further back and kept the [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|''Trieste'' Motorised Division]] in reserve near the coast.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=28\u201329}} Rommel hoped to move his troops faster than the Allies, to concentrate his defences at the most important point ({{lang|de|Schwerpunkt}}) but lack of fuel meant that once the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} had concentrated, it would not be able to move again because of lack of fuel.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=20}} The British were well aware that Rommel would be unable to mount a defence based on his usual manoeuvre tactics but no clear picture emerged of how he would fight the battle and British plans seriously underestimated the Axis defences and the fighting power of the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}}<!--really?-->.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=431}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Phase one: the break-in===\n[[File:The Campaign in North Africa 1940-1943 E18469.jpg|thumb|left|British night artillery barrage which opened the second Battle of El Alamein]]\nPrior to the main barrage, there was a diversion by the [[24th Brigade (Australia)|24th Australian Brigade]], which involved the 15th Panzer Division being subjected to heavy fire for a few minutes.{{sfn|Latimer|2002|p=177}} Then at 21:40 (Egyptian Summer Time) on 23 October{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=304}} on a calm, clear evening under the bright sky of a full moon, Operation Lightfoot began with a 1,000-gun barrage.  The fire plan had been arranged so that the first rounds from the 882 guns from the field and medium batteries would land along the {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} front at the same time.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=308}} After twenty minutes of general bombardment, the guns switched to precision targets in support of the advancing infantry.{{sfn|Clifford|1943|p=307}} The shelling plan continued for five and a half hours, by the end of which each gun had fired about 600 rounds, about 529,000 shells.\n\nOperation Lightfoot alluded to the infantry attacking first. Anti-tank mines would not be tripped by soldiers stepping on them since they were too light. As the infantry advanced, engineers had to clear a path for the tanks coming behind.

The objective was to establish a bridgehead before dawn at the imaginary line in the desert where the strongest enemy defences were situated, on the far side of the second mine belt. Once the infantry reached the first minefields, the mine sweepers, including Reconnaissance Corps troops and [[sapper]]s, moved in to create a passage for the armoured divisions of X Corps. Progress was slower than planned but at 02:00, the first of the 500 tanks crawled forward. By 04:00, the lead tanks were in the minefields, where they stirred up so much dust that there was no visibility at all, traffic jams developed and tanks bogged down. Only about half of the infantry attained their objectives and none of the tanks broke through.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=438}}\n\n[[File:Paracadutista El Alamein14.jpg|thumb|upright|Original military uniform of an Italian paratrooper of the division Folgore in 1942]]\nThe [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] (with one Free French Brigade under command) from  XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks) made a secondary attack to the south.

Allied air activity that night focused on Rommel's northern armoured group, where {{convert|135|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped.

Axis forces were firmly entrenched in most of their original battle positions and the battle was at a standstill. Montgomery decided that the planned advance southward from Miteirya Ridge by the New Zealanders would be too costly and instead decided that XXX Corps\u2014while keeping firm hold of Miteirya\u2014should strike northward toward the coast with 9th Australian Division. Meanwhile, 1st Armoured Division\u2014on the Australians' left\u2014should continue to attack west and north-west, and activity to the south on both Corps fronts would be confined to patrolling.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=47}} The battle would be concentrated at the Kidney feature and Tel el Eisa until a breakthrough occurred.\n\n[[File:RAF Baltimore bombing El Daba airfield.jpg|thumb|right|RAF [[Martin Baltimore|Baltimore]] of No. 223 Squadron bombing El Daba airfield in support of the Alamein offensive]]\nBy early morning, the Axis forces launched a series of attacks using 15th Panzer and ''Littorio'' divisions. The Panzer Army was probing for a weakness, but without success. When the sun set the Allied infantry went on the attack. Around midnight, 51st Division launched three attacks, but no one knew exactly where they were. Pandemonium and carnage ensued, resulting in the loss of over 500 Allied troops, and leaving only one officer among the attacking forces.

The Italian [[102 Motorised Division Trento|''Trento'' Division]] had lost 50 per cent of its infantry and most of its artillery, the 164th Light Division had lost two battalions.

A mile north-west of the feature was Outpost Woodcock and roughly the same distance south-west lay Outpost Snipe. An attack was planned on these areas using two battalions from 7th Motor Brigade. At 23:00 on 26 October 2 Battalion, [[The Rifle Brigade]] would attack Snipe and 2nd Battalion [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (KRRC) would attack Woodcock. The plan was for 2nd Armoured Brigade to pass round the north of Woodcock the following dawn and 24th Armoured Brigade round the south of Snipe. The attack was to be supported by all the available artillery of both X and XXX Corps.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nBoth battalions had difficulty finding their way in the dark and dust. At dawn, the KRRC had not reached its objective and had to find cover and dig in some distance from Woodcock. 2nd Rifle Brigade had had better fortune and after following the shell bursts of the supporting artillery dug in when they concluded they had reached their objective having encountered little opposition.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=54}}\n\nAt 06:00, the 2nd Armoured Brigade commenced its advance and ran into such stiff opposition that, by noon, it had still not linked with the KRRC. The 24th Armoured Brigade started a little later and was soon in contact with the Rifle Brigade (having shelled them in error for a while). Some hours of confused fighting ensued involving tanks from the ''Littorio'' and troops and anti-tank guns from 15th Panzer which managed to keep the British armour at bay in spite of the support of the Rifle Brigade battle group's anti-tank guns. Rommel had decided to make two counter-attacks using his fresh troops. 90th Light Division was to make a fresh attempt to capture Point 29 and 21st Panzer were targeted at Snipe (the ''Ariete'' detachment had returned south).{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nAt Snipe, mortar and shellfire was constant all day long. At 16:00, Rommel launched his major attack. German and Italian tanks moved forward. Against them the Rifle Brigade had 13 6-pounder anti-tank guns along with six more from the supporting 239th Anti-Tank Battery, RA. Although on the point of being overrun more than once they held their ground, destroying 22 German and 10 Italian tanks.

By 01:30 on 28 October, the 4th battalion [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] judged they were on Woodcock and dug in. At dawn, 2nd Armoured Brigade moved up in support but before contact could be made 4th Royal Sussex were counter-attacked and overrun with many losses. Meanwhile, the Lorried Brigade's two other battalions had moved on Snipe and dug in, only to find out the next day that they were in fact well short of their objective.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nFurther north, the 90th Light Division's attack on Point 29 during the afternoon of 27 October failed under heavy artillery and bombing which broke up the attack before it had closed with the Australians.

Late on 27 October, the British 133rd Brigade was sent forward to recover lost positions but the next day, a good part of this force was overrun by German and Italian tanks from the Littorio and supporting [[12th Bersaglieri Regiment]] and several hundred British soldiers were captured.{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=166}} On the night of 28/29 October, the [[Australian 9th Division|9th Australian Division]] was ordered to make a second set-piece attack. The [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Australian Infantry Brigade]] with 40th R.T.R. in support would push north-west from Point 29 to form a base for [[26th Brigade (Australia)|26th Australian Infantry Brigade]] with 46th R.T.R. in support,  to attack north-east to an Axis location south of the railway known as Thompson's Post and then over the railway to the coast road, where they would advance south-east to close on the rear of the Axis troops in the coastal salient.

The infantry and tanks lost touch with each other in fighting with the 125th ''Panzergrenadier'' Regiment and a battalion of [[7th Bersaglieri Regiment]] sent to reinforce the sector and the advance came to a halt.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=58}} The Australians suffered 200 casualties in that attack and suffered 27 killed and 290 wounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/remembering1942/alamein23/transcript.htm |title=The Battle of El Alamein, 23 October 1942|work=Remembering 1942|first=Dr. Mark|last= Johnston|publisher=Australian War Memorial, Canberra|date=23 October 2002|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> The German and Italian forces that had participated in the counter-attack formed an outpost and held on until the arrival of German reinforcements on 1 November.\n\n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E18684.jpg|thumb|British Grant tank moving up to the front, 29 October 1942]]\nIt became clear that there were no longer enough hours of darkness left to reform, continue the attack and see it to its conclusion, so the operation was called off. By the end of these engagements in late October, the British had 800 tanks still in operation, while the ''Panzerarmee'' day report for 28 October (intercepted and read by Eighth Army the following evening) recorded 81 serviceable German tanks and 197 Italian.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=441}} With the help of signals intelligence information the ''Proserpina'' (carrying 4,500 tonnes of fuel) and ''Tergestea'' (carrying 1,000 tonnes of fuel and 1,000 tonnes of ammunition) had been destroyed on 26 October and the tanker ''Luisiano'' (carrying 2,500 tonnes of fuel) had been sunk off the west coast of Greece by a torpedo from a Wellington bomber on 28 October.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=58, 63}} Rommel told his commanders, \"It will be quite impossible for us to disengage from the enemy. There is no gasoline for such a manoeuvre.

Montgomery determined therefore that it would take place further south on a {{convert|4000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} front south of Point 29. The attack was to take place on the night of 31 October/1 November, as soon as he had completed the reorganisation of his front line to create the reserves needed for the offensive (although in the event it was postponed by 24 hours). To keep Rommel's attention on the coastal sector, Montgomery ordered the renewal of the 9th Australian Division operation on the night of 30/31 October.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=59}}\n\n====D + 7\u20139: 30 October \u2013 1 November====\n[[File:Montgomery watches his tanks move up.jpg|thumb|[[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] watches Allied tanks advance (November 1942)]]\nThe night of 30 October saw a continuation of previous Australian plans, their third attempt to reach the paved road. Although not all the objectives were achieved, by the end of the night they were astride the road and the railway, making the position of the Axis troops in the salient precarious. Rommel brought up a battlegroup from ''21. Panzer-Division'' and on 31 October, launched four successive attacks against \"Thompson's Post\". The fighting was intense and often hand-to-hand, but no ground was gained by the Axis forces.

His fuel state continued to be critical: on 1 November, two more supply ships\u2014the ''Tripolino'' and the ''Ostia''\u2014had been torpedoed and sunk from the air north-west of Tobruk. The shortage forced him to rely increasingly on fuel flown in from [[Crete]] on the orders of [[Albert Kesselring]], Luftwaffe ''[[OB S\u00fcd|Oberbefehlshaber S\u00fcd]]'' (''OB S\u00fcd'', Supreme Commander South), despite the restrictions imposed by heavy bombing of the airfields in Crete and the Desert Air Force's efforts to intercept the transport aircraft.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=63}}\n\nRommel began to plan a retreat anticipating retiring to Fuka, some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} west, as he had only 90 tanks remaining in stark contrast with the Allies' 800.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=261}} Large amounts of fuel arrived at Benghazi after the German forces had started to retreat, but little of it reached the front, a fact Kesselring tried to change by delivering it more closely to the fighting forces.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=26}}\n\n===Phase four: Operation Supercharge===\n\n====D + 10: 2 November====\n[[File:Priest of 1st Armoured Division in North Africa, 2 November 1942 (E 18869).jpg|thumb|A [[M7 Priest|Priest 105 mm self-propelled gun]] of the 1st Armoured Division preparing for action, 2 November 1942]]\nThis phase of the battle began at 01:00 on 2 November, with the objective of destroying enemy armour, forcing the enemy to fight in the open, reducing the Axis stock of petrol, attacking and occupying enemy supply routes, and causing the disintegration of the enemy army.

In addition, the division was to have [[British 9th Armoured Brigade]] under command.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nAs in Operation Lightfoot, it was planned that two infantry brigades (the 151st on the right and 152nd on the left) each this time supported by a regiment of tanks\u2014the 8th and 50th Royal Tank Regiments\u2014would advance and clear a path through the mines.

The division had left behind a ''panzergrenadier'' regiment which would bolster the [[101 Motorised Division Trieste|''Trieste'' Division]] which had been ordered forward to replace it. Rommel had also interspersed formations from the ''Trieste'' and 15th Panzer Divisions to \"corset\" his weaker forces in the front line. On 1 November the two German armoured divisions had 102 effective tanks to face Supercharge and the ''Littorio'' and ''Trieste'' Divisions had 65 tanks between them.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=445}}\n\nSupercharge started with a seven-hour aerial bombardment focused on Tel el Aqqaqir and [[Sidi Abdel Rahman|Sidi Abd el Rahman]], followed by a four and a half hour barrage of 360 guns firing 15,000 shells.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The two assault brigades started their attack at 01:05 on 2 November and gained most of their objectives to schedule and with moderate losses. On the right of the main attack 28th (Maori) battalion captured positions to protect the right flank of the newly formed salient and 133rd Lorried Infantry did the same on the left. New Zealand engineers cleared five lines through the mines allowing the [[Royal Dragoons]] armoured car regiment to slip out into the open and spend the day raiding the Axis communications.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=66}}\n\nThe 9th Armoured Brigade had started its approach march at 20:00 on 1 November from El Alamein railway station with around 130 tanks and arrived at its start line with only 94 runners (operational tanks). The brigade was to have started its attack towards Tel el Aqqaqir at 05:45 behind a barrage; the attack was postponed for 30 minutes while the brigade regrouped on [[John Cecil Currie|Currie's]] orders.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=387}} At 06:15, 30 minutes before dawn, the three regiments of the brigade advanced towards the gun line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n{{quote|We all realise that for armour to attack a wall of guns sounds like another [[Charge of the Light Brigade|Balaclava]], it is properly an infantry job.

The Axis gun screen started to inflict a steady amount of damage upon the advancing tanks but was unable to stop them; over the course of the next 30 minutes, around 35 guns were destroyed and several hundred prisoners taken. The 9th Armoured Brigade had started the attack with 94 tanks and was reduced to only 14 operational tanks{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=67}} and of the 400 tank crew involved in the attack, 230 were killed, wounded or captured.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=left\n|width=20%\n|quote=\"If the British armour owed any debt to the infantry of the Eighth Army, the debt was paid on November 2 by 9th Armoured in heroism and blood.\"{{sfn|Barr|2005|pp=388\u2013389}}\n|source=Bernard Montgomery, referring to the mistakes of the British armoured forces during the First Battle of El Alamein{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n|}}\n\nAfter the Brigade's action, Brigadier Gentry of 6th New Zealand Brigade went ahead to survey the scene.

At 11:00 on 2 November, the remains of 15th Panzer, 21st Panzer and ''Littorio'' Armoured Divisions counter-attacked 1st Armoured Division and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade, which by that time had dug in with a screen of anti-tank guns and artillery together with intensive air support. The counter-attack failed under a blanket of shells and bombs, resulting in a loss of some 100 tanks.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=24}}\n\n[[File:The Campaign in North Africa 1940-1943 E18485.jpg|thumb|German prisoners brought in from the battle]]\nAlthough X Corps had failed in its attempt to break out, it had succeeded in its objective of finding and destroying enemy tanks. Although tank losses were approximately equal, this represented only a portion of the total British armour, but most of Rommel's tanks; the ''Afrika Korps'' strength of tanks fit for battle fell by 70 while in addition to the losses of the 9th Armoured Brigade, the 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades lost 14 tanks in the fighting, with another 40 damaged or broken down. The fighting was later termed the \"Hammering of the Panzers\". In the late afternoon and early evening, the 133rd Lorried and 151st Infantry Brigades\u2014by this time back under command of 51st Infantry Division\u2014attacked respectively the Snipe and Skinflint (about a mile west of Snipe) positions in order to form a base for future operations. The heavy artillery concentration which accompanied their advance suppressed the opposition from the ''Trieste'' Division and the operation succeeded with few casualties.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=67\u201370}}\n\nOn the night of 2 November, Montgomery once again reshuffled his infantry in order to bring four brigades (5th Indian, 151st, 5th New Zealand and 154th) into reserve under XXX Corps to prepare for the next thrust. He also reinforced X Corps by moving 7th Armoured Division from army reserve and sending 4th Light Armoured Brigade from XIII Corps in the south. General von Thoma's report to Rommel that night said he would have at most 35 tanks available to fight the next day and his artillery and anti-tank weapons had been reduced to \u2153 of their strength at the start of the battle. Rommel concluded that to forestall a breakthrough and the resulting destruction of his whole army he must start withdrawing to the planned position at Fuka. He called up [[Italian 132nd Armored Division Ariete|''Ariete'']] from the south to join the mobile Italian XX Corps around Tel el Aqqaqir. His mobile forces (XX Corps, ''Afrika Korps'', 90th Light Division and 19th ''Flak'' Division) were ordered to make a fighting withdrawal while his other formations were to withdraw as best they could with the limited transport available.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=68\u201369}}\n\n====D + 11: 3 November====\nAt 20:30 on 2 November, Lumsden decided that one more effort by his X Corps would see the gun screen on the Rahman track defeated and ordered 7th Motor Brigade to seize the track along a {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} front north of Tell el Aqqaqir. The 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades would then pass through the infantry to a distance of about {{convert|3.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. On the morning of 3 November 7 Armoured Division would pass through and swing north heading for the railway at Ghazal station. 7th Motor Brigade set off at 01:15 on 3 November, but having received its orders late, had not had the chance to reconnoitre the battle area in daylight. This combined with stiff resistance led to the failure of their attack. As a consequence, the orders for the armour were changed and 2nd Armoured Brigade was tasked to support the forward battalion of 133rd Lorried Brigade (2nd King's Royal Rifle Corps) and 8th Armoured Brigade was to push south-west. Fighting continued throughout 3 November, but 2nd Armoured was held off by elements of the ''Afrika Korps'' and tanks of the ''Littorio'' Division.

The 5th Indian Infantry Brigade was to attack the track {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} further south during the early hours of 4 November; at 06:15, the 154th Infantry Brigade was to attack Tel el Aqqaqir. The 152nd Infantry Brigade was mistakenly told the Axis had withdrawn from their objectives and unexpectedly met determined resistance. Communications failed and the forward infantry elements ended up digging in well short of their objective. By the time the 5th Indian Brigade set off, the defenders had begun to withdraw and their objective was taken virtually unopposed.

By nightfall on 11 November, the Egyptian wall was clear but Montgomery was forced to order that the pursuit should temporarily be continued only by armoured cars and artillery, because of the difficulty in supplying larger formations west of Bardia.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\"\n!colspan=|Maps showing stages of the battle\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 002.png|Allied Forces attack: 10:00&nbsp;p.m. 23 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 003.png|Axis Armoured Divisions counter-attack: 6:00&nbsp;p.m. 24 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 004.png|Allies attempt to break through: night of 25 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 005.png|Axis counter-attack and attack by 9th Australian Division: afternoon, 25 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 006.png|''Folgore'' Parachutist Division attacked from three directions: 10:30&nbsp;p.m. 25 October to 3:00&nbsp;a.m. 26 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 007.png|Allies advance: 51st Highland Division takes Kidney Ridge, ''Littorio'' Armoured Division counter-attacks: 5:00&nbsp;p.m. 26 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 008.png|Both sides redeploy: night of 26 to 27 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 009.png|Axis fails to retake Kidney Ridge: 8:00&nbsp;a.m. 27 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 010.png|Allies attempt to push back ''Trento'' Division: 28 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 011.png|Rommel redeploys forces: 29 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 012.png|Operation Supercharge begins, 9th Australian fails to break through: 11:00&nbsp;p.m. 31 October 1942\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 013.png|Tank Battle of Tell el Aqqaqir: 9:00&nbsp;a.m. 2 November; Axis forces begin retreat: 10:00&nbsp;p.m. 2 November\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 014.png|Axis forces prepare to fall back: 3 November\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 015.png|Axis forces halt their retreat: 3 November\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 016.png|Allied forces break through: 7:00&nbsp;a.m. 4 November; ''Trento'', ''Bologna'' and ''Ariete'' Divisions destroyed, Axis forces flee\n</gallery>\n|}\nEl Alamein was an Allied victory,<!--''Decisive'' isn't supported by the citation--> although Rommel did not lose hope until the end of the [[Tunisia Campaign]]. Churchill said,\n\n{{quote|It may almost be said, \"Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat\".|sign=Winston Churchill.{{sfn|Churchill|1950|p=603}}}}\n\nThe Allies frequently had numerical superiority in the Western Desert but never had it been so complete in quantity and quality. With the arrival of [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]], [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|6-pounder]] anti-tank guns and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] in the Western Desert, the Allies gained a comprehensive superiority.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=76}} Montgomery envisioned the battle as an attrition operation, similar to those fought in the [[First World War]] and accurately predicted the length of the battle and the number of Allied casualties. Allied artillery was superbly handled and Allied air support was excellent, in contrast to the ''Luftwaffe'' and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'', which offered little or no support to ground forces, preferring to engage in air-to-air combat. Air supremacy had a huge effect on the battle. Montgomery wrote,\n\n{{quote|The moral effect of air action [on the enemy] is very great and out of all proportion to the material damage inflicted. In the reverse direction, the sight and sound of our own air forces operating against the enemy have an equally satisfactory effect on our own troops. A combination of the two has a profound influence on the most important single factor in war\u2014morale.|Montgomery{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=63}}}}\n\nHistorians debate the reasons Rommel decided to advance into Egypt. In 1997, Martin van Creveld wrote that Rommel had been advised by the German and Italian staffs that his army could not properly be supplied so far from the ports of Tripoli and [[Benghazi]]. Rommel pressed ahead with his advance to Alamein and as predicted, supply difficulties limited the attacking potential of the axis forces.{{sfn|Creveld|1997|p=196}} According to Maurice Remy (2002), Hitler and Mussolini put pressure on Rommel to advance. Rommel had been very pessimistic, especially after the First Battle of El Alamein, and knew that as US supplies were en route to Africa and Axis ships were being sunk in the Mediterranean, the Axis was losing a race against time. On 27 August, Kesselring promised Rommel that supplies would arrive in time but Westphal pointed out that such an expectation would be unrealistic and the offensive should not begin until they had arrived. After a conversation with Kesselring on 30 August, Rommel decided to attack, \"the hardest [decision] in my life\".{{sfn|Remy|2002|pp=111\u2013116}}\n\n====Italian troops====\n[[File:El Alamein Italian memorial entrance.jpeg|thumb|Entrance of the Italian war memorial at El Alamein.]]\nItalian Defence ministry chief of staff [[Luigi Binelli Mantelli]] said: \"The spirit of service and cohesion are fundamental elements for the operational capacity of the armed forces ...

Huge quantities of engineer stores had been collected to repair the coast road; the railway line from El Alamein to Fort Capuzzo, despite having been blown up in over 200 places, was quickly repaired.

On 11 December, Montgomery launched the 51st (Highland) Division along the line of the coast road with the 7th Armoured Division on the inland flank. On 12 December the 2nd New Zealand Division started a deeper flanking manoeuvre to cut the Axis line of retreat on the coast road in the rear of the Mersa Brega position.{{sfn|Watson|2007|pp=39, 42}} The Highland Division made a slow and costly advance and 7th Armoured Division met stiff resistance from the ''Ariete'' Combat Group (the remains of the ''Ariete'' Armoured Division).

Weakened by the withdrawal of 21st Panzer Division to Tunisia to strengthen the [[5th Panzer Army]] ([[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim]]), Rommel conducted a fighting retreat.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=44}} The port of Tripoli, {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} further west, was taken on 23 January as Rommel continued to withdraw to the [[Mareth Line]], the French southern defensive position in Tunisia.\n\n====Tunisia====\n{{main|Tunisia Campaign}}\nRommel was by this time in contact with the Fifth Panzer Army, which had been fighting against the multi-national [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] in northern Tunisia, since shortly after Operation Torch. Hitler was determined to retain Tunisia and Rommel finally started to receive replacement men and materials. The Axis faced a war on [[two-front war|two fronts]], with the Eighth Army approaching from the east and the British, French and Americans from the west. The German-Italian Panzer Army was renamed the Italian First Army (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and Rommel assumed command of the new Army Group Africa, responsible for both fronts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The two Allied armies were commanded by the  [[18th Army Group]] (General Harold Alexander). The [[Run for Tunis#Stalemate|failure]] of the First Army in the [[run for Tunis]] in December 1942 led to a longer [[North African campaign]] which ended when the Italian-German forces in North Africa [[Tunisia Campaign#Axis surrender|capitulated]] in May 1943.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n* [[El Alamein Fountain]] (war memorial commemorating the battle, in Sydney, Australia)\n* [[List of World War II battles]]\n* [[North African Campaign timeline]]\n* [[Dan Pienaar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|1}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Barr|2005}}\n|first=Niall |last=Barr |title=Pendulum of War: The Three Battles of El Alamein |location=Woodstock, NY |publisher=Overlook Press |year=2005 |orig-year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58567-738-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bauer|2000}}\n|first=Eddy |last=Bauer |editor-last=Young |editor-first=Peter |title=The History of World War II |location=London |publisher=Orbis|edition=rev. |year=2000 |orig-year=1979 |isbn=1-85605-552-3}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bierman|Smith|2003}}\n|first1=John |last1=Bierman |last2=Smith |first2=Colin |title=War Without Hate: The Desert Campaign of 1940\u20131943 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |edition=|year=2003 |isbn= 978-0-14-200394-7 |orig-year=2002}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Buffetaut|1995}}\n|last=Buffetaut |first=Yves |series=Les grandes batailles de la Seconde Guerre mondiale: Collection hors-s\u00e9rie Militaria |number=16 |title=Operation Supercharge-La seconde bataille d'El Alamein |trans-title=Operation Supercharge: Second Battle of El Alamein |location=Paris |publisher=Histoire Et Collections |year=1995 |language=French |oclc=464158829}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Churchill|1950}}\n|last=Churchill |first=W. |authorlink=Winston Churchill |series=The Second World War |title=The Hinge of Fate |year=1950 |publisher=Bantam |location=new York |oclc=24115733}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Clifford|1943}}\n|first=Alexander |last=Clifford |title=Three Against Rommel |location=London |publisher=George G.

The [[First Battle of El Alamein]] and the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] had prevented the [[Axis powers|Axis]] from advancing further into Egypt.\n\nIn August 1942, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] had been sacked as Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]] and his successor, Lieutenant-General [[William Gott]] was killed on his way to replace him as commander of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]. [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] was appointed and led the Eighth Army offensive.\n\nThe Allied victory was the beginning of the end of the [[Western Desert Campaign]], eliminating the Axis threat to [[Egypt]], the [[Suez Canal]] and the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields. The battle revived the morale of the Allies, being the first big success against the Axis since [[Operation Crusader]] in late 1941. The battle coincided with the Allied invasion of [[French North Africa]] in [[Operation Torch]] on 8 November, the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}\n{{Further|Second Battle of El Alamein order of battle}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-443-1589-07, Nordafrika, Rommel in Befehlsfahrzeug.jpg|thumb|[[Erwin Rommel]] (left) in his [[Sd.Kfz. 250|Sd.Kfz. 250/3]] command halftrack.]]\n[[Panzer Army Africa]] ({{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}}/{{lang|it|Armata Corazzata Africa}}, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]), composed of German and Italian tank and infantry units, had advanced into [[Egypt]] after its success at the [[Battle of Gazala]] (26 May \u2013 21 June 1942). The Axis advance menaced British control of the [[Suez Canal]], the Middle East and its oil resources. [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] withdrew the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] to within {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[Alexandria]] where the [[Qattara Depression]] was {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[El Alamein]] on the coast. The depression was impassable and meant that any attack had to be frontal; Axis attacks in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] (1\u201327 July) were defeated.\n\nEighth Army counter-attacks in July also failed, as the Axis forces dug in and regrouped. Auchinleck called off the attacks at the end of July to rebuild the army. In early August, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]] and General Sir [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), visited [[Cairo]] and replaced Auchinleck as [[Commander-in-chief]] [[Middle East Command]] with General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]]. [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[William Gott]] was made commander of the Eighth Army but was killed when his transport aircraft was shot down by ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters; Lieutenant-General [[Bernard Montgomery]] was flown from Britain to replace him.\n\nLacking reinforcements and depending on small, underdeveloped ports for supplies, aware of a huge [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] reinforcement operation for the Eighth Army, Rommel decided to attack first. The two armoured divisions of the ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' and the reconnaissance units of {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} led the attack but were repulsed at the Alam el Halfa ridge and Point 102 on 30 August 1942 during the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] and the Axis forces retired to their start lines. The short front line and secure flanks favoured the [[Axis powers|Axis]] defence and Rommel had time to develop the Axis  defences, sowing extensive [[minefield]]s with {{circa|500,000}} mines and miles of [[barbed wire]].{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2003|p=255}} Alexander and Montgomery intended to establish a superiority of force sufficient to achieve a [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] and exploit it to destroy {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}}. Earlier in the [[Western Desert Campaign]], neither side had been able to exploit a local victory sufficiently to defeat its opponent before it had withdrawn and transferred the problem of over-extended supply lines to the victor.\n\nThe British had an intelligence advantage because [[Ultra]] and local sources exposed the Axis order of battle, its supply position and intentions. A reorganisation of military intelligence in Africa in July had also improved the integration of information received from all sources and the speed of its dissemination.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=425}} With rare exceptions, intelligence identified the supply ships destined for North Africa, their location or routing and in most cases their cargoes, allowing them to be attacked.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=423}} By 25 October, {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} was down to three days' supply of fuel, only two days' worth of which were east of Tobruk. [[Harry Hinsley]], the official historian of British intelligence wrote in 1981 that \"The Panzer Army...&nbsp;did not possess the operational freedom of movement that was absolutely essential in consideration of the fact that the British offensive can be expected to start any day\".{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}} Submarine and air transport somewhat eased the shortage of ammunition and by late October, there was sixteen days' supply at the front.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}} After six more weeks, the Eighth Army was ready; {{nowrap|195,000 men}} and {{nowrap|1,029 tanks}} began the offensive against the {{nowrap|116,000 men}} and {{nowrap|547 tanks}} of the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}}.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied plan===\n\n====Operation Lightfoot====\nMontgomery's plan was for a main attack to the north of the line and a secondary attack to the south, involving [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Oliver Leese]]) and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]]), while [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Herbert Lumsden]]) was to exploit the success.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|1994|p=219}} With Operation Lightfoot, Montgomery intended to cut two corridors through the Axis minefields in the north. One corridor was to run south-west through the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] sector towards the centre of Miteirya Ridge, while the second was to run west, passing {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the west end of the Miteirya Ridge across the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian]] and [[51st (Highland) Division]] sectors.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=34}} Tanks would then pass through and defeat the German armour. Diversions at Ruweisat Ridge in the centre and also the south of the line would keep the rest of the Axis forces from moving northwards. Montgomery expected a 12-day battle in three stages: the break-in, the dogfight and the final breaking of the enemy.{{sfn|Dear|2005|p=254}}\n\nFor the first night of the offensive, Montgomery planned for four infantry divisions of XXX Corps to advance on a {{convert|26|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} front to the Oxalic Line, over-running the forward Axis defences. Engineers would clear and mark the two lanes through the minefields, through which the armoured divisions from X Corps would pass to gain the Pierson Line. They would rally and consolidate their position just west of the infantry positions, blocking an Axis tank counter-attack. The British tanks would then advance to ''Skinflint'', astride the north\u2013south Rahman Track deep in the Axis defensive system, to challenge the Axis armour.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=34}} The infantry battle would continue as the Eighth Army infantry \"crumbled\" the deep Axis defensive fortifications (three successive lines of fortification had been constructed) and destroy any tanks that attacked them.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=430\u2013431}}{{efn|The [[Polish Mine Detector]] designed in Scotland in 1941 by the Polish engineer and signals officer, Lieutnant [[J\u00f3zef Kosacki]] was to be used for the first time in action. Five hundred of these were issued to Eighth Army. The apparatus doubled the speed at which heavily mined sands could be cleared, from around {{convert|100|m|yd}} to about {{convert|200|m|yd|abbr=on}} an hour.{{sfn|Modelski|1986|p=221}}}}\n\n====Operation Bertram====\n\n{{main|Operation Bertram}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces practised a number of deceptions in the months before the battle to confuse the Axis command as to the whereabouts of the forthcoming battle and when the battle was likely to occur. This operation was code-named [[Operation Bertram]]. In September, they dumped waste materials (discarded packing cases, etc.) under camouflage nets in the northern sector, making them appear to be ammunition or ration dumps. The Axis naturally noticed these but, as no offensive action immediately followed and the \"dumps\" did not change in appearance, they were subsequently ignored. This allowed Eighth Army to build up supplies in the forward area unnoticed by the Axis, by replacing the rubbish with ammunition, petrol or rations at night. Meanwhile, a dummy pipeline was built, hopefully leading the Axis to believe the attack would occur much later than it, in fact, did and much further south. To further the illusion, dummy tanks consisting of plywood frames placed over jeeps were constructed and deployed in the south. In a reverse [[feint]], the tanks destined for battle in the north were disguised as supply trucks by placing removable plywood superstructures over them.{{sfn|Lucas|1983|p=123}}\n\n====Operation Braganza====\n\n{{main|Operation Braganza}}\n\nAs a preliminary, the [[131st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|131st (Queen's) Infantry Brigade]] of the [[44th (Home Counties) Division|44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division]], supported by tanks from the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th Armoured Brigade]], launched [[Operation Braganza]] attacking the [[185th Airborne Division Folgore]] on the night of 29/30 September in an attempt to capture the Deir el Munassib area. The Italian [[paratrooper]]s repelled the attack, killing or capturing over 300 of the attackers.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=269}} It was wrongly assumed that ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (German paratroopers) had manned the defences and been responsible for the British reverse. The ''Afrika Korps'' war diary notes that the Italian paratroops \"bore the brunt of the attack. It fought well and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.\"<ref>Afrika Korps War Diary, 30 September 1942</ref>\n\n===Axis plan===\n[[File:2 Battle of El Alamein 001.png|thumb|Deployment of forces on the eve of battle.]]\nWith the failure of the offensive at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, the Axis forces went onto the defensive but losses had not been excessive. The Axis supply line from [[Tripoli]] was extremely long and captured Allied supplies and equipment had been exhausted, but Rommel decided to advance into Egypt.{{sfn|Creveld|1997|p=196}}{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=111-116}}\n\nThe Eighth Army was being supplied with men and materials from the United Kingdom, India, Australia and New Zealand, as well as with trucks and the new [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] from the United States. Rommel continued to request equipment, supplies and fuel but the priority of the German war effort was the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and very limited supplies reached North Africa<!--really?-->. Rommel was ill and in early September, arrangements were made for him to return to Germany on sick leave and for ''[[General der Panzertruppe]]'' [[Georg Stumme]] to transfer from the Russian front to take his place. Before he left for Germany on 23 September, Rommel organised the defence and wrote a long appreciation of the situation to ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW armed forces high command), once again setting out the essential needs of the Panzer Army.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=26}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-009-34, Georg Stumme.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|left|[[Georg Stumme]] in 1940.]]\nRommel knew that the British Commonwealth forces would soon be strong enough to attack. His only hope now relied on the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German forces]] fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] quickly to defeat the [[Red Army]], then move south through the [[Caucasus|Trans-Caucasus]] and threaten Iran (Persia) and the Middle East. If successful, large numbers of British and Commonwealth forces would have to be sent from the Egyptian front to reinforce the Ninth Army in Iran, leading to the postponement of any offensive against his army. Rommel hoped to convince OKW to reinforce his forces for the eventual link-up between {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} and the German armies fighting in southern Russia, enabling them finally to defeat the British and Commonwealth armies in North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIn the meantime, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} dug in and waited for the attack by the Eighth Army or the defeat of the Red Army at Stalingrad. Rommel added depth to his defences by creating at least two belts of mines about {{convert|5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} apart, connected at intervals to create boxes ([[Devil's gardens]]) which would restrict enemy penetration and deprive British armour of room for manoeuvre. The front face of each box was lightly held by battle outposts and the rest of the box was unoccupied but sowed with mines and explosive traps and covered by enfilading fire.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=432\u2013433}} The main defensive positions were built to a depth of at least {{convert|2|km|mi}} behind the second mine belt.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=27\u201328}} The Axis laid around half a million mines, mostly [[Teller mine|Teller anti-tank mines]] with some smaller anti-personnel types (such as the [[S-mine]]). (Many of these mines were British, and had been captured at Tobruk). To lure enemy vehicles into the minefields, the Italians dragged an axle and tyres through the fields using a long rope to create what appeared to be well-used tracks.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2003|p=255}}\n\n[[File:Ettore Bastico.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Marshal Ettore Bastico|alt=]]\nRommel did not want the British armour to break out into the open because he had neither the strength of numbers nor fuel to match them in a battle of manoeuvre. The battle had to be fought in the fortified zones; a breakthrough had to be defeated quickly. Rommel stiffened his forward lines by alternating German and Italian infantry formations. Because the Allied deception confused the Axis as to the point of attack, Rommel departed from his usual practice of holding his armoured strength in a concentrated reserve and split it into a northern group ([[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer]] and [[133rd Armoured Division Littorio|''Littorio'' Division]]) and a southern group ([[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer]] and [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|''Ariete'' Division]]), each organised into [[Battlegroup (army)|battle groups]] to be able to make a quick armoured intervention wherever the blow fell and prevent narrow breakthroughs from being enlarged. A significant proportion of his armoured reserve was dispersed and held unusually far forward. The 15th Panzer Division had 125 operational tanks (16 Pz.IIs, 43 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 6 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F) while the 21st Panzer Division had 121 operational combat vehicles (12 Pz.IIs, 38 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 2 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F).{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=8}}\n\nRommel held the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]] further back and kept the [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|''Trieste'' Motorised Division]] in reserve near the coast.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=28\u201329}} Rommel hoped to move his troops faster than the Allies, to concentrate his defences at the most important point ({{lang|de|Schwerpunkt}}) but lack of fuel meant that once the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} had concentrated, it would not be able to move again because of lack of fuel.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=20}} The British were well aware that Rommel would be unable to mount a defence based on his usual manoeuvre tactics but no clear picture emerged of how he would fight the battle and British plans seriously underestimated the Axis defences and the fighting power of the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}}<!--really?-->.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=431}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Phase one: the break-in===\n[[File:The Campaign in North Africa 1940-1943 E18469.jpg|thumb|left|British night artillery barrage which opened the second Battle of El Alamein]]\nPrior to the main barrage, there was a diversion by the [[24th Brigade (Australia)|24th Australian Brigade]], which involved the 15th Panzer Division being subjected to heavy fire for a few minutes.{{sfn|Latimer|2002|p=177}} Then at 21:40 (Egyptian Summer Time) on 23 October{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=304}} on a calm, clear evening under the bright sky of a full moon, Operation Lightfoot began with a 1,000-gun barrage.

The engineers had to clear a {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} route through the Devil's Gardens.

The objective was to establish a bridgehead before dawn at the imaginary line in the desert where the strongest enemy defences were situated, on the far side of the second mine belt. Once the infantry reached the first minefields, the mine sweepers, including Reconnaissance Corps troops and [[sapper]]s, moved in to create a passage for the armoured divisions of X Corps. Progress was slower than planned but at 02:00, the first of the 500 tanks crawled forward. By 04:00, the lead tanks were in the minefields, where they stirred up so much dust that there was no visibility at all, traffic jams developed and tanks bogged down. Only about half of the infantry attained their objectives and none of the tanks broke through.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=438}}\n\n[[File:Paracadutista El Alamein14.jpg|thumb|upright|Original military uniform of an Italian paratrooper of the division Folgore in 1942]]\nThe [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] (with one Free French Brigade under command) from  XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks) made a secondary attack to the south.

By the time they had reorganised they were well behind schedule and out of touch with the creeping artillery barrage. By daylight the brigade was out in the open taking considerable fire from well sited tanks and anti-tank guns.  Meanwhile [[24th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Armoured Brigade]] had pushed forward and reported at dawn they were on the Pierson line, although it turned out that, in the dust and confusion, they had mistaken their position and were well short.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=46}}\n\nThe attack in the XIII Corps sector to the south fared no better. 44th Division's 131st Infantry Brigade cleared a path through the mines, but when 22nd Armoured Brigade passed through, they came under heavy fire and were repulsed, with 31 tanks disabled. Allied air activity that night focused on Rommel's northern armoured group, where {{convert|135|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped.

Axis forces were firmly entrenched in most of their original battle positions and the battle was at a standstill. Montgomery decided that the planned advance southward from Miteirya Ridge by the New Zealanders would be too costly and instead decided that XXX Corps\u2014while keeping firm hold of Miteirya\u2014should strike northward toward the coast with 9th Australian Division. Meanwhile, 1st Armoured Division\u2014on the Australians' left\u2014should continue to attack west and north-west, and activity to the south on both Corps fronts would be confined to patrolling.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=47}} The battle would be concentrated at the Kidney feature and Tel el Eisa until a breakthrough occurred.\n\n[[File:RAF Baltimore bombing El Daba airfield.jpg|thumb|right|RAF [[Martin Baltimore|Baltimore]] of No. 223 Squadron bombing El Daba airfield in support of the Alamein offensive]]\nBy early morning, the Axis forces launched a series of attacks using 15th Panzer and ''Littorio'' divisions. The Panzer Army was probing for a weakness, but without success. When the sun set the Allied infantry went on the attack. Around midnight, 51st Division launched three attacks, but no one knew exactly where they were. Pandemonium and carnage ensued, resulting in the loss of over 500 Allied troops, and leaving only one officer among the attacking forces.

The Italian [[102 Motorised Division Trento|''Trento'' Division]] had lost 50 per cent of its infantry and most of its artillery, the 164th Light Division had lost two battalions.

A mile north-west of the feature was Outpost Woodcock and roughly the same distance south-west lay Outpost Snipe. An attack was planned on these areas using two battalions from 7th Motor Brigade. At 23:00 on 26 October 2 Battalion, [[The Rifle Brigade]] would attack Snipe and 2nd Battalion [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (KRRC) would attack Woodcock. The plan was for 2nd Armoured Brigade to pass round the north of Woodcock the following dawn and 24th Armoured Brigade round the south of Snipe. The attack was to be supported by all the available artillery of both X and XXX Corps.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nBoth battalions had difficulty finding their way in the dark and dust. At dawn, the KRRC had not reached its objective and had to find cover and dig in some distance from Woodcock. 2nd Rifle Brigade had had better fortune and after following the shell bursts of the supporting artillery dug in when they concluded they had reached their objective having encountered little opposition.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=54}}\n\nAt 06:00, the 2nd Armoured Brigade commenced its advance and ran into such stiff opposition that, by noon, it had still not linked with the KRRC. The 24th Armoured Brigade started a little later and was soon in contact with the Rifle Brigade (having shelled them in error for a while). Some hours of confused fighting ensued involving tanks from the ''Littorio'' and troops and anti-tank guns from 15th Panzer which managed to keep the British armour at bay in spite of the support of the Rifle Brigade battle group's anti-tank guns. Rommel had decided to make two counter-attacks using his fresh troops. 90th Light Division was to make a fresh attempt to capture Point 29 and 21st Panzer were targeted at Snipe (the ''Ariete'' detachment had returned south).{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nAt Snipe, mortar and shellfire was constant all day long. At 16:00, Rommel launched his major attack. German and Italian tanks moved forward.

At dawn, 2nd Armoured Brigade moved up in support but before contact could be made 4th Royal Sussex were counter-attacked and overrun with many losses.

Montgomery determined therefore that it would take place further south on a {{convert|4000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} front south of Point 29. The attack was to take place on the night of 31 October/1 November, as soon as he had completed the reorganisation of his front line to create the reserves needed for the offensive (although in the event it was postponed by 24 hours).

Rommel brought up a battlegroup from ''21. Panzer-Division'' and on 31 October, launched four successive attacks against \"Thompson's Post\". The fighting was intense and often hand-to-hand, but no ground was gained by the Axis forces. One of the Australians killed was Sergeant [[William Henry Kibby|William Kibby]] ([[2/48th Battalion (Australia)|2/48th Infantry Battalion]]) who, for his heroic actions from the 23rd until his death on the 31st \u2013 including a lone attack on a machine-gun position at his own initiative \u2013 was awarded the Victoria Cross.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=61}}\n\nAgain, on Sunday, 1 November Rommel tried to dislodge the Australians, but the brutal, desperate fighting resulted in nothing but lost men and equipment. He did however regain contact with ''Panzergrenadier-Regiment 125'' in the nose of the salient,{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=61\u201362}} and the supporting ''10\u00b0 battaglione Bersaglieri'' \u2013 that fought well according to German and Allied sources; the ''Bersaglieri'' had resisted several Australian attacks even though they were (in the words of military historian [[Niall Barr]]) \"surrounded on all sides, short of ammunition, food and water, [and] unable to evacuate their many wounded\".{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=380}}\n\nBy now, it had become obvious to Rommel that the battle was lost. His fuel state continued to be critical: on 1 November, two more supply ships\u2014the ''Tripolino'' and the ''Ostia''\u2014had been torpedoed and sunk from the air north-west of Tobruk. The shortage forced him to rely increasingly on fuel flown in from [[Crete]] on the orders of [[Albert Kesselring]], Luftwaffe ''[[OB S\u00fcd|Oberbefehlshaber S\u00fcd]]'' (''OB S\u00fcd'', Supreme Commander South), despite the restrictions imposed by heavy bombing of the airfields in Crete and the Desert Air Force's efforts to intercept the transport aircraft.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=63}}\n\nRommel began to plan a retreat anticipating retiring to Fuka, some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} west, as he had only 90 tanks remaining in stark contrast with the Allies' 800.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=261}} Large amounts of fuel arrived at Benghazi after the German forces had started to retreat, but little of it reached the front, a fact Kesselring tried to change by delivering it more closely to the fighting forces.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=26}}\n\n===Phase four: Operation Supercharge===\n\n====D + 10: 2 November====\n[[File:Priest of 1st Armoured Division in North Africa, 2 November 1942 (E 18869).jpg|thumb|A [[M7 Priest|Priest 105 mm self-propelled gun]] of the 1st Armoured Division preparing for action, 2 November 1942]]\nThis phase of the battle began at 01:00 on 2 November, with the objective of destroying enemy armour, forcing the enemy to fight in the open, reducing the Axis stock of petrol, attacking and occupying enemy supply routes, and causing the disintegration of the enemy army. The intensity and the destruction in Supercharge were greater than anything witnessed so far during this battle. The objective of this operation was Tel el Aqqaqir, the base of the Axis defence roughly {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} north-west of the Kidney feature and situated on the Rahman lateral track.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|loc=Map 10}}\n\nThe initial thrust of Supercharge was to be carried out by the 2nd New Zealand Division. Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg, had tried to free them of this task, as they had lost 1,405 men in just three days, at El Ruweisat Ridge in July. However, in addition to its own 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and 28th (Maori) Infantry Battalion, the division was to have had placed under its command [[151st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|151st (Durham) Brigade]] from 50th Division, [[152nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|152nd (Seaforth and Camerons) Brigade]] from 51st Division and the [[133rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|133rd Royal Sussex Lorried Infantry Brigade]]. In addition, the division was to have [[British 9th Armoured Brigade]] under command.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nAs in Operation Lightfoot, it was planned that two infantry brigades (the 151st on the right and 152nd on the left) each this time supported by a regiment of tanks\u2014the 8th and 50th Royal Tank Regiments\u2014would advance and clear a path through the mines. Once they reached their objectives, {{convert|4000|yd|m|abbr=on}} distant, 9th Armoured Brigade would pass through supported by a heavy artillery barrage and break open a gap in the Axis defences on and around the Rahman track, some {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}} further forward, which the 1st Armoured Division, following behind, would pass through into the open to take on Rommel's armoured reserves.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=64\u2013 65}} Rommel had ordered 21st Panzer Division from the front line on 31 October to form a mobile counterattacking force. The division had left behind a ''panzergrenadier'' regiment which would bolster the [[101 Motorised Division Trieste|''Trieste'' Division]] which had been ordered forward to replace it. Rommel had also interspersed formations from the ''Trieste'' and 15th Panzer Divisions to \"corset\" his weaker forces in the front line. On 1 November the two German armoured divisions had 102 effective tanks to face Supercharge and the ''Littorio'' and ''Trieste'' Divisions had 65 tanks between them.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=445}}\n\nSupercharge started with a seven-hour aerial bombardment focused on Tel el Aqqaqir and [[Sidi Abdel Rahman|Sidi Abd el Rahman]], followed by a four and a half hour barrage of 360 guns firing 15,000 shells.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The two assault brigades started their attack at 01:05 on 2 November and gained most of their objectives to schedule and with moderate losses. On the right of the main attack 28th (Maori) battalion captured positions to protect the right flank of the newly formed salient and 133rd Lorried Infantry did the same on the left. New Zealand engineers cleared five lines through the mines allowing the [[Royal Dragoons]] armoured car regiment to slip out into the open and spend the day raiding the Axis communications.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=66}}\n\nThe 9th Armoured Brigade had started its approach march at 20:00 on 1 November from El Alamein railway station with around 130 tanks and arrived at its start line with only 94 runners (operational tanks). The brigade was to have started its attack towards Tel el Aqqaqir at 05:45 behind a barrage; the attack was postponed for 30 minutes while the brigade regrouped on [[John Cecil Currie|Currie's]] orders.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=387}} At 06:15, 30 minutes before dawn, the three regiments of the brigade advanced towards the gun line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n{{quote|We all realise that for armour to attack a wall of guns sounds like another [[Charge of the Light Brigade|Balaclava]], it is properly an infantry job.

British tanks attacking the ''Folgore'' sector were fought off with [[petrol bombs]] and mortar fire as well as with the obsolete Italian 47&nbsp;mm cannons. The Axis gun screen started to inflict a steady amount of damage upon the advancing tanks but was unable to stop them; over the course of the next 30 minutes, around 35 guns were destroyed and several hundred prisoners taken. The 9th Armoured Brigade had started the attack with 94 tanks and was reduced to only 14 operational tanks{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=67}} and of the 400 tank crew involved in the attack, 230 were killed, wounded or captured.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=left\n|width=20%\n|quote=\"If the British armour owed any debt to the infantry of the Eighth Army, the debt was paid on November 2 by 9th Armoured in heroism and blood.\"{{sfn|Barr|2005|pp=388\u2013389}}\n|source=Bernard Montgomery, referring to the mistakes of the British armoured forces during the First Battle of El Alamein{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n|}}\n\nAfter the Brigade's action, Brigadier Gentry of 6th New Zealand Brigade went ahead to survey the scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he approached him saying, \"Sorry to wake you John, but I'd like to know where your tanks are?\" Currie waved his hand at a group of tanks around him and replied \"There they are\". Gentry said \"I don't mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?\" Currie waved his arm and again replied, \"There are my armoured regiments, Bill\".{{sfn|Lucas-Phillips|1962|p=358}}\n\nThe brigade had sacrificed itself upon the gun line and caused great damage but had failed to create the gap for the 1st Armoured Division to pass through; however, soon after dawn 1st Armoured Division started to deploy and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade came under its command. 2nd Armoured Brigade came up behind the 9th, and by mid-morning 8th Armoured Brigade had come up on its left, ordered to advance to the south-west.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=67}} In heavy fighting during the day the British armour made little further progress. At 11:00 on 2 November, the remains of 15th Panzer, 21st Panzer and ''Littorio'' Armoured Divisions counter-attacked 1st Armoured Division and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade, which by that time had dug in with a screen of anti-tank guns and artillery together with intensive air support. The counter-attack failed under a blanket of shells and bombs, resulting in a loss of some 100 tanks.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=24}}\n\n[[File:The Campaign in North Africa 1940-1943 E18485.jpg|thumb|German prisoners brought in from the battle]]\nAlthough X Corps had failed in its attempt to break out, it had succeeded in its objective of finding and destroying enemy tanks. Although tank losses were approximately equal, this represented only a portion of the total British armour, but most of Rommel's tanks; the ''Afrika Korps'' strength of tanks fit for battle fell by 70 while in addition to the losses of the 9th Armoured Brigade, the 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades lost 14 tanks in the fighting, with another 40 damaged or broken down. The fighting was later termed the \"Hammering of the Panzers\". In the late afternoon and early evening, the 133rd Lorried and 151st Infantry Brigades\u2014by this time back under command of 51st Infantry Division\u2014attacked respectively the Snipe and Skinflint (about a mile west of Snipe) positions in order to form a base for future operations. The heavy artillery concentration which accompanied their advance suppressed the opposition from the ''Trieste'' Division and the operation succeeded with few casualties.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=67\u201370}}\n\nOn the night of 2 November, Montgomery once again reshuffled his infantry in order to bring four brigades (5th Indian, 151st, 5th New Zealand and 154th) into reserve under XXX Corps to prepare for the next thrust. He also reinforced X Corps by moving 7th Armoured Division from army reserve and sending 4th Light Armoured Brigade from XIII Corps in the south. General von Thoma's report to Rommel that night said he would have at most 35 tanks available to fight the next day and his artillery and anti-tank weapons had been reduced to \u2153 of their strength at the start of the battle. Rommel concluded that to forestall a breakthrough and the resulting destruction of his whole army he must start withdrawing to the planned position at Fuka. He called up [[Italian 132nd Armored Division Ariete|''Ariete'']] from the south to join the mobile Italian XX Corps around Tel el Aqqaqir. His mobile forces (XX Corps, ''Afrika Korps'', 90th Light Division and 19th ''Flak'' Division) were ordered to make a fighting withdrawal while his other formations were to withdraw as best they could with the limited transport available.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=68\u201369}}\n\n====D + 11: 3 November====\nAt 20:30 on 2 November, Lumsden decided that one more effort by his X Corps would see the gun screen on the Rahman track defeated and ordered 7th Motor Brigade to seize the track along a {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} front north of Tell el Aqqaqir. The 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades would then pass through the infantry to a distance of about {{convert|3.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. On the morning of 3 November 7 Armoured Division would pass through and swing north heading for the railway at Ghazal station. 7th Motor Brigade set off at 01:15 on 3 November, but having received its orders late, had not had the chance to reconnoitre the battle area in daylight. This combined with stiff resistance led to the failure of their attack. As a consequence, the orders for the armour were changed and 2nd Armoured Brigade was tasked to support the forward battalion of 133rd Lorried Brigade (2nd King's Royal Rifle Corps) and 8th Armoured Brigade was to push south-west. Fighting continued throughout 3 November, but 2nd Armoured was held off by elements of the ''Afrika Korps'' and tanks of the ''Littorio'' Division. Further south, 8th Armoured Brigade was held off by anti-tank units helped later by tanks of the arriving ''Ariete'' Division.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=70\u201371}}\n\n===Phase five: the break-out===\n[[File:Sherman tanks of the Eighth Army move across the desert.jpg|thumb|left|Sherman tanks of the Eighth Army move across the desert]]\n\nOn 2 November, Rommel signalled to Hitler that\n\n{{quote|The army's strength was so exhausted after its ten days of battle that it was not now capable of offering any effective opposition to the enemy's next break-through attempt&nbsp;...

At 17:45, the 152nd Infantry Brigade with the 8th RTR in support, attacked about {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Tel el Aqqaqir. The 5th Indian Infantry Brigade was to attack the track {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} further south during the early hours of 4 November; at 06:15, the 154th Infantry Brigade was to attack Tel el Aqqaqir. The 152nd Infantry Brigade was mistakenly told the Axis had withdrawn from their objectives and unexpectedly met determined resistance. Communications failed and the forward infantry elements ended up digging in well short of their objective. By the time the 5th Indian Brigade set off, the defenders had begun to withdraw and their objective was taken virtually unopposed. By the time the 154th Brigade moved into some artillery-fire, the Axis had left.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=75}}\n\n====D + 12, 4 November====\n[[File:88 mm Flak 36 near El Aqqaqir 1942.jpg|thumb|A captured 88 mm Flak 36 near El Aqqaqir, November 1942]]\nOn 4 November, the Eighth Army plan for pursuit began at dawn; no fresh units were available and the 1st and 7th Armoured divisions were to turn northwards to roll up the Axis units still in the forward lines. The 2nd New Zealand Division with two lorried infantry brigades and the 9th Armoured and 4th Light Armoured brigades under command, was to head west along desert tracks to the escarpment above Fuka, about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. The New Zealanders got off to a slow start because its units were dispersed after the recent fighting and took time to concentrate. Paths through the minefields were congested and had deteriorated, which caused more delays.

Roughly {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-west of Sidi Haneish, the 7th Armoured Division encountered the 21st Panzer Division and the ''Voss'' Reconnaissance Group that morning.

The 10th Armoured Division, on the coast road and with ample fuel, advanced to Mersa Matruh while its infantry mopped up on the road west of Galal.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=91}} Rommel intended to fight a delaying action at [[Sidi Barrani]], {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Matruh, to gain time for Axis troops to get through the bottlenecks at Halfaya and Sollum.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=93}} The last rearguards left Matruh on the night of 7/8 November but were only able to hold Sidi Barrani until the evening of 9 November. By the evening of 10 November, the 2nd New Zealand Division, heading for Sollum, had the 4th Light Armoured Brigade at the foot of the Halfaya Pass while 7th Armoured Division was conducting another detour to the south, to take Fort Capuzzo and Sidi Azeiz. On the morning of 11 November, the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade captured the pass, taking 600 Italian prisoners. By nightfall on 11 November, the Egyptian wall was clear but Montgomery was forced to order that the pursuit should temporarily be continued only by armoured cars and artillery, because of the difficulty in supplying larger formations west of Bardia.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\"\n!colspan=|Maps showing stages of the battle\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 002.png|Allied Forces attack: 10:00&nbsp;p.m. 23 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 003.png|Axis Armoured Divisions counter-attack: 6:00&nbsp;p.m. 24 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 004.png|Allies attempt to break through: night of 25 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 005.png|Axis counter-attack and attack by 9th Australian Division: afternoon, 25 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 006.png|''Folgore'' Parachutist Division attacked from three directions: 10:30&nbsp;p.m. 25 October to 3:00&nbsp;a.m. 26 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 007.png|Allies advance: 51st Highland Division takes Kidney Ridge, ''Littorio'' Armoured Division counter-attacks: 5:00&nbsp;p.m. 26 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 008.png|Both sides redeploy: night of 26 to 27 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 009.png|Axis fails to retake Kidney Ridge: 8:00&nbsp;a.m. 27 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 010.png|Allies attempt to push back ''Trento'' Division: 28 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 011.png|Rommel redeploys forces: 29 October\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 012.png|Operation Supercharge begins, 9th Australian fails to break through: 11:00&nbsp;p.m. 31 October 1942\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 013.png|Tank Battle of Tell el Aqqaqir: 9:00&nbsp;a.m. 2 November; Axis forces begin retreat: 10:00&nbsp;p.m. 2 November\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 014.png|Axis forces prepare to fall back: 3 November\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 015.png|Axis forces halt their retreat: 3 November\nFile:2 Battle of El Alamein 016.png|Allied forces break through: 7:00&nbsp;a.m. 4 November; ''Trento'', ''Bologna'' and ''Ariete'' Divisions destroyed, Axis forces flee\n</gallery>\n|}\nEl Alamein was an Allied victory,<!--''Decisive'' isn't supported by the citation--> although Rommel did not lose hope until the end of the [[Tunisia Campaign]].

With the arrival of [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]], [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|6-pounder]] anti-tank guns and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] in the Western Desert, the Allies gained a comprehensive superiority.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=76}} Montgomery envisioned the battle as an attrition operation, similar to those fought in the [[First World War]] and accurately predicted the length of the battle and the number of Allied casualties. Allied artillery was superbly handled and Allied air support was excellent, in contrast to the ''Luftwaffe'' and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'', which offered little or no support to ground forces, preferring to engage in air-to-air combat. Air supremacy had a huge effect on the battle. Montgomery wrote,\n\n{{quote|The moral effect of air action [on the enemy] is very great and out of all proportion to the material damage inflicted. In the reverse direction, the sight and sound of our own air forces operating against the enemy have an equally satisfactory effect on our own troops. A combination of the two has a profound influence on the most important single factor in war\u2014morale.|Montgomery{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=63}}}}\n\nHistorians debate the reasons Rommel decided to advance into Egypt. In 1997, Martin van Creveld wrote that Rommel had been advised by the German and Italian staffs that his army could not properly be supplied so far from the ports of Tripoli and [[Benghazi]]. Rommel pressed ahead with his advance to Alamein and as predicted, supply difficulties limited the attacking potential of the axis forces.{{sfn|Creveld|1997|p=196}} According to Maurice Remy (2002), Hitler and Mussolini put pressure on Rommel to advance. Rommel had been very pessimistic, especially after the First Battle of El Alamein, and knew that as US supplies were en route to Africa and Axis ships were being sunk in the Mediterranean, the Axis was losing a race against time. On 27 August, Kesselring promised Rommel that supplies would arrive in time but Westphal pointed out that such an expectation would be unrealistic and the offensive should not begin until they had arrived. After a conversation with Kesselring on 30 August, Rommel decided to attack, \"the hardest [decision] in my life\".{{sfn|Remy|2002|pp=111\u2013116}}\n\n====Italian troops====\n[[File:El Alamein Italian memorial entrance.jpeg|thumb|Entrance of the Italian war memorial at El Alamein.]]\nItalian Defence ministry chief of staff [[Luigi Binelli Mantelli]] said: \"The spirit of service and cohesion are fundamental elements for the operational capacity of the armed forces ...

The Axis faced a war on [[two-front war|two fronts]], with the Eighth Army approaching from the east and the British, French and Americans from the west.

When prodded, they'll grudgingly admit that the present system is not a free market, and that it includes a lot of state intervention on behalf of the rich.

This, however, is mistaken for at least two reasons. First, on social\u2014rather than economic\u2014issues, libertarianism tends to be 'left-wing'. It opposes laws that restrict consensual and private sexual relationships between adults (e.g., gay sex, non-marital sex, and deviant sex), laws that restrict drug use, laws that impose religious views or practices on individuals, and compulsory military service. Second, in addition to the better-known version of libertarianism\u2014right-libertarianism\u2014there is also a version known as 'left-libertarianism'. Both endorse full self-ownership, but they differ with respect to the powers agents have to appropriate unappropriated natural resources (land, air, water, etc.).<ref name=\"Vallentyne 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\nRight-libertarians are distinguished from the dominant libertarian tradition by their relation to [[Property rights (economics)|property]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. While both [[libertarianism]] and right-libertarianism share general antipathy towards power by government authority, the latter exempts power wielded through [[free-market capitalism]]. Historically, libertarians such as [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Max Stirner]] supported the protection of an individual's freedom from powers of [[government]] and [[private ownership]]. While condemning governmental encroachment on [[personal liberties]], right-libertarians support freedoms on the basis of their agreement with private property rights and the abolishment of public amenities is a common theme in right-libertarian writings.<ref name=\"Francis\"/><ref>Carson, Kevin (8 November 2015).

Carson uses \"vulgar libertarianism\" to refer to the use of talk about what could be expected in a genuinely free market to justify some or all of \"[[actually existing capitalism]]\" which according to Carson is distorted by state-secured privilege and lacks many of the defining features of a free market. Carson derives this phrase from [[Karl Marx]]'s \"vulgar [[political economy]]\", a style of economic reasoning that \"deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [evident in economic life]\".<ref>Marx, Karl (1971).

When prodded, they'll grudgingly admit that the present system is not a free market, and that it includes a lot of state intervention on behalf of the rich.

This, however, is mistaken for at least two reasons. First, on social\u2014rather than economic\u2014issues, libertarianism tends to be 'left-wing'. It opposes laws that restrict consensual and private sexual relationships between adults (e.g., gay sex, non-marital sex, and deviant sex), laws that restrict drug use, laws that impose religious views or practices on individuals, and compulsory military service. Second, in addition to the better-known version of libertarianism\u2014right-libertarianism\u2014there is also a version known as 'left-libertarianism'. Both endorse full self-ownership, but they differ with respect to the powers agents have to appropriate unappropriated natural resources (land, air, water, etc.).<ref name=\"Vallentyne 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\nRight-libertarians are distinguished from the dominant libertarian tradition by their relation to [[Property rights (economics)|property]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. While both [[libertarianism]] and right-libertarianism share general antipathy towards power by government authority, the latter exempts power wielded through [[free-market capitalism]]. Historically, libertarians such as [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Max Stirner]] supported the protection of an individual's freedom from powers of [[government]] and [[private ownership]]. While condemning governmental encroachment on [[personal liberties]], right-libertarians support freedoms on the basis of their agreement with private property rights and the abolishment of public amenities is a common theme in right-libertarian writings.<ref name=\"Francis\"/><ref>Carson, Kevin (8 November 2015).

He studied philosophy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crimmins | first=James E. | title=William Paley (1743\u20131805) | journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | year=2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1776 Paley was presented to the rectory of [[Musgrave, Cumbria|Musgrave]] in [[Westmorland]], which was exchanged soon after for Appleby. He was subsequently made vicar of [[Dalston, Cumbria|Dalston]] in 1780, near the bishop's palace at [[Rose Castle]]. In 1782 he became the [[Archdeacon of Carlisle]]. Paley was intimate with the Law family throughout his life, and the Bishop and his son [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]] (who was later an Irish bishop) were instrumental during the decade after he left Cambridge in pressing him to publish his revised lectures and in negotiating with the publisher. In 1782 Edmund Law, otherwise the mildest of men, was most particular that Paley should add a book on political philosophy to the moral philosophy, which Paley was reluctant to write. The book was published in 1785 under the title of ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', and was made a part of the examinations at the [[University of Cambridge]] the next year. It passed through fifteen editions in the author's lifetime. Paley strenuously supported the abolition of the [[slave trade]], and his attack on slavery in the book was instrumental in drawing greater public attention to the practice. In 1789, a speech he gave on the subject in Carlisle was published.<ref>{{cite book | last=Paley | first=Edmund | title=The Works of William Paley, Vol 1 | year=1825 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Principles'' was followed in 1790 by his first essay in the field of Christian apologetics, ''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'' which compared the Paul's Epistles with the Acts of the Apostles, making use of \"undesigned coincidences\" to argue that these documents mutually supported each other's authenticity. Some have said this book was the most original of Paley's works. It was followed in 1794 by the celebrated ''View of the Evidences of Christianity'', which was also added to the examinations at Cambridge, remaining on the syllabus until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Paley | first=William | title=''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'' | url=https://archive.org/details/horaepaulinaeo00pale | year=1790 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nFor his services in defence of the faith, with the publication of the ''Evidences'', the [[Bishop of London]] gave him a stall in [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]; the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] made him subdean of that cathedral, and the [[Bishop of Durham]] conferred upon him the rectory of [[Bishopwearmouth]].

It was cited in several parliamentary debates over the [[corn laws]] in Britain and in debates in the US Congress. The book remained a set textbook at Cambridge well into the Victorian era. [[Charles Darwin]], as a student of theology, was required to read it when he did his undergraduate studies at Christ's College, but it was Paley's ''Natural Theology'' that most impressed Darwin even though it was not a set book for undergraduates. Portraits of Paley and Darwin face each other at Christ's College to this day.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQO3CgAAQBAJ|title=Charles Darwin in Cambridge: The Most Joyful Years|last=Wyhe|first=John van|date=2014-05-27|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814583992|location=|pages=120|language=en|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:William Paley Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity Title Page 1802.jpg|thumb|Title Page of William Paley's ''Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity'', 1802]]\nPaley is also remembered for his contributions to the [[philosophy of religion]], utilitarian ethics and Christian [[apologetics]]. In 1802, he published  ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'', his last book. As he states in the preface, he saw the book as a preamble to his other philosophical and theological books; in fact, he suggests that ''Natural Theology'' should be read first, so as to build a systematic understanding of his arguments. The main thrust of his argument was that God's design of the whole creation could be seen in the general happiness, or well-being, that was evident in the physical and social order of things. Such a book fell within the broad tradition of [[natural theology]] works written during the Enlightenment; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on [[John Ray]] (1691), [[William Derham]] (1711) and [[Bernard Nieuwentyt]] (1750).<ref>{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel and David M. Knight|title='Introduction', in William Paley, Natural Theology|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nPaley's argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. \"For my part\", he says, \"I take my stand in human anatomy\"; elsewhere he insists upon \"the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear\". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Science and Rhetoric of Paley's Natural Theology|journal=Literature and Theology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=1\u201322|doi=10.1093/litthe/18.1.1}}</ref> Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the [[Watchmaker analogy]].  Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock.  To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]] and the Dublin Astronomer Royal [[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural Theology|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=Appendix entry on Brinkley}}</ref>\n\nThe germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used sundials and Ptolemaic epicycles to illustrate the divine order of the world.  These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher [[Cicero]], especially in his ''[[De Natura Deorum|De natura deorum]]'', ii. 87 and 97.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hallam|first=Henry|title=Introduction to the Literature of Europe, Vol II|year=1847|publisher=Murray|location=London|page=385}}</ref>  The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment, by [[Deism|deists]] and Christians alike. Thus, Paley's use of the watch (and other mechanical objects like it) continued a long and fruitful tradition of analogical reasoning that was well received by those who read ''Natural Theology'' when it was published in 1802.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Three churchmen; John Wesley, William Paley, and Beilby Port Wellcome V0006791.jpg|thumb|Three churchmen: [[John Wesley]], William Paley, and [[Beilby Porteus]]. A posthumous engraving.]]\nSince Paley is often read in university courses that address the philosophy of religion, the timing of his design argument has sometimes perplexed modern philosophers. Earlier in the century [[David Hume]] had argued against notions of design with counter examples drawn from monstrosity, imperfect forms of testimony and probability (see [[watchmaker analogy#Criticism|watchmaker analogy]]). Hume's arguments, however, were not widely accepted by most of the reading public and they fell 'stillborn' (to use Hume's own assessment) from the press.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Fieser, James |title=Early Responses to Hume's Life and Reputation Vols 1 and 2 |year=2005 |publisher=Continuum}}</ref> Despite Hume's unpopularity, Paley's published works and in manuscript letters show that he engaged directly with Hume from his time as an undergraduate to his last works. Paley's works were more influential than Hume's from the 1800s to the 1840s.  Hume's arguments were only accepted gradually by the reading public, and his philosophical works sold poorly until agnostics like [[Thomas Huxley]] championed Hume's philosophy in the late 19th century.\n\nScientific norms have changed greatly since Paley's day, and are inclined to do less than justice to his arguments and ways of reasoning. But his style is lucid and he was willing to present transparently the evidence against his own case. The design argument has also been applied in other fields of scientific and philosophical inquiry, notably in regards to anthropic cosmological fine-tuning,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpIiIaC4kRA]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj_fLi_K7jA]</ref> fine-tuning for discoverability<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey8723Vc8gg]</ref> and the origin of life.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA-FcnLsF1g]</ref> His subject matter was central to Victorian anxieties, which might be one reason ''Natural Theology'' continued to appeal to the reading public, making his book a best seller for most of the 19th century, even after the publication of Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.  ''[[Natural Theology]]'' and the ''[[Evidences of Christianity]]'' appealed to Victorian [[Evangelicals]], although not so much to adherents of the [[Oxford Movement]] \u2013 and both found his ''utilitarianism'' objectionable.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fyfe |first=Aileen |title=Publishing and the classics: Paley's Natural Theology and the nineteenth-century scientific canon |journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science |year=2002 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=729\u2013751 |doi=10.1016/s0039-3681(02)00032-8|url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/5083/1/classics_of_science_Studies_revised.pdf }}</ref> Paley's views influenced (both positively and negatively) theologians, philosophers and scientists, then and since.\n\nIn addition to ''Moral and Political Philosophy'' and the ''Evidences'', [[Charles Darwin]] read ''Natural Theology'' during his student years, and later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument. His views changed with time. By the 1820s and 1830s, well-known liberals like [[Thomas Wakley]] and other radical editors of ''[[The Lancet]]'' were using Paley's ageing examples to attack the establishment's control over medical and scientific education in Durham, London, Oxford and Cambridge. It also inspired the [[Earl of Bridgewater]] to commission the ''Bridgewater Treatises'' and the [[Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge]] to issue cheap reprints for the rising middle class.   But whereas Paley's natural theology was disassembled or rebuilt by intellectuals like Wakley or the Bridgewater authors, the core of argument retained an ongoing popularity with the reading public and served as the basis of many catechisms and textbooks that were used in Britain and its colonies until World War II when, as argued by [[Matthew Daniel Eddy]], the existential morass of World War I undermined the moral teleology that had underpinned natural theology since the Enlightenment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology |journal=Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology |year=2013 |pages=101\u2013117 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1539597}}</ref>\n\nToday, Paley's name evokes both reverence and revulsion and his work is cited accordingly by authors seeking to frame their own views of design. Even [[Richard Dawkins]], an opponent of the ''design argument'', described himself as a ''neo-Paleyan'' in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. Today, as in his own time (though for different reasons), Paley is a controversial figure, a lightning rod for both sides in the contemporary argument between creationism and evolutionary biology.  His writings reflect the thought of his time, but as Dawkins observed, his was a strong and logical approach to evidence, whether human or natural. Perhaps this explains why the Oxford constitutional theorist [[A.V. Dicey]] had his pupils read the ''Evidences'' to teach them about legal reasoning. It is for such reasons that Paley's writings, ''Natural Theology'' included, stand as a notable body of work in the canon of Western thought.\n\n==Works==\n\n* ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', 1785\n* ''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'', 1790\n* ''View of the Evidences of Christianity'', 1794 \n* {{citation | author= Paley, William | year = 1809 | title =Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\n | edition =12th | location = London | publisher = J.

In 1789, a speech he gave on the subject in Carlisle was published.<ref>{{cite book | last=Paley | first=Edmund | title=The Works of William Paley, Vol 1 | year=1825 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Principles'' was followed in 1790 by his first essay in the field of Christian apologetics, ''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'' which compared the Paul's Epistles with the Acts of the Apostles, making use of \"undesigned coincidences\" to argue that these documents mutually supported each other's authenticity. Some have said this book was the most original of Paley's works. It was followed in 1794 by the celebrated ''View of the Evidences of Christianity'', which was also added to the examinations at Cambridge, remaining on the syllabus until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Paley | first=William | title=''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'' | url=https://archive.org/details/horaepaulinaeo00pale | year=1790 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nFor his services in defence of the faith, with the publication of the ''Evidences'', the [[Bishop of London]] gave him a stall in [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]; the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] made him subdean of that cathedral, and the [[Bishop of Durham]] conferred upon him the rectory of [[Bishopwearmouth]].  During the remainder of Paley's life, his time was divided between Bishopwearmouth and Lincoln, during which time he wrote ''Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity'', despite his increasingly debilitating illness.<ref>{{cite book | last=Stephen|first=Leslie | title=Dictionary of National Biography | year=1895 | publisher=MacMillan| location=New York | page=Paley entry}}</ref> He died on 27 May 1807 and is buried in Carlisle Cathedral with his two wives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19881/19881-8.txt | title=Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Carlisle | publisher=Project Gutenberg | date=2006 | accessdate=14 April 2014 | author=Eley, C.

It was cited in several parliamentary debates over the [[corn laws]] in Britain and in debates in the US Congress. The book remained a set textbook at Cambridge well into the Victorian era. [[Charles Darwin]], as a student of theology, was required to read it when he did his undergraduate studies at Christ's College, but it was Paley's ''Natural Theology'' that most impressed Darwin even though it was not a set book for undergraduates. Portraits of Paley and Darwin face each other at Christ's College to this day.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQO3CgAAQBAJ|title=Charles Darwin in Cambridge: The Most Joyful Years|last=Wyhe|first=John van|date=2014-05-27|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814583992|location=|pages=120|language=en|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:William Paley Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity Title Page 1802.jpg|thumb|Title Page of William Paley's ''Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity'', 1802]]\nPaley is also remembered for his contributions to the [[philosophy of religion]], utilitarian ethics and Christian [[apologetics]]. In 1802, he published  ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'', his last book. As he states in the preface, he saw the book as a preamble to his other philosophical and theological books; in fact, he suggests that ''Natural Theology'' should be read first, so as to build a systematic understanding of his arguments. The main thrust of his argument was that God's design of the whole creation could be seen in the general happiness, or well-being, that was evident in the physical and social order of things. Such a book fell within the broad tradition of [[natural theology]] works written during the Enlightenment; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on [[John Ray]] (1691), [[William Derham]] (1711) and [[Bernard Nieuwentyt]] (1750).<ref>{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel and David M. Knight|title='Introduction', in William Paley, Natural Theology|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nPaley's argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. \"For my part\", he says, \"I take my stand in human anatomy\"; elsewhere he insists upon \"the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear\". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Science and Rhetoric of Paley's Natural Theology|journal=Literature and Theology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=1\u201322|doi=10.1093/litthe/18.1.1}}</ref> Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the [[Watchmaker analogy]].  Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock.  To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]] and the Dublin Astronomer Royal [[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural Theology|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=Appendix entry on Brinkley}}</ref>\n\nThe germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used sundials and Ptolemaic epicycles to illustrate the divine order of the world.  These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher [[Cicero]], especially in his ''[[De Natura Deorum|De natura deorum]]'', ii. 87 and 97.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hallam|first=Henry|title=Introduction to the Literature of Europe, Vol II|year=1847|publisher=Murray|location=London|page=385}}</ref>  The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment, by [[Deism|deists]] and Christians alike. Thus, Paley's use of the watch (and other mechanical objects like it) continued a long and fruitful tradition of analogical reasoning that was well received by those who read ''Natural Theology'' when it was published in 1802.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Three churchmen; John Wesley, William Paley, and Beilby Port Wellcome V0006791.jpg|thumb|Three churchmen: [[John Wesley]], William Paley, and [[Beilby Porteus]]. A posthumous engraving.]]\nSince Paley is often read in university courses that address the philosophy of religion, the timing of his design argument has sometimes perplexed modern philosophers. Earlier in the century [[David Hume]] had argued against notions of design with counter examples drawn from monstrosity, imperfect forms of testimony and probability (see [[watchmaker analogy#Criticism|watchmaker analogy]]). Hume's arguments, however, were not widely accepted by most of the reading public and they fell 'stillborn' (to use Hume's own assessment) from the press.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Fieser, James |title=Early Responses to Hume's Life and Reputation Vols 1 and 2 |year=2005 |publisher=Continuum}}</ref> Despite Hume's unpopularity, Paley's published works and in manuscript letters show that he engaged directly with Hume from his time as an undergraduate to his last works. Paley's works were more influential than Hume's from the 1800s to the 1840s.  Hume's arguments were only accepted gradually by the reading public, and his philosophical works sold poorly until agnostics like [[Thomas Huxley]] championed Hume's philosophy in the late 19th century.\n\nScientific norms have changed greatly since Paley's day, and are inclined to do less than justice to his arguments and ways of reasoning. But his style is lucid and he was willing to present transparently the evidence against his own case. The design argument has also been applied in other fields of scientific and philosophical inquiry, notably in regards to anthropic cosmological fine-tuning,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpIiIaC4kRA]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj_fLi_K7jA]</ref> fine-tuning for discoverability<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey8723Vc8gg]</ref> and the origin of life.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA-FcnLsF1g]</ref> His subject matter was central to Victorian anxieties, which might be one reason ''Natural Theology'' continued to appeal to the reading public, making his book a best seller for most of the 19th century, even after the publication of Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.  ''[[Natural Theology]]'' and the ''[[Evidences of Christianity]]'' appealed to Victorian [[Evangelicals]], although not so much to adherents of the [[Oxford Movement]] \u2013 and both found his ''utilitarianism'' objectionable.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fyfe |first=Aileen |title=Publishing and the classics: Paley's Natural Theology and the nineteenth-century scientific canon |journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science |year=2002 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=729\u2013751 |doi=10.1016/s0039-3681(02)00032-8|url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/5083/1/classics_of_science_Studies_revised.pdf }}</ref> Paley's views influenced (both positively and negatively) theologians, philosophers and scientists, then and since.\n\nIn addition to ''Moral and Political Philosophy'' and the ''Evidences'', [[Charles Darwin]] read ''Natural Theology'' during his student years, and later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument. His views changed with time. By the 1820s and 1830s, well-known liberals like [[Thomas Wakley]] and other radical editors of ''[[The Lancet]]'' were using Paley's ageing examples to attack the establishment's control over medical and scientific education in Durham, London, Oxford and Cambridge. It also inspired the [[Earl of Bridgewater]] to commission the ''Bridgewater Treatises'' and the [[Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge]] to issue cheap reprints for the rising middle class.   But whereas Paley's natural theology was disassembled or rebuilt by intellectuals like Wakley or the Bridgewater authors, the core of argument retained an ongoing popularity with the reading public and served as the basis of many catechisms and textbooks that were used in Britain and its colonies until World War II when, as argued by [[Matthew Daniel Eddy]], the existential morass of World War I undermined the moral teleology that had underpinned natural theology since the Enlightenment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology |journal=Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology |year=2013 |pages=101\u2013117 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1539597}}</ref>\n\nToday, Paley's name evokes both reverence and revulsion and his work is cited accordingly by authors seeking to frame their own views of design. Even [[Richard Dawkins]], an opponent of the ''design argument'', described himself as a ''neo-Paleyan'' in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. Today, as in his own time (though for different reasons), Paley is a controversial figure, a lightning rod for both sides in the contemporary argument between creationism and evolutionary biology.  His writings reflect the thought of his time, but as Dawkins observed, his was a strong and logical approach to evidence, whether human or natural. Perhaps this explains why the Oxford constitutional theorist [[A.V. Dicey]] had his pupils read the ''Evidences'' to teach them about legal reasoning. It is for such reasons that Paley's writings, ''Natural Theology'' included, stand as a notable body of work in the canon of Western thought.\n\n==Works==\n\n* ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', 1785\n* ''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'', 1790\n* ''View of the Evidences of Christianity'', 1794 \n* {{citation | author= Paley, William | year = 1809 | title =Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\n | edition =12th | location = London | publisher = J.
