Set on the colonized fictional planet of Theron in the future, where an alien race led by Gaudy have invaded the human-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] craft in a effort to counterattack the invaders. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[microcomputer]] and [[Home video game console|console]] platforms by various [[third-party developer]]s, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.\n\n''Slap Fight'' proved to be popular for Toaplan among arcades players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, however it was met with mixed reception from video game magazines across western regions, specifically the home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n''Slap Fight'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game reminiscent of ''[[B-Wings]]'', where players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 space fighter craft in a counterattack effort to defeat an invading alien race led by Gaudy on planet Theron as the main objective.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"SFss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> Besides some [[helicopter]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard and side shots that travel a max distance of half the screen's height and length.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/>\n\nThe game's weapon [[power-up]] system takes inspiration from ''[[Gradius]]'';<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/> certain enemies spawn a [[star]]-shaped [[Item (gaming)|item]] upon destruction to be collected, activating an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen that moves a lit cursor through the list of weapon power-ups described below.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/> However, activating any weapon power-up increases the ship's [[Collision detection#Hitbox|hitbox]], making it a bigger target for enemy fire and difficult to keep successive lives in the heat of battle.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/> If any power-up is lit but the player's ship is destroyed before a power-up could be selected, the star item is \"carried over\" and the speed power-up is lit on the next life. A number of hidden bonus secrets to be found are hosted, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as firing on determined locations and certain [[setpiece]]s within the scenery in some stages reveals a bonus secret.\n\nMajor weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with laser or homing missile shots; other enemies are destroyed much faster with specific weapons to match. If [[bomb]] or homing missile shots are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to grow and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.<ref name=\"SFss\"/> It has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player's ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.<ref>{{cite web|author=smac|url=https://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/&do=findComment&comment=1735599|title=Best Trick, Cheat Or Bug In An Arcade Game.. (Page 2)|website=rllmukforum.com|date=16 March 2005|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\nThe game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's [[firepower]] to its original state and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to [[Continue (video games)|continue]] playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns. The title does not support continues with extra credits and is believed to loop endlessly.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot summary of ''Slap Fight'' varies between each region and version.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/><ref name=\"ALCONflyer\">''Alcon'' arcade flyer (Taito, US)</ref> The game takes place in the year 2059 on another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac. Five years ago, the colony on Orac was attacked by alien invaders and the war was so intense, the colonists were forced to leave. However, Theon is now under attack by the same alien fleet, but the humans are ready. The player assumes the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot in the SW475 space fighter craft to stop the invaders from taking over Theon.\n\n== Development ==\n=== Arcade version ===\n[[File:Slap Fight art design.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the artwork were hand-drawn sketches created by the development team before being transpose to [[pixel art]] graphics.]]\n''Slap Fight''{{'}}s development team had a concept for a game that featured secrets, while its main appeal to keep players investing long playtime sessions revolved around hidden items and the weapon power-up system, as then-Toaplan [[Video game composer|composer]] Masahiro Yuge stated that the team's idea for the game was to add many secrets as they could like one of the aliens from ''[[Space Invaders]]'', which was added as an homage to Taito, with Yuge citing his liking of titles with hidden secrets and characters.<ref name=\"PSGv10\">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=FSG|date=September 1989|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name=\"G49\">{{cite magazine|author=|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCb\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb \u7279\u8a2d\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4b\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Y\u016bsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u7279\u96c6  -

America|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1986 [[Shoot 'em up#Types|vertically scrolling shooter]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[Toaplan]] and published by [[Taito]]. Set on the colonized fictional planet of Theron in the future, where an alien race led by Gaudy have invaded the human-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] craft in a effort to counterattack the invaders. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[microcomputer]] and [[Home video game console|console]] platforms by various [[third-party developer]]s, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.\n\n''Slap Fight'' proved to be popular for Toaplan among arcades players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, however it was met with mixed reception from video game magazines across western regions, specifically the home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n''Slap Fight'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game reminiscent of ''[[B-Wings]]'', where players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 space fighter craft in a counterattack effort to defeat an invading alien race led by Gaudy on planet Theron as the main objective.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"SFss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> Besides some [[helicopter]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard and side shots that travel a max distance of half the screen's height and length.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/>\n\nThe game's weapon [[power-up]] system takes inspiration from ''[[Gradius]]'';<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/> certain enemies spawn a [[star]]-shaped [[Item (gaming)|item]] upon destruction to be collected, activating an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen that moves a lit cursor through the list of weapon power-ups described below.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/> However, activating any weapon power-up increases the ship's [[Collision detection#Hitbox|hitbox]], making it a bigger target for enemy fire and difficult to keep successive lives in the heat of battle.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/> If any power-up is lit but the player's ship is destroyed before a power-up could be selected, the star item is \"carried over\" and the speed power-up is lit on the next life. A number of hidden bonus secrets to be found are hosted, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as firing on determined locations and certain [[setpiece]]s within the scenery in some stages reveals a bonus secret.\n\nMajor weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with laser or homing missile shots; other enemies are destroyed much faster with specific weapons to match. If [[bomb]] or homing missile shots are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to grow and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.<ref name=\"SFss\"/> It has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player's ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.<ref>{{cite web|author=smac|url=https://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/&do=findComment&comment=1735599|title=Best Trick, Cheat Or Bug In An Arcade Game.. (Page 2)|website=rllmukforum.com|date=16 March 2005|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\nThe game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's [[firepower]] to its original state and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to [[Continue (video games)|continue]] playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns. The title does not support continues with extra credits and is believed to loop endlessly.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot summary of ''Slap Fight'' varies between each region and version.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/><ref name=\"ALCONflyer\">''Alcon'' arcade flyer (Taito, US)</ref> The game takes place in the year 2059 on another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac. Five years ago, the colony on Orac was attacked by alien invaders and the war was so intense, the colonists were forced to leave. However, Theon is now under attack by the same alien fleet, but the humans are ready. The player assumes the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot in the SW475 space fighter craft to stop the invaders from taking over Theon.\n\n== Development ==\n=== Arcade version ===\n[[File:Slap Fight art design.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the artwork were hand-drawn sketches created by the development team before being transpose to [[pixel art]] graphics.]]\n''Slap Fight''{{'}}s development team had a concept for a game that featured secrets, while its main appeal to keep players investing long playtime sessions revolved around hidden items and the weapon power-up system, as then-Toaplan [[Video game composer|composer]] Masahiro Yuge stated that the team's idea for the game was to add many secrets as they could like one of the aliens from ''[[Space Invaders]]'', which was added as an homage to Taito, with Yuge citing his liking of titles with hidden secrets and characters.<ref name=\"PSGv10\">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=FSG|date=September 1989|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name=\"G49\">{{cite magazine|author=|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCb\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb \u7279\u8a2d\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4b\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Y\u016bsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u7279\u96c6  -

The [[Tanzimat]] reforms introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the novel and the short story. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namik Kemal|N\u00e2m\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel ''\u0130ntib\u00e2h'' (Awakening), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi|\u015einasi]] has written, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"''\u015eair Evlenmesi''\" (The Poet's Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period: the ''Edebiyat-\u0131 Ced\u00eede'' (New Literature) movement; the ''Fecr-i \u00c2t\u00ee'' (Dawn of the Future) movement; and the ''Mill\u00ee Edebiyat'' (National Literature) movement. The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish poetry was taken by [[N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet Ran|N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]], who introduced the [[free verse]] style. Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the [[Garip]] movement led by [[Orhan Veli Kan\u0131k|Orhan Veli]], [[Oktay R\u0131fat Horozcu|Oktay R\u0131fat]] and [[Melih Cevdet Anday|Melih Cevdet]]. The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatised, for example, in the form of the \"new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures\" enacted in the novels of [[Orhan Pamuk]], recipient of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6044192.stm|title=Pamuk wins Nobel Literature prize|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 December 2006|date=12 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:S\u00fcreyya Opera House in Istanbul, Turkey.jpg|thumb|right|[[S\u00fcreyya Opera House]] in Istanbul]]\n\nThe origin of [[Turkish theatre]] dates back to ancient pagan rituals and oral legends. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. In time, the ancient rituals, myths, legends and stories evolved into theatrical shows. Starting from the 11th-century, the traditions of the Seljuk Turks blended with those of the indigenous peoples of Anatolia and the interaction between diverse cultures paved the way for new plays. After the [[Tanzimat]] (Reformation) period in the 19th century, characters in Turkish theatre were modernised and plays were performed on European-style stages, with actors wearing European costumes. Following the [[Second Constitutional Era|restoration of constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected at the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, [[Dar\u00fclbedayi|Dar\u00fclbedayi-i Osmani]] (which became the nucleus of the [[Istanbul City Theatres]]) was established in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Dar\u00fclbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Numerous Turkish playwrights emerged in this era; some of them wrote on romantic subjects, while others were interested in social problems, and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. The first Turkish musicals were also written in this period. In time, Turkish women began to appear on stage, which was an important development in the late Ottoman society. Until then, female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey's ethnic minorities. Today there are numerous private theatres in the country, together with those which are subsidised by the government, such as the [[Turkish State Theatres]].<ref name=\"turkishculture.org4\">{{cite web|title=Traditional Theatre|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/performing-arts/theatre-36.htm|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>\nNotable players, directors and playwrights of Turkish theatre include [[Muhsin Ertu\u011frul]], [[Haldun Taner]], [[Aziz Nesin]], [[G\u00fclriz Sururi]], [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z Kenter]], [[M\u00fc\u015ffik Kenter]], [[Haldun Dormen]], [[Sadri Al\u0131\u015f\u0131k]], [[\u00c7olpan \u0130lhan]], [[M\u00fcnir \u00d6zkul]], [[Adile Na\u015fit]], [[Erol G\u00fcnayd\u0131n]], [[Gazanfer \u00d6zcan]], [[Nejat Uygur]], [[Genco Erkal]], [[Metin Serezli]], [[Nevra Serezli]], [[Levent K\u0131rca]], [[Zeki Alasya]], [[Metin Akp\u0131nar]], [[M\u00fcjdat Gezen]], [[Ferhan \u015eensoy]], among others.\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{Main|Turkish dance|Music of Turkey}}\n{{see also|Turkish classical music|Turkish folk music|Turkish music (style)}}\n[[File:Sertab Erener 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sertab Erener]] and [[Demir Demirkan]]]]\n\n[[Music of Turkey]] includes mainly [[Turkic culture|Turkic]] elements as well as partial influences ranging from [[Music of Central Asia|Central Asian folk music]], [[Arabic music]], [[Greek music]], [[Ottoman music]], [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] and [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Balkan music]], as well as references to more modern European and [[Music of the United States|American]] [[popular music]].

This book was based on recipes found in an 18th century Ottoman manuscript. His second book was about palace cuisine during the reign of [[Mehmet II]]. Following the publication of \u00dcnver's book subsequent studies were published, including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin \u00d6gel about the [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] origins of Turkish cuisine.<ref name=berg />\n\n[[Ottoman cuisine]] contains elements of [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], [[Kurdish cuisine|Kurdish]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] and [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] cuisines.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-61069-389-9| last = Kia| first = Mehrdad| title = The Ottoman Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes]|year=2017|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgUmDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA4}}</ref> The country's position between [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] helped the Turks in gaining complete control of the major [[trade route]]s, and an ideal landscape and climate allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s six hundred-year reign. [[Yogurt]] salads, fish in [[olive oil]], [[sharbat|sherbet]] and [[dolma|stuffed and wrapped vegetables]] became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from [[Austria]] and [[Ukraine]] to [[Arabia]] and [[North Africa]], used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914\u20131918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and Western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.<ref name=\"foodbycountry.com\">{{cite web|title=Food in Turkey \u2013 Turkish Food, Turkish Cuisine |url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Spain-to-Zimbabwe-Cumulative-Index/Turkey.html|website=foodbycountry.com|access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sports in Turkey}}\n{{see also|Football in Turkey}}\n[[File:La selecci\u00f3n turca de baloncesto tras recibir la medalla de plata.jpg|thumb|[[Turkey national basketball team|Turkey]] won the silver medal at the [[2010 FIBA World Championship]].]]\n\nThe most popular [[Sports in Turkey|sport in Turkey]] is [[association football]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/sports.htm|title=Sports in Turkey|author=Burak Sansal|publisher=allaboutturkey.com|access-date=13 December 2006|year=2006}}</ref> [[Galatasaray S.K.

The [[Tanzimat]] reforms introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the novel and the short story. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namik Kemal|N\u00e2m\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel ''\u0130ntib\u00e2h'' (Awakening), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi|\u015einasi]] has written, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"''\u015eair Evlenmesi''\" (The Poet's Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period: the ''Edebiyat-\u0131 Ced\u00eede'' (New Literature) movement; the ''Fecr-i \u00c2t\u00ee'' (Dawn of the Future) movement; and the ''Mill\u00ee Edebiyat'' (National Literature) movement. The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish poetry was taken by [[N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet Ran|N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]], who introduced the [[free verse]] style. Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the [[Garip]] movement led by [[Orhan Veli Kan\u0131k|Orhan Veli]], [[Oktay R\u0131fat Horozcu|Oktay R\u0131fat]] and [[Melih Cevdet Anday|Melih Cevdet]]. The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatised, for example, in the form of the \"new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures\" enacted in the novels of [[Orhan Pamuk]], recipient of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6044192.stm|title=Pamuk wins Nobel Literature prize|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 December 2006|date=12 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:S\u00fcreyya Opera House in Istanbul, Turkey.jpg|thumb|right|[[S\u00fcreyya Opera House]] in Istanbul]]\n\nThe origin of [[Turkish theatre]] dates back to ancient pagan rituals and oral legends. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. In time, the ancient rituals, myths, legends and stories evolved into theatrical shows. Starting from the 11th-century, the traditions of the Seljuk Turks blended with those of the indigenous peoples of Anatolia and the interaction between diverse cultures paved the way for new plays. After the [[Tanzimat]] (Reformation) period in the 19th century, characters in Turkish theatre were modernised and plays were performed on European-style stages, with actors wearing European costumes. Following the [[Second Constitutional Era|restoration of constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected at the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, [[Dar\u00fclbedayi|Dar\u00fclbedayi-i Osmani]] (which became the nucleus of the [[Istanbul City Theatres]]) was established in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Dar\u00fclbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Numerous Turkish playwrights emerged in this era; some of them wrote on romantic subjects, while others were interested in social problems, and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. The first Turkish musicals were also written in this period. In time, Turkish women began to appear on stage, which was an important development in the late Ottoman society. Until then, female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey's ethnic minorities. Today there are numerous private theatres in the country, together with those which are subsidised by the government, such as the [[Turkish State Theatres]].<ref name=\"turkishculture.org4\">{{cite web|title=Traditional Theatre|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/performing-arts/theatre-36.htm|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>\nNotable players, directors and playwrights of Turkish theatre include [[Muhsin Ertu\u011frul]], [[Haldun Taner]], [[Aziz Nesin]], [[G\u00fclriz Sururi]], [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z Kenter]], [[M\u00fc\u015ffik Kenter]], [[Haldun Dormen]], [[Sadri Al\u0131\u015f\u0131k]], [[\u00c7olpan \u0130lhan]], [[M\u00fcnir \u00d6zkul]], [[Adile Na\u015fit]], [[Erol G\u00fcnayd\u0131n]], [[Gazanfer \u00d6zcan]], [[Nejat Uygur]], [[Genco Erkal]], [[Metin Serezli]], [[Nevra Serezli]], [[Levent K\u0131rca]], [[Zeki Alasya]], [[Metin Akp\u0131nar]], [[M\u00fcjdat Gezen]], [[Ferhan \u015eensoy]], among others.\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{Main|Turkish dance|Music of Turkey}}\n{{see also|Turkish classical music|Turkish folk music|Turkish music (style)}}\n[[File:Sertab Erener 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sertab Erener]] and [[Demir Demirkan]]]]\n\n[[Music of Turkey]] includes mainly [[Turkic culture|Turkic]] elements as well as partial influences ranging from [[Music of Central Asia|Central Asian folk music]], [[Arabic music]], [[Greek music]], [[Ottoman music]], [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] and [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Balkan music]], as well as references to more modern European and [[Music of the United States|American]] [[popular music]].

This book was based on recipes found in an 18th century Ottoman manuscript. His second book was about palace cuisine during the reign of [[Mehmet II]]. Following the publication of \u00dcnver's book subsequent studies were published, including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin \u00d6gel about the [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] origins of Turkish cuisine.<ref name=berg />\n\n[[Ottoman cuisine]] contains elements of [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], [[Kurdish cuisine|Kurdish]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] and [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] cuisines.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-61069-389-9| last = Kia| first = Mehrdad| title = The Ottoman Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes]|year=2017|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgUmDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA4}}</ref> The country's position between [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] helped the Turks in gaining complete control of the major [[trade route]]s, and an ideal landscape and climate allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s six hundred-year reign. [[Yogurt]] salads, fish in [[olive oil]], [[sharbat|sherbet]] and [[dolma|stuffed and wrapped vegetables]] became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from [[Austria]] and [[Ukraine]] to [[Arabia]] and [[North Africa]], used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914\u20131918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and Western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.<ref name=\"foodbycountry.com\">{{cite web|title=Food in Turkey \u2013 Turkish Food, Turkish Cuisine |url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Spain-to-Zimbabwe-Cumulative-Index/Turkey.html|website=foodbycountry.com|access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sports in Turkey}}\n{{see also|Football in Turkey}}\n[[File:La selecci\u00f3n turca de baloncesto tras recibir la medalla de plata.jpg|thumb|[[Turkey national basketball team|Turkey]] won the silver medal at the [[2010 FIBA World Championship]].]]\n\nThe most popular [[Sports in Turkey|sport in Turkey]] is [[association football]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/sports.htm|title=Sports in Turkey|author=Burak Sansal|publisher=allaboutturkey.com|access-date=13 December 2006|year=2006}}</ref> [[Galatasaray S.K.

K. Rowling]] and the fifth novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. It follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter's]] struggles through his fifth year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], including the surreptitious return of the antagonist [[Lord Voldemort]], [[Hogwarts#Subjects_and_teachers|O.W.L.]] exams, and an obstructive [[Ministry of Magic]]. The novel was published on 21 June 2003 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC|Bloomsbury]] in the United Kingdom, [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]] in the United States, and [[Raincoast Books|Raincoast]] in Canada. It sold five million copies in the first 24 hours of publication.<ref name=\"July date\"/> It is the longest book of the series.\n\n''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' won several awards, including the [[American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults|American Library Association Best Book Award for Young Adults]] in 2003. The book was also made into a 2007 [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|film]] and [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|a video game]] by [[Electronic Arts]].\n\n==Plot==   I like turtles\n\nDuring the summer holidays with his aunt [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] and uncle [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]], 15-year-old [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his cousin [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] are attacked by [[Dementors]]. After openly using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, but his expulsion is postponed pending a hearing at the Ministry of Magic. Harry is whisked off by a group of wizards including [[\"Mad-Eye\" Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], [[Remus Lupin]], and several new faces, including [[Nymphadora Tonks]], a bubbly young Metamorphmagus (a witch or wizard who can change his or her appearance without a potion or spell), and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], a senior Auror, to [[Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], the childhood home of [[Sirius Black]]. The building also serves as the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], of which Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Sirius are also members. [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] explain that the Order is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] dedicated to fighting [[Lord Voldemort]] and his followers, the [[Death Eaters]]. From the members of the Order, Harry, Ron, Hermione, [[Ginny Weasley]] and [[Fred and George Weasley]] learn that Voldemort is seeking an object he did not have prior to his first defeat and assume this object to be a weapon of some sort. Harry learns the [[Ministry of Magic]], led by [[Cornelius Fudge]], is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because of the panic and chaos doing so would cause. Harry also learns [[the Daily Prophet]] has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore. At the hearing, Harry is cleared when Dumbledore provides evidence that Harry was fully within his rights to use magic against the Dementors, but refuses to make direct eye contact with him.\n\nAt Hogwarts, [[Dolores Umbridge]], a senior employee in the Ministry of Magic, becomes the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. Umbridge and Harry clash because she, like Fudge, refuses to believe Voldemort has returned. She punishes Harry for his rebellious outbursts by having him write \"I must not tell lies\" with a cursed quill that carves the phrase into the back of his hand. She also refuses to teach her students how to perform defensive spells, prompting Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form their own Defence Against the Dark Arts group with students from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. They call this group [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Many students sign up, including [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Ginny Weasley]], and [[Luna Lovegood]]. The next day, however, they see on the notice board that Umbridge has banned all clubs she has not approved. Struggling to find a place to practice, [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]] the house elf tells him about the [[Room of Requirement]] and its uses. The club meets there to learn and practice defensive spells under Harry's instruction.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Rubeus Hagrid]] has not yet returned from the secret mission Dumbledore gave him at the end of the previous book and is absent for the first part of the school year. Upon his return, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn his mission, which was mostly unsuccessful, was to find the last giants and prevent their joining Lord Voldemort. Professor Umbridge has been steadily amassing more and more power and influence at the school, and as she begins regularly inspecting Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures lessons, it is clear she intends to sack him.\n\nOne night, Harry dreams through the eyes of Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]], who is possessed by Voldemort. Nagini attacks and seriously injures [[Arthur Weasley]]. Harry tells [[Professor McGonagall]] and Dumbledore, and Mr. Weasley is rescued. Dumbledore arranges for Harry to take [[Occlumency]] lessons with [[Professor Snape]] to protect his mind against further invasions by Voldemort.\n\nUmbridge sacks Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher, but she is outraged when Professor Dumbledore undermines her power by allowing Trelawney to continue living at the school and hiring Firenze, a centaur, to take her place, in spite of Umbridge's prejudice against part-humans. Soon after, Umbridge is given a tip-off about Dumbledore's Army by Marietta Edgecombe, a friend of Harry's crush Cho Chang. Marietta's betrayal unwittingly activates a curse set by Hermione that disfigures her face. Despite Dobby's warning, the gang are caught and get into trouble with Fudge. When Dumbledore takes responsibility for the illegal organisation, he is forced into hiding. Dolores Umbridge becomes headmistress, and Fred and George cause pandemonium around the school in revenge.\n\nDuring one Occlumency lesson, Snape is called away. Harry, left alone, looks into Dumbledore's Pensieve, which Snape has borrowed, and sees a memory of Snape's time as a Hogwarts student. Harry is shocked to witness his father, [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], and Sirius bullying and humiliating Snape. Snape catches Harry and, enraged, refuses to continue his lessons. Distraught at this revelation of his father's character, Harry talks to Sirius and Lupin using Floo powder in the fireplace in Umbridge's office and learns more about his parents and their background. After helping Harry break into Umbridge's office, Fred and George leave Hogwarts to start a joke shop in Diagon Alley.\n\nSuspecting he will be the next teacher Umbridge sacks, Hagrid confesses to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that he has brought his giant half-brother, Grawp, to Hogwarts and hidden him in the Forbidden Forest with the intention of eventually introducing him to human society. Hagrid asks the three of them to look after Grawp if he must leave the school. Sure enough, Umbridge leads a party of Aurors to attack Hagrid in his house one night. Hagrid overpowers them and flees the school. McGonagall, trying to disrupt the violence, is badly injured and put in [[St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]].\n\nOn the last day of O.W.L. exams, Harry has a vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. Harry uses Umbridge's office fireplace to contact the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters and check whether the vision was genuine. [[Kreacher]] the house elf informs him Sirius is indeed at the Ministry just before Umbridge catches Harry and his friends. Umbridge summons Snape to provide [[Veritaserum]] to question Harry, but Snape claims to have no further stocks of the potion left. Remembering Snape is also a member of the Order, Harry gives him a cryptic warning about Sirius, but Snape claims to have not understood it.\n\nUmbridge decides to use the illegal [[Cruciatus Curse]] on Harry to interrogate him about Sirius's whereabouts. She also reveals that she ordered the Dementor attack on Harry, intending to have him either silenced or discredited. Hermione intervenes, and in order to create a distraction, she convinces Umbridge they are hiding a weapon of Dumbledore's in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Harry and Hermione lead her into an area of the forest inhabited by centaurs, where Umbridge provokes them into taking her captive. The centaurs are furious upon learning that Hermione used them to do her bidding and turn on the pair, but Grawp arrives and clashes with the centaurs, allowing Harry and Hermione to escape.\n\nLuna, Ron, Ginny, and Neville join them in the forest, and all six fly to the Ministry on [[thestrals]], expecting to find and rescue Sirius. Once in the Department of Mysteries, Harry realises his vision was falsely planted by Voldemort. However, he finds a glass sphere bearing his and Voldemort's names. [[Death Eater]]s led by [[Lucius Malfoy]] attack in order to capture the sphere, which is a recording of a prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort. The prophecy is revealed to be the object Voldemort has been trying to obtain the whole year because Voldemort believes he missed something when he first heard the prophecy. Lucius explains that only the subjects of prophecies (in this case, Harry or Voldemort) can remove them from the shelves. During a heated fight, Neville accidentally kicks and smashes the prophecy. Harry and his friends, soon joined by members of the Order, battle with the Death Eaters. During the fight, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] kills Sirius. Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Dumbledore appears and engages in a ferocious duel with Voldemort, which eventually reaches a stalemate. Unable to kill Dumbledore, Voldemort tries to possess Harry in an attempt to get Dumbledore to kill Harry. Harry fights off the possession, and Voldemort escapes just as Fudge appears. Faced with firsthand evidence that Voldemort has returned, Fudge has no choice but to accept the truth.\n\nIn his office, Dumbledore explains that Snape understood Harry's cryptic warning and contacted Sirius to confirm he was still at Grimmauld Place. After Harry did not return from the Forbidden Forest, Snape deduced where he had gone and alerted the Order, enabling them to save Harry and his friends. Dumbledore reveals that during the Christmas holidays, Kreacher interpreted a command of Sirius's as an order to leave the house and went to Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius, and told her about Harry and Sirius's close relationship. Voldemort used Kreacher's information to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries by planting the vision that Sirius was in danger there.\n\nOwing Harry a full explanation, Dumbledore reveals the full contents of the prophecy made by Sybil Trelawney herself:\n:''The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches''\n:''Born to those who have thrice defied him''\n:''Born as the seventh month dies''\n:''And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal''\n:''But he will have power the Dark Lord knows not''\n:''And either must die at the hand of the other''\n:''For neither can live while the other survives''\n:''The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord''\n:''Will be born as the seventh month dies''\n\nVoldemort learned of the first part of the prophecy and subsequently tried to murder Harry, believing he could prevent the prophecy from coming true and unaware he would grant Harry great power and mark him as an equal by doing so. Dumbledore tells Harry he must stay with the Dursleys for one last summer because, by taking Harry into her home, Aunt Petunia, Lily's older sister, seals the protection Harry's mother afforded him when she died. As long as he is at [[Number Four Privet Drive|Number Four, Privet Drive]], he is safe from Voldemort and his followers.\n\nHarry comes to terms with the responsibility of the prophecy but mourns the loss of his godfather. Harry then finds an old handheld mirror in his dormitory that was a gift from Sirius. He realises Sirius would not want him to be depressed on the matter and resolves to keep fighting Voldemort.\n\n==Publication and release==\n''Potter'' fans waited three years between the releases of the fourth and fifth books.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/entertainment/books/harry-potter-timeline.html|title=Harry Potter Timeline: 2000 to the Present|last=Ross|first=Shmuel|author2=Mark Zurlo|date=2000\u20132009|publisher=Pearson Education, publishing as Infoplease|accessdate=11 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224155835/http://www.infoplease.com/entertainment/books/harry-potter-timeline.html|archivedate=24 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"list\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/books/index.shtml|title=Harry Potter Books|date=1999\u20132009|publisher=MuggleNet.com|accessdate=29 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606023823/http://www.mugglenet.com/books/index.shtml|archivedate=6 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before the release of the fifth book, 200&nbsp;million copies of the first four books had already been sold and translated into 55&nbsp;languages in 200&nbsp;countries.<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/books/06/20/sprj.cas03.potter.advancer/|title=Potter-mania sweeps bookstores|date=30 June 2003|publisher=CNN|accessdate=29 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724155040/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/books/06/20/sprj.cas03.potter.advancer/|archivedate=24 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As the series was already a global phenomenon, the book forged new pre-order records, with thousands of people queuing outside book stores on 20 June 2003&nbsp;to secure copies at midnight.<ref name=\"cnn\"/> Despite the security, thousands of copies were stolen from an [[Earlestown]], Merseyside warehouse on 15 June 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2996718.stm|title=Thousands of Potter books stolen|date=17 June 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818100547/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2996718.stm|archivedate=18 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n\n''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' was met with mostly positive reviews and received several awards.

K. Rowling]] and the fifth novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. It follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter's]] struggles through his fifth year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], including the surreptitious return of the antagonist [[Lord Voldemort]], [[Hogwarts#Subjects_and_teachers|O.W.L.]] exams, and an obstructive [[Ministry of Magic]]. The novel was published on 21 June 2003 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC|Bloomsbury]] in the United Kingdom, [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]] in the United States, and [[Raincoast Books|Raincoast]] in Canada. It sold five million copies in the first 24 hours of publication.<ref name=\"July date\"/> It is the longest book of the series.\n\n''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' won several awards, including the [[American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults|American Library Association Best Book Award for Young Adults]] in 2003. The book was also made into a 2007 [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|film]] and [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|a video game]] by [[Electronic Arts]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the summer holidays with his aunt [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] and uncle [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]], 15-year-old [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his cousin [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] are attacked by [[Dementors]]. After openly using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, but his expulsion is postponed pending a hearing at the Ministry of Magic. Harry is whisked off by a group of wizards including [[\"Mad-Eye\" Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], [[Remus Lupin]], and several new faces, including [[Nymphadora Tonks]], a bubbly young Metamorphmagus (a witch or wizard who can change his or her appearance without a potion or spell), and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], a senior Auror, to [[Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], the childhood home of [[Sirius Black]]. The building also serves as the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], of which Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Sirius are also members. [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] explain that the Order is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] dedicated to fighting [[Lord Voldemort]] and his followers, the [[Death Eaters]]. From the members of the Order, Harry, Ron, Hermione, [[Ginny Weasley]] and [[Fred and George Weasley]] learn that Voldemort is seeking an object he did not have prior to his first defeat and assume this object to be a weapon of some sort. Harry learns the [[Ministry of Magic]], led by [[Cornelius Fudge]], is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because of the panic and chaos doing so would cause. Harry also learns [[the Daily Prophet]] has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore. At the hearing, Harry is cleared when Dumbledore provides evidence that Harry was fully within his rights to use magic against the Dementors, but refuses to make direct eye contact with him.\n\nAt Hogwarts, [[Dolores Umbridge]], a senior employee in the Ministry of Magic, becomes the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. Umbridge and Harry clash because she, like Fudge, refuses to believe Voldemort has returned. She punishes Harry for his rebellious outbursts by having him write \"I must not tell lies\" with a cursed quill that carves the phrase into the back of his hand. She also refuses to teach her students how to perform defensive spells, prompting Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form their own Defence Against the Dark Arts group with students from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. They call this group [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Many students sign up, including [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Fred and George Weasley]], [[Ginny Weasley]], and [[Luna Lovegood]]. The next day, however, they see on the notice board that Umbridge has banned all clubs she has not approved. Struggling to find a place to practice, [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]] the house elf tells him about the [[Room of Requirement]] and its uses. The club meets there to learn and practice defensive spells under Harry's instruction.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Rubeus Hagrid]] has not yet returned from the secret mission Dumbledore gave him at the end of the previous book and is absent for the first part of the school year. Upon his return, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn his mission, which was mostly unsuccessful, was to find the last giants and prevent their joining Lord Voldemort. Professor Umbridge has been steadily amassing more and more power and influence at the school, and as she begins regularly inspecting Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures lessons, it is clear she intends to sack him.\n\nOne night, Harry dreams through the eyes of Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]], who is possessed by Voldemort. Nagini attacks and seriously injures [[Arthur Weasley]]. Harry tells [[Professor McGonagall]] and Dumbledore, and Mr. Weasley is rescued. Dumbledore arranges for Harry to take [[Occlumency]] lessons with [[Professor Snape]] to protect his mind against further invasions by Voldemort.\n\nUmbridge sacks Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher, but she is outraged when Professor Dumbledore undermines her power by allowing Trelawney to continue living at the school and hiring Firenze, a centaur, to take her place, in spite of Umbridge's prejudice against part-humans. Soon after, Umbridge is given a tip-off about Dumbledore's Army by Marietta Edgecombe, a friend of Harry's crush Cho Chang. Marietta's betrayal unwittingly activates a curse set by Hermione that disfigures her face. Despite Dobby's warning, the gang are caught and get into trouble with Fudge. When Dumbledore takes responsibility for the illegal organisation, he is forced into hiding. Dolores Umbridge becomes headmistress, and Fred and George cause pandemonium around the school in revenge.\n\nDuring one Occlumency lesson, Snape is called away. Harry, left alone, looks into Dumbledore's Pensieve, which Snape has borrowed, and sees a memory of Snape's time as a Hogwarts student. Harry is shocked to witness his father, [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], and Sirius bullying and humiliating Snape. Snape catches Harry and, enraged, refuses to continue his lessons. Distraught at this revelation of his father's character, Harry talks to Sirius and Lupin using Floo powder in the fireplace in Umbridge's office and learns more about his parents and their background. After helping Harry break into Umbridge's office, Fred and George leave Hogwarts to start a joke shop in Diagon Alley.\n\nSuspecting he will be the next teacher Umbridge sacks, Hagrid confesses to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that he has brought his giant half-brother, Grawp, to Hogwarts and hidden him in the Forbidden Forest with the intention of eventually introducing him to human society. Hagrid asks the three of them to look after Grawp if he must leave the school. Sure enough, Umbridge leads a party of Aurors to attack Hagrid in his house one night. Hagrid overpowers them and flees the school. McGonagall, trying to disrupt the violence, is badly injured and put in [[St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]].\n\nOn the last day of O.W.L. exams, Harry has a vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. Harry uses Umbridge's office fireplace to contact the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters and check whether the vision was genuine. [[Kreacher]] the house elf informs him Sirius is indeed at the Ministry just before Umbridge catches Harry and his friends. Umbridge summons Snape to provide [[Veritaserum]] to question Harry, but Snape claims to have no further stocks of the potion left. Remembering Snape is also a member of the Order, Harry gives him a cryptic warning about Sirius, but Snape claims to have not understood it.\n\nUmbridge decides to use the illegal [[Cruciatus Curse]] on Harry to interrogate him about Sirius's whereabouts. She also reveals that she ordered the Dementor attack on Harry, intending to have him either silenced or discredited. Hermione intervenes, and in order to create a distraction, she convinces Umbridge they are hiding a weapon of Dumbledore's in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Harry and Hermione lead her into an area of the forest inhabited by centaurs, where Umbridge provokes them into taking her captive. The centaurs are furious upon learning that Hermione used them to do her bidding and turn on the pair, but Grawp arrives and clashes with the centaurs, allowing Harry and Hermione to escape.\n\nLuna, Ron, Ginny, and Neville join them in the forest, and all six fly to the Ministry on [[thestrals]], expecting to find and rescue Sirius. Once in the Department of Mysteries, Harry realises his vision was falsely planted by Voldemort. However, he finds a glass sphere bearing his and Voldemort's names. [[Death Eater]]s led by [[Lucius Malfoy]] attack in order to capture the sphere, which is a recording of a prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort. The prophecy is revealed to be the object Voldemort has been trying to obtain the whole year because Voldemort believes he missed something when he first heard the prophecy. Lucius explains that only the subjects of prophecies (in this case, Harry or Voldemort) can remove them from the shelves. During a heated fight, Neville accidentally kicks and smashes the prophecy. Harry and his friends, soon joined by members of the Order, battle with the Death Eaters. During the fight, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] kills Sirius. Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Dumbledore appears and engages in a ferocious duel with Voldemort, which eventually reaches a stalemate. Unable to kill Dumbledore, Voldemort tries to possess Harry in an attempt to get Dumbledore to kill Harry. Harry fights off the possession, and Voldemort escapes just as Fudge appears. Faced with firsthand evidence that Voldemort has returned, Fudge has no choice but to accept the truth.\n\nIn his office, Dumbledore explains that Snape understood Harry's cryptic warning and contacted Sirius to confirm he was still at Grimmauld Place. After Harry did not return from the Forbidden Forest, Snape deduced where he had gone and alerted the Order, enabling them to save Harry and his friends. Dumbledore reveals that during the Christmas holidays, Kreacher interpreted a command of Sirius's as an order to leave the house and went to Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius, and told her about Harry and Sirius's close relationship. Voldemort used Kreacher's information to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries by planting the vision that Sirius was in danger there.\n\nOwing Harry a full explanation, Dumbledore reveals the full contents of the prophecy made by Sybil Trelawney herself:\n:''The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches''\n:''Born to those who have thrice defied him''\n:''Born as the seventh month dies''\n:''And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal''\n:''But he will have power the Dark Lord knows not''\n:''And either must die at the hand of the other''\n:''For neither can live while the other survives''\n:''The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord''\n:''Will be born as the seventh month dies''\n\nVoldemort learned of the first part of the prophecy and subsequently tried to murder Harry, believing he could prevent the prophecy from coming true and unaware he would grant Harry great power and mark him as an equal by doing so. Dumbledore tells Harry he must stay with the Dursleys for one last summer because, by taking Harry into her home, Aunt Petunia, Lily's older sister, seals the protection Harry's mother afforded him when she died. As long as he is at [[Number Four Privet Drive|Number Four, Privet Drive]], he is safe from Voldemort and his followers.\n\nHarry comes to terms with the responsibility of the prophecy but mourns the loss of his godfather. Harry then finds an old handheld mirror in his dormitory that was a gift from Sirius.

She believed God would have wanted her to. They were caught, and she was arrested and sent to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]].

She heard that the ten Booms had previously helped their Jewish neighbors, the Weils, and asked if they could help her too.

Corrie and her sister Betsie opened their home to Jewish and Gentile refugees who were members of the [[Dutch resistance|resistance movement]], and as a result they were sought after by the [[Gestapo]] and its Dutch counterpart. The secret room was in Corrie's bedroom behind a false wall and would hold 6 people. A ventilation system was installed for the occupants. A buzzer could be heard in the house to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible during security sweeps through the neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corrie ten Boom Biography |url=https://www.biography.com/activist/corrie-ten-boom |website=Biography |accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref> They had plenty of room, but wartime shortages meant that food was scarce. Every non-Jewish Dutch person had received a ration card, the requirement for obtaining weekly food coupons. Through her charitable work, ten Boom knew many people in Haarlem and remembered a family with a disabled daughter, whose father was a civil servant who was now in charge of the local ration-card office.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> She went to his house one evening, and when he asked how many ration cards she needed, \"I opened my mouth to say, 'Five,'\" ten Boom wrote in ''The Hiding Place''. \"But the number that unexpectedly and astonishingly came out instead was: 'One hundred.'\"<ref>Boom, Corrie ten. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p. 92</ref> He gave them to her and she provided cards to every Jew she met.\n\nThe refugee work which ten Boom and her sister did at the Beje became known by the [[Dutch Resistance]], which sent an architect to the ten Boom home to build a secret room adjacent to the room for the Jews who were in hiding and an alert buzzer that could be used to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Arrest, detention and release===\nOn February 28th, 1944, a Dutch informant, Jan Vogel, told the Nazis about the ten Booms' work; at around 12:30 p.m. of that day, the Nazis arrested the entire ten Boom family. They were sent to [[Scheveningen]] Prison when Resistance materials and extra [[ration cards]] were found at the home.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=120}}</ref> Nollie and Willem were released immediately, along with Corrie's nephew Peter van Woerden; Casper died ten days later. The group of six people hidden by the ten Booms, made up of both Jews and resistance workers, remained undiscovered. Corrie received a letter one day in prison, \"All the watches in your cabinet are safe\", meaning that the refugees had managed to escape and were safe.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Four days after the raid, resistance workers transferred them to other locations. Altogether, the [[Gestapo]] arrested some 30 people who were in the family home that day.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006914 | publisher = The Holocaust Memorial | title = Holocaust Memorial - Corrie ten Boom}}</ref>\n\nTen Boom was initially held in [[solitary confinement]]. After three months, she was taken to her first hearing. At her trial, ten Boom spoke about her work with the mentally disabled; the Nazi lieutenant scoffed, because the Nazis had been [[Aktion T4|killing mentally disabled individuals]] for years in accordance with their [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] policies.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=121}}</ref> Ten Boom defended her work by saying that in the eyes of [[God]], a mentally disabled person might be more valuable \"than a watchmaker.

There, they held worship services after the hard days at work by using a [[Bible]] that they had managed to smuggle in.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> While they were imprisoned at Ravensbruck, Betsie and her sister began to discuss plans for finding a place of healing after the war. Betsie's health continued to deteriorate, and she died on 16 December 1944 at the age of 59.<ref>{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|pages=121\u2013122}}</ref> Before she died, she told Corrie, \"There is no pit so deep that He [God] is not deeper still.\" Fifteen days later, Corrie was released. Afterwards, she was told that her release was because of a clerical error and that a week later, all the women in her age group were sent to the [[gas chamber]]s.<ref>Boom, Corrie ten. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p 240</ref>\n\nCorrie returned home in the midst of the \"[[Dutch famine of 1944\u201345|hunger winter]]\".

The refuge housed concentration-camp survivors and exclusively sheltered jobless Dutch who had collaborated with the Germans during the Occupation until 1950, when it accepted anyone in need of care. She returned to Germany in 1946 and met with and forgave two Germans who had been employed at Ravensbr\u00fcck, one of whom had been particularly cruel to Betsie.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Ten Boom went on to travel the world as a public speaker, appearing in more than 60 countries. She wrote many books during this period.\n\nOne of these books is entitled \u201cTramp for the Lord\u201d and was written in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Each chapter tells a short, different story about her world travels and sharing the Gospel message in Africa, Europe, the Americas, Asia, and even in difficult to reach and dangerous countries such as Russia (then-[[USSR]]), Cuba, and China. It features photographs of Corrie and her important messages of forgiveness, hope, Love, and Salvation through the saving grace of Jesus Christ.\n\nCorrie told the story of her family members and their [[World War II]] work in her bestselling book, ''[[The Hiding Place (biography)|The Hiding Place]]'' (1971), which was made into a 1975 [[World Wide Pictures]] film, ''[[The Hiding Place (film)|The Hiding Place]]'', starring [[Jeannette Clift]] as Corrie and [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] as Betsie. In 1977, the 85-year-old Corrie migrated to [[Placentia, California]]. In 1978, she suffered two [[stroke]]s, the first rendered her unable to speak, and the second resulted in paralysis. She died on her 91st birthday, 15 April 1983, after suffering a third stroke.\n\nA sequel film, ''[[Return to the Hiding Place|Return to the Hiding Place (War of Resistance)]]'', was released in 2011 in the [[United Kingdom]] and in 2013 it was released in the [[United States]].

watchmaker and later a writer who worked with her father, [[Casper ten Boom]], her sister [[Betsie ten Boom]] and other family members to help many [[Jews]] escape the [[Nazism|Nazis]] from [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] by hiding them in her home. She believed God would have wanted her to. They were caught, and she was arrested and sent to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]]. Her most famous book, ''[[The Hiding Place (biography)|The Hiding Place]]'', is a biography that recounts the story of her family's efforts and how she found hope in God while she was imprisoned at the concentration camp.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:CorrieTenBoom.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Corrie ten Boom c. 1921]]\nCorrie ten Boom was born on 15 April 1892 to a working-class family in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands, near [[Haarlem]]. Named after her mother, Cornelia, but known as Corrie all her life, she was the youngest child of [[Casper ten Boom]], a jeweler and watchmaker.<ref name=\"auto0\">{{Citation|  url = https://www.biography.com/people/corrie-ten-boom-21358155 | publisher = A&E Television Networks, LLC. | title =  Corrie ten Boom Biography}}</ref> Her father was fascinated by the craft of watchmaking and often became so engrossed in his work that he forgot to charge customers for his services.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=117}}</ref>\n\nShe trained to be a watchmaker herself, and in 1922, she became the first woman to be licensed as a watchmaker in The Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amightygirl.com/blog?p=23970|title=The Watchmaker's Secret Room: Corrie ten Boom, The Holocaust Rescuer Behind \"The Hiding Place\"|website=www.amightygirl.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref> Over the next decade, in addition to working in her father's shop, she established a youth club for teenage girls, which provided religious instruction and classes in the performing arts, sewing, and handicrafts.<ref name=\"auto0\"/> She and her family were [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Christians]] in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], and their faith inspired them to serve their society, which they did by offering shelter, food and money to those who were in need.<ref name=\"auto0\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n{{Righteous Among the Nations}}\nIn May 1940, the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Germans invaded the Netherlands]]. One of their restrictions was the banning of the youth club.<ref>ten Boom, Corrie. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}} In May 1942, a well-dressed woman came to the ten Booms' with a suitcase in hand and told them that she was a [[Judaism|Jew]], her husband had been arrested several months earlier, her son had gone into hiding and Occupation authorities had recently visited her so she was afraid to go back. She heard that the ten Booms had previously helped their Jewish neighbors, the Weils, and asked if they could help her too. Casper  readily agreed that she could stay with them although the police headquarters was only half a block away.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=118}}</ref> A devoted reader of the [[Old Testament]], he believed that the Jews were the \"[[Jews as the chosen people|chosen people]]\" and told the woman, \"In this household, God's people are always welcome\".<ref>Boom, Corrie ten. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p. 88</ref> The family then became very active in the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch underground]] hiding refugees and honouring the Jewish [[Shabbat|Sabbath]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A622388 | publisher = The British Broadcasting Company | title = DNA | contribution = H2G2}}.</ref> The family never sought to convert any of the Jews who stayed with them.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=119}}</ref>\n\nThus the ten Booms created \"The Hiding Place\" (Dutch: ''De Schuilplaats'' or ''de B\u00e9j\u00e9'', pronounced \"bayay\", an abbreviation of the street , [[Barteljorisstraat]]). Corrie and her sister Betsie opened their home to Jewish and Gentile refugees who were members of the [[Dutch resistance|resistance movement]], and as a result they were sought after by the [[Gestapo]] and its Dutch counterpart. The secret room was in Corrie's bedroom behind a false wall and would hold 6 people. A ventilation system was installed for the occupants. A buzzer could be heard in the house to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible during security sweeps through the neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corrie ten Boom Biography |url=https://www.biography.com/activist/corrie-ten-boom |website=Biography |accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref> They had plenty of room, but wartime shortages meant that food was scarce. Every non-Jewish Dutch person had received a ration card, the requirement for obtaining weekly food coupons. Through her charitable work, ten Boom knew many people in Haarlem and remembered a family with a disabled daughter, whose father was a civil servant who was now in charge of the local ration-card office.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> She went to his house one evening, and when he asked how many ration cards she needed, \"I opened my mouth to say, 'Five,'\" ten Boom wrote in ''The Hiding Place''. \"But the number that unexpectedly and astonishingly came out instead was: 'One hundred.'\"<ref>Boom, Corrie ten. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p. 92</ref> He gave them to her and she provided cards to every Jew she met.\n\nThe refugee work which ten Boom and her sister did at the Beje became known by the [[Dutch Resistance]], which sent an architect to the ten Boom home to build a secret room adjacent to the room for the Jews who were in hiding and an alert buzzer that could be used to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Arrest, detention and release===\nOn February 28th, 1944, a Dutch informant, Jan Vogel, told the Nazis about the ten Booms' work; at around 12:30 p.m. of that day, the Nazis arrested the entire ten Boom family. They were sent to [[Scheveningen]] Prison when Resistance materials and extra [[ration cards]] were found at the home.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=120}}</ref> Nollie and Willem were released immediately, along with Corrie's nephew Peter; Casper died ten days later. The group of six people hidden by the ten Booms, made up of both Jews and resistance workers, remained undiscovered. Corrie received a letter one day in prison, \"All the watches in your cabinet are safe\", meaning that the refugees had managed to escape and were safe.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Four days after the raid, resistance workers transferred them to other locations. Altogether, the [[Gestapo]] arrested some 30 people who were in the family home that day.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006914 | publisher = The Holocaust Memorial | title = Holocaust Memorial - Corrie ten Boom}}</ref>\n\nTen Boom was initially held in [[solitary confinement]]. After three months, she was taken to her first hearing. At her trial, ten Boom spoke about her work with the mentally disabled; the Nazi lieutenant scoffed, because the Nazis had been [[Aktion T4|killing mentally disabled individuals]] for years in accordance with their [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] policies.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=121}}</ref> Ten Boom defended her work by saying that in the eyes of [[God]], a mentally disabled person might be more valuable \"than a watchmaker. Or a lieutenant.\"<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nCorrie and Betsie were sent from Scheveningen to [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|Herzogenbusch]], a political [[concentration camp]] (also known as Kamp Vught) and finally to the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]], a women's labor camp in [[Germany]]. There, they held worship services after the hard days at work by using a [[Bible]] that they had managed to smuggle in.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> While they were imprisoned at Ravensbruck, Betsie and her sister began to discuss plans for finding a place of healing after the war. Betsie's health continued to deteriorate, and she died on 16 December 1944 at the age of 59.<ref>{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|pages=121\u2013122}}</ref> Before she died, she told Corrie, \"There is no pit so deep that He [God] is not deeper still.\" Fifteen days later, Corrie was released. Afterwards, she was told that her release was because of a clerical error and that a week later, all the women in her age group were sent to the [[gas chamber]]s.<ref>Boom, Corrie ten. ''The Hiding Place''. Peabody Massachusetts Hendrickson Publishers, 2009, p 240</ref>\n\nCorrie returned home in the midst of the \"[[Dutch famine of 1944\u201345|hunger winter]]\". She still opened her doors to the mentally disabled who were in hiding for fear of execution.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556529610|page=122}}</ref>\n\n==Life after the war==\nAfter the war, Corrie returned to the Netherlands to set up a [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] centre in [[Bloemendaal]]. The refuge housed concentration-camp survivors and exclusively sheltered jobless Dutch who had collaborated with the Germans during the Occupation until 1950, when it accepted anyone in need of care. She returned to Germany in 1946 and met with and forgave two Germans who had been employed at Ravensbr\u00fcck, one of whom had been particularly cruel to Betsie.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Ten Boom went on to travel the world as a public speaker, appearing in more than 60 countries. She wrote many books during this period.\n\nOne of these books is entitled \u201cTramp for the Lord\u201d and was written in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Each chapter tells a short, different story about her world travels and sharing the Gospel message in Africa, Europe, the Americas, Asia, and even in difficult to reach and dangerous countries such as Russia (then-[[USSR]]), Cuba, and China. It features photographs of Corrie and her important messages of forgiveness, hope, Love, and Salvation through the saving grace of Jesus Christ.\n\nCorrie told the story of her family members and their [[World War II]] work in her bestselling book, ''[[The Hiding Place (biography)|The Hiding Place]]'' (1971), which was made into a 1975 [[World Wide Pictures]] film, ''[[The Hiding Place (film)|The Hiding Place]]'', starring [[Jeannette Clift]] as Corrie and [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] as Betsie. In 1977, the 85-year-old Corrie migrated to [[Placentia, California]]. In 1978, she suffered two [[stroke]]s, the first rendered her unable to speak, and the second resulted in paralysis. She died on her 91st birthday, 15 April 1983, after suffering a third stroke.\n\nA sequel film, ''[[Return to the Hiding Place|Return to the Hiding Place (War of Resistance)]]'', was released in 2011 in the [[United Kingdom]] and in 2013 it was released in the [[United States]]. The film was based on Hans Poley's book, which painted a wider picture of the circle of which she was a part.\n\n==Honors==\n* Israel honored her by naming her [[Righteous Among the Nations]].\n* She was knighted by the Queen of the Netherlands in recognition of her work during the war. \n* The [[Ten Boom Museum]] in Haarlem is dedicated to her and her family in recognition of their work.\n* [[The King's College (New York)|The King's College]] in [[New York City]] named a new women's house in her honor.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation | title = Corrie ten Boom: Faith Triumphs | series = Heroes of The Faith | first = Halcyon C. | last = Backhouse | year = 1992 |location=Alton |publisher=Hunt & Thorpe|postscript=. |isbn=1-85608-007-2}}\n* {{Citation | title = Corrie ten Boom | series = Chronicles of Faith | first1 = Kjersti Hoff | last1 = Baez |first2=Al |last2=Bohl | year = 2008 |orig-year=1989 |location=Ulrichsville, Ohio |publisher=Barbour Pub |postscript=. |isbn=1-59789-967-4}}\n* {{Citation | title = Corrie ten Boom: Keeper of the Angels' Den | last1 = Benge | first1 = Janet | first2 = Geoffrey \u2018Geoff\u2019 | last2 = Benge | year = 1999 |location=Seattle, WA |publisher=YWAM Pub|postscript=.|isbn=1-57658-136-5}}\n* {{Citation | title = Paint the Prisons Bright: Corrie ten Boom | first = Jill | last = Briscoe | year = 1991|postscript=. |location=Dallas |publisher=Word Pub|isbn=0-8499-3308-0}}\n* {{Citation | title = Corrie, the Lives She's Touched | first = Joan Winmill | last = Brown |year=1979 |postscript=. |location=Old Tappan, N.J |publisher=F.H.

[[Military technology]] of the time included important innovations in [[machine gun]]s, [[grenade]]s, and artillery, along with essentially new weapons such as [[submarine]]s, [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]], [[warplane]]s and [[Tanks in World War I|tanks]].<ref>Tucker, Spencer C. (1998) ''The Great War: 1914-18''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press; p. 11</ref>\n\nOne could characterize the earlier years of the First World War as a clash of 20th-century [[technology]] with 19th-century [[military science]] creating ineffective battles with huge numbers of casualties on both sides. On land, only in the final year of the war did the major armies make effective steps in revolutionizing matters of command and control and tactics to adapt to the modern battlefield and start to harness the myriad new technologies to effective military purposes. Tactical reorganizations (such as shifting the focus of command from the 100+ man [[Company (military unit)|company]] to the 10+ man [[squad]]) went hand-in-hand with armored cars, the first submachine guns, and automatic rifles that a single individual soldier could carry hi\n\n== Trench warfare ==\n{{Main|Trench warfare}}\nThe new metallurgical and chemical industries created new firepower that briefly simplified defense before new approaches to [[Offensive (military)|attack]] evolved. The application of infantry [[rifle]]s, rifled [[artillery]] with [[hydraulic recoil mechanism]]s, zigzag trenches and [[machine gun]]s made it difficult or nearly impossible to cross defended ground. The [[hand grenade]], long used in crude form, developed rapidly as an aid in attacking trenches. Probably the most important was the introduction of [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive|high explosive shells]], which dramatically increased the [[lethality]] of artillery over the 19th-century equivalents.\n\nTrench warfare led to the development of the concrete [[Pillbox (military)|pill box]], a small, hardened blockhouse that could be used to deliver machine gun fire. Pillboxes could be placed across a battlefield with interlocking fields of fire.<ref>{{Citation \n |author1=March, F. A. |author2=Beamish, R. J. | year=1919\n | title=History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War\n | publisher=Leslie-Judge }}</ref>\n\nBecause attacking an entrenched enemy was so difficult, [[tunnel warfare]] became a major effort during the war. Once enemy positions were undermined, huge amounts of explosives would be planted and detonated as part preparation for an overland charge. Sensitive listening devices that could detect the sounds of digging were a crucial method of defense against these underground incursions. The British proved especially adept at these tactics, thanks to the skill of their tunnel-digging \"[[sapper]]s\" and the sophistication of their listening devices.\n\nDuring the First World War, the static movement of [[trench warfare]] and a need for protection from [[sniper]]s created a requirement for [[Loophole (firearm)|loopholes]] both for discharging firearms and for observation.<ref name=\"One\">[https://ww1revisited.com/2014/03/16/trench-loopholes-le-linge/ Trench Loopholes, Le Linge]</ref>  Often a steel plate was used with a \"key hole\", which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\n=== Clothing ===\n[[File:Temporary exhibition about WWI, gare de Paris-Est, 2014 (German helmets).jpg|thumb|German helmets went from leather to steel]]\nThe British and German armies had already changed from [[red coat (British army)]] (1902) or [[Prussian blue]] (1910) for field uniforms, to less conspicuous [[khaki]] or [[field gray]]. [[Adolphe Messimy]], [[Joseph Gallieni]] and other French leaders had proposed following suit, but the French army marched to war in their traditional red trousers, and only began receiving the new \"[[French Army in World War I#Uniforms|horizon blue]]\" ones in 1915.\n\nA type of raincoat for British officers, introduced long before the war, gained fame as the [[trench coat]].\n\nThe principal armies entered the war under cloth caps or leather helmets. They hastened to develop new [[steel helmet]]s, in designs that became icons of their respective countries.\n\n== Artillery ==\n{{Further|Artillery of World War I}}\n\n[[File:Cannon 75 mm Schneider with limber Memorial de Verdun.JPG|thumb|French [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897]] gave quick, accurate fire in a small, agile unit, but the Western Front often needed longer range]]\n[[Image:7.7 cm FK 16 CMHM Brantford 1.JPG|right|thumb|German [[7.7 cm FK 16]], developed during the war because an earlier model had insufficient range]]\n[[File:Austro-Hungarian artillery 1914.jpg|thumb|Austro-Hungarian artillery 1914]]\nIn the 19th century, Britain and France exploited the rapid technical developments in [[artillery]] to serve a [[War of Movement]]. Such weapons served well in the colonial wars of that century, and served Germany very well in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], but trench warfare was more like a [[siege]], and called for [[siege gun]]s. The German army had already anticipated that a European war might require heavier artillery, hence had a more appropriate mix of sizes. Foundries responded to the actual situation with more heavy products and fewer highly mobile pieces. Germany developed the [[Paris gun]]s of stupendous size and range. However, the necessarily stupendous [[muzzle velocity]] wore out a gun barrel after a few shots requiring a return to the factory for relining, so these weapons served more to frighten and anger urban people than to kill them or devastate their cities.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, artillery was often sited in the front line to fire over open sights at enemy infantry. During the war, the following improvements were made:\n\n* Indirect [[counter-battery fire]] was developed for the first time\n* [[Forward observer]]s were used to direct artillery positioned out of direct line of sight from the targets, and sophisticated communications and fire plans were developed\n*[[Artillery sound ranging]] and [[flash spotting]], for the location and eventual destruction of enemy batteries\n* Factors such as weather, air temperature, and barrel wear could for the first time be accurately measured and taken into account for [[indirect fire]]\n*The first \"box [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]]\" in history was fired in the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915; this was the use of a three- or four-sided curtain of shell-fire to prevent the movement of enemy infantry\n* The [[creeping barrage]] was perfected\n* The wire-cutting [[No. 106 fuze]] was developed, specifically designed to explode on contact with barbed wire, or the ground before the shell buried itself in mud, and equally effective as an [[anti-personnel]] weapon\n* The first [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were devised out of necessity\n\n[[Field artillery]] entered the war with the idea that each gun should be accompanied by hundreds of shells, and armories ought to have about a thousand on hand for resupply. This proved utterly inadequate when it became commonplace for a gun to sit in one place and fire a hundred shells or more per day for weeks or months on end. To meet the resulting [[Shell Crisis of 1915]], factories were hastily converted from other purposes to make more ammunition. Railways to the front were expanded or built, leaving the question of the [[last mile]]. [[Horses in World War I]] were the main answer, and their high death rate seriously weakened the Central Powers late in the war. In many places the newly invented [[trench railway]]s helped. The new motor [[truck]]s as yet lacked pneumatic tires, versatile suspension, and other improvements that in later decades would allow them to perform well.\n\nThe majority of casualties inflicted during the war were the result of artillery fire.\n\n== Poison gas ==\n{{Main|Poison gas in World War I}}\n[[Image:Australian infantry small box respirators Ypres 1917.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Australian infantry with gas masks, [[Ypres]], 1917.]]\n[[Chemical weapon]]s were first used systematically in this war. [[Chemical weapons in World War I]] included [[phosgene]], [[tear gas]], [[Adamsite|chlorarsine]]s and [[mustard gas]].\n\nAt the beginning of the war, Germany had the most advanced chemical industry in the world, accounting for more than 80% of the world's dye and chemical production. Although the use of poison gas had been banned by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], [[Germany]] turned to this industry for what it hoped would be a decisive weapon to break the deadlock of trench warfare. [[Chlorine]] gas was first used on the battlefield in April 1915 at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] in [[Belgium]]. The unknown gas appeared to be a simple [[smoke screen]], used to hide attacking soldiers, and Allied troops were ordered to the front trenches to repel the expected attack. The gas had a devastating effect, killing many defenders or when the wind direction changed and blew the gas back, many attackers. Because the gas killed the attackers, depending on the wind, a more reliable way had to be made to transmit the gas. It began being delivered in artillery shells.<ref>[[Chemical weapons in World War I]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}} Later, [[mustard gas]], [[phosgene]] and other gases were used. Britain and France soon followed suit with their own gas weapons. The first defenses against gas were makeshift, mainly rags soaked in water or [[urine]]. Later, relatively effective [[gas mask]]s were developed, and these greatly reduced the effectiveness of gas as a weapon. Although it sometimes resulted in brief tactical advantages and probably caused over 1,000,000 casualties, gas seemed to have had no significant effect on the course of the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nChemical weapons were easily attained, and cheap. Gas was especially effective against troops in trenches and bunkers that protected them from other weapons. Chemical weapons attacked an individual's respiratory system. The concept of choking easily caused fear in soldiers and the resulting terror affected them psychologically. Because there was such a great fear of chemical weapons it was not uncommon that a soldier would panic and misinterpret symptoms of the common cold as being affected by a poisonous gas.\n\n== Command and control ==\n{{Main|Command and control}}\n\nIn the early days of the war, generals tried to direct tactics from headquarters many miles from the front, with messages being carried back and forth by [[courier]]s on motorcycles. It was soon realized that more immediate methods of communication were needed.\n\n[[Radio]] sets of the period were too heavy to carry into battle, and [[field telephone]] lines laid were quickly broken. Runners, flashing lights, and mirrors were often used instead; dogs were also used, though they were only used occasionally as troops tended to adopt them as pets and men would volunteer to go as runners in the dog's place. There were also [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]] (called \"contact patrols\") that carried messages between headquarters and forward positions, sometimes dropping their messages without landing.\n\nThe new long-range artillery developed just before the war now had to fire at positions it could not see. Typical tactics were to pound the enemy front lines and then stop to let infantry move forward, hoping that the enemy line was broken, though it rarely was. The lifting and then the [[barrage (artillery)#Development of the creeping barrage|creeping barrage]] were developed to keep artillery fire landing directly in front of the infantry \"as it advanced.\" Communications being impossible, the danger was that the barrage would move too fast \u2014 losing the protection \u2014 or too slowly \u2014 holding up the advance.\n\nThere were also countermeasures to these artillery tactics: by aiming a counter barrage directly behind an enemy's creeping barrage, one could target the infantry that was following the creeping barrage. Microphones ([[Sound ranging]]) were used to triangulate the position of enemy guns and engage in [[counter-battery fire]]. Muzzle flashes of guns could also be spotted and used to target enemy artillery.\n\n== Railways ==\n{{wide image|Wrecked ammunition train3.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|German ammunition train wrecked by shell fire, c. 1918.}}\n[[File:Somme -- French Auto in mud LOC 15276629134.jpg|thumb|Motor trucks rarely performed well]]\nRailways dominated in this war as in no other. [[Schlieffen Plan|The German strategy]] was known beforehand by the Allies simply because of the vast marshaling yards on the Belgian border that had no other purpose than to deliver the mobilized German army to its start point. The German mobilization plan was little more than a vast detailed railway timetable. Men and material could get to the front at an unprecedented rate by rail, but trains were vulnerable at the front itself. Thus, armies could only advance at the pace that they could build or rebuild a railway, e.g. [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|the British advance across Sinai]]. Motorized transport was only extensively used in the last two years of World War I. After the rail head, troops moved the [[last mile]] on foot, and guns and supplies were drawn by horses and [[trench railways]]. Railways lacked the flexibility of motor transport and this lack of flexibility percolated through into the conduct of the war.\n\n== War of attrition ==\nThe countries involved in the war applied the full force of industrial mass-production to the manufacture of weapons and ammunition, especially artillery shells. [[Female roles in the World Wars|Women on the home-front]] played a crucial role in this by working in munitions factories. This complete mobilization of a nation's resources, or \"[[total war]]\" meant that not only the armies, but also the economies of the warring nations were in competition.\n\nFor a time, in 1914\u20131915, some hoped that the war could be won through an attrition of [[materiel]]\u2014that the enemy's supply of artillery shells could be exhausted in futile exchanges. But production was ramped up on both sides and hopes proved futile. In Britain the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] brought down the British government, and led to the building of [[HM Factory, Gretna]], a huge munitions factory on the English-Scottish border.\n\nThe [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] then focused on another resource: human lives. In the [[Battle of Verdun]] in particular, German Chief of Staff [[Erich Von Falkenhayn]] hoped to \"bleed France white\" through repeated attacks on this French city.\n\nIn the end, the war ended through a combination of attrition (of men and material), advances on the battlefield, arrival of American troops in large numbers, and a breakdown of morale and production on the [[Home front during World War I#Germany|German home-front]] due to an effective [[naval blockade]] of her seaports.\n\n== Air warfare ==\n{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}\n[[Image:Fokker Dr1 on the ground.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Fokker Dr.I|Fokker triplane]] belonging to [[Manfred von Richthofen]] (the \"Red Baron\")]]\n\n[[Aviation in World War I]] started with primitive aircraft, primitively used. Technological progress was swift, leading to ground attack, [[tactical bombing]], and highly publicized, deadly [[dogfight]]s among aircraft equipped with forward-firing, [[Synchronization gear|synchronized]] [[machine gun]]s [[Synchronization gear#The Fokker Stangensteuerung gear|from July 1915]] onwards. However, these uses made a lesser impact on the war than more mundane roles in intelligence, sea patrol and especially [[artillery spotting]]. [[Antiaircraft warfare]] also had its beginnings in this war.\n\nAs with most technologies, aircraft and their use underwent many improvements during World War I. As the initial war of movement on the Western Front settled into trench warfare, [[aerial reconnaissance]] over the front added to the difficulty of mounting surprise attacks against entrenched and concealed defenders.\n\nManned [[observation balloon]]s floating high above the trenches were used as stationary observation posts, reporting enemy troop positions and directing artillery fire. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, each equipped with [[parachute]]s: upon an enemy air attack on the flammable balloon, the crew would jump to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots in aircraft, and smaller versions would not be developed until the end of the war. (In the British case, there arose concerns that they might undermine [[morale]], effectively encouraging [[cowardice]].) Recognized for their value as observer platforms, observation balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by large concentrations of anti-aircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft.\n\nWhile early air spotters were unarmed, they soon began firing at each other with handheld weapons. An arms race commenced, quickly leading to increasingly agile planes equipped with machine guns. A key innovation was the [[synchronization gear|interrupter gear]], a Dutch invention<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1369.htm|title=No. 1369: Fokker's Interrupter Mechanism|website=www.uh.edu}}</ref> that allowed a machine gun to be mounted behind the propeller so the pilot could fire directly ahead, along the plane's flight path.\n\nAs the stalemate developed on the ground, with both sides unable to advance even a few miles without a major battle and thousands of casualties, planes became greatly valued for their role gathering intelligence on enemy positions. They also bombed enemy supplies behind the trench lines, in the manner of later [[attack aircraft]]. Large planes with a pilot and an observer were used to reconnoiter enemy positions and bomb their supply bases. These large and slow planes made easy targets for enemy fighter planes, who in turn were met by [[fighter escort]]s and spectacular aerial dogfights.\n\n[[German strategic bombing during World War I]] struck Warsaw, Paris, London and other cities. Germany led the world in [[Zeppelin]]s, and used these airships to make occasional bombing raids on military targets, London and other British cities, without great effect. Later in the war, Germany introduced long range [[strategic bomber]]s. Damage was again minor but they forced the British air forces to maintain squadrons of fighters in England to defend against air attack, depriving the British Expeditionary Force of planes, equipment, and personnel badly needed on the Western front.\n\nThe Allies made much smaller efforts in bombing the Central Powers.\n\n== Mobility ==\n[[File:Belgian corps in Russia.jpg|thumb|[[Minerva (automobile)|Mors-Minerva]] armored car of the [[Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia]], {{circa}} January 1916]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]] armed with machine guns were organized into combat units, along with [[Bicycle infantry|cyclist infantry]] and [[Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade|machine guns mounted on motor cycle sidecars]]. Though not able to assault entrenched positions, they provided mobile fire support to infantry, and performed scouting, reconnaissance, and other roles similar to cavalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mmg.htm|title=Motor Machine-gun units|date=2008-06-22|website=Via Wayback Machine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622183109/http://www.1914-1918.net/mmg.htm|archive-date=2008-06-22|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> After trench warfare took hold of major battle-lines, opportunities for such vehicles greatly diminished, though they continued to see use in the more open campaigns in Russia and the Middle East.\n\nBetween late 1914 and early 1918, the Western Front hardly moved. When the [[Russian Empire]] surrendered after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, Germany was able to move many troops to the Western Front. With new [[stormtrooper]] infantry trained in [[infiltration tactics]] to exploit enemy weak points and penetrate into rear areas, they launched a [[Spring Offensive|series of offensives in the spring of 1918]]. In the largest of these, [[Operation Michael]], General [[Oskar von Hutier]] pushed forward 60 kilometers, gaining in a couple weeks what France and Britain had spent years to achieve. Although initially successful tactically, these offensives stalled after outrunning their horse-drawn supply, artillery, and reserves, leaving German forces weakened and exhausted.\n\nIn the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] of August 1918, the Triple Entente forces began a counterattack that would be called the \"[[Hundred Days Offensive]].\" The Australian and Canadian divisions that spearheaded the attack managed to advance 13 kilometers on the first day alone. These battles marked the end of trench warfare on the Western Front and a return to mobile warfare. \n\nThe [[mobile personnel shield]] was a less successful attempt at restoring mobility.<ref name=\"Gougaud, p.110\">Gougaud, p.110</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the defeated Germans would seek to combine their infantry-based mobile warfare of 1918 with vehicles, eventually leading to ''[[blitzkrieg]]'', or \"lightning warfare.\"\n\n=== Tanks ===\n{{Main|Tanks in World War I}}\n[[File:Lot-7868-8 (28364510440).jpg|thumb|[[Renault FT]]s in U.S. service, Juvigny, France]]\nAlthough the concept of the [[tank]] had been suggested as early as the 1890s, authorities showed little more than a passing interest in them until the trench stalemate of World War I caused reconsideration. In early 1915, the British [[Royal Navy]] and French industrialists both started dedicated development of tanks.\n\nBasic tank design combined several existing technologies. It included [[vehicle armor|armor plating]] thick enough to be proof against all standard infantry arms, [[caterpillar track]] (invented in 1770 and perfected in the early 1900s) for mobility over the shell-torn battlefield, the four-stroke gasoline powered [[internal combustion engine]] (refined in the 1870s), and heavy firepower, provided by the same machine guns which had recently become so dominant in warfare, or even light artillery guns.\n\nIn Britain, a landships committee was formed, teamed with the inventions committee, and assigned the task working out a practical tank design. The \"landship\" focus led to large tanks with a [[rhomboidal]] shape to allow crossing of an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} trench, starting with the [[Mark I tank]], with the \"male\" versions mounting [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|small naval guns]].\n\nIn France, several competing arms industry organizations each proposed radically different designs. Smaller tanks became favored, leading to the [[Renault FT tank]], in part by being able to leverage the engines and manufacturing techniques of commercial tractors and automobiles.\n\nThough their initial appearance on the battlefield in 1917 terrified the Germans, these engagements provided more opportunities for development than battle successes. Early tanks were unreliable, breaking down often. Germans learned they were vulnerable to direct hits from field artillery and heavy mortars, their trenches were widened and other obstacles devised to halt them, and special [[anti-tank rifle]]s were rapidly developed. Also, both Britain and France found new tactics and training were required to make effective use of their tanks, such as larger coordinated formations of tanks and close support with infantry. Once tanks could be organized in the hundreds, as in the opening assault of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, they began to have notable impact.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the war, new tank designs often revealed flaws in battle, to be addressed in later designs, but reliability remained the primary weakness of tanks. In the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]], a major [[Triple Entente|Entente]] counteroffensive near the end of the war, British forces went to field with 532 tanks; after several days, only a few were still in commission, with those that suffered mechanical difficulties outnumbering those disabled by enemy fire.\n\nGermany utilized many captured enemy tanks, and made a few of their own late in the war. \n\nIn the last year of the war, despite rapidly increasing production (especially by France) and improving designs, tank technology struggled to make more than a modest impact on the war's overall progress. [[Plan 1919]] proposed the future use of massive tank formations in great offensives combined with [[ground attack aircraft]].\n\nEven without achieving the decisive results hoped for during World War I, tank technology and [[mechanized warfare]] had been launched and would grow increasingly sophisticated in the years following the war. By [[World War II]], the tank would evolve into a fearsome weapon critical to restoring mobility to land warfare.<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=421\u2013426}}</ref>\n\n== At sea ==\n{{Main|Naval warfare of World War I}}\n \nThe years leading up to the war saw the use of improved metallurgical and mechanical techniques to produce larger ships with larger guns and, in reaction, more armor. The launching of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)]] revolutionized [[battleship]] construction, leaving many ships obsolete before they were completed. German ambitions brought an [[Anglo-German naval arms race]] in which the [[Imperial German Navy]] was built up from a small force to the world's most modern and second most powerful. However, even this high-technology navy entered the war with a mix of newer ships and obsolete older ones.\n\nThe advantage was in long-range gunnery, and naval battles took place at far greater distances than before. The 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] demonstrated the excellence of German ships and crews, but also showed that the [[High Seas Fleet]] was not big enough to challenge openly the British [[blockade of Germany]]. It was the only full-scale battle between fleets in the war.\n\nHaving the largest surface fleet, the United Kingdom sought to press its advantage. British ships blockaded German ports, hunted down German and Austro-Hungarian ships wherever they might be on the high seas, and supported actions against [[German colonies]]. The German surface fleet was largely kept in the North Sea. This situation pushed Germany, in particular, to direct its resources to a new form of naval power: submarines.\n\n[[Naval mine]]s were deployed in hundreds of thousands, or far greater numbers than in previous wars. Submarines proved surprisingly effective for this purpose. [[Influence mine]]s were a new development but moored contact mines were the most numerous. They resembled those of the late 19th century, improved so they less often exploded while being laid. The Allies produced enough mines to build the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] to help bottle the Germans into the [[North Sea]], but it was too late to make much difference.\n\n=== Submarines ===\n[[File:Submarine U-14 (LOC) (6358166395).jpg|thumb|German U-boat ''[[SM U-14 (Germany)|U-14]]'']]\nWorld War I was the first conflict in which [[submarine]]s were a serious weapon of war. In the years shortly before the war, the relatively sophisticated propulsion system of diesel power while surfaced and battery power while submerged was introduced. Their armament had similarly improved, but few were in service. Germany had already increased production, and quickly built up its [[U-boat]] fleet, both for action against British warships and for a counterblockade of the British Isles. 360 were eventually built. The resulting [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)]] destroyed more enemy warships than the High Seas Fleet had, and hampered British war supplies as the more expensive surface fleet had not.\n\nThe United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed its population and supply its war industry, and the German Navy hoped to blockade and starve Britain using [[U-boats]] to attack merchant ships. Lieutenant [[Otto Weddigen]] remarked of the [[Action of 22 September 1914|second submarine attack of the Great War]]:\n\n:{{cquote|How much they feared our submarines and how wide was the agitation caused by good little [[SM U-9|U-9]] is shown by the English reports that a whole flotilla of German submarines had attacked the cruisers and that this flotilla had approached under cover of the flag of Holland. These reports were absolutely untrue. U-9 was the only submarine on deck, and she flew the flag she still flies \u2013 the German naval ensign.}}\n\nSubmarines soon came under persecution by [[submarine chaser]]s and other small warships using hastily devised [[anti-submarine weapons]]. They could not impose an effective blockade while acting under the restrictions of the [[prize rules]] and international [[law of the sea]]. They resorted to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], which cost Germany public sympathy in neutral countries and was a factor contributing to the [[American entry into World War I]].\n\nThis struggle between German submarines and British counter measures became known as the \"[[First Battle of the Atlantic]].\" As German submarines became more numerous and effective, the British sought ways to protect their merchant ships. \"[[Q-ship]]s,\" attack vessels disguised as civilian ships, were one early strategy.\n\nConsolidating merchant ships into [[convoys]] protected by one or more armed navy vessels was adopted later in the war. There was initially a great deal of debate about this approach, out of fear that it would provide German U-boats with a wealth of convenient targets. Thanks to the development of active and passive [[sonar]] devices,<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|pp=129, 130, 140}}</ref> coupled with increasingly deadly [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, the convoy system reduced British losses to U-boats to a small fraction of their former level.\n\n[[Holland 602 type submarine]]<nowiki/>s and other Allied types were fewer, being unnecessary for the blockade of Germany.\n\n== Small arms ==\n[[File:French troopers under General Gouraud, with their machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the Marne... - NARA - 533679.tif|thumb|French machine gunners defend a ruined cathedral, late in the war]]\n[[List of infantry weapons of World War I|Infantry weapons]] for major powers were mainly [[bolt action]] rifles, capable of firing ten or more rounds per minute. German soldiers carried [[Gewehr 98]] rifle in 8mm mauser, while the British carried the [[Short Magazine Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifle.<ref>Bull, Stephen  (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare''; (1): 1914-16.

Oxford: Osprey Publishing; pp. 11-12</ref> Their use in defense, combined with barbed [[wire obstacle]]s, converted the expected [[Maneuver warfare|mobile battlefield]] to a static one. The machine gun was useful in [[Trench warfare|stationary battle]] but could not move easily through a battlefield, and therefore forced soldiers to face enemy machine guns without machine guns of their own.\n\nBefore the war, the French Army studied the question of a [[light machine gun]] but had made none for use. At the start of hostilities, France quickly turned an existing prototype (the \"CS\" for Chauchat and Sutter) into the lightweight [[Chauchat|Chauchat M1915]] automatic rifle with a high [[rate of fire]]. Besides its use by the French, the first American units to arrive in France used it in 1917 and 1918. Hastily mass-manufactured under desperate wartime pressures, the weapon developed a reputation for unreliability.<ref name=TrenchWarfare>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXCn3WrINjwC&pg=PA31 |pages=31\u201332 |title=World War I Trench Warfare (1916\u20131918) |last1=Bull |first1=Stephen |last2=Hook |first2=Adam |publisher=Osprey |year=2002 |isbn=1-84176-198-2 |series=Elite |volume=84 |edition=3}}</ref>\n\nSeeing the potential of such a weapon, the British Army adopted the American-designed [[Lewis gun]] chambered in .303 British.

When the war started, grenades were few and poor. Hand grenades were used and improved throughout the war. [[Contact fuze]]s became less common, replaced by time fuzes.\n\nThe British entered the war with the long-handled impact detonating \"[[No 1 grenade|Grenade, Hand No 1]]\".<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\">Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 27</ref> This was replaced by the [[No. 15 ball grenade|No. 15 \"Ball Grenade\"]] to partially overcome some of its inadequacies. An [[Improvised explosive device|improvised]] hand grenade was developed in Australia for use by ANZAC troops called the [[Jam Tin Grenade|Double Cylinder \"jam tin\"]] which consisted of a tin filled with [[dynamite]] or [[guncotton]], packed round with scrap metal or stones. To ignite, at the top of the tin there was a Bickford [[safety fuse]] connecting the detonator, which was lit by either the user, or a second person.<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\"/> The \"[[Mills bomb]]\" (Grenade, Hand No. 5) was introduced in 1915 and would serve in its basic form in the British Army until the 1970s. Its improved fusing system relied on the soldier removing a pin and while holding down a lever on the side of the grenade. When the grenade was thrown the safety lever would automatically release, igniting the grenades internal fuse which would burn down until the grenade detonated. The French would use the [[F1 grenade (France)|F1]] defensive grenade.\n\nThe major grenades used in the beginning by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] were the impact-detonating \"[[Discus throw|discus]]\" or \"oyster shell\" bomb and the Mod 1913 black powder ''[[Kugelhandgranate]]'' with a friction-ignited time fuse.<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\"/> In 1915 Germany developed the much more effective ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'', nicknamed \"potato masher\" for its shape, whose variants remained in use for decades; it used a timed fuse system similar to the Mills bomb. \n\nHand grenades were not the only attempt at projectile explosives for infantry. A [[rifle grenade]] was brought into the trenches to attack the enemy from a greater distance. The [[Hales rifle grenade]] got little attention from the British Army before the war began but, during the war, Germany showed great interest in this weapon. The resulting casualties for the Allies caused Britain to search for a new defense.<ref>Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 29</ref>\n\nThe [[Stokes mortar]], a lightweight and very portable [[trench mortar]] with short tube and capable of [[indirect fire]], was rapidly developed and widely imitated.<ref>Duffy, Michael (2000-07) \"Safe Surf\". http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/mortars.htm</ref> Mechanical bomb throwers of lesser range were used in a similar fashion to fire upon the enemy from a safe distance within the trench.\n\nThe [[Sauterelle]] was a grenade launching [[Crossbow]] used before the Stokes mortar by French and British troops.\n\n==Flame throwers==\n[[File:PSM V87 D315 Flame thrower used by the germans to repulse attacks in ww 1.png|thumb|Defensive use]]\nThe Imperial German Army deployed [[flame thrower]]s (''Flammenwerfer'') on the Western Front attempting to flush out French or British soldiers from their trenches. Introduced in 1915, it was used with greatest effect during the [[Hooge, Belgium|Hooge]] battle of the Western Front on 30 July 1915. The German Army had two main types of flame throwers during the Great War: a small single person version called the [[Kleinflammenwerfer]] and a larger crew served configuration called the [[Grossflammenwerfer]]. In the latter, one soldier carried the fuel tank while another aimed the nozzle. Both the large and smaller versions of the flame-thrower were of limited use because their short range left the operator(s) exposed to small arms fire.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of German weapons of World War I]]\n* [[Romanian military equipment of World War I]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Johnson, Jeffrey: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/science_and_technology Science and Technology] , in: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/home.html 1914-1918-online.

[[Military technology]] of the time included important innovations in [[machine gun]]s, [[grenade]]s, and artillery, along with essentially new weapons such as [[submarine]]s, [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]], [[warplane]]s and [[Tanks in World War I|tanks]].<ref>Tucker, Spencer C. (1998) ''The Great War: 1914-18''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press; p. 11</ref>\n\nOne could characterize the earlier years of the First World War as a clash of 20th-century [[technology]] with 19th-century [[military science]] creating ineffective battles with huge numbers of casualties on both sides. On land, only in the final year of the war did the major armies make effective steps in revolutionizing matters of command and control and tactics to adapt to the modern battlefield and start to harness the myriad new technologies to effective military purposes. Tactical reorganizations (such as shifting the focus of command from the 100+ man [[Company (military unit)|company]] to the 10+ man [[squad]]) went hand-in-hand with armored cars, the first submachine guns, and automatic rifles that a single individual soldier could carry and use.\n\n== Trench warfare ==\n{{Main|Trench warfare}}\nThe new metallurgical and chemical industries created new firepower that briefly simplified defense before new approaches to [[Offensive (military)|attack]] evolved. The application of infantry [[rifle]]s, rifled [[artillery]] with [[hydraulic recoil mechanism]]s, zigzag trenches and [[machine gun]]s made it difficult or nearly impossible to cross defended ground. The [[hand grenade]], long used in crude form, developed rapidly as an aid in attacking trenches. Probably the most important was the introduction of [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive|high explosive shells]], which dramatically increased the [[lethality]] of artillery over the 19th-century equivalents.\n\nTrench warfare led to the development of the concrete [[Pillbox (military)|pill box]], a small, hardened blockhouse that could be used to deliver machine gun fire. Pillboxes could be placed across a battlefield with interlocking fields of fire.<ref>{{Citation \n |author1=March, F. A. |author2=Beamish, R. J. | year=1919\n | title=History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War\n | publisher=Leslie-Judge }}</ref>\n\nBecause attacking an entrenched enemy was so difficult, [[tunnel warfare]] became a major effort during the war. Once enemy positions were undermined, huge amounts of explosives would be planted and detonated as part preparation for an overland charge. Sensitive listening devices that could detect the sounds of digging were a crucial method of defense against these underground incursions. The British proved especially adept at these tactics, thanks to the skill of their tunnel-digging \"[[sapper]]s\" and the sophistication of their listening devices.\n\nDuring the First World War, the static movement of [[trench warfare]] and a need for protection from [[sniper]]s created a requirement for [[Loophole (firearm)|loopholes]] both for discharging firearms and for observation.<ref name=\"One\">[https://ww1revisited.com/2014/03/16/trench-loopholes-le-linge/ Trench Loopholes, Le Linge]</ref>  Often a steel plate was used with a \"key hole\", which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\n=== Clothing ===\n[[File:Temporary exhibition about WWI, gare de Paris-Est, 2014 (German helmets).jpg|thumb|German helmets went from leather to steel]]\nThe British and German armies had already changed from [[red coat (British army)]] (1902) or [[Prussian blue]] (1910) for field uniforms, to less conspicuous [[khaki]] or [[field gray]]. [[Adolphe Messimy]], [[Joseph Gallieni]] and other French leaders had proposed following suit, but the French army marched to war in their traditional red trousers, and only began receiving the new \"[[French Army in World War I#Uniforms|horizon blue]]\" ones in 1915.\n\nA type of raincoat for British officers, introduced long before the war, gained fame as the [[trench coat]].\n\nThe principal armies entered the war under cloth caps or leather helmets. They hastened to develop new [[steel helmet]]s, in designs that became icons of their respective countries.\n\n== Artillery ==\n{{Further|Artillery of World War I}}\n\n[[File:Cannon 75 mm Schneider with limber Memorial de Verdun.JPG|thumb|French [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897]] gave quick, accurate fire in a small, agile unit, but the Western Front often needed longer range]]\n[[Image:7.7 cm FK 16 CMHM Brantford 1.JPG|right|thumb|German [[7.7 cm FK 16]], developed during the war because an earlier model had insufficient range]]\n[[File:Austro-Hungarian artillery 1914.jpg|thumb|Austro-Hungarian artillery 1914]]\nIn the 19th century, Britain and France exploited the rapid technical developments in [[artillery]] to serve a [[War of Movement]]. Such weapons served well in the colonial wars of that century, and served Germany very well in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], but trench warfare was more like a [[siege]], and called for [[siege gun]]s. The German army had already anticipated that a European war might require heavier artillery, hence had a more appropriate mix of sizes. Foundries responded to the actual situation with more heavy products and fewer highly mobile pieces. Germany developed the [[Paris gun]]s of stupendous size and range. However, the necessarily stupendous [[muzzle velocity]] wore out a gun barrel after a few shots requiring a return to the factory for relining, so these weapons served more to frighten and anger urban people than to kill them or devastate their cities.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, artillery was often sited in the front line to fire over open sights at enemy infantry. During the war, the following improvements were made:\n\n* Indirect [[counter-battery fire]] was developed for the first time\n* [[Forward observer]]s were used to direct artillery positioned out of direct line of sight from the targets, and sophisticated communications and fire plans were developed\n*[[Artillery sound ranging]] and [[flash spotting]], for the location and eventual destruction of enemy batteries\n* Factors such as weather, air temperature, and barrel wear could for the first time be accurately measured and taken into account for [[indirect fire]]\n*The first \"box [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]]\" in history was fired in the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915; this was the use of a three- or four-sided curtain of shell-fire to prevent the movement of enemy infantry\n* The [[creeping barrage]] was perfected\n* The wire-cutting [[No. 106 fuze]] was developed, specifically designed to explode on contact with barbed wire, or the ground before the shell buried itself in mud, and equally effective as an [[anti-personnel]] weapon\n* The first [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were devised out of necessity\n\n[[Field artillery]] entered the war with the idea that each gun should be accompanied by hundreds of shells, and armories ought to have about a thousand on hand for resupply. This proved utterly inadequate when it became commonplace for a gun to sit in one place and fire a hundred shells or more per day for weeks or months on end. To meet the resulting [[Shell Crisis of 1915]], factories were hastily converted from other purposes to make more ammunition. Railways to the front were expanded or built, leaving the question of the [[last mile]]. [[Horses in World War I]] were the main answer, and their high death rate seriously weakened the Central Powers late in the war. In many places the newly invented [[trench railway]]s helped. The new motor [[truck]]s as yet lacked pneumatic tires, versatile suspension, and other improvements that in later decades would allow them to perform well.\n\nThe majority of casualties inflicted during the war were the result of artillery fire.\n\n== Poison gas ==\n{{Main|Poison gas in World War I}}\n[[Image:Australian infantry small box respirators Ypres 1917.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Australian infantry with gas masks, [[Ypres]], 1917.]]\n[[Chemical weapon]]s were first used systematically in this war. [[Chemical weapons in World War I]] included [[phosgene]], [[tear gas]], [[Adamsite|chlorarsine]]s and [[mustard gas]].\n\nAt the beginning of the war, Germany had the most advanced chemical industry in the world, accounting for more than 80% of the world's dye and chemical production. Although the use of poison gas had been banned by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], [[Germany]] turned to this industry for what it hoped would be a decisive weapon to break the deadlock of trench warfare. [[Chlorine]] gas was first used on the battlefield in April 1915 at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] in [[Belgium]]. The unknown gas appeared to be a simple [[smoke screen]], used to hide attacking soldiers, and Allied troops were ordered to the front trenches to repel the expected attack. The gas had a devastating effect, killing many defenders or when the wind direction changed and blew the gas back, many attackers. Because the gas killed the attackers, depending on the wind, a more reliable way had to be made to transmit the gas. It began being delivered in artillery shells.<ref>[[Chemical weapons in World War I]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}} Later, [[mustard gas]], [[phosgene]] and other gases were used. Britain and France soon followed suit with their own gas weapons. The first defenses against gas were makeshift, mainly rags soaked in water or [[urine]]. Later, relatively effective [[gas mask]]s were developed, and these greatly reduced the effectiveness of gas as a weapon. Although it sometimes resulted in brief tactical advantages and probably caused over 1,000,000 casualties, gas seemed to have had no significant effect on the course of the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nChemical weapons were easily attained, and cheap. Gas was especially effective against troops in trenches and bunkers that protected them from other weapons. Chemical weapons attacked an individual's respiratory system. The concept of choking easily caused fear in soldiers and the resulting terror affected them psychologically. Because there was such a great fear of chemical weapons it was not uncommon that a soldier would panic and misinterpret symptoms of the common cold as being affected by a poisonous gas.\n\n== Command and control ==\n{{Main|Command and control}}\n\nIn the early days of the war, generals tried to direct tactics from headquarters many miles from the front, with messages being carried back and forth by [[courier]]s on motorcycles. It was soon realized that more immediate methods of communication were needed.\n\n[[Radio]] sets of the period were too heavy to carry into battle, and [[field telephone]] lines laid were quickly broken. Runners, flashing lights, and mirrors were often used instead; dogs were also used, though they were only used occasionally as troops tended to adopt them as pets and men would volunteer to go as runners in the dog's place. There were also [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]] (called \"contact patrols\") that carried messages between headquarters and forward positions, sometimes dropping their messages without landing.\n\nThe new long-range artillery developed just before the war now had to fire at positions it could not see. Typical tactics were to pound the enemy front lines and then stop to let infantry move forward, hoping that the enemy line was broken, though it rarely was. The lifting and then the [[barrage (artillery)#Development of the creeping barrage|creeping barrage]] were developed to keep artillery fire landing directly in front of the infantry \"as it advanced.\" Communications being impossible, the danger was that the barrage would move too fast \u2014 losing the protection \u2014 or too slowly \u2014 holding up the advance.\n\nThere were also countermeasures to these artillery tactics: by aiming a counter barrage directly behind an enemy's creeping barrage, one could target the infantry that was following the creeping barrage. Microphones ([[Sound ranging]]) were used to triangulate the position of enemy guns and engage in [[counter-battery fire]]. Muzzle flashes of guns could also be spotted and used to target enemy artillery.\n\n== Railways ==\n{{wide image|Wrecked ammunition train3.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|German ammunition train wrecked by shell fire, c. 1918.}}\n[[File:Somme -- French Auto in mud LOC 15276629134.jpg|thumb|Motor trucks rarely performed well]]\nRailways dominated in this war as in no other. [[Schlieffen Plan|The German strategy]] was known beforehand by the Allies simply because of the vast marshaling yards on the Belgian border that had no other purpose than to deliver the mobilized German army to its start point. The German mobilization plan was little more than a vast detailed railway timetable. Men and material could get to the front at an unprecedented rate by rail, but trains were vulnerable at the front itself. Thus, armies could only advance at the pace that they could build or rebuild a railway, e.g. [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|the British advance across Sinai]]. Motorized transport was only extensively used in the last two years of World War I. After the rail head, troops moved the [[last mile]] on foot, and guns and supplies were drawn by horses and [[trench railways]]. Railways lacked the flexibility of motor transport and this lack of flexibility percolated through into the conduct of the war.\n\n== War of attrition ==\nThe countries involved in the war applied the full force of industrial mass-production to the manufacture of weapons and ammunition, especially artillery shells. [[Female roles in the World Wars|Women on the home-front]] played a crucial role in this by working in munitions factories. This complete mobilization of a nation's resources, or \"[[total war]]\" meant that not only the armies, but also the economies of the warring nations were in competition.\n\nFor a time, in 1914\u20131915, some hoped that the war could be won through an attrition of [[materiel]]\u2014that the enemy's supply of artillery shells could be exhausted in futile exchanges. But production was ramped up on both sides and hopes proved futile. In Britain the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] brought down the British government, and led to the building of [[HM Factory, Gretna]], a huge munitions factory on the English-Scottish border.\n\nThe [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] then focused on another resource: human lives. In the [[Battle of Verdun]] in particular, German Chief of Staff [[Erich Von Falkenhayn]] hoped to \"bleed France white\" through repeated attacks on this French city.\n\nIn the end, the war ended through a combination of attrition (of men and material), advances on the battlefield, arrival of American troops in large numbers, and a breakdown of morale and production on the [[Home front during World War I#Germany|German home-front]] due to an effective [[naval blockade]] of her seaports.\n\n== Air warfare ==\n{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}\n[[Image:Fokker Dr1 on the ground.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Fokker Dr.I|Fokker triplane]] belonging to [[Manfred von Richthofen]] (the \"Red Baron\")]]\n\n[[Aviation in World War I]] started with primitive aircraft, primitively used. Technological progress was swift, leading to ground attack, [[tactical bombing]], and highly publicized, deadly [[dogfight]]s among aircraft equipped with forward-firing, [[Synchronization gear|synchronized]] [[machine gun]]s [[Synchronization gear#The Fokker Stangensteuerung gear|from July 1915]] onwards. However, these uses made a lesser impact on the war than more mundane roles in intelligence, sea patrol and especially [[artillery spotting]]. [[Antiaircraft warfare]] also had its beginnings in this war.\n\nAs with most technologies, aircraft and their use underwent many improvements during World War I. As the initial war of movement on the Western Front settled into trench warfare, [[aerial reconnaissance]] over the front added to the difficulty of mounting surprise attacks against entrenched and concealed defenders.\n\nManned [[observation balloon]]s floating high above the trenches were used as stationary observation posts, reporting enemy troop positions and directing artillery fire. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, each equipped with [[parachute]]s: upon an enemy air attack on the flammable balloon, the crew would jump to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots in aircraft, and smaller versions would not be developed until the end of the war. (In the British case, there arose concerns that they might undermine [[morale]], effectively encouraging [[cowardice]].) Recognized for their value as observer platforms, observation balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by large concentrations of anti-aircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft.\n\nWhile early air spotters were unarmed, they soon began firing at each other with handheld weapons. An arms race commenced, quickly leading to increasingly agile planes equipped with machine guns. A key innovation was the [[synchronization gear|interrupter gear]], a Dutch invention<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1369.htm|title=No. 1369: Fokker's Interrupter Mechanism|website=www.uh.edu}}</ref> that allowed a machine gun to be mounted behind the propeller so the pilot could fire directly ahead, along the plane's flight path.\n\nAs the stalemate developed on the ground, with both sides unable to advance even a few miles without a major battle and thousands of casualties, planes became greatly valued for their role gathering intelligence on enemy positions. They also bombed enemy supplies behind the trench lines, in the manner of later [[attack aircraft]]. Large planes with a pilot and an observer were used to reconnoiter enemy positions and bomb their supply bases. These large and slow planes made easy targets for enemy fighter planes, who in turn were met by [[fighter escort]]s and spectacular aerial dogfights.\n\n[[German strategic bombing during World War I]] struck Warsaw, Paris, London and other cities. Germany led the world in [[Zeppelin]]s, and used these airships to make occasional bombing raids on military targets, London and other British cities, without great effect. Later in the war, Germany introduced long range [[strategic bomber]]s. Damage was again minor but they forced the British air forces to maintain squadrons of fighters in England to defend against air attack, depriving the British Expeditionary Force of planes, equipment, and personnel badly needed on the Western front.\n\nThe Allies made much smaller efforts in bombing the Central Powers.\n\n== Mobility ==\n[[File:Belgian corps in Russia.jpg|thumb|[[Minerva (automobile)|Mors-Minerva]] armored car of the [[Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia]], {{circa}} January 1916]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]] armed with machine guns were organized into combat units, along with [[Bicycle infantry|cyclist infantry]] and [[Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade|machine guns mounted on motor cycle sidecars]]. Though not able to assault entrenched positions, they provided mobile fire support to infantry, and performed scouting, reconnaissance, and other roles similar to cavalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mmg.htm|title=Motor Machine-gun units|date=2008-06-22|website=Via Wayback Machine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622183109/http://www.1914-1918.net/mmg.htm|archive-date=2008-06-22|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> After trench warfare took hold of major battle-lines, opportunities for such vehicles greatly diminished, though they continued to see use in the more open campaigns in Russia and the Middle East.\n\nBetween late 1914 and early 1918, the Western Front hardly moved. When the [[Russian Empire]] surrendered after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, Germany was able to move many troops to the Western Front. With new [[stormtrooper]] infantry trained in [[infiltration tactics]] to exploit enemy weak points and penetrate into rear areas, they launched a [[Spring Offensive|series of offensives in the spring of 1918]]. In the largest of these, [[Operation Michael]], General [[Oskar von Hutier]] pushed forward 60 kilometers, gaining in a couple weeks what France and Britain had spent years to achieve. Although initially successful tactically, these offensives stalled after outrunning their horse-drawn supply, artillery, and reserves, leaving German forces weakened and exhausted.\n\nIn the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] of August 1918, the Triple Entente forces began a counterattack that would be called the \"[[Hundred Days Offensive]].\" The Australian and Canadian divisions that spearheaded the attack managed to advance 13 kilometers on the first day alone. These battles marked the end of trench warfare on the Western Front and a return to mobile warfare. \n\nThe [[mobile personnel shield]] was a less successful attempt at restoring mobility.<ref name=\"Gougaud, p.110\">Gougaud, p.110</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the defeated Germans would seek to combine their infantry-based mobile warfare of 1918 with vehicles, eventually leading to ''[[blitzkrieg]]'', or \"lightning warfare.\"\n\n=== Tanks ===\n{{Main|Tanks in World War I}}\n[[File:Lot-7868-8 (28364510440).jpg|thumb|[[Renault FT]]s in U.S. service, Juvigny, France]]\nAlthough the concept of the [[tank]] had been suggested as early as the 1890s, authorities showed little more than a passing interest in them until the trench stalemate of World War I caused reconsideration. In early 1915, the British [[Royal Navy]] and French industrialists both started dedicated development of tanks.\n\nBasic tank design combined several existing technologies. It included [[vehicle armor|armor plating]] thick enough to be proof against all standard infantry arms, [[caterpillar track]] (invented in 1770 and perfected in the early 1900s) for mobility over the shell-torn battlefield, the four-stroke gasoline powered [[internal combustion engine]] (refined in the 1870s), and heavy firepower, provided by the same machine guns which had recently become so dominant in warfare, or even light artillery guns.\n\nIn Britain, a landships committee was formed, teamed with the inventions committee, and assigned the task working out a practical tank design. The \"landship\" focus led to large tanks with a [[rhomboidal]] shape to allow crossing of an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} trench, starting with the [[Mark I tank]], with the \"male\" versions mounting [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|small naval guns]].\n\nIn France, several competing arms industry organizations each proposed radically different designs. Smaller tanks became favored, leading to the [[Renault FT tank]], in part by being able to leverage the engines and manufacturing techniques of commercial tractors and automobiles.\n\nThough their initial appearance on the battlefield in 1917 terrified the Germans, these engagements provided more opportunities for development than battle successes. Early tanks were unreliable, breaking down often. Germans learned they were vulnerable to direct hits from field artillery and heavy mortars, their trenches were widened and other obstacles devised to halt them, and special [[anti-tank rifle]]s were rapidly developed. Also, both Britain and France found new tactics and training were required to make effective use of their tanks, such as larger coordinated formations of tanks and close support with infantry. Once tanks could be organized in the hundreds, as in the opening assault of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, they began to have notable impact.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the war, new tank designs often revealed flaws in battle, to be addressed in later designs, but reliability remained the primary weakness of tanks. In the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]], a major [[Triple Entente|Entente]] counteroffensive near the end of the war, British forces went to field with 532 tanks; after several days, only a few were still in commission, with those that suffered mechanical difficulties outnumbering those disabled by enemy fire.\n\nGermany utilized many captured enemy tanks, and made a few of their own late in the war. \n\nIn the last year of the war, despite rapidly increasing production (especially by France) and improving designs, tank technology struggled to make more than a modest impact on the war's overall progress. [[Plan 1919]] proposed the future use of massive tank formations in great offensives combined with [[ground attack aircraft]].\n\nEven without achieving the decisive results hoped for during World War I, tank technology and [[mechanized warfare]] had been launched and would grow increasingly sophisticated in the years following the war. By [[World War II]], the tank would evolve into a fearsome weapon critical to restoring mobility to land warfare.<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=421\u2013426}}</ref>\n\n== At sea ==\n{{Main|Naval warfare of World War I}}\n \nThe years leading up to the war saw the use of improved metallurgical and mechanical techniques to produce larger ships with larger guns and, in reaction, more armor. The launching of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)]] revolutionized [[battleship]] construction, leaving many ships obsolete before they were completed. German ambitions brought an [[Anglo-German naval arms race]] in which the [[Imperial German Navy]] was built up from a small force to the world's most modern and second most powerful. However, even this high-technology navy entered the war with a mix of newer ships and obsolete older ones.\n\nThe advantage was in long-range gunnery, and naval battles took place at far greater distances than before. The 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] demonstrated the excellence of German ships and crews, but also showed that the [[High Seas Fleet]] was not big enough to challenge openly the British [[blockade of Germany]]. It was the only full-scale battle between fleets in the war.\n\nHaving the largest surface fleet, the United Kingdom sought to press its advantage. British ships blockaded German ports, hunted down German and Austro-Hungarian ships wherever they might be on the high seas, and supported actions against [[German colonies]]. The German surface fleet was largely kept in the North Sea. This situation pushed Germany, in particular, to direct its resources to a new form of naval power: submarines.\n\n[[Naval mine]]s were deployed in hundreds of thousands, or far greater numbers than in previous wars. Submarines proved surprisingly effective for this purpose. [[Influence mine]]s were a new development but moored contact mines were the most numerous. They resembled those of the late 19th century, improved so they less often exploded while being laid. The Allies produced enough mines to build the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] to help bottle the Germans into the [[North Sea]], but it was too late to make much difference.\n\n=== Submarines ===\n[[File:Submarine U-14 (LOC) (6358166395).jpg|thumb|German U-boat ''[[SM U-14 (Germany)|U-14]]'']]\nWorld War I was the first conflict in which [[submarine]]s were a serious weapon of war. In the years shortly before the war, the relatively sophisticated propulsion system of diesel power while surfaced and battery power while submerged was introduced. Their armament had similarly improved, but few were in service. Germany had already increased production, and quickly built up its [[U-boat]] fleet, both for action against British warships and for a counterblockade of the British Isles. 360 were eventually built. The resulting [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)]] destroyed more enemy warships than the High Seas Fleet had, and hampered British war supplies as the more expensive surface fleet had not.\n\nThe United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed its population and supply its war industry, and the German Navy hoped to blockade and starve Britain using [[U-boats]] to attack merchant ships. Lieutenant [[Otto Weddigen]] remarked of the [[Action of 22 September 1914|second submarine attack of the Great War]]:\n\n:{{cquote|How much they feared our submarines and how wide was the agitation caused by good little [[SM U-9|U-9]] is shown by the English reports that a whole flotilla of German submarines had attacked the cruisers and that this flotilla had approached under cover of the flag of Holland. These reports were absolutely untrue. U-9 was the only submarine on deck, and she flew the flag she still flies \u2013 the German naval ensign.}}\n\nSubmarines soon came under persecution by [[submarine chaser]]s and other small warships using hastily devised [[anti-submarine weapons]]. They could not impose an effective blockade while acting under the restrictions of the [[prize rules]] and international [[law of the sea]]. They resorted to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], which cost Germany public sympathy in neutral countries and was a factor contributing to the [[American entry into World War I]].\n\nThis struggle between German submarines and British counter measures became known as the \"[[First Battle of the Atlantic]].\" As German submarines became more numerous and effective, the British sought ways to protect their merchant ships. \"[[Q-ship]]s,\" attack vessels disguised as civilian ships, were one early strategy.\n\nConsolidating merchant ships into [[convoys]] protected by one or more armed navy vessels was adopted later in the war. There was initially a great deal of debate about this approach, out of fear that it would provide German U-boats with a wealth of convenient targets. Thanks to the development of active and passive [[sonar]] devices,<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|pp=129, 130, 140}}</ref> coupled with increasingly deadly [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, the convoy system reduced British losses to U-boats to a small fraction of their former level.\n\n[[Holland 602 type submarine]]<nowiki/>s and other Allied types were fewer, being unnecessary for the blockade of Germany.\n\n== Small arms ==\n[[File:French troopers under General Gouraud, with their machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the Marne... - NARA - 533679.tif|thumb|French machine gunners defend a ruined cathedral, late in the war]]\n[[List of infantry weapons of World War I|Infantry weapons]] for major powers were mainly [[bolt action]] rifles, capable of firing ten or more rounds per minute.

Oxford: Osprey Publishing; pp. 11-12</ref> Their use in defense, combined with barbed [[wire obstacle]]s, converted the expected [[Maneuver warfare|mobile battlefield]] to a static one. The machine gun was useful in [[Trench warfare|stationary battle]] but could not move easily through a battlefield, and therefore forced soldiers to face enemy machine guns without machine guns of their own.\n\nBefore the war, the French Army studied the question of a [[light machine gun]] but had made none for use. At the start of hostilities, France quickly turned an existing prototype (the \"CS\" for Chauchat and Sutter) into the lightweight [[Chauchat|Chauchat M1915]] automatic rifle with a high [[rate of fire]]. Besides its use by the French, the first American units to arrive in France used it in 1917 and 1918. Hastily mass-manufactured under desperate wartime pressures, the weapon developed a reputation for unreliability.<ref name=TrenchWarfare>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXCn3WrINjwC&pg=PA31 |pages=31\u201332 |title=World War I Trench Warfare (1916\u20131918) |last1=Bull |first1=Stephen |last2=Hook |first2=Adam |publisher=Osprey |year=2002 |isbn=1-84176-198-2 |series=Elite |volume=84 |edition=3}}</ref>\n\nSeeing the potential of such a weapon, the British Army adopted the American-designed [[Lewis gun]] chambered in .303 British.

When the war started, grenades were few and poor. Hand grenades were used and improved throughout the war. [[Contact fuze]]s became less common, replaced by time fuzes.\n\nThe British entered the war with the long-handled impact detonating \"[[No 1 grenade|Grenade, Hand No 1]]\".<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\">Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 27</ref> This was replaced by the [[No. 15 ball grenade|No. 15 \"Ball Grenade\"]] to partially overcome some of its inadequacies. An [[Improvised explosive device|improvised]] hand grenade was developed in Australia for use by ANZAC troops called the [[Jam Tin Grenade|Double Cylinder \"jam tin\"]] which consisted of a tin filled with [[dynamite]] or [[guncotton]], packed round with scrap metal or stones. To ignite, at the top of the tin there was a Bickford [[safety fuse]] connecting the detonator, which was lit by either the user, or a second person.<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\"/> The \"[[Mills bomb]]\" (Grenade, Hand No. 5) was introduced in 1915 and would serve in its basic form in the British Army until the 1970s. Its improved fusing system relied on the soldier removing a pin and while holding down a lever on the side of the grenade. When the grenade was thrown the safety lever would automatically release, igniting the grenades internal fuse which would burn down until the grenade detonated. The French would use the [[F1 grenade (France)|F1]] defensive grenade.\n\nThe major grenades used in the beginning by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] were the impact-detonating \"[[Discus throw|discus]]\" or \"oyster shell\" bomb and the Mod 1913 black powder ''[[Kugelhandgranate]]'' with a friction-ignited time fuse.<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\"/> In 1915 Germany developed the much more effective ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'', nicknamed \"potato masher\" for its shape, whose variants remained in use for decades; it used a timed fuse system similar to the Mills bomb. \n\nHand grenades were not the only attempt at projectile explosives for infantry. A [[rifle grenade]] was brought into the trenches to attack the enemy from a greater distance. The [[Hales rifle grenade]] got little attention from the British Army before the war began but, during the war, Germany showed great interest in this weapon. The resulting casualties for the Allies caused Britain to search for a new defense.<ref>Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 29</ref>\n\nThe [[Stokes mortar]], a lightweight and very portable [[trench mortar]] with short tube and capable of [[indirect fire]], was rapidly developed and widely imitated.<ref>Duffy, Michael (2000-07) \"Safe Surf\". http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/mortars.htm</ref> Mechanical bomb throwers of lesser range were used in a similar fashion to fire upon the enemy from a safe distance within the trench.\n\nThe [[Sauterelle]] was a grenade launching [[Crossbow]] used before the Stokes mortar by French and British troops.\n\n==Flame throwers==\n[[File:PSM V87 D315 Flame thrower used by the germans to repulse attacks in ww 1.png|thumb|Defensive use]]\nThe Imperial German Army deployed [[flame thrower]]s (''Flammenwerfer'') on the Western Front attempting to flush out French or British soldiers from their trenches. Introduced in 1915, it was used with greatest effect during the [[Hooge, Belgium|Hooge]] battle of the Western Front on 30 July 1915. The German Army had two main types of flame throwers during the Great War: a small single person version called the [[Kleinflammenwerfer]] and a larger crew served configuration called the [[Grossflammenwerfer]]. In the latter, one soldier carried the fuel tank while another aimed the nozzle.

It was released on 17 November 1971 in the UK and 4 December 1971 in the US by [[RCA Records]]. It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. It was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album was co-produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] who, before ''Hunky Dory'' was an engineer for [[the Beatles]] and Bowie's previous two albums. Scott would go on to co-produce his next three records. \n\nAfter ''The Man Who Sold the World'', Bowie took time off due to managerial problems and other conflicts. In February 1971, he underwent a promotional tour of America, which helped shape the music and lyrics for ''Hunky Dory''. The album contains three tribute songs to the American icons [[Andy Warhol]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Velvet Underground]], as well as another to his newborn son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]]. Unlike his previous records, the songs are primarily piano-led rather than guitar-led. They contain lyrics that are influenced by the work of [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] and philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nUpon release, the album received very positive reviews from multiple publications but sold poorly, partly due to poor marketing. However, following the commercial breakthrough of his follow-up album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972), ''Hunky Dory'' became a commercial success, peaking at number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and gave the album a larger audience. It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. It has been placed on numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time, including by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''. The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\n{{quote box|quote=The whole ''Hunky Dory'' album reflected my newfound enthusiasm for this new continent that had been opened up to me.

According to Andy Greene of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the tour opened his eyes to new genres he had never explored before. It inspired him to write three tribute songs for three iconic American artists: artist [[Andy Warhol]], singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]] and the rock band [[the Velvet Underground]], more specifically their singer [[Lou Reed]].<ref name=\"Greene RS\" /> After the tour, Bowie returned to Haddon and began writing.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Cann: \"[That's] rubbish.

The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh!

him since ''The Man Who Sold the World'', and his previous hard rock and metallic sound was not present. The song was unlike \"[[Space Oddity]]\" and its 1969 parent album, but rather \"pure, unashamedly melodic, gleefully commercial, gorgeously mellifluous pop.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=141}}\n\n\"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" was the first track written for the album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}} The piano style has been compared to the Beatles' \"[[Martha My Dear]]\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201341}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} The lyrics reference the teaching of the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] and his [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], particularly with the lines 'the homo superior', 'the golden ones' and 'homo sapiens have outgrown their use'.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} The 'Homo Superior' refers to Nietzsche's theory of ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'', or \"Superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} There's also a reference to ''[[The Coming Race]]'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]],{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} a 19th-century novel in which superhumans are found residing in the depths of Earth and subsequently take over as the dominant species.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=356}} Pegg also believes a possible influence is the 1953 [[Arthur C. Clarke]] novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'', in which an alien influence causes to children to rise up against their parents,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}} while Doggett believes there is a sense of [[H. G. Wells]] in Bowie's concern about \"the world to come\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} The music itself provides a contrast to the darker themes. According to Doggett, it features the same diatonic major progression in the chorus as \"Changes\" and his future \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} He further describes Bowie's vocal performance as \"quite unadorned, presented so starkly...that it [is] almost unsettling\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=115}}\n\nDesigned to sound like a \"continuation\" of the previous track,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=143}} \"Eight Line Poem\" is described by Pegg as the album's most \"overlooked\" song.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} It features Bowie's vocal over a gentle, sporadic piano and [[Country music|country]]-influenced guitar line from Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=144}} Featuring exactly eight lines,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=143}} the lyrics portray a room where a cat just knocked over a spinning mobile and a cactus sits in a window.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} Doggett believes there's a metaphor between the cactus and a prairie.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=144}} Around the album's release, Bowie cryptically described the song as \"The city is a kind of high-life wart on the backside of the prairie.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} In a 1973 interview, William Burroughs believed the lyrics to be influenced by [[T.

There are clutches of melody in that that were definite parodies.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} The handwritten notes on the back cover say \"Inspired by Frankie\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=149}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=284}} Like most songs on the album, \"Life on Mars?\" is mostly piano-led, but features a string arrangement from Ronson \u2013 his very first one{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=285}} \u2013 that is described by Doggett as \"gargantuan\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} Bowie's vocal \u2013 recorded in one take{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} \u2013 is delivered passionately during the chorus and almost nasally in the verses; he hits a high B{{flat}} on the word 'Mars' in the chorus, and holds the note for three bars.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} In the lyrics, he mentions \"the girl with the mousy hair\", whose identity commentators have debated,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=285}} and says \"look at those cavemen go\", which is borrowed from [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"[[Alley Oop (song)|Alley Oop]]\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=286}} Greene describes the song as \"the story of a girl with 'mousy hair' who goes to the movies as an escape from life.\"<ref name=\"Greene RS\" />\n\n\"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" was written as a tribute for Bowie's son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones]], within days of his birth on 30 May 1971. Performed by Bowie as early as 3 June, the ''Hunky Dory'' version features a string arrangement from Ronson and trumpet played by Bolder.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=259\u2013260}} The song is noticeably more \"lightweight\" than the two tracks it is sequenced between, but, according to Pegg, ultimately carries a hint of [the album's] preoccupation with the compulsion to fictionalise life, as Bowie invites his son to 'stay in our lovers' story'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=260}} Doggett writes that its inclusion on the album \"ensured its enduring appeal among those who were less entranced by his explorations of politics, psychology and occult elsewhere on the album.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=129}}\n\nAccording to Pegg, \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" was inspired by Bowie's trip to America in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=383}} However, Doggett states that the song was written ''about'' a lack of inspiration and as a means of ''accessing'' it. English writer [[Colin Wilson]] wrote in his ''[[The Occult: A History|The Occult]]'' (1971) that thought was a form of [[quicksand]] that allowed consciousness to keep the unconscious beyond reach. So, \"Quicksand\" was Bowie's plea to search within himself to be shown the way.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=145}} In the mid-1970s, Bowie described the song as \"a mixture of narrative and surrealism\" and a \"precursor\" to the music of his 1977 album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=383}} Throughout the track, Bowie makes numerous references to Aleister Crowley and his Golden Dawn, [[Winston Churchill]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], and the \"supermen\" of Friedrich Nietzsche.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=145}} The song also evokes spiritualism through the mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings such as [[bardo]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}} Buckley compares the ideas to [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} Bowie would later revisit themes presented in \"Quicksand\" on the [[Station to Station (song)|title track]] of ''[[Station to Station]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} The instrumental track features multiple layers of acoustic guitars on top of each other,{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} which was made at the insistence of Scott.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"Fill Your Heart\", written by [[Biff Rose]] and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], is the only song on the album not written by Bowie. It replaced \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\" as the side two opener late in the album's development.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} Described by Bowie as \"a flower-power [[Randy Newman]]\", Rose was a major influence on Bowie since the late 1960s and is reflected in songs such as \"Conversation Piece\", \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\", \"[[The Supermen]]\" and \"[[Shadow Man (song)|Shadow Man]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} One of the more up-tempo tracks on the album,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} the song is described by Doggett as being \"practically identical\" to Rose's original version \u2013 found on his 1968 album ''[[The Thorn in Mrs. Rose's Side]]'' \u2013 albeit it's more \"bouncy\" and less \"swung\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=136}} The piano-led arrangement is different than Bowie's live performances of it in 1970, where it was acoustic guitar-led.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} Rose would decades later question Bowie's choice to copy his arrangement, saying \"I mean couldn't you have done your own treatment of it?\" Pegg writes that the track provides a \"cogent counterpoint\" to the \"angst\" of \"Quicksand\" and the \"cautionary warnings\" of \"Changes\" and is best remembered for Bowie's saxophone break, Ronson's string arrangement, and Wakeman's piano solo.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A black and white photo of Andy Warhol with a dog|[[Andy Warhol]], between 1966 and 1977]]\n\"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" is a tribute to [[Andy Warhol]],{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=95}} a major influence on Bowie since the mid-1960s and was described by him as \"one of the leaders\" of \"the media of the streets, street messages.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} It was originally written for Bowie's friend Dana Gillespie, who recorded a studio version, with Bowie producing,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} that was later released on her 1974 album ''Weren't Born a Man''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=42}} Bowie's version, described by Pegg as a \"cult favorite\", the song is based around a guitar riff, played on two acoustic guitars, that heavily resembles the intro of [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"Silent Song Across the Land\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}} The lyrics emphasise Warhol's belief that life and art blur together.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} The song's opening features Ken Scott saying \"This is 'Andy Warhol', and it's take one\", only for Bowie to correct his pronunciation of 'Warhol'. According to Pegg, the ending applause was recorded in the studio bathroom \"in pursuit of the desired acoustic\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}} Doggett believes that the opening and closing bits resemble the sound effects on the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} When Bowie played the song for Warhol when they met in September 1971, the artist hated it, reacting by leaving the room; however, Bowie recalled in 1997 that he found the meeting \"fascinating\" because Warhol had \"nothing to say at all, absolutely nothing\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=A black and white photo of Bob Dylan with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica in 1963|[[Bob Dylan]] in 1963]]\n\"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" is another tribute song, this time to American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=95}} Described by Bowie at the time as \"this is how some see BD\", the song's title is a parody of Dylan's 1962 tribute to American folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]], \"[[Song to Woody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}} Throughout the song, Bowie addresses Dylan by his real name 'Robert Zimmerman', which Doggett points out [[John Lennon]] did as well on his song \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\" the year prior.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=131}} Pegg and Doggett believe that this highlights Bowie's struggle with identity, from his real name David Jones, to his stage name David Bowie and, very shortly, to Ziggy Stardust.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=131}} The lyrics specifically present Dylan as no longer being a hero figure for rock music, and he must return to his roots and come to the rescue for the unfaithful.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} By 1970, Dylan was the spokesman of a generation. Bowie himself had taken influence from Dylan for his 1969 album ''Space Oddity'', which was primarily folk-rock and featured the use of a [[harmonica]] and acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Upon his refusal to supports political protests of the [[Vietnam War]] and America in the time of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], artists such as [[Country Joe and the Fish]] (with their song \"Hey Bobby\") and the Dylan Liberation Front (whose mission was to \"Free Bob Dylan from himself\") were created.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=130}} According to Doggett, Bowie initially wrote it for his friend George Underwood, who performed it during Bowie's June 1971 BBC session in a Dylanesque voice.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=130}} However, when discussing the song to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1976, Bowie said: \"[That song] laid out what I wanted to do in rock. It was at that period that I said, OK if you don't want to do it, I will. I saw the leadership void.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} However, Doggett argues that this explanation is invalid because there is nothing in the song that supports this.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=130\u2013131}} The music contains Dylanesque chord changes and the chorus is derived from the titles of two [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] songs, \"Here She Comes Now\" and \"There She Goes Again\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}} Buckley writes that the song is \"probably the weakest\" on the album, while Pegg notes that it is \"little-regarded\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}\n\n[[File:Velvet Underground WLWH publicity photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|alt=A black and white photo of the Velvet Underground in 1968|[[The Velvet Underground]] in 1968]]\nThe final tribute song on the album, \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" is largely inspired by the Velvet Underground, specifically their lead singer [[Lou Reed]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} The handwritten sleeve notes on the back cover read: \"some V.U. White Light returned with thanks\", indicating an influence of Reed's \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man|Waiting for the Man]]\" and \"[[White Light/White Heat (song)|White Light/White Heat]]\". There is also a lyrical reference to Reed's song \"[[Sister Ray]]\". Unlike the majority of the album's tracks, \"Queen Bitch\" is primarily guitar-led rather than piano-led.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}} Pegg writes that the guitar riff was inspired by \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}} although Doggett disagrees, citing Reed's \"[[Sweet Jane]]\" as the inspiration.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=134}} The chorus sees Bowie mincing his \"satin and tat\", a nod to [[Lindsay Kemp]]. Pegg states: \"Part of the genius of 'Queen Bitch' is that it filters the archness of [[Marc Bolan]] and Kemp through the streetwise attitude of Reed: this is a song that succeeds in making the phrase 'bipperty-bopperty hat' sound raunchy and cool.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=[It's] another vaguely anecdotal piece about my feelings about myself and my brother, or my other doppelg\u00e4nger.

In 1972, he told an American interviewer, \"I like 'The Bewlay Brothers' so much, only because it's so personal. I'm sure it doesn't mean a thing to anybody else, and I'm sorry if I inflicted myself upon people with that track.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} Many reviewers have found a [[homosexual]] vibe to the track, while others predicted it to be about Bowie's relationship with his [[schizophrenic]] half-brother Terry Burns; he confirmed the latter theory in 1977: \"[that song is] very much based on myself and my brother.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} However, Buckley is unsure about whether the account is fictionalised or real.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Some of the lyrics refer to other tracks on the album: \"the solid book we wrote cannot be found today\" recalls \"Song for Bob Dylan\", the \"books...fou\u00e9d by the golden ones\" mirror \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", and the \"fakers\" bring us full-circle to \"Changes\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} He also uses the word \"[[chameleon]]\", which would become the most clich\u00e9d word used by rock critics to describe him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=65}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward, at his studio in Heddon Street, off [[Regent Street]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'.

According to Cann, initial UK pressings were laminated, which enhanced the colour to create a \"superior finish\"; these pressings are now highly sought after items.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=234}} The rear side featured Bowie's handwritten notes about each song from the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=234}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\n== Release ==\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

However, Defries succeeded in forcing Mercury to terminate his contract in May after threatening to deliver a low-quality album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=605\u2013606}} Defries was then able to pay off Bowie's debts to Mercury through Gem Productions; Mercury then surrendered their copyright on ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969) and ''The Man Who Sold the World'' (1970).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} After ending the contract with Mercury, Defries presented the album to multiple labels in the US. [[RCA Records]], stationed in New York City, liked the album and signed Bowie to a three-album deal on 9 September 1971; RCA would be Bowie's label for the rest of the 1970s.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195, 227}} \n\n''Hunky Dory'' was released on 17 November 1971 in the UK and 4 December 1971 in the US by RCA Records.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} By this time, the sessions for ''Ziggy Stardust'' were underway.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=230\u2013231}} It was supported by the single \"Changes\" on 7 January 1972.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Changes\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=RCA 2160}}</ref> Due to the unusual album cover, described by Pegg as a ''fait accompli'', and told that Bowie would be changing his image for his next album, RCA did little to promote the album.

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] praised the album writing, \"On the surface, [having] such a wide range of styles and sounds would make an album incoherent, but Bowie's improved songwriting and determined sense of style instead made ''Hunky Dory'' a touchstone for reinterpreting pop's traditions into fresh, postmodern pop music.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> Michael Gallucci of ''Ultimate Classic Rock'' writes that ''Hunky Dory'' is \"where Bowie starts to become Bowie\", featuring lyrical and stylistic themes he would replicate on his future albums.

It was released on 17 November 1971 in the UK and 4 December 1971 in the US by [[RCA Records]]. It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. It was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album was co-produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] who, before ''Hunky Dory'' was an engineer for [[the Beatles]] and Bowie's previous two albums. Scott would go on to co-produce his next three records. \n\nAfter ''The Man Who Sold the World'', Bowie took time off due to managerial problems and other conflicts. In February 1971, he underwent a promotional tour of America, which helped shape the music and lyrics for ''Hunky Dory''. The album contains three tribute songs to the American icons [[Andy Warhol]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Velvet Underground]], as well as another to his newborn son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]]. Unlike his previous records, the songs are primarily piano-led rather than guitar-led. They contain lyrics that are influenced by the work of [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] and philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nUpon release, the album received very positive reviews from multiple publications but sold poorly, partly due to poor marketing. However, following the commercial breakthrough of his follow-up album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972), ''Hunky Dory'' became a commercial success, peaking at number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and gave the album a larger audience. It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. It has been placed on numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time, including by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''. The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\n{{quote box|quote=The whole ''Hunky Dory'' album reflected my newfound enthusiasm for this new continent that had been opened up to me.

According to Andy Greene of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the tour opened his eyes to new genres he had never explored before. It inspired him to write three tribute songs for three iconic American artists: artist [[Andy Warhol]], singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]] and the rock band [[the Velvet Underground]], more specifically their singer [[Lou Reed]].<ref name=\"Greene RS\" /> After the tour, Bowie returned to Haddon and began writing.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh!

distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} He also identifies the line \"look out you rock 'n' rollers' as Bowie \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} Pegg summarises the lyrics as Bowie \"holding a mirror to his face\" just as he's about to achieve stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} The song's chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to [[the Who]]'s \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\"), as well as [[Bob

him since ''The Man Who Sold the World'', and his previous hard rock and metallic sound was not present. The song was unlike \"[[Space Oddity]]\" and its 1969 parent album, but rather \"pure, unashamedly melodic, gleefully commercial, gorgeously mellifluous pop.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=141}}\n\n\"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" was the first track written for the album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}} The piano style has been compared to the Beatles' \"[[Martha My Dear]]\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201341}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} The lyrics reference the teaching of the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] and his [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], particularly with the lines 'the homo superior', 'the golden ones' and 'homo sapiens have outgrown their use'.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} The 'Homo Superior' refers to Nietzsche's theory of ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'', or \"Superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} There's also a reference to ''[[The Coming Race]]'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]],{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} a 19th-century novel in which superhumans are found residing in the depths of Earth and subsequently take over as the dominant species.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=356}} Pegg also believes a possible influence is the 1953 [[Arthur C. Clarke]] novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'', in which an alien influence causes to children to rise up against their parents,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}} while Doggett believes there is a sense of [[H. G. Wells]] in Bowie's concern about \"the world to come\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} The music itself provides a contrast to the darker themes. According to Doggett, it features the same diatonic major progression in the chorus as \"Changes\" and his future \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} He further describes Bowie's vocal performance as \"quite unadorned, presented so starkly...that it [is] almost unsettling\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=115}}\n\nDesigned to sound like a \"continuation\" of the previous track,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=143}} \"Eight Line Poem\" is described by Pegg as the album's most \"overlooked\" song.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} It features Bowie's vocal over a gentle, sporadic piano and [[Country music|country]]-influenced guitar line from Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=144}} Featuring exactly eight lines,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=143}} the lyrics portray a room where a cat just knocked over a spinning mobile and a cactus sits in a window.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} Doggett believes there's a metaphor between the cactus and a prairie.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=144}} Around the album's release, Bowie cryptically described the song as \"The city is a kind of high-life wart on the backside of the prairie.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} In a 1973 interview, William Burroughs believed the lyrics to be influenced by [[T.

There are clutches of melody in that that were definite parodies.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} The handwritten notes on the back cover say \"Inspired by Frankie\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=149}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=284}} Like most songs on the album, \"Life on Mars?\" is mostly piano-led, but features a string arrangement from Ronson \u2013 his very first one{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=285}} \u2013 that is described by Doggett as \"gargantuan\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} Bowie's vocal \u2013 recorded in one take{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} \u2013 is delivered passionately during the chorus and almost nasally in the verses; he hits a high B{{flat}} on the word 'Mars' in the chorus, and holds the note for three bars.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} In the lyrics, he mentions \"the girl with the mousy hair\", whose identity commentators have debated,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=285}} and says \"look at those cavemen go\", which is borrowed from [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"[[Alley Oop (song)|Alley Oop]]\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=286}} Greene describes the song as \"the story of a girl with 'mousy hair' who goes to the movies as an escape from life.\"<ref name=\"Greene RS\" />\n\n\"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" was written as a tribute for Bowie's son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones]], within days of his birth on 30 May 1971. Performed by Bowie as early as 3 June, the ''Hunky Dory'' version features a string arrangement from Ronson and trumpet played by Bolder.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=259\u2013260}} The song is noticeably more \"lightweight\" than the two tracks it is sequenced between, but, according to Pegg, ultimately carries a hint of [the album's] preoccupation with the compulsion to fictionalise life, as Bowie invites his son to 'stay in our lovers' story'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=260}} Doggett writes that its inclusion on the album \"ensured its enduring appeal among those who were less entranced by his explorations of politics, psychology and occult elsewhere on the album.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=129}}\n\nAccording to Pegg, \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" was inspired by Bowie's trip to America in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=383}} However, Doggett states that the song was written ''about'' a lack of inspiration and as a means of ''accessing'' it. English writer [[Colin Wilson]] wrote in his ''[[The Occult: A History|The Occult]]'' (1971) that thought was a form of [[quicksand]] that allowed consciousness to keep the unconscious beyond reach. So, \"Quicksand\" was Bowie's plea to search within himself to be shown the way.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=145}} In the mid-1970s, Bowie described the song as \"a mixture of narrative and surrealism\" and a \"precursor\" to the music of his 1977 album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=383}} Throughout the track, Bowie makes numerous references to Aleister Crowley and his Golden Dawn, [[Winston Churchill]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], and the \"supermen\" of Friedrich Nietzsche.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=145}} The song also evokes spiritualism through the mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings such as [[bardo]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}} Buckley compares the ideas to [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} Bowie would later revisit themes presented in \"Quicksand\" on the [[Station to Station (song)|title track]] of ''[[Station to Station]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} The instrumental track features multiple layers of acoustic guitars on top of each other,{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} which was made at the insistence of Scott.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"Fill Your Heart\", written by [[Biff Rose]] and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], is the only song on the album not written by Bowie. It replaced \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\" as the side two opener late in the album's development.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} Described by Bowie as \"a flower-power [[Randy Newman]]\", Rose was a major influence on Bowie since the late 1960s and is reflected in songs such as \"Conversation Piece\", \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\", \"[[The Supermen]]\" and \"[[Shadow Man (song)|Shadow Man]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} One of the more up-tempo tracks on the album,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} the song is described by Doggett as being \"practically identical\" to Rose's original version \u2013 found on his 1968 album ''[[The Thorn in Mrs. Rose's Side]]'' \u2013 albeit it's more \"bouncy\" and less \"swung\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=136}} The piano-led arrangement is different than Bowie's live performances of it in 1970, where it was acoustic guitar-led.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} Rose would decades later question Bowie's choice to copy his arrangement, saying \"I mean couldn't you have done your own treatment of it?\" Pegg writes that the track provides a \"cogent counterpoint\" to the \"angst\" of \"Quicksand\" and the \"cautionary warnings\" of \"Changes\" and is best remembered for Bowie's saxophone break, Ronson's string arrangement, and Wakeman's piano solo.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A black and white photo of Andy Warhol with a dog|[[Andy Warhol]], between 1966 and 1977]]\n\"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" is a tribute to [[Andy Warhol]],{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=95}} a major influence on Bowie since the mid-1960s and was described by him as \"one of the leaders\" of \"the media of the streets, street messages.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} It was originally written for Bowie's friend Dana Gillespie, who recorded a studio version, with Bowie producing,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} that was later released on her 1974 album ''Weren't Born a Man''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=42}} Bowie's version, described by Pegg as a \"cult favorite\", the song is based around a guitar riff, played on two acoustic guitars, that heavily resembles the intro of [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"Silent Song Across the Land\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}} The lyrics emphasise Warhol's belief that life and art blur together.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} The song's opening features Ken Scott saying \"This is 'Andy Warhol', and it's take one\", only for Bowie to correct his pronunciation of 'Warhol'. According to Pegg, the ending applause was recorded in the studio bathroom \"in pursuit of the desired acoustic\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}} Doggett believes that the opening and closing bits resemble the sound effects on the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} When Bowie played the song for Warhol when they met in September 1971, the artist hated it, reacting by leaving the room; however, Bowie recalled in 1997 that he found the meeting \"fascinating\" because Warhol had \"nothing to say at all, absolutely nothing\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=A black and white photo of Bob Dylan with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica in 1963|[[Bob Dylan]] in 1963]]\n\"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" is another tribute song, this time to American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=95}} Described by Bowie at the time as \"this is how some see BD\", the song's title is a parody of Dylan's 1962 tribute to American folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]], \"[[Song to Woody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}} Throughout the song, Bowie addresses Dylan by his real name 'Robert Zimmerman', which Doggett points out [[John Lennon]] did as well on his song \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\" the year prior.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=131}} Pegg and Doggett believe that this highlights Bowie's struggle with identity, from his real name David Jones, to his stage name David Bowie and, very shortly, to Ziggy Stardust.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=131}} The lyrics specifically present Dylan as no longer being a hero figure for rock music, and he must return to his roots and come to the rescue for the unfaithful.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} By 1970, Dylan was the spokesman of a generation. Bowie himself had taken influence from Dylan for his 1969 album ''Space Oddity'', which was primarily folk-rock and featured the use of a [[harmonica]] and acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Upon his refusal to supports political protests of the [[Vietnam War]] and America in the time of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], artists such as [[Country Joe and the Fish]] (with their song \"Hey Bobby\") and the Dylan Liberation Front (whose mission was to \"Free Bob Dylan from himself\") were created.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=130}} According to Doggett, Bowie initially wrote it for his friend George Underwood, who performed it during Bowie's June 1971 BBC session in a Dylanesque voice.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=130}} However, when discussing the song to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1976, Bowie said: \"[That song] laid out what I wanted to do in rock. It was at that period that I said, OK if you don't want to do it, I will. I saw the leadership void.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} However, Doggett argues that this explanation is invalid because there is nothing in the song that supports this.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=130\u2013131}} The music contains Dylanesque chord changes and the chorus is derived from the titles of two [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] songs, \"Here She Comes Now\" and \"There She Goes Again\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}} Buckley writes that the song is \"probably the weakest\" on the album, while Pegg notes that it is \"little-regarded\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}\n\n[[File:Velvet Underground WLWH publicity photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|alt=A black and white photo of the Velvet Underground in 1968|[[The Velvet Underground]] in 1968]]\nThe final tribute song on the album, \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" is largely inspired by the Velvet Underground, specifically their lead singer [[Lou Reed]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} The handwritten sleeve notes on the back cover read: \"some V.U. White Light returned with thanks\", indicating an influence of Reed's \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man|Waiting for the Man]]\" and \"[[White Light/White Heat (song)|White Light/White Heat]]\". There is also a lyrical reference to Reed's song \"[[Sister Ray]]\". Unlike the majority of the album's tracks, \"Queen Bitch\" is primarily guitar-led rather than piano-led.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}} Pegg writes that the guitar riff was inspired by \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}} although Doggett disagrees, citing Reed's \"[[Sweet Jane]]\" as the inspiration.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=134}} The chorus sees Bowie mincing his \"satin and tat\", a nod to [[Lindsay Kemp]]. Pegg states: \"Part of the genius of 'Queen Bitch' is that it filters the archness of [[Marc Bolan]] and Kemp through the streetwise attitude of Reed: this is a song that succeeds in making the phrase 'bipperty-bopperty hat' sound raunchy and cool.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=[It's] another vaguely anecdotal piece about my feelings about myself and my brother, or my other doppelg\u00e4nger.

In 1972, he told an American interviewer, \"I like 'The Bewlay Brothers' so much, only because it's so personal. I'm sure it doesn't mean a thing to anybody else, and I'm sorry if I inflicted myself upon people with that track.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} Many reviewers have found a [[homosexual]] vibe to the track, while others predicted it to be about Bowie's relationship with his [[schizophrenic]] half-brother Terry Burns; he confirmed the latter theory in 1977: \"[that song is] very much based on myself and my brother.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} However, Buckley is unsure about whether the account is fictionalised or real.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Some of the lyrics refer to other tracks on the album: \"the solid book we wrote cannot be found today\" recalls \"Song for Bob Dylan\", the \"books...fou\u00e9d by the golden ones\" mirror \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", and the \"fakers\" bring us full-circle to \"Changes\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} He also uses the word \"[[chameleon]]\", which would become the most clich\u00e9d word used by rock critics to describe him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=65}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward, at his studio in Heddon Street, off [[Regent Street]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The original UK cover featured Bowie's name and the album title while in the US, there was no text and only featured the artist's face; the title was instead printed on a sticker and slapped onto the cellophane wrapping. According to Cann, initial UK pressings were laminated, which enhanced the colour to create a \"superior finish\"; these pressings are now highly sought after items.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=234}} The rear side featured Bowie's handwritten notes about each song from the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=234}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\n== Release ==\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

However, Defries succeeded in forcing Mercury to terminate his contract in May after threatening to deliver a low-quality album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=605\u2013606}} Defries was then able to pay off Bowie's debts to Mercury through Gem Productions; Mercury then surrendered their copyright on ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969) and ''The Man Who Sold the World'' (1970).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} After ending the contract with Mercury, Defries presented the album to multiple labels in the US. [[RCA Records]], stationed in New York City, liked the album and signed Bowie to a three-album deal on 9 September 1971; RCA would be Bowie's label for the rest of the 1970s.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195, 227}} \n\n''Hunky Dory'' was released on 17 November 1971 in the UK and 4 December 1971 in the US by RCA Records.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} By this time, the sessions for ''Ziggy Stardust'' were underway.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=230\u2013231}} It was supported by the single \"Changes\" on 7 January 1972.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Changes\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=RCA 2160}}</ref> Due to the unusual album cover, described by Pegg as a ''fait accompli'', and told that Bowie would be changing his image for his next album, RCA did little to promote the album.

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] praised the album writing, \"On the surface, [having] such a wide range of styles and sounds would make an album incoherent, but Bowie's improved songwriting and determined sense of style instead made ''Hunky Dory'' a touchstone for reinterpreting pop's traditions into fresh, postmodern pop music.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> Michael Gallucci of ''Ultimate Classic Rock'' writes that ''Hunky Dory'' is \"where Bowie starts to become Bowie\", featuring lyrical and stylistic themes he would replicate on his future albums.

The tournament was a [[stroke play]] team event, shortened from 72 holes, after the second round, scheduled on Friday, was cancelled due to bad weather, to 54 holes with 43 teams. Each team consisted of two players from a country. The combined score of each team determined the team results. The [[Republic of China]] team of [[Hsieh Min-Nan]] and [[Lu Liang-huan]] won by two strokes over the [[Japan]] team of [[Takaaki Kono]] and [[Takashi Murakami (golfer)|Takashi Murakami]]. The individual competition was won by Hsieh two strokes ahead of Kono. This was the first team victory for the Republic of China, also known as Taiwan, in the history of the World Cup, founded in 1953 and until 1967 named the Canada Cup.\n\n== Teams ==\n{|

It was the 20th [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] event. The tournament was a [[stroke play]] team event, shortened from 72 holes, after the second round, scheduled on Friday, was cancelled due to bad weather, to 54 holes with 43 teams. Each team consisted of two players from a country. The combined score of each team determined the team results. The [[Republic of China]] team of [[Hsieh Min-Nan]] and [[Lu Liang-huan]] won by two strokes over the [[Japan]] team of [[Takaaki Kono]] and [[Takashi Murakami (golfer)|Takashi Murakami]]. The individual competition was won by Hsieh two strokes ahead of Kono. This was the first team victory for the Republic of China, also known as Taiwan, in the history of the World Cup, founded in 1953 and until 1967 named the Canada Cup.\n\n== Teams ==\n{|
