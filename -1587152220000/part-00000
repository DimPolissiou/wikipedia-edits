It is the [[List of northernmost items|northernmost]] city in Africa, located 65&nbsp;km (40mil) north of the capital [[Tunis]]. It is one of the oldest known settlements in Tunisia, having been founded by settlers from the [[Phoenicia]]n port of [[Sidon]] around 1100{{nbsp}}BC.

Several Carthaginian generals used its port during the [[Punic Wars]] of 264-146 BC - such as [[Hamilcar Barca]], [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]], [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]] and [[Hannibal]].\n* In 149 BC the first Roman raids occurred. During the ascendancy of [[Julius Caesar]] the  [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] occupied the city, calling it Hippo Diarrhytus. The city regained its prosperity and progress from the reign of [[Augustus]] (Emperor from 27 BC to 14 AD) and  maintained maritime relations with [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], as shown by a mosaic decorating its commercial representation in the square of [[Piazzale delle Corporazioni|Forum of Corporations]]. Christianity spread in the city under the Empire.\n* In 439 AD [[Genseric]], the king of the [[Vandals]] ([[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribes]]) and his followers invaded the city and used the port as a base for invasions into other parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]: the city of Rome and the islands of [[Sardinia]], [[Malta]], [[Corsica]] and [[Sicily]]. The town appears on the medieval [[Peutinger Map]].\n* From 534 AD to 642 AD the city came under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]] after a defeat of the Vandals in 534; they{{who|date=July 2019}} build the Fort of Bizerte (now the Fort of Kasba).\n\n[[File:BizerteKasba.jpg|thumb|right|Old Port of Bizerte]]\n[[File:Pilsum leaving Bizerte.jpg|thumb|right|The moveable bridge of the Bizerte canal]]\n\n===Later history===\n[[Rashidun Caliphate|Arab]] armies took Bizerte in 647 in their first invasion of the area, but the city reverted to control from Constantinople until the Byzantines were defeated and finally driven from North Africa in 695\u201398. The troops of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] captured the city in 1535; the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Turks took it in 1574]]. The city then became a [[Barbary Pirate|corsair]] harbour and struggled against the French and the Venetians.\n\nWith its occupation of Tunisia in 1881, [[French Third Republic|France]] gained control of Bizerte and built a large naval harbour in the city.\n\nIn 1924, after the French government officially recognized the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), [[Wrangel's fleet|the western military fleet of White Russia]] that had been kept in the port of Bizerte was returned to the Soviet government. The ships were never moved from the port and finally were sold there as scrap metal.\n\nIn March 1939, towards the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Spanish Republican Navy]] Commander [[Miguel Buiza Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios|Miguel Buiza]] ordered the evacuation of the bulk of the Republican fleet. Three cruisers, eight destroyers and two submarines left [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] harbor and reached Bizerte, where the French authorities impounded them.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= Hugh Thomas (writer) |last= Thomas |first= Hugh |title= The Spanish Civil War\n| publisher = [[Penguin Books]] |year= 2001 |location= London |page= 877}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army|Italian armies]] occupied Bizerte until [[Tunisian Campaign|Allied troops defeated them]] on 7 May 1943. During the fighting between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and the German Army, many of the city's inhabitants fled to the countryside or to [[Tunis]]. The city suffered significant damage during the battle.<ref>{{cite web\n |url= http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/bizerte/bizerte-fm.htm\n |title= To Bizerte With The Ii Corps\n |publisher= History.army.mil\n |date= \n |accessdate= 2012-08-04\n |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120726133335/http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/bizerte/bizerte-fm.htm\n |archive-date= 2012-07-26\n |url-status= dead\n }}</ref>\n[[File:Vue a\u00e9rienne de Bizerte - 1959.jpg|thumb|right|180px| Aerial view of Bizerte in 1959]]\nDue to Bizerte's strategic location on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[French Fourth Republic|France]] retained control of the city and her naval base after Tunisian independence in 1956. \nIn 1961 Tunisian forces [[Bizerte crisis|blockaded]] the area of Bizerte and demanded French withdrawal. The face-off turned nasty when a French helicopter took off and drew fire.   The French brought in reinforcements; when these were fired upon, France took decisive military action against the Tunisian forces. Using state-of-the-art weapons and decisive force the French took Bizerte and [[Menzel Bourguiba]].  During three days in July 1961, 700 Tunisians died (1200 wounded); the French lost 24 dead (100 wounded).{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}\n\nMeetings at the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and other international pressure moved France to agreement; the French military finally abandoned Bizerte on 15 October 1963.{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nBizerte is on a section of widened inlet and east-facing coast of the north coast of Tunisia, 15 kilometres from [[Ras ben Sakka]] (the northernmost point in Africa on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]), 20 kilometers northeast of the [[Ichkeul lake]] (a World Heritage Site), 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the archaeological site of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and 65 kilometers north of [[Tunis]].\n\nit has to the west coastal hills forming an outcrop of the [[Tell Atlas]] with well-conserved woods and vantage points.  Its associated beaches include Sidi Salem, La Grotte, Rasenjela, and Al Rimel.  It is on a section of Mediterranean climate coastline, close to [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]], as opposed to coasts in the south of the country which have a year-round dry desert climate.\n\nThe city is centered on the north shore of the canal of Bizerte linking the Mediterranean Sea to a tidal lake, the [[Lac de Bizerte]] which is larger than all parts of the town combined, to the immediate south.  Built-up areas are in three directions:\n*South-west along the widening canal with jetties at Pecherie and Jarrouba, the latter associated with [[Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base]] adjoining the opening of the lake and military/rescue heliport.  \n*North are Sidi Salam and Corniche. They are within meters of the coast and on coast-facing slopes of the Ain Berda, a range of hills toward Cap Blanc, a small headland in the Ain Damou Plage natural conservation area. \n*Zarzouna, [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]] are on the south shore of the canal, formed by the locality of Zarzouna and the towns of [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]], by a moveable bridge and both Menzels face the lake itself.  The rest of the [[isthmus]] on which they stand is the gently rising Foret de Remel, reaching a high point east of its forest area at [[Cap Zebib]].\n\n===Transport===\nThe bridge leads to [[A4 motorway (Tunisia)|the motorway A4]] leading to [[Tunis\u2013Carthage International Airport]] and the capital. On the town side the P11 passes semi-rural Louata, hugs Ichkeul Lake and branches into a western route, the P7, leading directly to [[Tabarka]] on the coast next to the Algerian border.  The P11 leads south-west to [[B\u00e9ja]], a governorate center, in the foothills of the [[Tell Atlas]], forks into several roads at [[Bou Salem]], a small town in a broad fertile plain, and climbs to Firnanah passing two high-altitude lakes and also approaching the north-west border with Algeria.\n\n===Climate===\nBizerte enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer mediterranean]] climate, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The Mediterranean Sea breeze makes summers cooler but more humid.<ref name=\"Climate\u2013Data.Eu\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=tsxx0001&lang=en |title=Climate Bizerte

[[A4 motorway (Tunisia)|A4 motorway]] connecting Bizerte and Tunis]]\nBizerte's economy is very diverse. There are several military bases and year-round tourism. As a tourist centre the region is however not as popular as the eastern coast of Tunisia. There is manufacturing (textile, auto parts, cookware), fishing, fruits and vegetables, and wheat.\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n\n[[File:Jebel A\u00efn Chouna.jpg|thumb|right|Jebel A\u00efn Chouna]]\n* The port of Bizerte is being developed into a significant Mediterranean yachting marina that was scheduled to open in May 2012. The superyacht section of the marina will be called Goga Superyacht Marina, and will have berths for yachts of up to 110m in length. It is expected that this will give a significant boost to the local economy as the yacht owners and also the hundreds of professional crew will become year-round consumers. The service industries supplying the yachts will gradually develop and bring additional employment.<ref>{{cite web |author=Morley Yachts |url=http://www.GogaMarina.com |title=Goga Superyacht Marina |publisher=Gogamarina.com |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2012-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605024331/http://gogamarina.com/ |archivedate=2013-06-05 }}</ref>\n* The actor [[Abdelmajid Lakhal]] was born in Bizerte.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n* The Teapacks song \"Lo haya lano klum\" is about how bandleader [[Kobi Oz]]' family were expelled from Bizerte by the Nazis in 1942.\n\n==Titular see==\nHippo Diarrhytus is a [[titular see]] of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].

Serbian soldiers, and a small number of civilians, arrived in Bizerte on three occasions. In December 1915 and early 1916, after the Albanian Golgotha, then later in 1916 after the first clashes on the [[Salonica Front]] in [[Greece]] and in the early 1917 when Serbian volunteers began to gather in Bizerte. During the entire war, the soldiers were transported to the Salonica Front while the wounded were transported back to Tunisia. It is estimated that over 60,000 Serbian soldiers passed through the camp. The training of the volunteers was organized in the camp, education of the disabled but also the cultural events.<ref name=vojska>{{cite web|url= http://www.istorijskabiblioteka.com/art:srpska-vojska-u-bizerti |author= |title= Srpska vojska u Bizerti |date=|publisher=Istorijska biblioteka|language=Serbian}}</ref> French-Serbian dictionary was compiled and published by [[Veselin \u010cajkanovi\u0107]] in Bizerte.

Christianity spread in the city under the Empire.\n* In 439 AD [[Genseric]], the king of the [[Vandals]] ([[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribes]]) and his followers invaded the city and used the port as a base for invasions into other parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]: the city of Rome and the islands of [[Sardinia]], [[Malta]], [[Corsica]] and [[Sicily]]. The town appears on the medieval [[Peutinger Map]].\n* From 534 AD to 642 AD the city came under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]] after a defeat of the Vandals in 534; they{{who|date=July 2019}} build the Fort of Bizerte (now the Fort of Kasba).\n\n[[File:BizerteKasba.jpg|thumb|right|Old Port of Bizerte]]\n[[File:Pilsum leaving Bizerte.jpg|thumb|right|The moveable bridge of the Bizerte canal]]\n\n===Later history===\n[[Rashidun Caliphate|Arab]] armies took Bizerte in 647 in their first invasion of the area, but the city reverted to control from Constantinople until the Byzantines were defeated and finally driven from North Africa in 695\u201398. The troops of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] captured the city in 1535; the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Turks took it in 1574]]. The city then became a [[Barbary Pirate|corsair]] harbour and struggled against the French and the Venetians.\n\nWith its occupation of Tunisia in 1881, [[French Third Republic|France]] gained control of Bizerte and built a large naval harbour in the city.\n\nIn 1924, after the French government officially recognized the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), [[Wrangel's fleet|the western military fleet of White Russia]] that had been kept in the port of Bizerte was returned to the Soviet government. The ships were never moved from the port and finally were sold there as scrap metal.\n\nIn March 1939, towards the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Spanish Republican Navy]] Commander [[Miguel Buiza Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios|Miguel Buiza]] ordered the evacuation of the bulk of the Republican fleet. Three cruisers, eight destroyers and two submarines left [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] harbor and reached Bizerte, where the French authorities impounded them.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= Hugh Thomas (writer) |last= Thomas |first= Hugh |title= The Spanish Civil War\n| publisher = [[Penguin Books]] |year= 2001 |location= London |page= 877}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army|Italian armies]] occupied Bizerte until [[Tunisian Campaign|Allied troops defeated them]] on 7 May 1943. During the fighting between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and the German Army, many of the city's inhabitants fled to the countryside or to [[Tunis]]. The city suffered significant damage during the battle.<ref>{{cite web\n |url= http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/bizerte/bizerte-fm.htm\n |title= To Bizerte With The Ii Corps\n |publisher= History.army.mil\n |date= \n |accessdate= 2012-08-04\n |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120726133335/http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/bizerte/bizerte-fm.htm\n |archive-date= 2012-07-26\n |url-status= dead\n }}</ref>\n[[File:Vue a\u00e9rienne de Bizerte - 1959.jpg|thumb|right|180px| Aerial view of Bizerte in 1959]]\nDue to Bizerte's strategic location on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[French Fourth Republic|France]] retained control of the city and her naval base after Tunisian independence in 1956. \nIn 1961 Tunisian forces [[Bizerte crisis|blockaded]] the area of Bizerte and demanded French withdrawal. The face-off turned nasty when a French helicopter took off and drew fire.   The French brought in reinforcements; when these were fired upon, France took decisive military action against the Tunisian forces. Using state-of-the-art weapons and decisive force the French took Bizerte and [[Menzel Bourguiba]].  During three days in July 1961, 700 Tunisians died (1200 wounded); the French lost 24 dead (100 wounded).{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}\n\nMeetings at the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and other international pressure moved France to agreement; the French military finally abandoned Bizerte on 15 October 1963.{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nBizerte is on a section of widened inlet and east-facing coast of the north coast of Tunisia, 15 kilometres from [[Ras ben Sakka]] (the northernmost point in Africa on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]), 20 kilometers northeast of the [[Ichkeul lake]] (a World Heritage Site), 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the archaeological site of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and 65 kilometers north of [[Tunis]].\n\nit has to the west coastal hills forming an outcrop of the [[Tell Atlas]] with well-conserved woods and vantage points.  Its associated beaches include Sidi Salem, La Grotte, Rasenjela, and Al Rimel.  It is on a section of Mediterranean climate coastline, close to [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]], as opposed to coasts in the south of the country which have a year-round dry desert climate.\n\nThe city is centered on the north shore of the canal of Bizerte linking the Mediterranean Sea to a tidal lake, the [[Lac de Bizerte]] which is larger than all parts of the town combined, to the immediate south.  Built-up areas are in three directions:\n*South-west along the widening canal with jetties at Pecherie and Jarrouba, the latter associated with [[Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base]] adjoining the opening of the lake and military/rescue heliport.  \n*North are Sidi Salam and Corniche. They are within meters of the coast and on coast-facing slopes of the Ain Berda, a range of hills toward Cap Blanc, a small headland in the Ain Damou Plage natural conservation area. \n*Zarzouna, [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]] are on the south shore of the canal, formed by the locality of Zarzouna and the towns of [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]], by a moveable bridge and both Menzels face the lake itself.  The rest of the [[isthmus]] on which they stand is the gently rising Foret de Remel, reaching a high point east of its forest area at [[Cap Zebib]].\n\n===Transport===\nThe bridge leads to [[A4 motorway (Tunisia)|the motorway A4]] leading to [[Tunis\u2013Carthage International Airport]] and the capital. On the town side the P11 passes semi-rural Louata, hugs Ichkeul Lake and branches into a western route, the P7, leading directly to [[Tabarka]] on the coast next to the Algerian border.  The P11 leads south-west to [[B\u00e9ja]], a governorate center, in the foothills of the [[Tell Atlas]], forks into several roads at [[Bou Salem]], a small town in a broad fertile plain, and climbs to Firnanah passing two high-altitude lakes and also approaching the north-west border with Algeria.\n\n===Climate===\nBizerte enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer mediterranean]] climate, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The Mediterranean Sea breeze makes summers cooler but more humid.<ref name=\"Climate\u2013Data.Eu\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=tsxx0001&lang=en |title=Climate Bizerte

Combs was concerned that the video, which featured a shot of Nas and Combs being crucified, was blasphemous. He asked for his scenes on the cross to be pulled, but after it aired unedited on MTV on April 15, Combs visited Stoute's offices and injured Stoute.

After Whitfield presented the demo tapes, [[Gladys Knight]], [[Merald \"Bubba\" Knight|Bubba Knight]], [[William Guest (singer)|William Guest]], and [[Edward Patten]] worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement. To make the song suitable for Gladys, the first line of the second verse (''\"I know a man ain't supposed to cry/But these tears I can't hold inside\"'') was altered to (''\"Take a good look at these tears in my eyes/Baby, these tears I can't hold inside\"''). After much talk, Gordy reluctantly allowed the Pips' version to be a single on September 28, 1967, on Motown's Soul label.\n\n==Releases==\nThe Gladys Knight & the Pips version released on September 28, 1967, was on Motown's Soul label, with \"It\u2019s Time to Go Now\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Motown put little support behind it and the Pips relied on connections with DJs across the United States to get the record played. The Pips' version of \"Grapevine\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart on November 25, 1967, and stayed there for six weeks, making it the group's second R&B number one after 1961's \"Every Beat of My Heart\". It reached two on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart<ref>{{cite book|title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20132004 |author= [[Joel Whitburn]] |year= 2004 |publisher= Record Research |page=330}}</ref> the same month, with [[the Monkees]]' \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" holding top spot. It was Motown's best-selling single to that point. The song was later placed on the Gladys Knight & the Pips album ''[[Everybody Needs Love (Gladys Knight & the Pips album)|Everybody Needs Love]]''.\n\nWhitfield wanted Gordy to release Gaye's \"Grapevine\" as a single, but Gordy did not want to release another version after the Pips had already made a hit out of it.<ref name=Posner/> In September 1968, Whitfield added \"Grapevine\" to Gaye's new album ''[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine (album)|In the Groove]]''.<ref name=Posner/> On release \"Grapevine\" became a radio hit and, according to Gordy himself, \"The DJs played it so much off the album that we had to release it as a single\".<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eg0dpgvfVqEC&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= To Be Loved: The Music, the Magic, the Memories of Motown |author= [[Berry Gordy]] |page= 275 |publisher= [[Grand Central Pub.]] |date=  December 1, 1995 |accessdate= September 24, 2012}}</ref> So Gaye's version was released as a single on October 30, 1968. Gaye's \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" eventually outsold the Pips', and until [[The Jackson 5]]'s \"[[I'll Be There (Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]\" 20 months later, was the biggest hit single of all time on the Motown label. It stayed at the top of the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Singles]] chart<ref name=\"unt\">{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19831/m1/|title=Show 50 - The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit. &#91;Part 6&#93; :  UNT Digital Library|publisher=digital.library.unt.edu|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> for seven weeks, from December 14, 1968, to January 25, 1969. Gaye's \"Grapevine\" also held number one on the R&B chart during the same seven weeks,<ref>{{cite book|title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20132004 |author= [[Joel Whitburn]] |year= 2004 |publisher= Record Research |page= 225}}</ref> and stayed at number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks starting on March 26, 1969. The label was pleased with the success, although Gaye, depressed because of issues such as the illness of singing partner [[Tammi Terrell]] (which would kill her less than a year later), was quoted as saying that his success \"didn't seem real\" and that he \"didn't deserve it\".<ref name=Posner/>\n\nDue to the song's success, ''In the Groove'' was re-issued as ''I Heard It Through the Grapevine'' and peaked at number two on the R&B album chart and number sixty-three on the album chart, which was at the time Marvin's highest-charted solo studio effort to date. Because of the success of both versions, \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" was the first and last number one on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart in 1968: the Pips version was the first week of January, the Gaye version the last week of December. Gladys Knight was not pleased that Gaye's version usurped her own, and claimed that Gaye's version was recorded over an instrumental track Whitfield had prepared for a Pips song, an allegation Gaye denied.<ref>{{cite interview  |work= BBC Radio 2 |author= Marvin Gaye |interviewer= [[Paul Gambaccini]]|title=1976 interview with Marvin Gaye |year= 1976 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/ihearditthroughthegrapevine.shtml |accessdate= September 24, 2012}}</ref> In 1985, one year following Gaye's death, the song was re-released in the UK reaching number eight thanks to a [[Levi's]] commercial (starring [[Nick Kamen]]).<ref name=Robinson/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Gaye recording has become an acclaimed soul classic.

After hearing [[Aretha Franklin]]'s version of \"[[Respect (song)|Respect]]\", Whitfield rearranged \"Grapevine\" to include some of the [[funk]] elements of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]]. According to [[David Ritz]], Whitfield set to record a song that would \"out-funk\" Aretha. After Whitfield presented the demo tapes, [[Gladys Knight]], [[Merald \"Bubba\" Knight|Bubba Knight]], [[William Guest (singer)|William Guest]], and [[Edward Patten]] worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement. To make the song suitable for Gladys, the first line of the second verse (''\"I know a man ain't supposed to cry/But these tears I can't hold inside\"'') was altered to (''\"Take a good look at these tears in my eyes/Baby, these tears I can't hold inside\"''). After much talk, Gordy reluctantly allowed the Pips' version to be a single on September 28, 1967, on Motown's Soul label.\n\n==Releases==\nThe Gladys Knight & the Pips version released on September 28, 1967, was on Motown's Soul label, with \"It\u2019s Time to Go Now\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Motown put little support behind it and the Pips relied on connections with DJs across the United States to get the record played. The Pips' version of \"Grapevine\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart on November 25, 1967, and stayed there for six weeks, making it the group's second R&B number one after 1961's \"Every Beat of My Heart\". It reached two on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart<ref>{{cite book|title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20132004 |author= [[Joel Whitburn]] |year= 2004 |publisher= Record Research |page=330}}</ref> the same month, with [[the Monkees]]' \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" holding top spot. It was Motown's best-selling single to that point. The song was later placed on the Gladys Knight & the Pips album ''[[Everybody Needs Love (Gladys Knight & the Pips album)|Everybody Needs Love]]''.\n\nWhitfield wanted Gordy to release Gaye's \"Grapevine\" as a single, but Gordy did not want to release another version after the Pips had already made a hit out of it.<ref name=Posner/> In September 1968, Whitfield added \"Grapevine\" to Gaye's new album ''[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine (album)|In the Groove]]''.<ref name=Posner/> On release \"Grapevine\" became a radio hit and, according to Gordy himself, \"The DJs played it so much off the album that we had to release it as a single\".<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eg0dpgvfVqEC&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= To Be Loved: The Music, the Magic, the Memories of Motown |author= [[Berry Gordy]] |page= 275 |publisher= [[Grand Central Pub.]] |date=  December 1, 1995 |accessdate= September 24, 2012}}</ref> So Gaye's version was released as a single on October 30, 1968.

Because of the success of both versions, \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" was the first and last number one on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart in 1968: the Pips version was the first week of January, the Gaye version the last week of December.

From December 30, 1845 to January 2, 1846 he served as interim [[president of Mexico]]. He was the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|President of the Chamber of Deputies]] in 1843.<ref name=\"senado.gob.mx\">{{cite book |title=Enciclopedia Pol\u00edtica de M\u00e9xico 9 Tomo V. |publisher=Senado de la Rep\u00fablica - Instituto Belisario Dom\u00ednguez |date=2010 |url= http://www.senado.gob.mx/BMO/pdfs/enciclopedia/NUMERO_9.pdf}}</ref>\n\nValencia joined the Spanish colonial army before Mexican independence, but transferred his allegiance to the Mexican army in 1821. He made friends in the military and government, becoming a power in Mexican politics. He forged an uneasy alliance with [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], a powerful figure repeatedly in and out of the presidency during this period.\n\n==The ''Plan de la Ciudadela'', 1841==\nIn 1840 and 1841 there were several related rebellions against [[Anastasio Bustamante]], then in his third period as president of Mexico. Bustamante was an adherent of the centralist party. On July 15, 1840, soldiers led by rebellious General [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]] took the presidential palace and captured President Bustamante, later releasing him. The chief of the general staff, General Gabriel Valencia, helped subdue the revolt.<sup>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819114009/http://www.archontology.org/nations/mex/mex2/bustamante1.php]</sup>\n\nShortly thereafter, [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga]] rose against Bustamante in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Juan \u00c1lvarez|Juan N. \u00c1lvarez]] in the south, and L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna in [[Perote, Veracruz]]. This time, on September 4, 1841, Valencia joined the rebellion by publishing the ''Plan de la Ciudadela''.\n\nThe situation was now serious for Bustamante, himself a general. He took the field to fight the rebels, but was defeated. Bustamante went into exile in Europe for a second time (in Italy). The generals arrayed against him then reached a political agreement proclaimed as the ''Plan de Tacubaya''. This plan proclaimed the presidency vacant and named a provisional president to call elections for a constituent congress. This provisional president was, once again, L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. This was his sixth term as president.\n\n==Overthrow of President Herrera, 1845==\nAfter several other changes in the office of president (including two more intervals by Santa Anna), [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] became interim president on December 17, 1844.

Two days before, General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga again revolted, in opposition to Herrera.\n\nIn December 1845 Herrera announced he was setting out at the head of an expedition to repel North American invaders, who had reached [[Saltillo]]. General Paredes used this opportunity to seize power. On December 30, 1845, General Valencia, now in charge of the garrison of Mexico City, announced his support for Paredes. Out of options, Herrera turned power over to Valencia.\n\n==As interim president of Mexico==\nBy operation of law, Gabriel Valencia, as chairman of the Governing Council is who should assume the presidency following the resignation of President Jose Joaquin de Herrera. This was a temporary appointment, meant only to serve the transfer of power. A junta, led by the archbishop of Mexico City, Manuel Posada, was convoked. On January 2, 1846 this junta elected General Paredes interim president.

From December 30, 1845 to January 2, 1846 he served as interim [[president of Mexico]]. He was the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|President of the Chamber of Deputies]] in 1843.<ref name=\"senado.gob.mx\">{{cite book |title=Enciclopedia Pol\u00edtica de M\u00e9xico 9 Tomo V. |publisher=Senado de la Rep\u00fablica - Instituto Belisario Dom\u00ednguez |date=2010 |url= http://www.senado.gob.mx/BMO/pdfs/enciclopedia/NUMERO_9.pdf}}</ref>\n\nValencia joined the Spanish colonial army before Mexican independence, but transferred his allegiance to the Mexican army in 1821. He made friends in the military and government, becoming a power in Mexican politics. He forged an uneasy alliance with [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], a powerful figure repeatedly in and out of the presidency during this period.\n\n==The ''Plan de la Ciudadela'', 1841==\nIn 1840 and 1841 there were several related rebellions against [[Anastasio Bustamante]], then in his third period as president of Mexico. Bustamante was an adherent of the centralist party. On July 15, 1840, soldiers led by rebellious General [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]] took the presidential palace and captured President Bustamante, later releasing him. The chief of the general staff, General Gabriel Valencia, helped subdue the revolt.<sup>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819114009/http://www.archontology.org/nations/mex/mex2/bustamante1.php]</sup>\n\nShortly thereafter, [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga]] rose against Bustamante in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Juan \u00c1lvarez|Juan N. \u00c1lvarez]] in the south, and L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna in [[Perote, Veracruz]]. This time, on September 4, 1841, Valencia joined the rebellion by publishing the ''Plan de la Ciudadela''.\n\nThe situation was now serious for Bustamante, himself a general. He took the field to fight the rebels, but was defeated. Bustamante went into exile in Europe for a second time (in Italy). The generals arrayed against him then reached a political agreement proclaimed as the ''Plan de Tacubaya''. This plan proclaimed the presidency vacant and named a provisional president to call elections for a constituent congress. This provisional president was, once again, L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. This was his sixth term as president.\n\n==Overthrow of President Herrera, 1845==\nAfter several other changes in the office of president (including two more intervals by Santa Anna), [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] became interim president on December 17, 1844. He became constitutional president on September 16, 1845. Two days before, General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga again revolted, in opposition to Herrera.\n\nIn December 1845 Herrera announced he was setting out at the head of an expedition to repel North American invaders, who had reached [[Saltillo]]. General Paredes used this opportunity to seize power. On December 30, 1845, General Valencia, now in charge of the garrison of Mexico City, announced his support for Paredes. Out of options, Herrera turned power over to Valencia.\n\n==As interim president of Mexico==\nBy operation of law, Gabriel Valencia, as chairman of the Governing Council is who should assume the presidency following the resignation of President Jose Joaquin de Herrera. This was a temporary appointment, meant only to serve the transfer of power. A junta, led by the archbishop of Mexico City, Manuel Posada, was convoked. On January 2, 1846 this junta elected General Paredes interim president.

The concept and general plot for the show was seen as a parody of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (which also aired on ABC).<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/62/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=62-63}}</ref> The show also borrowed heavily from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', among others. \n\nCaptain Caveman's powers include super-strength, a variety of useful objects hidden inside his hair, and a club that allows him to fly and from which pop out different tools he uses to fight crime. His trademark is his battle cry of \"Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAAAAANNNN!\" Captain Caveman's voice was provided by [[Mel Blanc]].\n\nA total of forty 11-minute episodes ran for three seasons from 1977 to 1980: sixteen episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in 1977, eight episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics|Scooby's All-Stars]]'' in 1978 and sixteen episodes were produced in 1980 when ''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' were given their own half-hour show which combined new episodes and reruns from 1977\u201379. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels also participated in [[Sport|sporting competitions]] as part of \"[[Laff-A-Lympics#The Scooby Doobies|The Scooby Doobies]]\" team on the half-hour ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' segment. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of the Hanna-Barbera last productions to do so.\n\n==Characters==\n===Captain Caveman===\nCaptain Caveman, or \"Cavey\" for short (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]), is the protagonist of the show, billed as \"the world's first superhero.\" He is a [[caveman]] who is millennia old (his exact age is never disclosed, although in an episode he is carded by a doorman who is unsure Cavey is old enough to let in, to which Captain Caveman responds, \"I'll be 2 million next month.\") He can pull various objects from his long body hair that covers his body except for his nose, arms, and legs. He can also fly, but his flying power always seems to fail him at the worst possible moment. Sometimes he would attribute this mishap to an energy shortage (\"Uh oh! Bad time for energy crisis.\" ''CRASH!''), which was a reference to the [[1973 oil crisis#Price controls and rationing|gasoline rationing shortages]] of the late 1970s. He speaks in stereotypical \"caveman-talk\", replacing [[subject pronoun]]s with their [[object pronoun|object]] equivalents and dropping [[article (grammar)|articles]] such as \"the\" (for example, \"Me know where bad guys are hiding.\"), and often mumbles the nonsense phrase \"unga bunga\". He also has a bad habit of occasionally eating large non-food objects in one gulp (i.e. [[bicycle]]s, [[Television|TV]] sets, safes, table lamps), and the Teen Angels occasionally have to stop him from eating potential clues that will help them to solve the mystery.\n\n===Dee Dee Sykes===\nDee Dee Sykes (voiced by [[Vernee Watson-Johnson|Vernee Watson]]) is the brains of the Teen Angels and acts as their unofficial leader. Dee Dee and the rest of the Teen Angels found the frozen Captain Caveman and defrosted him. She wears her hair in an [[afro]] and usually wears a red turtleneck sweater with a blue skirt and red knee high boots. Both her dress style and her knack for solving mysteries make her similar to [[Velma Dinkley]] of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' fame, while she also bears a resemblance to Valerie from ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]''. She is misidentified as Brenda in the [[opening credits]].\n\n===Brenda Chance===\nBrenda Chance (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) is a nervous brunette who is always scared of the demons, monsters and phantoms that she encounters and always tries to back out of a scary mystery, but always ends up getting captured or the short end of the stick. She wears a purple striped tank top and a pair of hot pink flared trousers with a white belt. She also acts as Dee Dee's sergeant of the Teen Angels. She is misidentified as Dee Dee in the opening credits.\n\n===Taffy Dare===\nTaffy Dare (voiced by Laurel Page) is the blonde member of the group, renowned for her cry of \"Zowie!\" whenever she comes up with a plan (or \"Another Daffy Taffy Plan\" as Brenda and Cavey would call it) to catch the culprits, has a distinct, flirtatious, childlike persona and a [[New York City English|New York-influenced]]/Southern [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. In spite of her usually zany plans and ditziness, Taffy is actually very capable and clever. She has the ability to seduce Caveman into acting as bait for her plans to capture the culprit. She wears a green dress with matching shoes. She also acts as Dee Dee's second-in-command of the Teen Angels. It is revealed that Captain Caveman has a crush on her and vice versa.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' was broadcast in these following formats on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:\n\n* '''''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics''''' (September 10, 1977 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Scooby's All-Stars''''' (September 9, 1978 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels''''' (March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday)\n\nBroadcast schedules (all [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]):\n\n*September 10, 1977 \u2013 July 1978, ABC Saturday 9:00-11:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*July 1978 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday 9:30-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*September 9, 1978 \u2013 November 1978, ABC Saturday 10:00-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*November 1978 \u2013 May 1979, ABC Saturday 8:00-9:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*May 1979 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday 8:30-10:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday 11:30-12:00 noon\n\n==Opening and closing credits==\nThe opening credits for each episode consisted of voice-over narration by [[Gary Owens]]:\n<blockquote>''Set free by the Teen Angels from his prehistoric block of glacier ice, comes the world's first superhero, Captain Caveman!

Captain Caveman worked at ''The Daily Granite'' newspaper with [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]. His \"secret identity\" was Chester, the office boy. To disguise himself as Chester, Captain Caveman wore a pair of glasses and a tie. Despite the simplicity of his disguise, he required a coat rack and an elaborate transformation sequence to become Captain Caveman.\n\n===The Flintstone Kids (1986\u201388)===\nIn 1986, Captain Caveman appeared in a backup segment of ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' called ''Captain Caveman and Son'' with his son, Cavey Jr. (voiced by [[Charlie Adler|Charles Adler]]). In this case he appeared on a show-within-a-show that the younger versions of Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty enjoyed watching; the Captain's mumbled \"unga bunga\" became a catchphrase that the kids would shout before watching each \"episode\" of the show.  The show would involve a lesson the Flintstone kids were trying to learn in the prologue.  The whole \"secret identity\" idea was also ignored or forgotten.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* A very similar pair of characters, the Slag Brothers, made an appearance in the earlier Hanna-Barbera series ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. They served as the inspiration for Captain Caveman.\n\n* Captain Caveman later appeared in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode \"The Evolutionary War\" with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]] and Cavey Jr. voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. His son Cavey Jr. was teased at school because his existence proved the [[Creation and evolution in public education|Theory of Evolution]].\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Ban on the Fun\", voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]. In a segment that parodies ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in the style of the [[Munich massacre]], Captain Caveman and [[Shaggy Rogers]] confront [[Daisy Mayhem]] and Captain Caveman blows her up with the wrong club.\n\n* Characters that look very similar to Captain Caveman appear as enemies in the 8-bit computer game ''[[Renegade III: The Final Chapter]]''.\n\n* In the [[Halloween]] 2008 episode of ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', Homsar is dressed up in a Captain Caveman costume. He then exclaims \"Daaa!! AaAah'm the Captain Caveman of the graveyard train!\"\n\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode named \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\", Peter expresses how much he misses Captain Caveman, and vows that he will see him again once he gets off the island.\n\n* Captain Caveman also makes a cameo appearance in an episode of ''[[Adventure Time]]'' where he is seen as a stuffed doll in Finn's room.\n\n* Captain Caveman appears in the ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"Mystery Solvers Club State Finals,\" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He and the Teen Angels appear alongside other Hanna-Barbera detective teams in a fever dream of Scooby-Doo's. When the teenage sleuths are kidnapped by Lord Infernacus, it is up to their sidekicks to save them.\n\n* In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon]]'', there is a person who's cosplaying as Captain Caveman in a Hanna-Barbera convention.\n\n* Captain Caveman is seen briefly in the background in ''[[Imaginationland: The Movie|South Park - Imaginationland: The Movie]]'' (2008). He is amongst a plethora of other imaginary and cartoon characters who are being attacked by terrorists.\n\n* Captain Caveman will appear in ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BqLQA2SlGTx/|title=I tell stories on Instagram: \u201cRecording Captain Caveman voice for Warner Brothers new show\u201d Yabba Dabba Dinosaurs.\u201d . . . . #voiceacting #voiceactor #actor #vo #acting\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram}}</ref>\n\n* Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels will appear in ''[[Jellystone!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/hbo-max-looney-tunes-jellystone-the-fungies-tig-n-seek-kids-family-series-1202771895/|title=HBO Max Sets New Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Robert Zemeckis Hybrid Series \u2018Tooned Out\u2019, More For Kids & Family Slate|first1=Patrick|last1=Hipes|first2=Patrick|last2=Hipes|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Captain Caveman and Dee Dee Sykes will appear in the upcoming theatrical animated ''Scooby-Doo'' film ''[[Scoob!]]'' with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Tracy Morgan]] and Dee Dee Sykes voiced by [[Kiersey Clemons]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/scooby-doo-movie-star-will-forte-gina-rodriguez-tracy-morgan-1177354|title=Will Forte, Gina Rodriguez and Tracy Morgan to Star in Animated Scooby-Doo Movie (Exclusive)|first=Borys|last=Kit|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 1, 2019|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/scooby-doo-movie-scoob-ken-jeong-kiersey-clemons-join-cast-1202593116/|title=Ken Jeong & Kiersey Clemons Toon Up For Warner Bros.\u2019 \u2018Scoob\u2019|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|date=2019-04-10|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> It is currently unknown if Brenda and Taffy will also appear.\n\n==Comic books==\n* Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels appeared in all 13 issues of ''Laff-A-Lympics'' ([[Marvel Comics]], 1978\u201379) as members of the Scooby Doobies.\n* Cavey and the Angels appeared in the first issue of the short-lived ''Hanna-Barbera TV Stars'' (Marvel, August 1978).<ref name=TVS1>{{comicbookdb|issue|103865|TV Stars #1}}</ref>\n* The Captain and the Angels team up with Mystery, Inc. in ''Scooby-Doo'' #9 (Marvel, February 1979).<ref name=SD9>{{comicbookdb|issue|94377|Scooby-Doo #9}}</ref>\n* In 2018, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels appeared in a backup story in the [[DC Comics|DC]] comic ''Aquaman/ Jabberjaw Special'' #1;<ref name=AJ1>{{comicbookdb|issue|442713|Aquaman/Jabberjaw Special #1}}</ref> in this story, the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] transports the powerful hominid from prehistoric times to the present, to settle an argument with [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] about whether heroism is strictly a trait of modern man or also of early man.\n\n==Production credits==\n* Executive Producers: [[Joseph Barbera]] and [[William Hanna]]\n* Director: [[Charles August Nichols|Charles A.

The series aired during the network's [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning schedule]] from September 10, 1977 to June 21, 1980.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=108-109 }}</ref> All 40 episodes are available on the [[Boomerang (TV network)]] subscription app.\n\n==Summary==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' centers on the mystery-solving adventures of the Teen Angels\u2014'''Brenda''', '''Dee Dee''' and '''Taffy'''\u2014and their friend '''Captain Caveman''' (or Cavey for short), a prehistoric caveman whom the girls discovered and thawed from a block of ice. The concept and general plot for the show was seen as a parody of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (which also aired on ABC).<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/62/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=62-63}}</ref> The show also borrowed heavily from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', among others. \n\nCaptain Caveman's powers include super-strength, a variety of useful objects hidden inside his hair, and a club that allows him to fly and from which pop out different tools he uses to fight crime. His trademark is his battle cry of \"Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAAAAANNNN!\" Captain Caveman's voice was provided by [[Mel Blanc]].\n\nA total of forty 11-minute episodes ran for three seasons from 1977 to 1980: sixteen episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in 1977, eight episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics|Scooby's All-Stars]]'' in 1978 and sixteen episodes were produced in 1980 when ''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' were given their own half-hour show which combined new episodes and reruns from 1977\u201379. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels also participated in [[Sport|sporting competitions]] as part of \"[[Laff-A-Lympics#The Scooby Doobies|The Scooby Doobies]]\" team on the half-hour ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' segment. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of the Hanna-Barbera last productions to do so.\n\n==Characters==\n===Captain Caveman===\nCaptain Caveman, or \"Cavey\" for short (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]), is the protagonist of the show, billed as \"the world's first superhero.\" He is a [[caveman]] who is millennia old (his exact age is never disclosed, although in an episode he is carded by a doorman who is unsure Cavey is old enough to let in, to which Captain Caveman responds, \"I'll be 2 million next month.\") He can pull various objects from his long body hair that covers his body except for his nose, arms, and legs. He can also fly, but his flying power always seems to fail him at the worst possible moment. Sometimes he would attribute this mishap to an energy shortage (\"Uh oh! Bad time for energy crisis.\" ''CRASH!''), which was a reference to the [[1973 oil crisis#Price controls and rationing|gasoline rationing shortages]] of the late 1970s. He speaks in stereotypical \"caveman-talk\", replacing [[subject pronoun]]s with their [[object pronoun|object]] equivalents and dropping [[article (grammar)|articles]] such as \"the\" (for example, \"Me know where bad guys are hiding.\"), and often mumbles the nonsense phrase \"unga bunga\". He also has a bad habit of occasionally eating large non-food objects in one gulp (i.e. [[bicycle]]s, [[Television|TV]] sets, safes, table lamps), and the Teen Angels occasionally have to stop him from eating potential clues that will help them to solve the mystery.\n\n===Dee Dee Sykes===\nDee Dee Sykes (voiced by [[Vernee Watson-Johnson|Vernee Watson]]) is the brains of the Teen Angels and acts as their unofficial leader. Dee Dee and the rest of the Teen Angels found the frozen Captain Caveman and defrosted him. She wears her hair in an [[afro]] and usually wears a red turtleneck sweater with a blue skirt and red knee high boots. Both her dress style and her knack for solving mysteries make her similar to [[Velma Dinkley]] of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' fame, while she also bears a resemblance to Valerie from ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]''. She is misidentified as Brenda in the [[opening credits]].\n\n===Brenda Chance===\nBrenda Chance (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) is a nervous brunette who is always scared of the demons, monsters and phantoms that she encounters and always tries to back out of a scary mystery, but always ends up getting captured or the short end of the stick. She wears a purple striped tank top and a pair of hot pink flared trousers with a white belt. She also acts as Dee Dee's sergeant of the Teen Angels. She is misidentified as Dee Dee in the opening credits.\n\n===Taffy Dare===\nTaffy Dare (voiced by Laurel Page) is the blonde member of the group, renowned for her cry of \"Zowie!\" whenever she comes up with a plan (or \"Another Daffy Taffy Plan\" as Brenda and Cavey would call it) to catch the culprits, has a distinct, flirtatious, childlike persona and a [[New York City English|New York-influenced]]/Southern [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. In spite of her usually zany plans and ditziness, Taffy is actually very capable and clever. She has the ability to seduce Caveman into acting as bait for her plans to capture the culprit. She wears a green dress with matching shoes. She also acts as Dee Dee's second-in-command of the Teen Angels. It is revealed that Captain Caveman has a crush on her and vice versa.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' was broadcast in these following formats on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:\n\n* '''''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics''''' (September 10, 1977 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Scooby's All-Stars''''' (September 9, 1978 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels''''' (March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday)\n\nBroadcast schedules (all [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]):\n\n*September 10, 1977 \u2013 July 1978, ABC Saturday 9:00-11:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*July 1978 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday 9:30-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*September 9, 1978 \u2013 November 1978, ABC Saturday 10:00-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*November 1978 \u2013 May 1979, ABC Saturday 8:00-9:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*May 1979 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday 8:30-10:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday 11:30-12:00 noon\n\n==Opening and closing credits==\nThe opening credits for each episode consisted of voice-over narration by [[Gary Owens]]:\n<blockquote>''Set free by the Teen Angels from his prehistoric block of glacier ice, comes the world's first superhero, Captain Caveman! Now the constant companion to the Teen Angels\u2014Brenda, Dee Dee and Taffy\u2014in their hilarious, and sometimes scary mystery missions.

Captain Caveman worked at ''The Daily Granite'' newspaper with [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]. His \"secret identity\" was Chester, the office boy. To disguise himself as Chester, Captain Caveman wore a pair of glasses and a tie. Despite the simplicity of his disguise, he required a coat rack and an elaborate transformation sequence to become Captain Caveman.\n\n===The Flintstone Kids (1986\u201388)===\nIn 1986, Captain Caveman appeared in a backup segment of ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' called ''Captain Caveman and Son'' with his son, Cavey Jr. (voiced by [[Charlie Adler|Charles Adler]]). In this case he appeared on a show-within-a-show that the younger versions of Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty enjoyed watching; the Captain's mumbled \"unga bunga\" became a catchphrase that the kids would shout before watching each \"episode\" of the show.  The show would involve a lesson the Flintstone kids were trying to learn in the prologue.  The whole \"secret identity\" idea was also ignored or forgotten.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* A very similar pair of characters, the Slag Brothers, made an appearance in the earlier Hanna-Barbera series ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. They served as the inspiration for Captain Caveman.\n\n* Captain Caveman later appeared in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode \"The Evolutionary War\" with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]] and Cavey Jr. voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. His son Cavey Jr. was teased at school because his existence proved the [[Creation and evolution in public education|Theory of Evolution]].\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Ban on the Fun\", voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]. In a segment that parodies ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in the style of the [[Munich massacre]], Captain Caveman and [[Shaggy Rogers]] confront [[Daisy Mayhem]] and Captain Caveman blows her up with the wrong club.\n\n* Characters that look very similar to Captain Caveman appear as enemies in the 8-bit computer game ''[[Renegade III: The Final Chapter]]''.\n\n* In the [[Halloween]] 2008 episode of ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', Homsar is dressed up in a Captain Caveman costume. He then exclaims \"Daaa!! AaAah'm the Captain Caveman of the graveyard train!\"\n\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode named \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\", Peter expresses how much he misses Captain Caveman, and vows that he will see him again once he gets off the island.\n\n* Captain Caveman also makes a cameo appearance in an episode of ''[[Adventure Time]]'' where he is seen as a stuffed doll in Finn's room.\n\n* Captain Caveman appears in the ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"Mystery Solvers Club State Finals,\" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He and the Teen Angels appear alongside other Hanna-Barbera detective teams in a fever dream of Scooby-Doo's. When the teenage sleuths are kidnapped by Lord Infernacus, it is up to their sidekicks to save them.\n\n* In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon]]'', there is a person who's cosplaying as Captain Caveman in a Hanna-Barbera convention.\n\n* Captain Caveman is seen briefly in the background in ''[[Imaginationland: The Movie|South Park - Imaginationland: The Movie]]'' (2008). He is amongst a plethora of other imaginary and cartoon characters who are being attacked by terrorists.\n\n* Captain Caveman will appear in ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BqLQA2SlGTx/|title=I tell stories on Instagram: \u201cRecording Captain Caveman voice for Warner Brothers new show\u201d Yabba Dabba Dinosaurs.\u201d . . . . #voiceacting #voiceactor #actor #vo #acting\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram}}</ref>\n\n* Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels will appear in ''[[Jellystone!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/hbo-max-looney-tunes-jellystone-the-fungies-tig-n-seek-kids-family-series-1202771895/|title=HBO Max Sets New Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Robert Zemeckis Hybrid Series \u2018Tooned Out\u2019, More For Kids & Family Slate|first1=Patrick|last1=Hipes|first2=Patrick|last2=Hipes|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Captain Caveman and Dee Dee Sykes will appear in the upcoming theatrical animated ''Scooby-Doo'' film ''[[Scoob!]]'' with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Tracy Morgan]] and Dee Dee Sykes voiced by [[Kiersey Clemons]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/scooby-doo-movie-star-will-forte-gina-rodriguez-tracy-morgan-1177354|title=Will Forte, Gina Rodriguez and Tracy Morgan to Star in Animated Scooby-Doo Movie (Exclusive)|first=Borys|last=Kit|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 1, 2019|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/scooby-doo-movie-scoob-ken-jeong-kiersey-clemons-join-cast-1202593116/|title=Ken Jeong & Kiersey Clemons Toon Up For Warner Bros.\u2019 \u2018Scoob\u2019|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|date=2019-04-10|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> It is currently unknown if Brenda and Taffy will also appear.\n\n==Comic books==\n* Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels appeared in all 13 issues of ''Laff-A-Lympics'' ([[Marvel Comics]], 1978\u201379) as members of the Scooby Doobies.\n* Cavey and the Angels appeared in the first issue of the short-lived ''Hanna-Barbera TV Stars'' (Marvel, August 1978).<ref name=TVS1>{{comicbookdb|issue|103865|TV Stars #1}}</ref>\n* The Captain and the Angels team up with Mystery, Inc. in ''Scooby-Doo'' #9 (Marvel, February 1979).<ref name=SD9>{{comicbookdb|issue|94377|Scooby-Doo #9}}</ref>\n* In 2018, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels appeared in a backup story in the [[DC Comics|DC]] comic ''Aquaman/ Jabberjaw Special'' #1;<ref name=AJ1>{{comicbookdb|issue|442713|Aquaman/Jabberjaw Special #1}}</ref> in this story, the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] transports the powerful hominid from prehistoric times to the present, to settle an argument with [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] about whether heroism is strictly a trait of modern man or also of early man.\n\n==Production credits==\n* Executive Producers: [[Joseph Barbera]] and [[William Hanna]]\n* Director: [[Charles August Nichols|Charles A.

His father, Nishikanta Basu, was a doctor settled in Kolkata who hailed from the village of Barudi in [[Narayanganj District]], East Bengal (now in [[Bangladesh]]), while his mother Hemalata Basu was a housewife.<ref name=\"baradi\">{{Cite book|title=Jatadur Mone Pare: Rajnaitik Atmakathan|first=Jyoti|last=Basu|publisher=[[National Book Agency]] |location=Calcutta}}</ref> Basu grew up in a large Indian-style [[Hindu joint family|joint family]], consisting of his parents, siblings, paternal uncles, their wives and children. The family, who had lived in a rented house in Kolkata in addition to retaining ancestral properties in East Bengal, purchased a spacious mansion at 55-A, Hindustan road in 1920, and this is where Basu grew up.\n\nBasu's schooling started at [[Loreto Schools, Kolkata|Loreto School]] at [[Dharmatala]] in [[Kolkata]] in 1920, and he was moved in 1925 to [[St. Xavier's Collegiate School|St. Xavier's School]]. While admitting him to school, Basu's father shortened his name from Jyotirindra Basu to Jyoti Basu, and the shortened name stuck for life. After completing school, Basu took an undergraduate degree in [[English major|English literature honours]] from [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> After completing his undergraduate studies, Basu left for England to study law in 1935.\n\nIn England, he was introduced to politics and became greatly influenced by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].<ref name=profile/> He attended lectures by [[Harold Laski]] and was also influenced by noted Communist ideologue and prolific writer [[Rajani Palme Dutt]], a fellow [[Bengali people|Bengali]].<ref name=profile>{{citation |title=Jyoti Basu: A profile |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jyoti-basu-a-profile/ |work=[[The Indian Express]] |accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref> Between 1936 and 1940, Basu involved himself in various political activities, came into contact with several Indian freedom fighters including Netaji Subash Chandra Bose, Nehru, became a member of the India league, and joined the London Majlis.<ref name=profile/>\n\n==Return to India and marriage==\nBasu reached Kolkata and was reunited with his parents on January 1, 1940.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> While he was in London, his parents had selected a suitable bride for him and informed him of their choice. Like a normal Indian boy of his generation, Basu had replied that if the girl was acceptable to his parents, she was acceptable to him.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> The two sets of parents had then made arrangements for the wedding, and on Jan 20, 1940, only nineteen days after his return to India, Basu was married to Basanti Devi (n\u00e9e Ghose, fondly known as 'Chobi'), a girl of his own caste and similar family background.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> Unfortunately, Basanti died in 1942, hardly two years after the wedding, and there were no surviving children. Basu's mother, Hemalata Devi, also died a few months later, in 1942.\n\nAfter returning to India, Basu had become an active member of the Communist Party, to his father's chagrin. After Basanti's death, he deepened his involvement, virtually giving up the pretense of earning a living as a lawyer. His legal practice was mostly about providing legal services ''[[pro bono]]'' to the party and its affiliates, in particular to trade unions. He lived as always with his father and extended family (as per [[Hindu joint family|Indian custom]]) and thus had little need to earn a living. As a young barrister studying in England, he had been a prize catch for any family with a marriageable daughter, but the situation was altered now, and proposals were not plentiful. Several years passed, and Basu's father and other family members grew anxious to see him settled again. In time, they arranged for him to marry another suitable girl of their caste and background. This was Kamala, who Basu married on Dec 5, 1948.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> The marriage, which conformed in every way to Indian tradition and convention, was harmonious and lasted until their deaths more than sixty years later. On Aug 31, 1951, the couple became the parents of a daughter, born at Sishumangal Hospital in Kolkata. Tragically, the unnamed baby died only a few days later of diarrhoea and dehydration. In 1953, the couple were blessed with the birth of a son, Subhabrata Basu, fondly known as 'Chandan' by one and all.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> Chandan, who was to be the couple's only surviving child, was born while Basu was in prison for allegedly seditious activities, having been incarcerated by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress-led]] government of independent India.\n\nShortly after Chandan was born, Basu's father, Nishikant Basu, wrote a will which disinherited Basu entirely and vested all his property, a considerable fortune which included the massive mansion in Kolkata, in the name of his daughter-in-law Kamala, with provision that the property be inherited by Chandan eventually. The elderly ''[[bhadralok]]'' patrician had been aghast, even distraught, to find that his beloved son had returned from England a communist, and that he had developed over the next decade (the 1940s) into a violent revolutionary. Basu was to say later that the arrangement suited him perfectly, that indeed it had been devised in consultation with him; it ensured that Kamala was always able to feed the family and pay for her son's education, which left Basu free from the tension of having to provide for his wife and son, and enabled him to pursue his political activities.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Entry into politics===\n{{Indcom}}\nJyoti Basu's first track in politics was his effort to organise the Indian [[International student|students]] studying in United Kingdom, mostly for the cause of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Basu subsequently joined India League and London Majlis, both the organisations being communities of overseas Indian students.  Basu was later elected the General Secretary of London Majlis.<ref>{{cite news|title=London, the land that turned Basu into a Marxist|last=Roy|first=Amit|work=telegraphindia.com|location=Kolkata|date=18 January 2010|accessdate=7 June 2010|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100118/jsp/nation/story_11997615.jsp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126043345/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100118/jsp/nation/story_11997615.jsp#|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Basu was given the responsibility for arranging a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] during Nehru's visit to London in 1938. The same was done after [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] went to England. As a member of London Majlis, Basu introduced the visiting Indian political figures to the leaders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\nBasu was introduced to the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] by another communist leader and Basu's friend in England, [[Bhupesh Gupta]]. It is told Basu showed interest to join CPGB but the then Secretary General [[Harry Pollitt]] suggested that he should not do so, possibly because CPGB was then banned in India and Pollitt speculated Basu could have difficulties in returning to India as a member of CPGB.\n\nHowever Basu returned to India in 1940 and immediately contacted the Party leaders. Though he enrolled himself as a barrister in [[Calcutta High Court]], he never practised simply because he was determined to become a wholetimer of the Party.\n\nBasu became the secretary of Friends of Soviet Union and Anti-Fascist Writers' Association in Kolkata. As a member of the Party, his initial task was to maintain liaison with underground Party leaders. He was entrusted with responsibilities on the trade union front from 1944. In that year, Bengal Assam Railroad Workers' Union was formed and Basu became its first secretary. In 1944 Basu became involved in trade union activities when CPI delegated him to work amongst the railway labourers. When B.N. Railway Workers Union and B.D. Rail Road Workers Union merged, Basu became the general secretary of the union. In 1946, Basu was elected to the Bengal Provincial Assembly from the Railway Workers constituency. Ratanlal Bramhan and Rupnarayan Roy were the other two Communists who were elected. From that day on, Basu became one of the most popular and influential legislators for decades to come.\n\nBasu played a very active role in the stormy days of 1946\u201347 when Bengal witnessed the Tebhaga movement, workers strikes and even communal riots.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Basu served as the Vice-President of the [[All India Railwaymen's Federation]] until Communists were expelled from the union for attempt to organize strikes after the union had withdrawn its strike notice.<ref>{{cite book|title= Decolonization in South Asia: Meanings of Freedom in Post-independence West Bengal, 1947-52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vt95AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT172&dq=jyoti+basu+railwaymen|publisher = Routledge|year=2009|last=Bandopadhyay|first=Sekhar|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJyoti Basu was the secretary of the West Bengal Provincial Committee of the Party from 1953 to January 1961. He was elected to the Central Committee of the Party in 1951. He was a member of the Politburo from 1964 onwards. He was elected as a special invitee to PB in 19th Congress of the Party in 2008.\n\nAfter the country gained independence, he was elected to the assembly from [[Baranagar]] in 1952. He was elected to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1991 and 1996. Though an elected member, Basu was arrested several times during the 1950s and 60s and for certain periods he went underground to evade arrest by the police.\n\nIn 1962, Jyoti Basu was one amongst the 32 members of the National Council who walked out of the meeting. When the CPI(M) was formed in 1964 as a result of the ideological struggle within the Communist movement, Basu became a member of the Politburo. He was, in fact, the last surviving member of the \"Navaratnas\", the nine members of the first Politburo. The leftist section, to which the 32 National Council members belonged, organised a convention in [[Tenali]], Andhra Pradesh 7 to 11 July. It was here where the radical sections of party further showed their pro-Chinese stand. The Tenali convention was marked by the display of a large portrait of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] leader [[Mao Zedong]].<ref>Basu, Pradip.

He served as the Leader of Opposition for a long time when Dr. [[Bidhan Chandra Roy]] was the Chief Minister of West Bengal. Jyoti Basu led a number of agitations against the State Government and earned enviable popularity as a politician particularly among the students and youth. Beside organising the movements of the Railway Labourers, he led a movement by the teachers demanding a hike in salary. When the [[Communist Party of India]] split in 1964, Basu became one of the first nine members of the Politburo of the newly formed Communist Party of India (Marxist).<ref name=Nine/> In 1967 and 1969, Basu became Deputy Chief Minister of West Bengal in the United Front governments. In 1967, after the defeat of the Congress Government, Jyoti Basu was sworn-in as the Deputy Chief Minister under the Chief Ministership of [[Ajoy Mukherjee]]. In 1970, he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt at the Patna railway station. Though CPI(M) became the single largest party in the assembly elections in 1971, the party was refused the chance to form a ministry and presidents' Rule was imposed in West Bengal.\n\nThrough the 1972 elections the Congress returned to power in West Bengal and Jyoti Basu lost the elections from [[Baranagar (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Baranagar]] to [[Shiba Pada Bhattacharjee]] who used to campaign for Basu in Baranagar in earlier elections when the Communist party was united.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/shouldnt-have-contested-says-man-who-defeated-basu/ | title=Shouldn't have contested, says man who defeated Basu | publisher=[[Indian Express]] | work=Shiv Sahay Singh | date=19 January 2010 | accessdate=24 October 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305161708/http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/shouldnt-have-contested-says-man-who-defeated-basu/# | archive-date=5 March 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Basu famously declared the new assembly as \"assembly of the frauds\" and CPI(M) boycotted the assembly for the next five years.\n\n===As the Chief Minister of West Bengal===\nAfter the sweeping victory of the Left Front in 1977, Jyoti Basu became the Chief Minister of the Left Front government, a position he held continuously for a record more than 23 years, until his deputy Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took over the reins primarily due the former's deteriorating health. Under his leadership, the Left Front government focused on land reforms in the state; it instituted a ''panchayati raj system'' giving poor peasants and small farmers a say in running the panchayati institutions. The land reforms gave farmers a say on their lands, the agricultural output increased although not as much as expected initially, due to the fact that everyone was a land owner with nobody to sell/supply to, just enough means for self survival. \nWhile it was part of fulfilling his electoral agenda, it remained as the only thing worth remembering done by Basu in West Bengal, and that too is not without any critics. Although he is largely remembered as an extremely able administrator who didn't allow any riots in his state after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and in 1984 and during the demolition of babri masjid in 1992, while the whole country was on the boil, his excessive pro-people stance resulted in an economic and administrative nightmare. The socialist and populist moves garbed under state sponsored reforms gave way to occurrence of host of factors that resulted into economic nosedive of the state, increased labour militancy driving industries out of the state leaving the state high and dry on resources to thrive. Numerous reports of violence by labours across industries and factories were reported that drove industrialists out. Few prominent indrustrialists pleaded to Jyoti Basu and his administration, but were let down by the response that pinned the blame back on them; Frustrated, the indrustrialists moved out. This emigration of industries gradually led to an increase in unemployment that further became a chief cause of [[Naxal]] movement, which ended up being one of the most challenging internal security problems India still deals with.<ref>{{cite news |date=19 March 2018 |title=How communism killed Bengal's economy |url=http://www.rediff.com/business/special/how-the-communists-killed-bengals-industry/20180319.htm |location=India |agency=Indo-Asian News Service |access-date=9 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710010226/http://www.rediff.com/business/special/how-the-communists-killed-bengals-industry/20180319.htm# |archive-date=10 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \nElections were hijacked,<ref>https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/20020812-is-mastery-of-booth-capturing-technique-the-secret-of-cpims-continuance-in-power-794635-2002-08-12</ref> the CPIM workers ran rioting across anyone who opposed them or their stances, one such instance at very beginning of their rule, resulted in an infamous [[Marichjhapi incident]] {{fact|date=March 2020}} that led to death of more than 1700 immigrants from Bangladesh and destruction of properties and goods related to them.\n\nWhile the GDP of state registered marginal hike, it could feel the wholesale destruction of the state's manufacturing sector, where labour militancy, aided and abetted by the state government, took its toll.

While Patil said \"the nation has lost a veteran and eminent public figure,\" Manmohan Singh said Basu was a politician to whom he often turned for \"sagacious advice\". Basu was a leader \"who displayed his abilities as a leader of the people, an able administrator and eminent statesman\", the president said in a statement. \"In the years after he relinquished the Chief Ministry, he continued to be looked upon as an elder statesman, whose advice was sought by many political leaders in the state,\" the president added.\n\nIn a message to Jyoti Basu's son Chandan, Manmohan Singh said: \"He was a powerful regional voice in the national political scene and helped to strengthen Indian federalism... He was a man of great integrity with a deep commitment to secular values.\" He added:\"I have personally had a very long association with Basu. On many occasions in my career, I turned to him for his sagacious advice on all matters, whether they related to West Bengal or to issues of national importance\". Vice President Hamid Ansari said Basu had left behind a void that would be difficult to fill. \"His sagacity and leadership at both the state and the national level have been a source of inspiration and guidance,\" Ansari said in a statement.\n\nThe Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) that Basu led for several years expressed \"profound grief\", saying he was a Marxist who was not dogmatic. \"Jyoti Basu was a Marxist who never wavered in his convictions. He was a Marxist who was not dogmatic and continued to learn from his vast experience in charting out the course for the party,\" the CPI-M politburo said. \"There will be none like Jyoti Basu again,\" was how CPI-M general secretary Prakash Karat saluted a man he had prevented from becoming the prime minister in 1996. Karat, who influenced the CPI-M to block Basu from taking charge of the United Front government in 1996, said that the former West Bengal chief minister \"was a great leader of the CPI-M, the Left movement and India. With his passing away, an era has passed\". Communist Party of India (CPI) leader D. Raja paid glowing tributes to the Marxist patriarch, saying he could have proved to be a great prime minister. \"He (Basu) proved that the coalition of Left parties would work successfully and serve the people greatly. He could have proved to be a great prime minister also,\" Raja said.\n\nFormer [[Lok Sabha]] speaker and Communist leader [[Somnath Chatterjee]] said he had lost someone like his father. \"When things started to go bad (in Left front), he was sad. He was sad about what happened with me. I used to consult him on all matters. For the second time, I have lost somebody like my father,\" said an emotional Chatterjee.\n\nFinance Minister [[Pranab Mukherjee]] said he would miss a well-wisher. \"In his death, I have lost a great well-wisher, and the country has lost an able administrator, an outstanding parliamentarian and a charismatic political leader,\" Mukherjee told reporters.\n\nThe [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the staunchest anti-Communist force in the country, mourned the death of the Marxist leader, describing him as a \"role model for Indian politics\". In a moving tribute, senior BJP leader [[Arun Jaitley]] told reporters here that Basu, who was West Bengal's chief minister for 23 long years, was one of the \"tallest leaders\" in Indian politics with \"high credibility\". \"He was devoted to his ideology and played the longest innings in Indian politics,\" Jaitley said. Former prime minister and senior BJP leader [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] said Basu's demise had \"ended a chapter in the country's politics\".\n\nHome Minister [[P. Chidambaram]] told reporters in Kolkata: \"He was a colossus who straddled India's political scene for many decades. Not only the leader of West Bengal, but of India. He was a great patriot, great democrat, great parliamentarian and great source of inspiration.

After completing school, Basu took an undergraduate degree in [[English major|English literature honours]] from [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> After completing his undergraduate studies, Basu left for England to study law in 1935.\n\nIn England, he was introduced to politics and became greatly influenced by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].<ref name=profile/> He attended lectures by [[Harold Laski]] and was also influenced by noted Communist ideologue and prolific writer [[Rajani Palme Dutt]], a fellow [[Bengali people|Bengali]].<ref name=profile>{{citation |title=Jyoti Basu: A profile |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jyoti-basu-a-profile/ |work=[[The Indian Express]] |accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref> Between 1936 and 1940, Basu involved himself in various political activities, came into contact with several Indian freedom fighters including Netaji Subash Chandra Bose, Nehru, became a member of the India league, and joined the London Majlis.<ref name=profile/>\n\n==Return to India and marriage==\nBasu reached Kolkata and was reunited with his parents on January 1, 1940.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> While he was in London, his parents had selected a suitable bride for him and informed him of their choice. Like a normal Indian boy of his generation, Basu had replied that if the girl was acceptable to his parents, she was acceptable to him.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> The two sets of parents had then made arrangements for the wedding, and on Jan 20, 1940, only nineteen days after his return to India, Basu was married to Basanti Devi (n\u00e9e Ghose, fondly known as 'Chobi'), a girl of his own caste and similar family background.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> Unfortunately, Basanti died in 1942, hardly two years after the wedding, and there were no surviving children. Basu's mother, Hemalata Devi, also died a few months later, in 1942.\n\nAfter returning to India, Basu had become an active member of the Communist Party, to his father's chagrin. After Basanti's death, he deepened his involvement, virtually giving up the pretense of earning a living as a lawyer. His legal practice was mostly about providing legal services ''[[pro bono]]'' to the party and its affiliates, in particular to trade unions. He lived as always with his father and extended family (as per [[Hindu joint family|Indian custom]]) and thus had little need to earn a living. As a young barrister studying in England, he had been a prize catch for any family with a marriageable daughter, but the situation was altered now, and proposals were not plentiful. Several years passed, and Basu's father and other family members grew anxious to see him settled again. In time, they arranged for him to marry another suitable girl of their caste and background. This was Kamala, who Basu married on Dec 5, 1948.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> The marriage, which conformed in every way to Indian tradition and convention, was harmonious and lasted until their deaths more than sixty years later. On Aug 31, 1951, the couple became the parents of a daughter, born at Sishumangal Hospital in Kolkata. Tragically, the unnamed baby died only a few days later of diarrhoea and dehydration. In 1953, the couple were blessed with the birth of a son, Subhabrata Basu, fondly known as 'Chandan' by one and all.<ref name=jyotibasu.net/> Chandan, who was to be the couple's only surviving child, was born while Basu was in prison for allegedly seditious activities, having been incarcerated by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress-led]] government of independent India.\n\nShortly after Chandan was born, Basu's father, Nishikant Basu, wrote a will which disinherited Basu entirely and vested all his property, a considerable fortune which included the massive mansion in Kolkata, in the name of his daughter-in-law Kamala, with provision that the property be inherited by Chandan eventually. The elderly ''[[bhadralok]]'' patrician had been aghast, even distraught, to find that his beloved son had returned from England a communist, and that he had developed over the next decade (the 1940s) into a violent revolutionary. Basu was to say later that the arrangement suited him perfectly, that indeed it had been devised in consultation with him; it ensured that Kamala was always able to feed the family and pay for her son's education, which left Basu free from the tension of having to provide for his wife and son, and enabled him to pursue his political activities.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Entry into politics===\n{{Indcom}}\nJyoti Basu's first track in politics was his effort to organise the Indian [[International student|students]] studying in United Kingdom, mostly for the cause of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Basu subsequently joined India League and London Majlis, both the organisations being communities of overseas Indian students.  Basu was later elected the General Secretary of London Majlis.<ref>{{cite news|title=London, the land that turned Basu into a Marxist|last=Roy|first=Amit|work=telegraphindia.com|location=Kolkata|date=18 January 2010|accessdate=7 June 2010|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100118/jsp/nation/story_11997615.jsp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126043345/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100118/jsp/nation/story_11997615.jsp#|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Basu was given the responsibility for arranging a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] during Nehru's visit to London in 1938. The same was done after [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] went to England. As a member of London Majlis, Basu introduced the visiting Indian political figures to the leaders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\nBasu was introduced to the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] by another communist leader and Basu's friend in England, [[Bhupesh Gupta]]. It is told Basu showed interest to join CPGB but the then Secretary General [[Harry Pollitt]] suggested that he should not do so, possibly because CPGB was then banned in India and Pollitt speculated Basu could have difficulties in returning to India as a member of CPGB.\n\nHowever Basu returned to India in 1940 and immediately contacted the Party leaders. Though he enrolled himself as a barrister in [[Calcutta High Court]], he never practised simply because he was determined to become a wholetimer of the Party.\n\nBasu became the secretary of Friends of Soviet Union and Anti-Fascist Writers' Association in Kolkata. As a member of the Party, his initial task was to maintain liaison with underground Party leaders. He was entrusted with responsibilities on the trade union front from 1944. In that year, Bengal Assam Railroad Workers' Union was formed and Basu became its first secretary. In 1944 Basu became involved in trade union activities when CPI delegated him to work amongst the railway labourers. When B.N. Railway Workers Union and B.D. Rail Road Workers Union merged, Basu became the general secretary of the union. In 1946, Basu was elected to the Bengal Provincial Assembly from the Railway Workers constituency. Ratanlal Bramhan and Rupnarayan Roy were the other two Communists who were elected. From that day on, Basu became one of the most popular and influential legislators for decades to come.\n\nBasu played a very active role in the stormy days of 1946\u201347 when Bengal witnessed the Tebhaga movement, workers strikes and even communal riots.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Basu served as the Vice-President of the [[All India Railwaymen's Federation]] until Communists were expelled from the union for attempt to organize strikes after the union had withdrawn its strike notice.<ref>{{cite book|title= Decolonization in South Asia: Meanings of Freedom in Post-independence West Bengal, 1947-52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vt95AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT172&dq=jyoti+basu+railwaymen|publisher = Routledge|year=2009|last=Bandopadhyay|first=Sekhar|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJyoti Basu was the secretary of the West Bengal Provincial Committee of the Party from 1953 to January 1961. He was elected to the Central Committee of the Party in 1951. He was a member of the Politburo from 1964 onwards. He was elected as a special invitee to PB in 19th Congress of the Party in 2008.\n\nAfter the country gained independence, he was elected to the assembly from [[Baranagar]] in 1952. He was elected to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1991 and 1996. Though an elected member, Basu was arrested several times during the 1950s and 60s and for certain periods he went underground to evade arrest by the police.\n\nIn 1962, Jyoti Basu was one amongst the 32 members of the National Council who walked out of the meeting. When the CPI(M) was formed in 1964 as a result of the ideological struggle within the Communist movement, Basu became a member of the Politburo. He was, in fact, the last surviving member of the \"Navaratnas\", the nine members of the first Politburo. The leftist section, to which the 32 National Council members belonged, organised a convention in [[Tenali]], Andhra Pradesh 7 to 11 July. It was here where the radical sections of party further showed their pro-Chinese stand. The Tenali convention was marked by the display of a large portrait of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] leader [[Mao Zedong]].<ref>Basu, Pradip.

He served as the Leader of Opposition for a long time when Dr. [[Bidhan Chandra Roy]] was the Chief Minister of West Bengal. Jyoti Basu led a number of agitations against the State Government and earned enviable popularity as a politician particularly among the students and youth. Beside organising the movements of the Railway Labourers, he led a movement by the teachers demanding a hike in salary. When the [[Communist Party of India]] split in 1964, Basu became one of the first nine members of the Politburo of the newly formed Communist Party of India (Marxist).<ref name=Nine/> In 1967 and 1969, Basu became Deputy Chief Minister of West Bengal in the United Front governments. In 1967, after the defeat of the Congress Government, Jyoti Basu was sworn-in as the Deputy Chief Minister under the Chief Ministership of [[Ajoy Mukherjee]]. In 1970, he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt at the Patna railway station. Though CPI(M) became the single largest party in the assembly elections in 1971, the party was refused the chance to form a ministry and presidents' Rule was imposed in West Bengal.\n\nThrough the 1972 elections the Congress returned to power in West Bengal and Jyoti Basu lost the elections from [[Baranagar (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Baranagar]] to [[Shiba Pada Bhattacharjee]] who used to campaign for Basu in Baranagar in earlier elections when the Communist party was united.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/shouldnt-have-contested-says-man-who-defeated-basu/ | title=Shouldn't have contested, says man who defeated Basu | publisher=[[Indian Express]] | work=Shiv Sahay Singh | date=19 January 2010 | accessdate=24 October 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305161708/http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/shouldnt-have-contested-says-man-who-defeated-basu/# | archive-date=5 March 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Basu famously declared the new assembly as \"assembly of the frauds\" and CPI(M) boycotted the assembly for the next five years.\n\n===As the Chief Minister of West Bengal===\nAfter the sweeping victory of the Left Front in 1977, Jyoti Basu became the Chief Minister of the Left Front government, a position he held continuously for a record more than 23 years, until his deputy Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took over the reins primarily due the former's deteriorating health. Under his leadership, the Left Front government focused on land reforms in the state; it instituted a ''panchayati raj system'' giving poor peasants and small farmers a say in running the panchayati institutions. The land reforms gave farmers a say on their lands, the agricultural output increased although not as much as expected initially, due to the fact that everyone was a land owner with nobody to sell/supply to, just enough means for self survival. \nWhile it was part of fulfilling his electoral agenda, it remained as the only thing worth remembering done by Basu in West Bengal, and that too is not without any critics. Although he is largely remembered as an extremely able administrator who didn't allow any riots in his state after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and in 1984 and during the demolition of babri masjid in 1992, while the whole country was on the boil, his excessive pro-people stance resulted in an economic and administrative nightmare. The socialist and populist moves garbed under state sponsored reforms gave way to occurrence of host of factors that resulted into economic nosedive of the state, increased labour militancy driving industries out of the state leaving the state high and dry on resources to thrive. Numerous reports of violence by labours across industries and factories were reported that drove industrialists out. Few prominent indrustrialists pleaded to Jyoti Basu and his administration, but were let down by the response that pinned the blame back on them; Frustrated, the indrustrialists moved out. This emigration of industries gradually led to an increase in unemployment that further became a chief cause of [[Naxal]] movement, which ended up being one of the most challenging internal security problems India still deals with.<ref>{{cite news |date=19 March 2018 |title=How communism killed Bengal's economy |url=http://www.rediff.com/business/special/how-the-communists-killed-bengals-industry/20180319.htm |location=India |agency=Indo-Asian News Service |access-date=9 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710010226/http://www.rediff.com/business/special/how-the-communists-killed-bengals-industry/20180319.htm# |archive-date=10 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \nElections were hijacked,<ref>https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/20020812-is-mastery-of-booth-capturing-technique-the-secret-of-cpims-continuance-in-power-794635-2002-08-12</ref> the CPIM workers ran rioting across anyone who opposed them or their stances, one such instance at very beginning of their rule, resulted in an infamous [[Marichjhapi incident]] {{fact|date=March 2020}} that led to death of more than 1700 immigrants from Bangladesh and destruction of properties and goods related to them.\n\nWhile the GDP of state registered marginal hike, it could feel the wholesale destruction of the state's manufacturing sector, where labour militancy, aided and abetted by the state government, took its toll.

While Patil said \"the nation has lost a veteran and eminent public figure,\" Manmohan Singh said Basu was a politician to whom he often turned for \"sagacious advice\". Basu was a leader \"who displayed his abilities as a leader of the people, an able administrator and eminent statesman\", the president said in a statement. \"In the years after he relinquished the Chief Ministry, he continued to be looked upon as an elder statesman, whose advice was sought by many political leaders in the state,\" the president added.\n\nIn a message to Jyoti Basu's son Chandan, Manmohan Singh said: \"He was a powerful regional voice in the national political scene and helped to strengthen Indian federalism...

It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for [[target acquisition]] and [[night vision device|night vision systems]]. It is armed with a [[30 mm caliber|{{convert|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] [[M230 chain gun]] carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four [[hardpoint]]s mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missiles and [[Hydra 70]] rocket pods. The AH-64 has significant systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.\n\nThe Apache began as the ''Model 77'' developed by [[Hughes Helicopters]] for the [[United States Army]]'s [[Advanced Attack Helicopter]] program to replace the [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobra]]. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the [[Bell YAH-63]] in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, [[McDonnell Douglas]] continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]], with over 2,000 AH-64s being produced by 2013.<ref name=Sterling_March_2013>{{cite web |last1=Sterling |first1=Robert |title=Apache helicopters roar ahead |url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/Features/2013/06/bds_apache_06_03_13.page |website=Boeing.com |publisher=Boeing|date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH-64. It has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations, including [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It has been built under license in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[AgustaWestland Apache]]. American AH-64s have served in conflicts in [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)|Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for [[target acquisition]] and [[night vision device|night vision systems]]. It is armed with a [[30 mm caliber|{{convert|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] [[M230 chain gun]] carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four [[hardpoint]]s mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missiles and [[Hydra 70]] rocket pods. The AH-64 has significant systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.\n\nThe Apache began as the ''Model 77'' developed by [[Hughes Helicopters]] for the [[United States Army]]'s [[Advanced Attack Helicopter]] program to replace the [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobra]]. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the [[Bell YAH-63]] in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, [[McDonnell Douglas]] continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]], with over 2,000 AH-64s being produced by 2013.<ref name=Sterling_March_2013>{{cite web |last1=Sterling |first1=Robert |title=Apache helicopters roar ahead |url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/Features/2013/06/bds_apache_06_03_13.page |website=Boeing.com |publisher=Boeing|date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH-64. It has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations, including [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It has been built under license in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[AgustaWestland Apache]]. American AH-64s have served in conflicts in [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)|Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Israel used the Apache in its military conflicts in [[Lebanon]] and the [[Gaza Strip]].

The upgrade would have included new rotor blades, a Global Positioning System (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. U.S. Congress approved $82M to begin the Apache B upgrade.

More funding changed the plan to upgrade to AH-64C. The C upgrade would include all changes to be included in the Longbow except for mast-mounted radar and newer \u2212700C engine versions.

It is one of the largest [[petrel]]s that nests in burrows.\n\n==Description==\nThe spectacled petrel is a large, approximately {{convert|55|cm|in|abbr = on}} in length, predominately black [[petrel]]. It does have white bands around its eyes, and its [[beak|bill]] is yellow. Their lifespan averages 26.4 years.<ref name = \"BLI\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe spectacled petrel is a member of the [[genus]] ''[[Procellaria]]'', and in turn is a member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Procellariidae]], and the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Procellariiformes]]. As a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]]. Although the nostrils on the petrel are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a [[stomach oil]] made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> Finally, they also have a [[salt gland]] that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\nIn 2004, [[BirdLife International]] split the spectacled petrel, ''Procellaria conspicillata'', from the [[white-chinned petrel]], ''Procellaria aequinoctialis'', which had been considered [[conspecific]] or even a [[polymorphism (biology)|colour morph]].<ref name = \"Brooke\">Brooke, M. (2004)</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Procellaria'' comes from two [[Latin]] words, ''procella'' meaning \"a storm\" and ''arius'' a suffix meaning \"pertaining to\". This is in reference to their association with stormy weather. The word ''petrel'' is derived from [[St. Peter]] and the story of his walking on water.

Their nests are [[Burrow nest|burrows]] along the banks of rivers, and also in marshes.<ref name=\"BLI\"/>\n\n==Range and habitat==\nThe spectacled petrel is [[pelagic]] and during non-breeding season the majority of these petrels are found off the coast of southern [[Brazil]]. They also range east to the west coast of southern [[Africa]], and it is believed that they were found throughout the southern [[Indian Ocean]] in the 19th century.<ref name=\"BLI\"/>\nDuring breeding season, they inhabit [[Inaccessible Island]], of the [[Tristan da Cunha]] group.

Consequently, the conservation status of this species was downgraded to [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] in the 2007 [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=\"BLI\"/> The 2009 assessment maintained their status at vulnerable.<ref name=\"BLI\"/>\nThis petrel has an occurrence range of {{convert|9670000|km2|sqmi|abbr= on}} and a population estimated at between 31,000 and 45,000. Their population is trending up at between 1% and 9% over 60 years, and possibly 45% over the last five years.<ref name=\"BLI\"/>\n \nThe spectacled petrel is threatened by interactions with [[Longline fishing|longline fisheries]] which kills hundreds of birds every year as they become entangled in the fishing lines and drown.
