It was the first station on the [[Hudson River Railroad]] running north from the city, and the hub of daily stage coach, omnibus and streetcar lines. Situated near the famous [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Bloomingdale Road]], its hotels, houses of entertainment and post office made it an alluring destination of suburban retreat from the city, yet its direct proximity to the Hudson River also made it an invaluable industrial entry point for construction materials and other freight bound for [[Upper Manhattan]]. With the construction of road and railway viaducts over the valley in which the town sat, Manhattanville, increasingly absorbed into the growing city, became a marginalized industrial area. In the early 2000s, the neighborhood became the site of a major planned expansion of [[Columbia University]], which has campuses in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] to the south and [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] to the north.\n\nManhattanville is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 9|Manhattan Community District 9]] and its primary [[ZIP Code]]s are 10027 and 10031.<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\"/> It is patrolled by the 26th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]].\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date= January 2014}}\n===Colonial period and establishment===\nThe village of Manhattanville was founded in 1806 and quickly gained prominence as an outpost of the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://untappedcities.com/2013/02/26/manhattanville-history-and-development/|title=Manhattanville's History and Development in Harlem|date=2013-02-26|work=Untapped Cities|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}</ref> The village grew around the crossroads of Bloomingdale Road and Manhattan Street, now roughly [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and 125th Street. The village's original streets were laid out by Jacob Schieffelin and other wealthy merchants, mostly [[Quakers]], who had [[country seat]]s in the area. The town thrived as a result of the development of Manhattan Street from the Hudson River, whose convenient access also became a crucial catalyst in the growth of the older village of [[Harlem]] to the southeast on the Harlem River. Situated at approximately the same latitude, Harlem and Manhattanville flourished together throughout the 19th century as the two most prominent villages in upper Manhattan.[[File:Manhattanville forts.jpg|thumb|Manhattanville forts<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=972}}</ref>]]\nManhattanville sits in a valley formerly called ''Moertje David's Vly'' (\"Mother David's Valley\"; in Dutch, ''{{lang|nl|Vly}}'' is short for ''{{lang|nl|vallei}}'', or \"valley\") during the Dutch Colonial period and as ''Harlem Cove'' during the English Colonial period. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the valley was also known as the Hollow Way, where the main action of the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] began under the command of General [[George Washington]]. During the [[War of 1812]] the valley's southern ridges figured as the site of the Manhattanville Pass, whose defense fortifications and breastworks included Fort Laight and Blockhouse No. 4,<ref>*[http://dmna.state.ny.us/forts/fortsE_L/laightFort.htm Fort Laight]\n*[http://www.dmna.state.ny.us/forts/fortsM_P/nycBlockhouses.htm Blockhouse No. 4]</ref> which became the sites of [[Morningside Gardens]] Houses and PS 36, respectively.\n\n[[File:Daniel F. Tiemann's paint factory in 1850s.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Daniel F. Tiemann's paint factory]]\n\nManhattanville's early population was a diverse and eclectic mix of intermarried American patriots and British loyalists; at least one prominent former African slave trader (this seems to be a reference to [[Michael Hogan (shipowner)|Michael Hogan]], whose wife was of mixed British and Indian ancestry, born in [[Mumbai|Bombay]]); slave owners and enslaved African-Americans; Quaker anti-slavery activists and free black abolitionists; tradesmen, poor laborers and wealthy industrialists.<ref>Eric K. Washington, ''Manhattanville'', Introduction</ref>  Many were affiliated with the same institutions, principally the historic New York City landmarked St. Mary's Protestant Episcopal Church, organized in 1823, which was the first Episcopal church to dissolve [[pew rent]] in 1831, and the Manhattanville Free School (established in 1827, later Public School No. 43) still at their original sites. Manhattanville's most prominent resident was industrialist [[Daniel F. Tiemann]] (1805\u20131899), owner of the D. F. Tiemann & Company Color Works, who was also Mayor of New York City from 1858 to 1859. The Tiemann laboratory and factory which was originally located on [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] and [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] in [[Gramercy, Manhattan|Gramercy]], near [[Madison Square]] Park, relocated uptown to Manhattanville in 1832, in part due to an underground spring of running water at the new uptown location, which is today the site of 560 [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]].<ref name=\"Baptista\">Baptista, Robert J., [http://www.colorantshistory.org/TiemannColorWorks.html \"D.F. Tiemann & Co. Color Works, Manhattanville, New York City\"], Colorants Industry History, July 7, 2009</ref>\n\n===Immigration and urbanization===\nAccording to Eric K. Washington, \u201cWith Manhattanville\u2019s formation, the new village quickly became a significant suburban destination along the Bloomingdale Road [today\u2019s 125th St.]... Manhattanville flourished naturally as a nexus of various transportation arteries.\u201d<ref>Washington, Manhattanville 9.</ref> In the late nineteenth century, Manhattanville experienced a development boom of residential buildings, churches, hospitals, institutional construction, and transportation made it a desirable location for the brewery business.\n\nLater noteworthy population changes occurred around the mid-19th century following the opening of the Hudson River Railroad in 1850, with an influx of mostly Catholic Irish (who established the Church of the Annunciation in 1854) and Germans (who established St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in 1860). After the [[American Civil War]], the Jewish immigrant population that began to distinguish itself in Harlem gradually filtered into the western blocks of Manhattanville (and established Chevra Talmud Torah Anshei Marovi, also known as [[Old Broadway Synagogue]], in 1911). Other prominent 19th-century Manhattanville institutions included the Academy of Convent of the Sacred Heart (later called [[Manhattanville College]]) and [[Manhattan College]].\n\nIn 1904, the opening of the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] (IRT)'s new [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line|Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], now part of the {{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh north}} on the [[New York City Subway]], galvanized Manhattanville's radical transformation from rural [[exburb]] to an extension of the growing city, with the elevated railway providing rapid transit downtown. Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants moved into the area during the 20th century. By the 1970s, the southern part of Manhattanville (up to about 125th Street) was being filled by Columbia and [[Barnard College]] students, staff and faculty, as the university continued to expand.\n\nWest 125th Street has experienced a general economic upturn since the end of the 1990s. Many of the buildings below 125th Street have converted to cooperative ownership as the area experiences continuing [[gentrification]] and increasing demand for housing. In collaboration with the community, the city has developed a plan for the 125th Street corridor focusing on reinforcing and building upon its strengths as an arts and cultural corridor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nycedc.com/Web/AboutUs/OurProjects/CurrentProjects/125thStreet.htm |title=New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) 125th Street Project |access-date=May 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529005145/http://www.nycedc.com/Web/AboutUs/OurProjects/CurrentProjects/125thStreet.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n\n====University expansions====\n\n[[File:Manhattanville NYC.jpeg|right|250px|thumb|Columbia University construction near the [[125th Street (IRT Broadway \u2013 Seventh Avenue Line)|125th Street]] station]]\n\nManhattanville is the site of a planned major expansion of [[Columbia University]]. The university purchased several square blocks of the neighborhood between [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th]]<ref>Because of the dogleg shape of 125th Street on the west side, 125th Street and 129th Street merge, and so only four or five blocks are involved in the tract.</ref> and 133rd Streets on the south and north and between Broadway and 12th Avenue on the east side of Broadway from 131 to 134, west of the housing projects. According to the plan, the physical plant of those blocks will be partly demolished to construct a new campus, secondary school and park land, designed by Italian architect [[Renzo Piano]].  Local residents feared the impact of the further gentrification from this expansion in addition to the possible, and controversial, use of [[eminent domain]]. In 2006, Columbia built a new School of Social Work on Amsterdam Avenue at 122nd Street. In June 2007, the [[New York City Department of City Planning]] certified that Columbia's application for the rezoning is complete.

Its present stone building, built in 1908\u20131909 by T. E. Blake and the architectural firm of Carrere & Hastings, is the church\u2019s second structure on same site of the church's original wood frame structure, built in 1824 and consecrated in 1826. In 1831, St. Marys was the first church in the Episcopal Diocese to abolish [[pew]] rentals. The marble seal inlaid into the church porch of '''\"Jacob Schieffelin's Vault\"''', the [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] in which Jacob Schieffelin and his wife Hannah Lawrence Schieffelin (who were the church's land donors as well as Manhattanville's principal founders) are interred, is clearly visible to passersby. Today St. Mary's is the oldest congregation in continuous service on its original site in the entire Harlem area. In 1998, the complex of church, its adjacent frame parish house (circa 1851) and brick school building (1890) were officially designated a [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan above 110th Street|New York City landmark]].\n* '''Church of the Annunciation''' (Roman Catholic) on Convent Avenue and West 131st Street, founded in 1854, was the first Catholic church to be built on Manhattan's west side above 2nd Street, and ministered particularly to the Irish Catholic laborers on the Hudson River Railroad. The Christian Brothers established the church building adjacent to Manhattan College, at 131st Street and the Bloomingdale Road (Old Broadway). The Brothers subsequently sold the adjoining church and rectory sites to John Hughes, the first Catholic Archbishop of New York. The present stone building, built in 1906\u20131907 by the architectural firm of Lynch & Orchard, is the church's second structure, to which the congregation moved from two blocks east in 1907.\n* '''[[St. Joseph of the Holy Family Church (New York City)|Church of St. Joseph of the Holy Family]]''', founded in 1860 as the Church of the Holy Family by Manhattanville's German Catholic community at the northwest corner of 125th Street and Morningside Avenue. A 100th anniversary souvenir history in 1960 noted: \"While the construction of the church was going on . . . on May 30, of the year 1861 was celebrated what was probably the first public Corpus Christi procession in New York City.\" Manhattanville historian John J. Hopper mentions this church in his circa 1920 reminiscences as \"the German Catholic Church at Ninth Avenue, which my father [Isaac A. Hopper] built\" during his boyhood on Manhattan Street from 1853 to 1865. (Although the AIA guide attributes the church\u2019s architecture to the Herter Brothers in 1889, the incorrect building date was probably confused that of the St. Joseph R.C. School building around the corner at 168 Morningside Avenue). David Dunlap cites this church in his book, ''Glory in Gotham: Manhattan\u2019s Houses of Worship'', as the oldest church [building] in Harlem.\n* '''[[Old Broadway Synagogue]]''', an Orthodox Jewish synagogue incorporated in 1911 under the name Chevra Talmud Torah Anshei Marovi, was built on Old Broadway (a rare vestige on Manhattan island of the Bloomingdale Road) by the architectural firm of Meisner & Uffner in 1923.  The congregation formed from the mostly [[Ashkenazic]] Jewish population of Russian and Polish immigrants to New York during the 1880s who had made their way up to Central Harlem, then migrated to blocks west. The building is listed individually on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan above 110th Street|National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n=== Other sites of interest ===\n[[File:Claremont 135 theater jeh.JPG|thumb|Former Claremont Theatre]]\nAside from [[Grant's Tomb]], [[Riverside Church]] and the Manhattan School of Music near the southwestern corner, the principal landmarks in Manhattanville are the [[IRT Broadway Line Viaduct|IRT Broadway Line]] and [[Riverside Drive Viaduct]]s.

It was the first station on the [[Hudson River Railroad]] running north from the city, and the hub of daily stage coach, omnibus and streetcar lines. Situated near the famous [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Bloomingdale Road]], its hotels, houses of entertainment and post office made it an alluring destination of suburban retreat from the city, yet its direct proximity to the Hudson River also made it an invaluable industrial entry point for construction materials and other freight bound for [[Upper Manhattan]]. With the construction of road and railway viaducts over the valley in which the town sat, Manhattanville, increasingly absorbed into the growing city, became a marginalized industrial area. In the early 2000s, the neighborhood became the site of a major planned expansion of [[Columbia University]], which has campuses in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] to the south and [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] to the north.\n\nManhattanville is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 9|Manhattan Community District 9]] and its primary [[ZIP Code]]s are 10027 and 10031.<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\"/> It is patrolled by the 26th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]].\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date= January 2014}}\n===Colonial period and establishment===\nThe village of Manhattanville was founded in 1806 and quickly gained prominence as an outpost of the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://untappedcities.com/2013/02/26/manhattanville-history-and-development/|title=Manhattanville's History and Development in Harlem|date=2013-02-26|work=Untapped Cities|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}</ref> The village grew around the crossroads of Bloomingdale Road and Manhattan Street, now roughly [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and 125th Street. The village's original streets were laid out by Jacob Schieffelin and other wealthy merchants, mostly [[Quakers]], who had [[country seat]]s in the area. The town thrived as a result of the development of Manhattan Street from the Hudson River, whose convenient access also became a crucial catalyst in the growth of the older village of [[Harlem]] to the southeast on the Harlem River. Situated at approximately the same latitude, Harlem and Manhattanville flourished together throughout the 19th century as the two most prominent villages in upper Manhattan.[[File:Manhattanville forts.jpg|thumb|Manhattanville forts<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=972}}</ref>]]\nManhattanville sits in a valley formerly called ''Moertje David's Vly'' (\"Mother David's Valley\"; in Dutch, ''{{lang|nl|Vly}}'' is short for ''{{lang|nl|vallei}}'', or \"valley\") during the Dutch Colonial period and as ''Harlem Cove'' during the English Colonial period. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the valley was also known as the Hollow Way, where the main action of the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] began under the command of General [[George Washington]]. During the [[War of 1812]] the valley's southern ridges figured as the site of the Manhattanville Pass, whose defense fortifications and breastworks included Fort Laight and Blockhouse No. 4,<ref>*[http://dmna.state.ny.us/forts/fortsE_L/laightFort.htm Fort Laight]\n*[http://www.dmna.state.ny.us/forts/fortsM_P/nycBlockhouses.htm Blockhouse No. 4]</ref> which became the sites of [[Morningside Gardens]] Houses and PS 36, respectively.\n\n[[File:Daniel F. Tiemann's paint factory in 1850s.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Daniel F. Tiemann's paint factory]]\n\nManhattanville's early population was a diverse and eclectic mix of intermarried American patriots and British loyalists; at least one prominent former African slave trader (this seems to be a reference to [[Michael Hogan (shipowner)|Michael Hogan]], whose wife was of mixed British and Indian ancestry, born in [[Mumbai|Bombay]]); slave owners and enslaved African-Americans; Quaker anti-slavery activists and free black abolitionists; tradesmen, poor laborers and wealthy industrialists.<ref>Eric K. Washington, ''Manhattanville'', Introduction</ref>  Many were affiliated with the same institutions, principally the historic New York City landmarked St. Mary's Protestant Episcopal Church, organized in 1823, which was the first Episcopal church to dissolve [[pew rent]] in 1831, and the Manhattanville Free School (established in 1827, later Public School No. 43) still at their original sites. Manhattanville's most prominent resident was industrialist [[Daniel F. Tiemann]] (1805\u20131899), owner of the D. F. Tiemann & Company Color Works, who was also Mayor of New York City from 1858 to 1859. The Tiemann laboratory and factory which was originally located on [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] and [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] in [[Gramercy, Manhattan|Gramercy]], near [[Madison Square]] Park, relocated uptown to Manhattanville in 1832, in part due to an underground spring of running water at the new uptown location, which is today the site of 560 [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]].<ref name=\"Baptista\">Baptista, Robert J., [http://www.colorantshistory.org/TiemannColorWorks.html \"D.F. Tiemann & Co. Color Works, Manhattanville, New York City\"], Colorants Industry History, July 7, 2009</ref>\n\n===Immigration and urbanization===\nAccording to Eric K. Washington, \u201cWith Manhattanville\u2019s formation, the new village quickly became a significant suburban destination along the Bloomingdale Road [today\u2019s 125th St.]... Manhattanville flourished naturally as a nexus of various transportation arteries.\u201d<ref>Washington, Manhattanville 9.</ref> In the late nineteenth century, Manhattanville experienced a development boom of residential buildings, churches, hospitals, institutional construction, and transportation made it a desirable location for the brewery business.\n\nLater noteworthy population changes occurred around the mid-19th century following the opening of the Hudson River Railroad in 1850, with an influx of mostly Catholic Irish (who established the Church of the Annunciation in 1854) and Germans (who established St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in 1860). After the [[American Civil War]], the Jewish immigrant population that began to distinguish itself in Harlem gradually filtered into the western blocks of Manhattanville (and established Chevra Talmud Torah Anshei Marovi, also known as [[Old Broadway Synagogue]], in 1911). Other prominent 19th-century Manhattanville institutions included the Academy of Convent of the Sacred Heart (later called [[Manhattanville College]]) and [[Manhattan College]].\n\nIn 1904, the opening of the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] (IRT)'s new [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line|Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], now part of the {{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh north}} on the [[New York City Subway]], galvanized Manhattanville's radical transformation from rural [[exburb]] to an extension of the growing city, with the elevated railway providing rapid transit downtown. Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants moved into the area during the 20th century. By the 1970s, the southern part of Manhattanville (up to about 125th Street) was being filled by Columbia and [[Barnard College]] students, staff and faculty, as the university continued to expand.\n\nWest 125th Street has experienced a general economic upturn since the end of the 1990s. Many of the buildings below 125th Street have converted to cooperative ownership as the area experiences continuing [[gentrification]] and increasing demand for housing. In collaboration with the community, the city has developed a plan for the 125th Street corridor focusing on reinforcing and building upon its strengths as an arts and cultural corridor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nycedc.com/Web/AboutUs/OurProjects/CurrentProjects/125thStreet.htm |title=New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) 125th Street Project |access-date=May 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529005145/http://www.nycedc.com/Web/AboutUs/OurProjects/CurrentProjects/125thStreet.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n\n====University expansions====\n\n[[File:Manhattanville NYC.jpeg|right|250px|thumb|Columbia University construction near the [[125th Street (IRT Broadway \u2013 Seventh Avenue Line)|125th Street]] station]]\n\nManhattanville is the site of a planned major expansion of [[Columbia University]]. The university purchased several square blocks of the neighborhood between [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th]]<ref>Because of the dogleg shape of 125th Street on the west side, 125th Street and 129th Street merge, and so only four or five blocks are involved in the tract.</ref> and 133rd Streets on the south and north and between Broadway and 12th Avenue on the east side of Broadway from 131 to 134, west of the housing projects. According to the plan, the physical plant of those blocks will be partly demolished to construct a new campus, secondary school and park land, designed by Italian architect [[Renzo Piano]].  Local residents feared the impact of the further gentrification from this expansion in addition to the possible, and controversial, use of [[eminent domain]]. In 2006, Columbia built a new School of Social Work on Amsterdam Avenue at 122nd Street. In June 2007, the [[New York City Department of City Planning]] certified that Columbia's application for the rezoning is complete.

Its present stone building, built in 1908\u20131909 by T. E. Blake and the architectural firm of Carrere & Hastings, is the church\u2019s second structure on same site of the church's original wood frame structure, built in 1824 and consecrated in 1826. In 1831, St. Marys was the first church in the Episcopal Diocese to abolish [[pew]] rentals. The marble seal inlaid into the church porch of '''\"Jacob Schieffelin's Vault\"''', the [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] in which Jacob Schieffelin and his wife Hannah Lawrence Schieffelin (who were the church's land donors as well as Manhattanville's principal founders) are interred, is clearly visible to passersby. Today St. Mary's is the oldest congregation in continuous service on its original site in the entire Harlem area. In 1998, the complex of church, its adjacent frame parish house (circa 1851) and brick school building (1890) were officially designated a [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan above 110th Street|New York City landmark]].\n* '''Church of the Annunciation''' (Roman Catholic) on Convent Avenue and West 131st Street, founded in 1854, was the first Catholic church to be built on Manhattan's west side above 2nd Street, and ministered particularly to the Irish Catholic laborers on the Hudson River Railroad. The Christian Brothers established the church building adjacent to Manhattan College, at 131st Street and the Bloomingdale Road (Old Broadway). The Brothers subsequently sold the adjoining church and rectory sites to John Hughes, the first Catholic Archbishop of New York. The present stone building, built in 1906\u20131907 by the architectural firm of Lynch & Orchard, is the church's second structure, to which the congregation moved from two blocks east in 1907.\n* '''[[St. Joseph of the Holy Family Church (New York City)|Church of St. Joseph of the Holy Family]]''', founded in 1860 as the Church of the Holy Family by Manhattanville's German Catholic community at the northwest corner of 125th Street and Morningside Avenue. A 100th anniversary souvenir history in 1960 noted: \"While the construction of the church was going on . . . on May 30, of the year 1861 was celebrated what was probably the first public Corpus Christi procession in New York City.\" Manhattanville historian John J. Hopper mentions this church in his circa 1920 reminiscences as \"the German Catholic Church at Ninth Avenue, which my father [Isaac A. Hopper] built\" during his boyhood on Manhattan Street from 1853 to 1865. (Although the AIA guide attributes the church\u2019s architecture to the Herter Brothers in 1889, the incorrect building date was probably confused that of the St. Joseph R.C. School building around the corner at 168 Morningside Avenue). David Dunlap cites this church in his book, ''Glory in Gotham: Manhattan\u2019s Houses of Worship'', as the oldest church [building] in Harlem.\n* '''[[Old Broadway Synagogue]]''', an Orthodox Jewish synagogue incorporated in 1911 under the name Chevra Talmud Torah Anshei Marovi, was built on Old Broadway (a rare vestige on Manhattan island of the Bloomingdale Road) by the architectural firm of Meisner & Uffner in 1923.  The congregation formed from the mostly [[Ashkenazic]] Jewish population of Russian and Polish immigrants to New York during the 1880s who had made their way up to Central Harlem, then migrated to blocks west. The building is listed individually on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan above 110th Street|National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n=== Other sites of interest ===\n[[File:Claremont 135 theater jeh.JPG|thumb|Former Claremont Theatre]]\nAside from [[Grant's Tomb]], [[Riverside Church]] and the Manhattan School of Music near the southwestern corner, the principal landmarks in Manhattanville are the [[IRT Broadway Line Viaduct|IRT Broadway Line]] and [[Riverside Drive Viaduct]]s.

There was also a place to rent bicycles at the inn. It had a serious fire in the 1940s which caused its demise.

In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view such series in motion before 1832. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much success with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns. These lanterns usually depicted images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with [[stop-motion]] animation, possibly since around 1899, or, more likely, since 1906. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]] shown in theatres. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Animated features before CGI===\nAlthough at least eight animated feature films had been released in other countries and some had been quite successful, many Americans initially thought Disney's plans for an animated feature were foolish. In 1937, Disney proved them wrong with \"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\", a tremendous worldwide success. The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. He produced 8 theatrically released animated features aimed at adult audiences from 1972 to 1982. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries (further) developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and, despite a decline afterwards, reached 1,582 titles in 2018. Also China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium have animation industries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Animation on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series),''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981-1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\n\nWhile American animation also experienced international successes, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, often preferring [[stop-motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable traditional animation relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, with hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973-1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and  ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il \u00e9tait une fois\u2026 (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).\n\n===Computer animation===\n[[Computer animation]] has become popular since ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first feature-length animated film completely made using this technique.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=432}}\n\nMost of the traditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance. Most of the characteristics of traditional handmade animation that were deemed charming could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs & Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&rpctoken=342270562&_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early-2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and animated commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. \n\nIn [[information technology]], there is an extremely thin line between a [[user interface]], [[motion graphics]] and narrative animation. The combined techniques can simultaneously function to provide tools, to instruct and to appeal.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts. \n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] \"[[Kills Bugs Dead]]\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.   \n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen, original animated characters also commonly appear in  comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from movies and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey_Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey_Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products#Disney_resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The_Walt_Disney_Company#Financial_data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84\u201385}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|Joy &amp; Heron - A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n=== Animator ===\n{{Main|Animator}}\nAn animator is an artist who creates a visual sequence (or audio-visual if added sound) of multiple sequential images that generate the illusion of movement, that is, an animation. Animations are currently in many areas of technology and video, such as [[Film|cinema]], [[television]], [[video game]]s or the [[internet]]. Generally, these works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods to create these images depend on the animator and style that one wants to achieve (with images generated by a computer, manually ...).\n\nAnimators can be divided into animators of '''characters''' (artists who are specialized in the movements, dialogue and acting of the characters) and animators of '''special effects''' (for example vehicles, machinery or natural phenomena such as water, snow, rain).\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Traditional animation ===\n\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n==== Full animation ====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}. The World Famous Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice comedies]]'' (1923-1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).\n\n=== Stop motion animation ===\n{{Main|Stop motion}}\n\n'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}\n* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155\u201356}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005\u2013present).\n** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]\n* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150\u2013151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151\u201354}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957\u20131967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974\u20132005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977\u20132000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]''.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=250}}\n** '''[[Strata-cut animation]]''', Strata-cut animation is most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like \"loaf\" of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=52\u201354}}\n* '''[[Cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=59\u201360}} Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969\u20131974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; ''[[Tale of Tales (1979 film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997) and the music video Live for the moment, from Verona Riots band (produced by Alberto Serrano and N\u00edvola Uy\u00e1, Spain 2014).\n** '''[[Silhouette animation]]''' is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=170\u2013171}} Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Cin\u00e9 si|Princes et princesses]]'' (France, 2000).\n* '''[[Model animation]]''' refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world.{{sfn|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|pages=9\u201311}} Intercutting, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.<ref name=\"Harryhausen_Dalton222\u2013226\" /> Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films, ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963),<ref name=\"Harryhausen_Dalton18\" /> and the work of [[Willis H. O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).\n** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named \"Vermithrax\" from ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91\u201395}}\n* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51\u201357}}\n** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.\n** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357\u201363}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.{{sfn|Haglund|2014}}\n* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[academy award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].\n\n=== Computer animation ===\n{{Main|Computer animation}}\n'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}\n\n==== 2D animation ====\n{{main|2D computer graphics}}\n[[File:Catenary animation.gif|thumb|A 2D animation of two circles joined by a chain]]\n\n[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D [[Raster graphics|bitmap graphics]] and 2D [[vector graphics]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=165}} This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, [[Interpolation|interpolated]] [[morphing]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=32, 70, 132}} [[onion skinning]]{{sfn|Priebe|2006|pp=71\u201372}} and interpolated rotoscoping.\n\n2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]], and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[Still life photography|still photographs]] in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.{{sfn|White|2006|p=392}}\n\nFinal line [[advection]] animation is a technique used in 2D animation,{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|pp=246\u201347}} to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=127\u201328}} Speaking about using this approach in ''[[Paperman]]'', John Kahrs said that \"Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.\"{{sfn|Beck|2012}}\n\n==== 3D animation ====\n{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}\n3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator usually starts by creating a 3D [[polygon mesh]] to manipulate.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=78\u201380}} This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=285}}\n\nOther techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and [[fluid animation|water simulations]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=96}} These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|p=92}}\n\n===== 3D terms =====\n* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cel Shading: the Unsung Hero of Animation?|url=http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|publisher=Animator Mag|accessdate=20 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090445/http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|archivedate=5 March 2016|date=17 December 2011}}</ref> Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors.

They can sit and stand, and they cannot walk. An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.{{sfn|O'Keefe|2014}}\n** '''Linear Animation Generator''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.{{sfn|Parent|2007|pages=22\u201323}} The concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.\n* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.{{sfn|Kenyon|1998}}\n* The '''[[Magic lantern#Moving images|magic lantern]]''' used mechanical slides to project moving images, probably since Christiaan Huygens invented this early image projector in 1659.\n\n=== Other animation styles, techniques, and approaches ===\n[[File:World of Color overview.jpg|thumb|''[[World of Color]]'' hydrotechnics at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using 1200 fountains with high-definition projections on mist screens.]]\n* '''Hydrotechnics''': a technique that includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.\n* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]],{{sfn|Faber|Walters|2004|p=1979}} [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].\n* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass,{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=222}} for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].\n* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image.

In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view such series in motion before 1832. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much success with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns. These lanterns usually depicted images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with [[stop-motion]] animation, possibly since around 1899, or, more likely, since 1906. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]] shown in theatres. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Animated features before CGI===\nAlthough at least eight animated feature films had been released in other countries and some had been quite successful, many Americans initially thought Disney's plans for an animated feature were foolish. In 1937, Disney proved them wrong with \"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\", a tremendous worldwide success. The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. He produced 8 theatrically released animated features aimed at adult audiences from 1972 to 1982. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries (further) developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and, despite a decline afterwards, reached 1,582 titles in 2018. Also China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium have animation industries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Animation on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series),''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981-1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\n\nWhile American animation also experienced international successes, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, often preferring [[stop-motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable traditional animation relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, with hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973-1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and  ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il \u00e9tait une fois\u2026 (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).\n\n===Computer animation===\n[[Computer animation]] has become popular since ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first feature-length animated film completely made using this technique.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=432}}\n\nMost of the traditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance. Most of the characteristics of traditional handmade animation that were deemed charming could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs & Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&rpctoken=342270562&_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early-2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and animated commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. \n\nIn [[information technology]], there is an extremely thin line between a [[user interface]], [[motion graphics]] and narrative animation. The combined techniques can simultaneously function to provide tools, to instruct and to appeal.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts. \n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] \"[[Kills Bugs Dead]]\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.   \n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen, original animated characters also commonly appear in  comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from movies and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey_Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey_Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products#Disney_resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The_Walt_Disney_Company#Financial_data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84\u201385}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|Joy &amp; Heron - A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n=== Animator ===\n{{Main|Animator}}\nAn animator is an artist who creates a visual sequence (or audio-visual if added sound) of multiple sequential images that generate the illusion of movement, that is, an animation. Animations are currently in many areas of technology and video, such as [[Film|cinema]], [[television]], [[video game]]s or the [[internet]]. Generally, these works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods to create these images depend on the animator and style that one wants to achieve (with images generated by a computer, manually ...).\n\nAnimators can be divided into animators of '''characters''' (artists who are specialized in the movements, dialogue and acting of the characters) and animators of '''special effects''' (for example vehicles, machinery or natural phenomena such as water, snow, rain).\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Traditional animation ===\n\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n==== Full animation ====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice comedies]]'' (1923-1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).\n\n=== Stop motion animation ===\n{{Main|Stop motion}}\n\n'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}\n* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155\u201356}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005\u2013present).\n** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]\n* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150\u2013151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151\u201354}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957\u20131967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974\u20132005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977\u20132000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]''.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=250}}\n** '''[[Strata-cut animation]]''', Strata-cut animation is most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like \"loaf\" of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=52\u201354}}\n* '''[[Cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=59\u201360}} Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969\u20131974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; ''[[Tale of Tales (1979 film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997) and the music video Live for the moment, from Verona Riots band (produced by Alberto Serrano and N\u00edvola Uy\u00e1, Spain 2014).\n** '''[[Silhouette animation]]''' is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=170\u2013171}} Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Cin\u00e9 si|Princes et princesses]]'' (France, 2000).\n* '''[[Model animation]]''' refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world.{{sfn|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|pages=9\u201311}} Intercutting, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.<ref name=\"Harryhausen_Dalton222\u2013226\" /> Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films, ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963),<ref name=\"Harryhausen_Dalton18\" /> and the work of [[Willis H. O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).\n** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named \"Vermithrax\" from ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91\u201395}}\n* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51\u201357}}\n** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.\n** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357\u201363}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.{{sfn|Haglund|2014}}\n* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75\u201379}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[academy award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].\n\n=== Computer animation ===\n{{Main|Computer animation}}\n'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}\n\n==== 2D animation ====\n{{main|2D computer graphics}}\n[[File:Catenary animation.gif|thumb|A 2D animation of two circles joined by a chain]]\n\n[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D [[Raster graphics|bitmap graphics]] and 2D [[vector graphics]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=165}} This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, [[Interpolation|interpolated]] [[morphing]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=32, 70, 132}} [[onion skinning]]{{sfn|Priebe|2006|pp=71\u201372}} and interpolated rotoscoping.\n\n2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]], and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[Still life photography|still photographs]] in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.{{sfn|White|2006|p=392}}\n\nFinal line [[advection]] animation is a technique used in 2D animation,{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|pp=246\u201347}} to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=127\u201328}} Speaking about using this approach in ''[[Paperman]]'', John Kahrs said that \"Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.\"{{sfn|Beck|2012}}\n\n==== 3D animation ====\n{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}\n3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator usually starts by creating a 3D [[polygon mesh]] to manipulate.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=78\u201380}} This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=285}}\n\nOther techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and [[fluid animation|water simulations]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=96}} These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|p=92}}\n\n===== 3D terms =====\n* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cel Shading: the Unsung Hero of Animation?|url=http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|publisher=Animator Mag|accessdate=20 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090445/http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|archivedate=5 March 2016|date=17 December 2011}}</ref> Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors.

They can sit and stand, and they cannot walk. An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.{{sfn|O'Keefe|2014}}\n** '''Linear Animation Generator''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.{{sfn|Parent|2007|pages=22\u201323}} The concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.\n* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.{{sfn|Kenyon|1998}}\n* The '''[[Magic lantern#Moving images|magic lantern]]''' used mechanical slides to project moving images, probably since Christiaan Huygens invented this early image projector in 1659.\n\n=== Other animation styles, techniques, and approaches ===\n[[File:World of Color overview.jpg|thumb|''[[World of Color]]'' hydrotechnics at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using 1200 fountains with high-definition projections on mist screens.]]\n* '''Hydrotechnics''': a technique that includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.\n* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]],{{sfn|Faber|Walters|2004|p=1979}} [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].\n* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass,{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=222}} for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].\n* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image.

It is located due south of the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty]] on Izmaylovskiy Prospekt, not far from the [[Line 1 (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Tekhnologichesky Institut Metro]] station.\n\nThe cathedral, which can accommodate up to 3,000 visitors, has only recently begun to be restored to its pre-Revolutionary splendor after years of neglect. In honor of the victory in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]], when the Russians liberated [[Bulgaria]] from the Ottoman domination, a [[Russo-Turkish War Memorial column|memorial column was constructed]] in front of the northern facade of the cathedral in 1886. The cathedral became a part of the Saint Petersburg [[World Heritage Site]] in 1990.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/540/multiple=1&unique_number=635 ''Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments'']</ref>\n\nOn August 25, 2006, with reconstruction work underway, the main dome of the Cathedral collapsed after a fire, as did one of the smaller domes.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20060825/53157239.html ''Restorers face long effort at Petersburg cathedral after fire]</ref> The cathedral was restored and reopened in 2010.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nAccording to the Russian tradition, each regiment of the imperial guards had its own cathedral. The Trinity Cathedral was the regimental church of the [[Izmailovsky regiment]] of Imperial guards, which takes its name from a royal residence in [[Izmaylovo Estate|Izmailovo]], near [[Moscow]].\n\nOn July 12, 1733, a large field tent operating as a church was consecrated in St. Petersburg, with icons painted on a dark blue satin. However, the church functioned only in the summer, and in winter the soldiers and officers had to attend other parish churches. In 1754\u20131756, a wooden church was built on the site on order of [[Empress Elizabeth]]. The church had two altars, the main one of which was consecrated in the name of the [[Trinity]]. It suffered heavy damage as a result of the flood of 1824 and had to be rebuilt, a commission given by [[Emperor Nicholas I]] to Vasily Stasov.\n\n===Construction of the present church===\n[[File:stasov trinity.jpg|thumb|left|The Trinity Cathedral in St. Petersburg represents a high point of Russian [[Neoclassicism]]]]\n[[File:Trinity Cathedral in Saint Petersburg.jpg|thumb|right|The cathedral with [[Column of Glory]] in 2011]]\n\nConstruction of the new church began in May 1828, and the cathedral was consecrated in May 1835. The cathedral rises to a height of more than {{convert|80|meters|ft}}, and dominates the skyline of the surrounding area. Memorial plaques to regimental officers killed in battle were mounted on the cathedral's wall. After the cathedral's opening, flags, keys from forts and other [[trophy|trophies]] that the regiment won in campaigns in 1854\u20131855 and 1877\u20131878 were also housed in the cathedral.\n\nThe Trinity Cathedral was renowned for its collection of [[icon]]s. The main section of the cathedral housed the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] icon, while the southern section housed the Jesus Christ icon. Empress Elizabeth presented the church with the Beginning of Life Trinity icon in 1742. Other holy objects housed in the cathedral included a large ark made in the form of a cross in 1753 from silver, a large silver cross presented to the cathedral by Nicholas I in 1835, and two large Gospels in valuable bindings.\n\nDostoevsky married Anna Snitkina here on 15 February 1867.\n\n===Post-Revolution===\nIn 1922, most of the cathedral's valuables were looted, and the thievery continued for several more years until the cathedral was finally closed in 1938. There were rumors of plans to demolish the cathedral and use the remaining material for a district workers' theatre. However, the cathedral was transferred to the Soviet Ministry of Telecommunications, for which it became a warehouse. Only in 1990 did the cathedral return to the hands of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], when restoration began. By that time, the interior was largely bare, compared to the splendor and majesty of its pre-Revolutionary past.\n\n===2006 fire===\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0440 \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u0435-\u0418\u0437\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u0421\u041f\u0431, 24.08.2006 - \u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044b.jpg|alt=The cathedral with the main dome on fire|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Izmailovsky Gostiny Dvor.JPG|thumb|left|Restoration works in April 2008]]\n\nOn August 24, 2006, while the cathedral was under reconstruction, a fire originating on restorers' scaffolding collapsed the main dome, destroyed one of the four smaller domes and severely damaged the interior.<ref>\n{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11578214 Interfax > Politics<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224114/http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11578214 |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref><ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20060825/53157239.html RIA Novosti - Russia - Restorers face long effort at Petersburg cathedral after fire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The fire burned through scaffolding outside the central dome of the cathedral. The central dome collapsed and one of four smaller cupolas surrounding it was also destroyed; there were no reports of injuries.\n\nFirefighters battled to save the other three cupolas as emergency workers removed icons and other religious articles. A helicopter dumped water on the historic structure. About four hours after the blaze broke out, one of the three remaining cupolas had been damaged but the fire was contained.\n\nThe blaze apparently started on scaffolding on the outside of the church, which was undergoing restoration. The most valuable icons and other items were saved, and structural damage beneath the roof area was minor.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.interfax.ru/r/B/0/0.html?id_issue=11578344 \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0430\u043a\u0441<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224042/http://www.interfax.ru/r/B/0/0.html?id_issue=11578344 |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref>\n\nFire officials later tried hard to play down the damage.

the '''Troitsky Cathedral''', in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], is a late example of the [[Empire style]], built between 1828 and 1835 to a design by [[Vasily Stasov]]. It is located due south of the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty]] on Izmaylovskiy Prospekt, not far from the [[Line 1 (Saint Petersburg Metro)|Tekhnologichesky Institut Metro]] station.\n\nThe cathedral, which can accommodate up to 3,000 visitors, has only recently begun to be restored to its pre-Revolutionary splendor after years of neglect. In honor of the victory in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]], when the Russians liberated [[Bulgaria]] from the Ottoman domination, a [[Russo-Turkish War Memorial column|memorial column was constructed]] in front of the northern facade of the cathedral in 1886. The cathedral became a part of the Saint Petersburg [[World Heritage Site]] in 1990.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/540/multiple=1&unique_number=635 ''Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments'']</ref>\n\nOn August 25, 2006, with reconstruction work underway, the main dome of the Cathedral collapsed after a fire, as did one of the smaller domes.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20060825/53157239.html ''Restorers face long effort at Petersburg cathedral after fire]</ref> The cathedral was restored and reopened in 2010.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nAccording to the Russian tradition, each regiment of the imperial guards had its own cathedral. The Trinity Cathedral was the regimental church of the [[Izmailovsky regiment]] of Imperial guards, which takes its name from a royal residence in [[Izmaylovo Estate|Izmailovo]], near [[Moscow]].\n\nOn July 12, 1733, a large field tent operating as a church was consecrated in St. Petersburg, with icons painted on a dark blue satin. However, the church functioned only in the summer, and in winter the soldiers and officers had to attend other parish churches. In 1754\u20131756, a wooden church was built on the site on order of [[Empress Elizabeth]]. The church had two altars, the main one of which was consecrated in the name of the [[Trinity]]. It suffered heavy damage as a result of the flood of 1824 and had to be rebuilt, a commission given by [[Emperor Nicholas I]] to Vasily Stasov.\n\n===Construction of the present church===\n[[File:stasov trinity.jpg|thumb|left|The Trinity Cathedral in St. Petersburg represents a high point of Russian [[Neoclassicism]]]]\n[[File:Trinity Cathedral in Saint Petersburg.jpg|thumb|right|The cathedral with [[Column of Glory]] in 2011]]\n\nConstruction of the new church began in May 1828, and the cathedral was consecrated in May 1835. The cathedral rises to a height of more than {{convert|80|meters|ft}}, and dominates the skyline of the surrounding area. Memorial plaques to regimental officers killed in battle were mounted on the cathedral's wall. After the cathedral's opening, flags, keys from forts and other [[trophy|trophies]] that the regiment won in campaigns in 1854\u20131855 and 1877\u20131878 were also housed in the cathedral.\n\nThe Trinity Cathedral was renowned for its collection of [[icon]]s. The main section of the cathedral housed the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] icon, while the southern section housed the Jesus Christ icon. Empress Elizabeth presented the church with the Beginning of Life Trinity icon in 1742. Other holy objects housed in the cathedral included a large ark made in the form of a cross in 1753 from silver, a large silver cross presented to the cathedral by Nicholas I in 1835, and two large Gospels in valuable bindings.\n\n===Post-Revolution===\nIn 1922, most of the cathedral's valuables were looted, and the thievery continued for several more years until the cathedral was finally closed in 1938. There were rumors of plans to demolish the cathedral and use the remaining material for a district workers' theatre. However, the cathedral was transferred to the Soviet Ministry of Telecommunications, for which it became a warehouse. Only in 1990 did the cathedral return to the hands of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], when restoration began. By that time, the interior was largely bare, compared to the splendor and majesty of its pre-Revolutionary past.\n\n===2006 fire===\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0440 \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u0435-\u0418\u0437\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u0421\u041f\u0431, 24.08.2006 - \u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044b.jpg|alt=The cathedral with the main dome on fire|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Izmailovsky Gostiny Dvor.JPG|thumb|left|Restoration works in April 2008]]\n\nOn August 24, 2006, while the cathedral was under reconstruction, a fire originating on restorers' scaffolding collapsed the main dome, destroyed one of the four smaller domes and severely damaged the interior.<ref>\n{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11578214 Interfax > Politics<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224114/http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11578214 |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref><ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20060825/53157239.html RIA Novosti - Russia - Restorers face long effort at Petersburg cathedral after fire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The fire burned through scaffolding outside the central dome of the cathedral.

A helicopter dumped water on the historic structure. About four hours after the blaze broke out, one of the three remaining cupolas had been damaged but the fire was contained.\n\nThe blaze apparently started on scaffolding on the outside of the church, which was undergoing restoration.

'''Haplogroup O-M122''' \uff08also known as '''Haplogroup O2''' (formerly '''Haplogroup O3''')\uff09is an [[Eurasian|Eastern Eurasian]] [[Y-chromosome]] [[haplogroup]]. The lineage ranges across [[Southeast Asia]] and [[East Asia]], where it dominates the paternal lineages with extremely high frequencies. It is also significantly present in Central Asia, especially among the [[Naimans|Naiman]] tribe of Kazakhs.<ref name=\"Ashirbekov2017\" />\n\nThis lineage is a descendant haplogroup of [[haplogroup O-M175 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup O-M175]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Origins==\nResearchers believe that O-M122 first appeared in [[Southeast Asia]] approximately 25,000-30,000 years ago {{harv|Shi|2009}} or roughly between 30,000 and 35,000 years ago according to more recent studies (Karmin ''et al.'' 2015, Poznik ''et al.'' 2016, YFull January 4, 2018). In a systematic sampling and genetic screening of an East Asian\u2013specific Y-chromosome haplogroup (O-M122) in 2,332 individuals from diverse East Asian populations, results indicate that the O-M122 lineage is dominant in East Asian populations, with an average frequency of 44.3%. Microsatellite data show that the O-M122 haplotypes are more diverse in Southeast Asia than those in northern East Asia {{harv|Shi|2009}}. This suggests a southern origin of the O-M122 mutation to be likely.\n\nIt was also part of the settlement of East Asia. However, the prehistoric peopling of East Asia by modern humans remains controversial with respect to early population migrations and the place of the O-M122 lineage in these migrations is ambivalent.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Distribution==\nAlthough Haplogroup O-M122 appears to be primarily associated with [[Han Chinese|Chinese people]], it also forms a significant component of the Y-chromosome diversity of most modern populations of the East Asian region. \n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n! align=\"center\"

The majority of Tibeto-Burmans, Han Chinese, and Ningxia and Liaoning Hui share paternal Y chromosomes of East Asian origin which are unrelated to Middle Easterners and Europeans. In contrast to distant Middle Eastern and Europeans whom the Muslims of China are not related to, East Asians, Han Chinese, and most of the Hui and Dongxiang of Linxia share more genes with each other. This indicates that native East Asian populations converted to Islam and were culturally assimilated to these ethnicities and that Chinese Muslim populations are mostly not descendants of foreigners as claimed by some accounts while only a small minority of them are.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/srep38656| pmid=27924949| pmc=5141421| title=Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of Chinese Muslim populations Dongxiang and Hui| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=6| pages=38656| year=2016| last1=Yao| first1=Hong-Bing| last2=Wang| first2=Chuan-Chao| last3=Tao| first3=Xiaolan| last4=Shang| first4=Lei| last5=Wen| first5=Shao-Qing| last6=Zhu| first6=Bofeng| last7=Kang| first7=Longli| last8=Jin| first8=Li| last9=Li| first9=Hui}}</ref>\n\n=== South Asia ===\nHaplogroup O-M122 is restricted among tribal groups of [[Northeast India]] where it is found at very high frequencies. In [[Arunachal Pradesh]], it is found at 89% among [[Adi people|Adi]], 82% among [[Apatani people|Apatani]], and 94% among [[Nishi (tribe)|Nishi]], while the [[Naga people]] show it at 76% ({{harvnb|Cordaux|2004}}). In [[Meghalaya]], 59.2% (42/71) of a sample of [[Garo (tribe)|Garos]] and 31.7% (112/353) of a sample of [[Khasi people|Khasis]] have been found to belong to O-M122 {{harv|Reddy|2007}}. In [[Nepal]], [[Tamang]] people present a very high frequency of O-M122 (39/45 = 86.7%), while much lower percentages of [[Newar]] (14/66 = 21.2%) and the general population of [[Kathmandu]] (16/77 = 20.8%) belong to this haplogroup {{harv|Gayden|2007}}. A study published in 2009 found O-M122 in 52.6% (30/57, including 28 members of O-M117 and two members of O-M134(xM117)) of a sample of [[Tharu people|Tharus]] from a village in [[Chitwan District]] of south-central Nepal, 28.6% (22/77, all O-M117) of a sample of Tharus from another village in Chitwan District, and 18.9% (7/37, all O-M117) of a sample of Tharus from a village in [[Morang District]] of southeastern Nepal.<ref name = \"Fornarino2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fornarino | first1 = Simona | last2 = Pala | first2 = Maria | last3 = Battaglia | first3 = Vincenza | display-authors = etal | year = 2009| title = Mitochondrial and Y-chromosome diversity of the Tharus (Nepal): a reservoir of genetic variation | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 2009 | issue = 9| page = 154 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-9-154 | pmid = 19573232 | pmc = 2720951 }}</ref> In contrast, the same study found O-M122 in only one individual in a sample of non-Tharu Hindus collected in Chitwan District (1/26 = 3.8% O-M134(xM117)), one [[Adivasi|tribal]] individual from Andhra Pradesh, India (1/29 = 3.4% O-M117), and one individual in a sample of Hindus from New Delhi, India (1/49 = 2.0% O-M122(xM134)).<ref name = \"Fornarino2009\" />\n\n=== Southeast Asia ===\nAmong all the populations of East and Southeast Asia, Haplogroup O-M122 is most closely associated with those that speak a [[Sinitic languages|Sinitic]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]], or [[Hmong\u2013Mien languages|Hmong\u2013Mien]] language. Haplogroup O-M122 comprises about 50% or more of the total Y-chromosome variation among the populations of each of these language families. The Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman language families are generally believed to be derived from a common [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] protolanguage, and most linguists place the homeland of the Sino-Tibetan language family somewhere in northern China. The Hmong\u2013Mien languages and cultures, for various archaeological and ethnohistorical reasons, are also generally believed to have derived from a source somewhere north of their current distribution, perhaps in northern or central China. The [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], however, despite the fact that they speak a language of the Tibeto-Burman language family, have high percentages of the otherwise rare haplogroups [[Haplogroup D-M15 (Y-DNA)|D-M15]] and [[Haplogroup D3 (Y-DNA)|D3]], which are also found at much lower frequencies among the members of some other ethnic groups in East Asia and Central Asia.\n\nHaplogroup O-M122 has been [https://web.archive.org/web/20060905193504/http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mpcox/publications/Cox_2003_PhD.pdf implicated as a diagnostic [[genetic marker]]] of the [[Austronesian]] expansion when it is found in populations of insular [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]].  It appears at moderately high frequencies in the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]]. Its distribution in Oceania is mostly limited to the traditionally Austronesian culture zones, chiefly [[Polynesia]] (approx. 25% {{harv|Hammer|2005}} to 32.5% {{harv|Su|2000}}).  O-M122 is found at generally lower frequencies in coastal and island [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aboriginal tribes]] (18% {{harv|Hammer|2005}} to 27.4% {{harv|Su|2000}} of [[Micronesia]]ns, and 5% of [[Melanesia]]ns {{harv|Karafet|2005}}, albeit with reduced frequencies of most subclades.\n\nHaplogroup O-M122[[* (haplogroup)|*]] Y-chromosomes, which are not defined by any identified downstream markers, are actually more common among certain non-[[Han Chinese]] populations than among Han Chinese ones, and the presence of these O-M122* Y-chromosomes among various populations of Central Asia, East Asia, and Oceania is more likely to reflect a very ancient shared ancestry of these populations rather than the result of any historical events. It remains to be seen whether Haplogroup O-M122* Y-chromosomes can be parsed into distinct subclades that display significant geographical or ethnic correlations.\n\n===Subclade Distribution===\n\n==== Paragroup O-M122* ====\nParagroup O2*-M122(xO2a-P197) Y-DNA is quite rare, having been detected only in 2/165 = 1.2% of a sample of [[Han Chinese]] in a pool of samples from mainland China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia (n=581), 8/641 = 1.2% of a sample of [[Balinese people|Balinese]] in a pool of samples from western Indonesia (n=960), and 7/350 = 2.0% of a sample of males from [[Sumba]] in a pool of samples from eastern Indonesia (n=957).

However, in a study published by Japanese researchers in the year 2007, the same haplogroup was found with much lower frequency (11/263 = 4.2%) in a larger sample of Japanese from various regions of Japan {{harv|Nonaka et al.|2007}}.\n\nIn [[Meghalaya]], a predominantly tribal state of Northeast India, O-M133 has been found in 19.7% (14/71) of a sample of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking [[Garo people|Garos]], but in only 6.2% (22/353, ranging from 0/32 Bhoi to 6/44 = 13.6% [[Pnar people|Pnar]]) of a pool of eight samples of the neighboring [[Khasic languages|Khasian]]-speaking tribes {{harv|Reddy et al.|2007}}.\n\n==== O-M300 ====\n{{empty section|date=December 2012}}\n\n==== O-M333 ====\n{{empty section|date=December 2012}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Phylogenetics==\n\n===Phylogenetic History===\n{{main|Conversion table for Y chromosome haplogroups}}\nPrior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely. The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c63;\"|'''YCC 2002/2008

'''Haplogroup O-M122''' \uff08also known as '''Haplogroup O2''' (formerly '''Haplogroup O3''')\uff09is an [[Eurasian|Eastern Eurasian]] [[Y-chromosome]] [[haplogroup]]. The lineage ranges across [[Southeast Asia]] and [[East Asia]], where it dominates the paternal lineages with extremely high frequencies. It is also significantly present in Central Asia, especially among the [[Naimans|Naiman]] tribe of Kazakhs.<ref name=\"Ashirbekov2017\" />\n\nThis lineage is a descendant haplogroup of [[haplogroup O-M175 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup O-M175]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Origins==\nResearchers believe that O-M122 first appeared in [[Southeast Asia]] approximately 25,000-30,000 years ago {{harv|Shi|2009}} or roughly between 30,000 and 35,000 years ago according to more recent studies (Karmin ''et al.'' 2015, Poznik ''et al.'' 2016, YFull January 4, 2018). In a systematic sampling and genetic screening of an East Asian\u2013specific Y-chromosome haplogroup (O-M122) in 2,332 individuals from diverse East Asian populations, results indicate that the O-M122 lineage is dominant in East Asian populations, with an average frequency of 44.3%. Microsatellite data show that the O-M122 haplotypes are more diverse in Southeast Asia than those in northern East Asia {{harv|Shi|2009}}. This suggests a southern origin of the O-M122 mutation to be likely.\n\nIt was also part of the settlement of East Asia. However, the prehistoric peopling of East Asia by modern humans remains controversial with respect to early population migrations and the place of the O-M122 lineage in these migrations is ambivalent.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Distribution==\nAlthough Haplogroup O-M122 appears to be primarily associated with [[Han Chinese|Chinese people]], it also forms a significant component of the Y-chromosome diversity of most modern populations of the East Asian region. \n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n! align=\"center\"

The majority of Tibeto-Burmans, Han Chinese, and Ningxia and Liaoning Hui share paternal Y chromosomes of East Asian origin which are unrelated to Middle Easterners and Europeans. In contrast to distant Middle Eastern and Europeans whom the Muslims of China are not related to, East Asians, Han Chinese, and most of the Hui and Dongxiang of Linxia share more genes with each other. This indicates that native East Asian populations converted to Islam and were culturally assimilated to these ethnicities and that Chinese Muslim populations are mostly not descendants of foreigners as claimed by some accounts while only a small minority of them are.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/srep38656| pmid=27924949| pmc=5141421| title=Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of Chinese Muslim populations Dongxiang and Hui| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=6| pages=38656| year=2016| last1=Yao| first1=Hong-Bing| last2=Wang| first2=Chuan-Chao| last3=Tao| first3=Xiaolan| last4=Shang| first4=Lei| last5=Wen| first5=Shao-Qing| last6=Zhu| first6=Bofeng| last7=Kang| first7=Longli| last8=Jin| first8=Li| last9=Li| first9=Hui}}</ref>\n\n=== South Asia ===\nHaplogroup O-M122 is restricted among tribal groups of [[Northeast India]] where it is found at very high frequencies. In [[Arunachal Pradesh]], it is found at 89% among [[Adi people|Adi]], 82% among [[Apatani people|Apatani]], and 94% among [[Nishi (tribe)|Nishi]], while the [[Naga people]] show it at 76% ({{harvnb|Cordaux|2004}}). In [[Meghalaya]], 59.2% (42/71) of a sample of [[Garo (tribe)|Garos]] and 31.7% (112/353) of a sample of [[Khasi people|Khasis]] have been found to belong to O-M122 {{harv|Reddy|2007}}. In [[Nepal]], [[Tamang]] people present a very high frequency of O-M122 (39/45 = 86.7%), while much lower percentages of [[Newar]] (14/66 = 21.2%) and the general population of [[Kathmandu]] (16/77 = 20.8%) belong to this haplogroup {{harv|Gayden|2007}}. A study published in 2009 found O-M122 in 52.6% (30/57, including 28 members of O-M117 and two members of O-M134(xM117)) of a sample of [[Tharu people|Tharus]] from a village in [[Chitwan District]] of south-central Nepal, 28.6% (22/77, all O-M117) of a sample of Tharus from another village in Chitwan District, and 18.9% (7/37, all O-M117) of a sample of Tharus from a village in [[Morang District]] of southeastern Nepal.<ref name = \"Fornarino2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fornarino | first1 = Simona | last2 = Pala | first2 = Maria | last3 = Battaglia | first3 = Vincenza | display-authors = etal | year = 2009| title = Mitochondrial and Y-chromosome diversity of the Tharus (Nepal): a reservoir of genetic variation | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 2009 | issue = 9| page = 154 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-9-154 | pmid = 19573232 | pmc = 2720951 }}</ref> In contrast, the same study found O-M122 in only one individual in a sample of non-Tharu Hindus collected in Chitwan District (1/26 = 3.8% O-M134(xM117)), one [[Adivasi|tribal]] individual from Andhra Pradesh, India (1/29 = 3.4% O-M117), and one individual in a sample of Hindus from New Delhi, India (1/49 = 2.0% O-M122(xM134)).<ref name = \"Fornarino2009\" />\n\n=== Southeast Asia ===\nAmong all the populations of East and Southeast Asia, Haplogroup O-M122 is most closely associated with those that speak a [[Sinitic languages|Sinitic]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]], or [[Hmong\u2013Mien languages|Hmong\u2013Mien]] language. Haplogroup O-M122 comprises about 50% or more of the total Y-chromosome variation among the populations of each of these language families. The Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman language families are generally believed to be derived from a common [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] protolanguage, and most linguists place the homeland of the Sino-Tibetan language family somewhere in northern China. The Hmong\u2013Mien languages and cultures, for various archaeological and ethnohistorical reasons, are also generally believed to have derived from a source somewhere north of their current distribution, perhaps in northern or central China. The [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], however, despite the fact that they speak a language of the Tibeto-Burman language family, have high percentages of the otherwise rare haplogroups [[Haplogroup D-M15 (Y-DNA)|D-M15]] and [[Haplogroup D3 (Y-DNA)|D3]], which are also found at much lower frequencies among the members of some other ethnic groups in East Asia and Central Asia.\n\nHaplogroup O-M122 has been [https://web.archive.org/web/20060905193504/http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mpcox/publications/Cox_2003_PhD.pdf implicated as a diagnostic [[genetic marker]]] of the [[Austronesian]] expansion when it is found in populations of insular [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]].  It appears at moderately high frequencies in the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]]. Its distribution in Oceania is mostly limited to the traditionally Austronesian culture zones, chiefly [[Polynesia]] (approx. 25% {{harv|Hammer|2005}} to 32.5% {{harv|Su|2000}}).  O-M122 is found at generally lower frequencies in coastal and island [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aboriginal tribes]] (18% {{harv|Hammer|2005}} to 27.4% {{harv|Su|2000}} of [[Micronesia]]ns, and 5% of [[Melanesia]]ns {{harv|Karafet|2005}}, albeit with reduced frequencies of most subclades.\n\nHaplogroup O-M122[[* (haplogroup)|*]] Y-chromosomes, which are not defined by any identified downstream markers, are actually more common among certain non-[[Han Chinese]] populations than among Han Chinese ones, and the presence of these O-M122* Y-chromosomes among various populations of Central Asia, East Asia, and Oceania is more likely to reflect a very ancient shared ancestry of these populations rather than the result of any historical events.

However, O-M7 has been found only with low frequency in samples of linguistically related [[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]] populations from northern Laos (1/50 = 2.0% Mal, 1/51 = 2.0% Khmu, 0/28 Bit, 0/29 Xinhmul), [[Vietic languages|Vietic]] peoples from Vietnam and central Laos (8/76 = 10.5% Kinh from Hanoi, Vietnam, 2/28 = 7.1% Bo, 4/70 = 5.7% Vietnamese, 0/12 Muong, 0/15 Kinh, 0/38 Aheu), [[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]] peoples from northwestern Laos and southwestern Yunnan (2/35 = 5.7% Lamet, 0/29 Ava, 0/52 Blang), and [[Pakanic languages|Pakanic]] peoples from southeastern Yunnan and northwestern Guangxi (0/30 Palyu, 0/32 Bugan).{{harv|Cai|2010}}{{harv|Karafet|2010}}{{harv|He|2012}}\n\nHaplogroup O-M7 has been found with notable frequency in some samples of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] populations from the central part of the [[Malay Archipelago]] (17/86 = 19.8% Indonesians from Borneo, 4/32 = 12.5% Malaysia, 7/61 = 11.5% Java (mostly sampled in [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng]])), but the frequency of this haplogroup appears to drop off very quickly toward the east (1/48 = 2.1% Philippines, 5/641 = 0.8% Balinese, 0/48 Taiwanese Aboriginals) and west (0/38 Batak Toba from Sumatra, 0/60 Nias, 0/74 Mentawai). {{harv|Karafet|2010}} O-M7 has been found in 5.1% (3/59) of a sample of the Austronesian-speaking [[Cham people]] from Binh Thuan, Vietnam. {{harv|He|2012}}\n\nIn the northern fringes of its distribution, O-M7 has been found in samples of [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] (2/31 = 6.5%), [[Tujia people|Tujia]] from Hunan (3/49 = 6.1%), [[Qiang people|Qiang]] (2/33 = 6.1%), and [[Han Chinese]] (3/165 = 1.8% Han Chinese, or 2/32 = 6.3% Han from Yili, Xinjiang, 4/66 = 6.1% Han from [[Huize]], Yunnan, 2/35 = 5.7% Han from Meixian, Guangdong, 1/18 = 5.6% Han from Wuhan, Hubei, 6/148 = 4.1% Han from Changting, Fujian, 2/63 = 3.2% Han from Weicheng, Sichuan, 2/100 = 2.0% Han from Nanjing, Jiangsu, 1/55 = 1.8% Han from Shanghai).{{harv|Wen|2004}}{{harv|Xue|2006}}{{harv|Karafet|2010}}\n\n==== O-M134 ====\n\n===== O-M134* =====\nParagroup O-M134(xM117) has been found with very high frequency in some samples of [[Kim Mun language|Kim Mun]] people, a subgroup of the [[Yao people]] of southern China (16/32 = 50.0% Mountain Kimmun from southern Yunnan, 11/28 = 39.3% Blue Kimmun from western Guangxi). However, this paragroup has been detected in only 3/41 = 7.3% of a sample of Lowland Kimmun from eastern Guangxi {{harv|Cai et al.|2011}}. This paragroup also has been found with high frequency in some Kazakh samples, especially the Naiman tribe (102/155 = 65.81%)({{harvnb|Dulik et al.|2011}} and {{harvnb|Lu et al.|2011}}) Dulik hypothesizes that O-M134 in Kazakhs was due to a later expansion due to its much more recent TMRCA time.\n\nThe general outline of the distribution of O-M134(xM117) among modern populations is different as that of the related clade O-M117. In particular, O-M134(xM117) occurs with only low frequency or is nonexistent among most [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking populations of Southwest China, Northeast India, and Nepal, who exhibit extremely high frequencies of O-M117.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This paragroup also occurs with very low frequency or is non-existent among most Mon-Khmer population of Laos, who exhibit much higher frequencies of O-M117 {{harv|Cai et al.|2011}}. In Han Chinese, the paragroup is found in approximately the same percentage as O-M117, but has a higher distribution in northern Han Chinese than Southern Han Chinese {{harv|Yan et al.|2012}}.\n\n===== O-M117 =====\n[[haplogroup O-M117|Haplogroup O2a2b1a1-M117]] (also defined by the phylogenetically equivalent mutation Page23) is a subclade of O2a2b1-M134 that occurs frequently in [[China]] and in neighboring countries, especially among [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking peoples.\n\nO-M117 has been detected in samples of [[Tamang people|Tamang]] (38/45 = 84.4%)\uff0c[[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] (45/156 = 28.8% or 13/35 = 37.1%), [[Tharu people|Tharus]] (57/171 = 33.3%), Han Taiwanese (40/183 = 21.9%), [[Newa people|Newars]] (14/66 = 21.2%), the general population of [[Kathmandu]], Nepal (13/77 = 16.9%), [[Han Chinese]] (5/34 = 14.7% Chengdu, 5/35 = 14.3% Harbin, 4/35 = 11.4% Meixian, 3/30 = 10.0% Lanzhou, 2/32 = 6.3% Yili), [[Tungusic peoples]] from the PRC (7/45 = 15.6% Hezhe, 4/26 = 15.4% Ewenki, 5/35 = 14.3% Manchu, 2/41 = 4.9% Xibe, 1/31 = 3.2% Oroqen), [[Koreans]] (4/25 = 16.0% Koreans from the PRC, 5/43 = 11.6% Koreans from South Korea), [[Mongols]] (5/45 = 11.1% Inner Mongolian, 3/39 = 7.7% Daur, 3/65 = 4.6% Outer Mongolian), and [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] (2/39 = 5.1% [[Yining City|Yili]], 1/31 = 3.2% [[Urumqi]]) ({{harvnb|Xue et al.|2006}}, {{harvnb|Gayden et al.|2007}}, and {{harvnb|Fornarino et al.|2009}}).\n\nLike O-M7, O-M117 has been found with greatly varying frequency in many samples of [[Hmong-Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]]-speaking peoples, such as Mienic peoples (7/20 = 35.0% Mountain Straggler Mien, 9/28 = 32.1% Blue Kimmun, 6/19 = 31.6% Flower Head Mien, 3/11 = 27.3% Top Board Mien, 3/11 = 27.3% Thin Board Mien, 11/47 = 23.4% Western Mien, 6/33 = 18.2% Northern Mien, 5/31 = 16.1% Lowland Yao, 5/35 = 14.3% Yao from Liannan, Guangdong, 5/37 = 13.5% Zaomin, 5/41 = 12.2% Lowland Kimmun, 3/41 = 7.3% Native Mien, 2/31 = 6.5% Southern Mien, 2/32 = 6.3% Mountain Kimmun, but 0/35 Yao from Bama, Guangxi), She (6/34 = 17.6% She, 4/56 = 7.1% Northern She), and Hmongic peoples (9/100 = 9.0% Miao from Hunan, 4/51 = 7.8% Hmong Daw from northern Laos, 3/49 = 6.1% Miao from Yunnan, 1/49 = 2.0% Miao from Guizhou, but 0/36 Bunu from Guangxi) ({{harvnb|Cai et al.|2011}} and {{harvnb|Xue et al.|2006}}).\n\nIn a study published by Chinese researchers in the year 2006, O-M117 was found with high frequency (8/47 = 17.0%) in a sample of Japanese of undescribed geographical origin {{harv|Xue et al.|2006}}. However, in a study published by Japanese researchers in the year 2007, the same haplogroup was found with much lower frequency (11/263 = 4.2%) in a larger sample of Japanese from various regions of Japan {{harv|Nonaka et al.|2007}}.\n\nIn [[Meghalaya]], a predominantly tribal state of Northeast India, O-M133 has been found in 19.7% (14/71) of a sample of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking [[Garo people|Garos]], but in only 6.2% (22/353, ranging from 0/32 Bhoi to 6/44 = 13.6% [[Pnar people|Pnar]]) of a pool of eight samples of the neighboring [[Khasic languages|Khasian]]-speaking tribes {{harv|Reddy et al.|2007}}.\n\n==== O-M300 ====\n{{empty section|date=December 2012}}\n\n==== O-M333 ====\n{{empty section|date=December 2012}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Phylogenetics==\n\n===Phylogenetic History===\n{{main|Conversion table for Y chromosome haplogroups}}\nPrior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely. The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c63;\"|'''YCC 2002/2008
