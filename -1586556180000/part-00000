Most notable of these being the continued landings and relaunches of the first stage of Falcon 9. As of March 2020, SpaceX has used a single first-stage booster, [[Falcon 9 booster B1048|B1048]], at most five times. SpaceX is defined as a private space company and thus its achievements can also be counted as firsts by a private company. \n\nLandmark achievements of SpaceX in chronological order include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yaabot.com/8479/rise-rise-spacex/ |title=The Rise and Rise of SpaceX| author=Mir Juned Hussain |publisher=Yaabot |accessdate=March 1, 2017 }}</ref>\n* The first privately funded liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit ([[Falcon 1#Fourth flight|Falcon 1 flight 4]] on 28 September 2008)\n* The first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to put a commercial satellite in orbit ([[RazakSAT]] on Falcon 1 flight 5 on 14 July 2009)\n* The first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft ([[SpaceX Dragon]] on [[SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1|COTS Demo Flight 1]] on 9 December 2010)\n* The first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station ([[Dragon C2+]] on 25 May 2012)\n* The first private company to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit ([[SES-8]] on Falcon 9 flight 7 on 3 December 2013)\n* The first landing of an orbital rocket's first stage on land ([[Falcon 9 flight 20]] on 22 December 2015)\n* The first landing of an orbital rocket's first stage on an ocean platform ([[Falcon 9 flight 23]] on 8 April 2016)\n* The first relaunch and landing of a used orbital rocket stage ([[B1021]] on [[Falcon 9 flight 32]] on 30 March 2017)<ref name=\":2\"/>\n* The first controlled flyback and recovery of a payload fairing (Falcon 9 flight 32 on 30 March 2017)<ref name=\"fairingrec\">{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/04/01/spacex-nose-cone-falcon9/ |title=SpaceX, In Another First, Recovers $6 Million Nose Cone From Reused Falcon 9|publisher=Fortune.com|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n* The first reflight of a commercial cargo spacecraft.

SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages within a short period, and the spacecraft was able to successfully complete its mission to and from the [[International Space Station]].\n\nIn late June 2015, [[SpaceX CRS-7|CRS-7]] launched a [[SpaceX Dragon|Cargo Dragon]] atop a [[Falcon 9]] to resupply the [[International Space Station]]. All [[telemetry]] readings were nominal until 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight, when a loss of helium pressure was detected and a cloud of vapor appeared outside the second stage. A few seconds after this, the second stage exploded. The first stage continued to fly for a few seconds before disintegrating due to [[Dynamic pressure|aerodynamic forces]].

{"title_page": "Biolinguistics", "text_new": "{{short description|The study of the biology and evolution of language}}\n[[File:Palmarini Pio Manz\u00f9.jpg|thumb|Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]]\n'''Biolinguistics''' is the study of the biological foundations of language first introduced by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the University of Arizona. At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. Biolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work that began in the 1950s as a reaction to then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\". Hacettepe \u00fcniversitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi \u00d6\u011fretim \u00fcyesi.  https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/88422</ref> Chomsky and Lenneberg militated against it by arguing for the innate knowledge of language. Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which is that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was in effect the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from American linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]]. The term \u201cbiolinguistics\u201d was coined by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini at a 1971 international meeting at MIT, and the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

At around the same time, [[geneticist]]s discovered a link between the language deficit manifest by the [[KE family]] members and the gene [[FOXP2]]. Although FOXP2 is not the gene responsible for language,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Why Only Us|date=2016|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262333351|doi = 10.7551/mitpress/10684.001.0001}}</ref> this discovery brought many linguists and scientists together to interpret this data, renewing the interest of biolinguistics.\n\nAlthough many linguists have differing opinions when it comes to the history of biolinguistics, Chomsky believes that the history of biolinguistics was simply the history of [[transformational grammar]]. While Di Sciullo claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, the linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics originated in the 1970s, and that it is not synonymous with transformational grammar, but rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by Charles Darwin, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values). It also contends that humans possess generative grammar, which is hard-wired into the human brain in some ways and makes it possible for young children to do the rapid and universal acquisition of speech.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Logan |first1=Robert K |title=The extended mind : the emergence of language, the human mind, and culture |date=2007 |publisher=Toronto : University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802093035 }}</ref> Elements of linguistic variation then determine the growth of language in the individual, and variation is the result of experience, given the genetic endowment and independent principles reducing complexity.\n\n=====Language Acquisition Device=====\n\n{{Main|Language Acquisition}}\n\nProposed by Chomsky in the 1960s, the [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was purported to be an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In  ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggested that different aspects of human biology that putitively contribute to language more than genes at play, for while they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguistics\u2014including Chomsky(ans)\u2014sometimes seem to imply. Contrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg approached language as a species-specific mental organ with non-trivial biological properties, which grows in the mind/brain of the child in the same way that (other) biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBase on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits (including language), or, put similarly, that genes can contain traits. Lenneberg then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon ontogenesis, criticizing prior hypothesis by Goodwin of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Recent Development ====\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language, in particular, is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This human biological endowment for language acquisition is known as [[Universal Grammar|Universal Grammar (UG)]], which is also considered as the initial state of the Language Acquisition Device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crain |first1=Stephen |last2=Koring |first2=Loes |last3=Thornton |first3=Rosalind |title=Language acquisition from a biolinguistic perspective |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2017 |volume=81 |issue=Pt B |pages=120\u2013149 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.004|pmid=27633153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berwick |first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky |first2=Noam |title=Why only us: Language and evolution |date=2016 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=9780262034241 |pages=89\u2013108}}</ref> UG contains core principles that are common to all languages and information on the ways that each language differs, and information on the language variations are encoded in parameters.

In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point.

This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n\n===People in biolinguistics===\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

So named by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini at a 1971 international meeting at MIT, biolinguistics is a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. Biolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work that began in the 1950s as a reaction to then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from American linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values). It also contends that humans possess generative grammar, which is hard-wired into the human brain in some ways and makes it possible for young children to do the rapid and universal acquisition of speech.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Logan |first1=Robert K |title=The extended mind : the emergence of language, the human mind, and culture |date=2007 |publisher=Toronto : University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802093035 }}</ref> Elements of linguistic variation then determine the growth of language in the individual, and variation is the result of experience, given the genetic endowment and independent principles reducing complexity.\n\n=====Language Acquisition Device=====\n\n{{Main|Language Acquisition}}\n\nProposed by Chomsky in the 1960s, the [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was purported to be an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref>\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the human faculty of language proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In  ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggested that different aspects of human biology that putitively contribute to language more than genes at play, for while they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguistics\u2014including Chomsky(ans)\u2014sometimes seem to imply. Contrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg approached language as a species-specific mental organ with non-trivial biological properties, which grows in the mind/brain of the child in the same way that (other) biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBase on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits (including language), or, put similarly, that genes can contain traits. Lenneberg then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon ontogenesis, criticizing prior hypothesis by Goodwin of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Recent Development ====\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language, in particular, is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\". ''Annual Review of Linguistics''. '''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n\n===People in biolinguistics===\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

The building became state property in 1724 and was used as a  spinning house (''spinnhus'').  In 1825 the spinnhus was relocated to [[Norrmalm]]. After the move, [[L\u00e5ngholmen Prison]]started to operate on the grounds.  L\u00e5ngholmen Prison  was built 1874\u20141880 as the central prison of Sweden, and was temporary closed down between 1972\u20141975.

His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering.\n\nThough Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his career, Brunel achieved many engineering firsts, including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a [[Navigability|navigable river]] and the development of the {{SS|Great Britain}}, the first propeller-driven, ocean-going, iron ship, which, when launched in 1843, was the largest ship ever built.{{sfn|Wilson|1994|pp=202\u201303}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ssgreatbritain.org/Brunel.aspx | title = Isambard Kingdom Brunel | publisher = SS Great Britain | date = 29 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn the GWR, Brunel set standards for a well-built railway, using careful surveys to minimise gradients and curves. This necessitated expensive construction techniques, new bridges, new viaducts, and the {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in|adj=mid}} long [[Box Tunnel]]. One controversial feature was the wide [[Track gauge|gauge]], a \"broad gauge\" of {{RailGauge|7ft0.25in}}, instead of what was later to be known as \"[[standard gauge]]\" of {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in}}. He astonished Britain by proposing to extend the GWR westward to North America by building steam-powered, iron-hulled ships. He designed and built three ships that revolutionised naval engineering: the {{SS|Great Western}} (1838), the {{SS|Great Britain}} (1843), and the {{SS|Great Eastern}} (1859).\n\nIn 2002, Brunel was placed second in a [[BBC]] public poll to determine the \"[[100 Greatest Britons]]\". In 2006, the bicentenary of his birth, a major programme of events celebrated his life and work under the name ''Brunel 200''.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.brunel200.com/\n|title= Home\n|publisher=Brunel 200\n|accessdate=22 July 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel was born on 9 April 1806 in Britain Street, [[Portsea Island|Portsea]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], where his father was working on [[Portsmouth Block Mills|block-making machinery]].{{sfn|Brunel|1870|p=2}}<ref>{{cite book\n | last= Timbs\n | first= John\n | year= 1860\n | title= Stories of inventors and discoverers in science and the useful arts\n | url= https://archive.org/details/storiesinventor02timbgoog\n | pages= [https://archive.org/details/storiesinventor02timbgoog/page/n119 102], 285\u201386\n | place= London\n | publisher= Kent and Co\n | oclc= 1349834\n}}</ref> He was named [[Isambard]] after his father, the French civil engineer Sir [[Marc Isambard Brunel]], and Kingdom after his English mother, [[Sophia Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Brindle, birth\" >{{Cite book\n  |last=Brindle  |first=Steven\n  |title=Brunel: The Man Who Built the World\n  |year=2005\n  |isbn=978-0-297-84408-2\n  |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson\n  |ref=harv\n  |page=28\n}}</ref>\n \nHe had two older sisters, Sophia, the oldest child,<ref>{{cite web\n | title= Isambard Kingdom Brunel: Family History\n | work= tracingancestors-uk.com\n | url= http://tracingancestors-uk.com/genealogies-of-the-famous/isambard-kingdom-brunel-family-history\n}}</ref> and Emma, and the whole family moved to [[London]] in 1808 for his father's work. Brunel had a happy childhood, despite the family's constant money worries, with his father acting as his teacher during his early years. His father taught him drawing and observational techniques from the age of four and Brunel had learned [[Euclidean geometry]] by eight. During this time he also learned fluent French and the basic principles of engineering. He was encouraged to draw interesting buildings and identify any faults in their structure.<ref name=\"Buchanan18\">Buchanan (2006), p. 18</ref>{{sfn|Gillings|2006|pp=1, 11}}\n\nWhen Brunel was eight he was sent to Dr Morrell's boarding school in [[Hove]], where he learned [[the classics]].

The [[Great Western Steamship Company]] was formed by Thomas Guppy for that purpose. It was widely disputed whether it would be commercially viable for a ship powered purely by steam to make such long journeys. Technological developments in the early 1830s\u2014including the invention of the [[surface condenser]], which allowed boilers to run on salt water without stopping to be cleaned\u2014made longer journeys more possible, but it was generally thought that a ship would not be able to carry enough fuel for the trip and have room for a commercial cargo. Brunel applied the experimental evidence of [[Mark Beaufoy|Beaufoy]]{{sfn|Beaufoy|1834}} and further developed the theory that the amount a ship could carry increased as the cube of its dimensions, whereas the amount of resistance a ship experienced from the water as it travelled only increased by a square of its dimensions.{{sfn|Garrison|1998|p=188}} This would mean that moving a larger ship would take proportionately less fuel than a smaller ship. To test this theory, Brunel offered his services for free to the Great Western Steamship Company, which appointed him to its building committee and entrusted him with designing its first ship, the {{SS|Great Western||2}}.{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|pp=57\u201359}}<ref name=\"Beckett 2006, pp. 171\u2013173\">Beckett (2006), pp. 171\u201373</ref>{{sfn|Dumpleton|Miller|2002|pp=34\u201346}}\n\n[[File:Great eastern launch attempt.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An old photograph showing a large iron paddlewheel ship being launched sideways, with workmen thrusting large baulks of timber under a large drum of iron chains|{{SS|Great Eastern||2}} shortly before launch in 1858]]\n[[File:Great Eastern 1866-crop.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Great Eastern'' in 1866]]\nWhen it was built, the ''Great Western'' was the longest ship in the world at {{convert|236|ft|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|250|ft|adj=on}} [[keel]]. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. In addition to its steam-powered [[paddle wheel]]s, the ship carried four masts for sails. The ''Great Western'' embarked on her maiden voyage from [[Avonmouth]], Bristol, to New York on 8 April 1838 with {{convert|600|LT|kg|abbr=on}} of coal, cargo and seven passengers on board. Brunel himself missed this initial crossing, having been injured during a fire aboard the ship as she was returning from fitting out in London. As the fire delayed the launch several days, the ''Great Western'' missed its opportunity to claim title as the first ship to cross the Atlantic under steam power alone. Even with a four-day [[Head start (positioning)|head start]], the competing {{SS|Sirius|1837|2}} arrived only one day earlier and its crew was forced to burn cabin furniture, spare yards and one mast for fuel. In contrast, the ''Great Western'' crossing of the Atlantic took 15 days and five hours, and the ship arrived at her destination with a third of its coal still remaining, demonstrating that Brunel's calculations were correct. The ''Great Western'' had proved the viability of commercial transatlantic steamship service, which led the Great Western Steamboat Company to use her in regular service between Bristol and New York from 1838 to 1846. She made 64&nbsp;crossings, and was the first ship to hold the [[Blue Riband]] with a crossing time of 13&nbsp;days westbound and 12&nbsp;days 6 hours eastbound. The service was commercially successful enough for a sister ship to be required, which Brunel was asked to design.<ref name=\"Beckett 2006, pp. 171\u2013173\"/>{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|pp=58\u201359}}{{sfn|Dumpleton|Miller|2002|pp=26\u201332}}\n\nBrunel had become convinced of the superiority of [[propeller#Marine|propeller]]-driven ships over paddle wheels.

His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering.\n\nThough Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his career, Brunel achieved many engineering firsts, including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a [[Navigability|navigable river]] and the development of {{SS|Great Britain}}, the first propeller-driven, ocean-going, iron ship, which, when launched in 1843, was the largest ship ever built.{{sfn|Wilson|1994|pp=202\u201303}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ssgreatbritain.org/Brunel.aspx | title = Isambard Kingdom Brunel | publisher = SS Great Britain | date = 29 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn the GWR, Brunel set standards for a well-built railway, using careful surveys to minimise gradients and curves. This necessitated expensive construction techniques, new bridges, new viaducts, and the {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in|adj=mid}} long [[Box Tunnel]]. One controversial feature was the wide [[Track gauge|gauge]], a \"broad gauge\" of {{RailGauge|7ft0.25in}}, instead of what was later to be known as \"[[standard gauge]]\" of {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in}}. He astonished Britain by proposing to extend the GWR westward to North America by building steam-powered, iron-hulled ships. He designed and built three ships that revolutionised naval engineering: the {{SS|Great Western}} (1838), the {{SS|Great Britain}} (1843), and the {{SS|Great Eastern}} (1859).\n\nIn 2002, Brunel was placed second in a [[BBC]] public poll to determine the \"[[100 Greatest Britons]]\". In 2006, the bicentenary of his birth, a major programme of events celebrated his life and work under the name ''Brunel 200''.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.brunel200.com/\n|title= Home\n|publisher=Brunel 200\n|accessdate=22 July 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel was born on 9 April 1806 in Britain Street, [[Portsea Island|Portsea]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], where his father was working on [[Portsmouth Block Mills|block-making machinery]].{{sfn|Brunel|1870|p=2}}<ref>{{cite book\n | last= Timbs\n | first= John\n | year= 1860\n | title= Stories of inventors and discoverers in science and the useful arts\n | url= https://archive.org/details/storiesinventor02timbgoog\n | pages= [https://archive.org/details/storiesinventor02timbgoog/page/n119 102], 285\u201386\n | place= London\n | publisher= Kent and Co\n | oclc= 1349834\n}}</ref> He was named [[Isambard]] after his father, the French civil engineer Sir [[Marc Isambard Brunel]], and Kingdom after his English mother, [[Sophia Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Brindle, birth\" >{{Cite book\n  |last=Brindle  |first=Steven\n  |title=Brunel: The Man Who Built the World\n  |year=2005\n  |isbn=978-0-297-84408-2\n  |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson\n  |ref=harv\n  |page=28\n}}</ref>\n \nHe had two older sisters, Sophia, the oldest child,<ref>{{cite web\n | title= Isambard Kingdom Brunel: Family History\n | work= tracingancestors-uk.com\n | url= http://tracingancestors-uk.com/genealogies-of-the-famous/isambard-kingdom-brunel-family-history\n}}</ref> and Emma, and the whole family moved to [[London]] in 1808 for his father's work. Brunel had a happy childhood, despite the family's constant money worries, with his father acting as his teacher during his early years. His father taught him drawing and observational techniques from the age of four and Brunel had learned [[Euclidean geometry]] by eight. During this time he also learned fluent French and the basic principles of engineering. He was encouraged to draw interesting buildings and identify any faults in their structure.<ref name=\"Buchanan18\">Buchanan (2006), p. 18</ref>{{sfn|Gillings|2006|pp=1, 11}}\n\nWhen Brunel was eight he was sent to Dr Morrell's boarding school in [[Hove]], where he learned [[the classics]]. His father, a Frenchman by birth, was determined that Brunel should have access to the high-quality education he had enjoyed in his youth in France; accordingly, at the age of 14, the younger Brunel was enrolled first at the [[University of Caen Normandy]], then at ''[[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]]'' in Paris.<ref name=\"Buchanan18\" /><ref name=\"1870p5\" >Brunel, Isambard (1870), p. 5.</ref>\n\nWhen Brunel was 15, his father Marc, who had accumulated debts of over \u00a35,000, was sent to a [[debtors' prison]]. After three months went by with no prospect of release, Marc let it be known that he was considering an offer from the [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar of Russia]]. In August 1821, facing the prospect of losing a prominent engineer, the government relented and issued Marc \u00a35,000 to clear his debts in exchange for his promise to remain in Britain.{{sfn|Gillings|2006|pp= 11\u201312}}<ref>{{cite book\n | last= Worth\n | first= Martin\n | year= 1999\n | title= Sweat and Inspiration: Pioneers of the Industrial Age\n | page= 87\n | publisher= Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd.\n | isbn= 978-0-7509-1660-8\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen Brunel completed his studies at ''Henri-IV'' in 1822, his father had him presented as a candidate at the renowned engineering school ''[[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]]'', but as a foreigner he was deemed ineligible for entry.

The [[Great Western Steamship Company]] was formed by Thomas Guppy for that purpose. It was widely disputed whether it would be commercially viable for a ship powered purely by steam to make such long journeys. Technological developments in the early 1830s\u2014including the invention of the [[surface condenser]], which allowed boilers to run on salt water without stopping to be cleaned\u2014made longer journeys more possible, but it was generally thought that a ship would not be able to carry enough fuel for the trip and have room for a commercial cargo. Brunel applied the experimental evidence of [[Mark Beaufoy|Beaufoy]]{{sfn|Beaufoy|1834}} and further developed the theory that the amount a ship could carry increased as the cube of its dimensions, whereas the amount of resistance a ship experienced from the water as it travelled only increased by a square of its dimensions.{{sfn|Garrison|1998|p=188}} This would mean that moving a larger ship would take proportionately less fuel than a smaller ship. To test this theory, Brunel offered his services for free to the Great Western Steamship Company, which appointed him to its building committee and entrusted him with designing its first ship, the {{SS|Great Western||2}}.{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|pp=57\u201359}}<ref name=\"Beckett 2006, pp. 171\u2013173\">Beckett (2006), pp. 171\u201373</ref>{{sfn|Dumpleton|Miller|2002|pp=34\u201346}}\n\n[[File:Great eastern launch attempt.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An old photograph showing a large iron paddlewheel ship being launched sideways, with workmen thrusting large baulks of timber under a large drum of iron chains|{{SS|Great Eastern||2}} shortly before launch in 1858]]\n[[File:Great Eastern 1866-crop.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Great Eastern'' in 1866]]\nWhen it was built, the ''Great Western'' was the longest ship in the world at {{convert|236|ft|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|250|ft|adj=on}} [[keel]]. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. In addition to its steam-powered [[paddle wheel]]s, the ship carried four masts for sails. The ''Great Western'' embarked on her maiden voyage from [[Avonmouth]], Bristol, to New York on 8 April 1838 with {{convert|600|LT|kg|abbr=on}} of coal, cargo and seven passengers on board. Brunel himself missed this initial crossing, having been injured during a fire aboard the ship as she was returning from fitting out in London. As the fire delayed the launch several days, the ''Great Western'' missed its opportunity to claim title as the first ship to cross the Atlantic under steam power alone. Even with a four-day [[Head start (positioning)|head start]], the competing {{SS|Sirius|1837|2}} arrived only one day earlier and its crew was forced to burn cabin furniture, spare yards and one mast for fuel. In contrast, the ''Great Western'' crossing of the Atlantic took 15 days and five hours, and the ship arrived at her destination with a third of its coal still remaining, demonstrating that Brunel's calculations were correct. The ''Great Western'' had proved the viability of commercial transatlantic steamship service, which led the Great Western Steamboat Company to use her in regular service between Bristol and New York from 1838 to 1846. She made 64&nbsp;crossings, and was the first ship to hold the [[Blue Riband]] with a crossing time of 13&nbsp;days westbound and 12&nbsp;days 6 hours eastbound. The service was commercially successful enough for a sister ship to be required, which Brunel was asked to design.<ref name=\"Beckett 2006, pp. 171\u2013173\"/>{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|pp=58\u201359}}{{sfn|Dumpleton|Miller|2002|pp=26\u201332}}\n\nBrunel had become convinced of the superiority of [[propeller#Marine|propeller]]-driven ships over paddle wheels.

It was built from 1828 to 1835 by Thomas Michael Pembroke. It is also known as '''Woodman's Inn''', '''King's Arms Inn''', '''Woodford Apartments''', '''Buss's Apartments''', '''Woodford House and Academy School'''.

Soldiers and colonial officials were some of their guests. Pembroke was granted a further {{convert|48|acre|ha|order=flip}} at what was then known as \"Twenty Mile Hollow\". He fell on hard times, heavily mortgaging the property and being sentenced to two years on a road gang for stealing slabs of wood at [[Springwood, New South Wales|Springwood]]. His sentence was later reduced to one year but forced him to sell \"The Woodman Inn\" in 1839.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606>BMACHO, 2014.</ref> In 1839 he sold it to Michael Hogan.

From 1867 until 1897 it was a private country retreat, owned by Alfred Fairfax, and from 1897 to 1907 it was a boarding house.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=7}} In 1863 a railway plan denotes the buildings as the 'King's Arms Inn' showing the main building and dairy building in their existing form.

In August 1868 the widow Mrs Buss sold the property to Alfred Fairfax. A March 1869 sketch of \"Buss's\" by John Vine Hall shows the present complex. In October 1869 it was advertised as 'Mountain air Woodford (late Buss's) Apartments vacant J.Sheils'.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13193212?searchTerm=Mountain |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=9 October 1869 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1869 Woodford was possibly occupied by caretaker Sheils. The property was then {{convert|90|acre|ha|order=flip}}. An 1869 drawing by Vine Hall shows the main and dairy buildings in their present form.

Fairfax renamed his home \"Woodford House\" and built the second storey east wing, primarily to accommodate his Sydney friends and their servants. It became an exclusive retreat for he and his friends. During his time here he bought more land {{circa|1868}} and then owned 90 acres on which he created an orchard and house garden to provide fresh food for his guests.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606/> Fairfax had \"house and servants\" at Woodford.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nIn 1874 an observation was made of the transit of Venus 200 yards to the west of Woodford. Members of the scientific community visited the Fairfax property to observe the phenomenon. Portable observatories were set up in tents for the observations.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nIn 1876 the property was leased or at least in the possession of Mr. Hague-Smith. In 1879 the house was still described as Mr. Fairfax's \"commodious residence and large gardens namded Woodford\". In {{circa|1880}} Hague-Smith made additions to the kitchen building and opened the property as a guest house: \"Woodford House\".<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nFrom October 1881 until 1907 it is said to have been a fashionable guest and function house. Names of clients included George Walker, Arnott, Sir [[William Patrick Manning]] and Sir Archibold Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nOn 29 June 1897 (Fairfax losing money in his financial dealings in mining ventures)<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606/> the property was put up for auction and sold to David Flannery.

At University and College he was enabled to indulge his passions for classical literature, and extended them into English literature, while living a vigorous outdoor and sporting life. After graduation he was founding headmaster of Dr. Aspinall's [[Scots College (Sydney)|Scots College]] in Sydney (now in [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]]). He left to found his own school, the Australian College and then went to [[Queensland]] to be senior classics master at the renowned [[Ipswich Grammar School]].<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=7}} In 1903 he returned to NSW's central west to be rector of Cooerwull Academy, but again ventured out to create a school of his own in 1907. This was Woodford Academy, directed, like Cooerwull, towards the Sydney University entry examination and elite learning generally. This was a significant school, in competition and then in succession to Lithgow's Cooerwull Academy (which McManamey had been rector of from 1903-7). Woodford Academy was a case of adapting much older buildings to school use, while supplementing the old with a custom-made wing.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=7}}\n\nOver 300 students were educated in the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] location between 1907 and 1925, benefitting from a curriculum based on the liberal arts with commercial subjects available for those intending to enter business life. There are tales of daily morning swims, even in the winter months, to encourage hygiene and develop character. Confident that his students would \"make their mark on history\", McManamey encouraged his boys to engrave their initials into their school desks and the rock shelves that surround the school buildings. They did so, but many made their mark in ways unimaginable at the time, distinguishing themselves for their actions in both world wars.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2613>Burgess, 2014, 8</ref><ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nIn December 1908 it was subdivided and the greater part sold to Mary Jane Waterhouse, mother of [[Eben Gowrie Waterhouse]], later of Sydney University and [[Eryldene, Gordon]]. In 1910 the timber concert room was blown over.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=13}} In 1913 Mrs McManamey died.

Their names are listed on an Honour Roll Call, and the National Trust's Woodford Academy Management Committee hopes family and friends will recognise names and come forward with additional information on the boys. This will be added to research carried out as the basis for a display at the Academy commemorating the centenary of the Anzacs from August 2014 to November 2018.

Cutting-edge performances using local talent to interpret the historic complex with sound, light, coour, taste - in new ways not before contemplated. Ghosts provide evening entertainment. The \"Make your mark in history\" project, developed to commemorate students of the Academy who fought in World War I received a 2015 National Trust Heritage Award. The [[Norman Lindsay Gallery]], Everglades and Woodford Academy were all represented in the Blue Mountains Winter Magic street festival which attracted over 30,000 people.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2464>[[National Trust of Australia]], 2015, 4.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n===Site===\nThe features contemporary with the construction of the building such as [[sandstone]] flagging, the stone tank, make a large contribution to the significance of the complex and should be considered as an integral part of the buildings. Not much seems to have survived from the Fairfax and guest house periods with the possible exception of some of the paving and perhaps the water pumps. These are also important as parts of this phase of the development of the buildings.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nOf all the site features however, the engraved (with boy students of the Academy's names: there are many such, e.g. RSBS who was Ralph Sanders Barclay Sillar, a student in 1909 and after World War I, a successful lawyer, who lived on until 1970<ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>) on the massive rock shelves at the site's rear (east) are probably the most interesting because they graphically demonstrate the use of the building as a school in the early 20th century. The various names personalise the history of the building (sic: site).<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nIn addition to any inherent significance the landscape at the site may have (not surveyed) the existing landscape does provide an aesthetically pleasing setting for the historic buildings. A number of the mature trees are clearly remnants of the Victorian and Edwardian period(s).<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=24}}\n\nFour Monterey pine trees (''Pinus radiata'') flank the south-west edge of the property onto the Great Western Highway. A large mature and significant eucalypt tree grows close to the centre of the main building facing the highway. Three more Monterey pines, two poplars, a lemon-scented gum and two paths - one stone, one brick, comprise the southern front boundary plantings, running roughly from mid-main building to both sides of the rough [[driveway]] and the property's eastern boundary shared with the Presbyterian church.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nTo the west of the building complex an area of poplars, suckers and undergrowth with Nile lilies (''Agapanthus orientalis''/''praecox''), weeds and other undergrowth existed.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/> To the north (rear) of the building complex a similar area of poplar suckers, undergrowth, rubbish tip, septic tank, piles of building debris, a fruit tree and black bean (''Castanospermum australe'') fill the \"[[courtyard]]\" space between wing buildings which are located at right angles to the main building. Areaas of sandstone paving are also part of this \"space\".<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nA concrete drive and garage building are located to the main building complex's east, the former located close to the Presbyterian church across the boundary.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2626>Stuart Read, from plan in CLP, 1984</ref><ref name=nswshr-1509/> Inspection of the site indicates curtilage lines other than the boundaries of the present land ownership are appropriate. The mid-range views of paddocks from the rear of the property are pleasant and it would be unfortunate if this area were developed. The boundary here is very close and a more suitable line is at the old fence line further to the north.<ref name=nswshr-1509/> The lot to the east (Presbyterian church) is the most intrusive of the neighbouring properties and here the boundary is also very close. A more suitable line is the west side of the church.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nNone of the neighbouring buildings are particularly detrimental to the character of the Woodford Academy. The most significant surviving feature of the site is the maintenance of the historic link between the buildings and the Great Western Highway. Here the curtilage should extend to the railway property on the other side of the road with the view of controlling development directly opposite the site.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=16}}\n\n===Building complex===\nThe Woodford Academy shows layers of growth from the original two-roomed inn at the east end of the south block to the present footprint.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\n====Original South Wing====\nThe original south wing (i.e., east end) is a symmetrical single storey sandstone building facing south to the Great Western Highway. The gabled roof is clad in galvanised iron (Moorewood & Rogers) tiles and has a brick [[chimney]] at the east end. A [[veranda]]h on the south side is broken back to the main roof and has a beaded verandah plate, stop chamfered [[columns]] and a flagged floor. A 6-panel door with bead flush lower panels, fielded top panels and a diagonally divided toplight is at the centre of the wing. It is flanked by 8 over 8 pane double hung windows. The north wall of the original wing has 2 no. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows. Floor is abutted boards (not [[Tongue and groove|tongue-and-groove]]).<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\n====West Extension (South Wing)====\nThe west extension of the south wing is an L-shaped gabled wing with a sandstone chimney at the west end. The verandah roofline is an extension of the original verandah but is skillioned. The galvanised iron (Moorewood & Rogers) tile roof is also used on this extension and has boxed [[eaves]]. A pair of [[french doors]] with bead flush lower panel and a toplight open to the east end of the verandah. A pair of 2 panelled doors with a toplight are off centre in the south wall opening to the verandah. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows with 3 pane toplights are also in this wall.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nA 4-panel door opens from the east side of the west leg of the wing. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows are in the north and south gabled wails with 4 over 6 pane double hung windows built to imitate [[Casement window|casements]], in the [[gable]] above. The windows in the south wall are shuttered. The west wall of the wing has 6 over 6 pane double hung windows. 2 no. [[hipped roof]] [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] form dormers are in the west roof slope and have double hung windows detailed to look like casements. The sandstone verandah flagging extends around the wing.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 20 June 2013, the property in early 1984 (both site and buildings) were in very poor condition<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=16}} pre repair and conservation works).

[[art gallery]] and [[coffeehouse]] at 90-92 [[Great Western Highway]], [[Woodford, New South Wales|Woodford]] in the [[City of Blue Mountains]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was built from 1828 to 1835 by Thomas Michael Pembroke. It is also known as '''Woodman's Inn''', '''King's Arms Inn''', '''Woodford Apartments''', '''Buss's Apartments''', '''Woodford House and Academy School'''. The property is owned by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW). It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 1 March 2002.<ref name=nswshr-1509>{{cite NSW SHR|5051258|Woodford Academy|hr=01509|fn=H00/00219/001, 10/04374|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe site was that of an early road gang's encampment.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599>Jack, 2014.</ref>{{rp|page=7}}\n\nIn November 1824 Thomas Michael Pembroke was promised a [[land grant]] of {{convert|50|acre|ha|order=flip}}. In the late 1820s the site was occupied by [[William James (general)|William James]].<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=9}} By 1830 James had erected improvements on the land.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601>CLP, 1984.</ref>{{rp|page=13}}\n\nIn November 1830 Pembroke was promised {{convert|2|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land.{{Circa|1830}} he applied for his land at Twenty Mile Hollow (Woodford). By 1831 Pembroke had made a selection of land at the site partly including James' improvements. By September 1832 Pembroke was given possession of the land. By 1833 Pembroke's hut existed (on the right hand (north) side of the road adjacent to James' improvements.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=13}} His weatherboard 'Woodman's Inn' possibly existed by 1833;<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=12}} it definitely existed by 1835 (Licensee Michael Pembroke)<ref name=nswshr-1509-2604>Australian Almanac & Directory, in CLP, 1984.</ref>{{rp|page=12}} when described by Messrs.

By 1835 Woodman's Inn (in weatherboard) existed on the site of the early road gangs' encampment at Twenty Mile Hollow. In 1836 William James stood trial for the murder of his wife.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=9}} Pembroke called it the \"The Woodman Inn\" and he lived there with his wife and 6 children. The inn provided food and lodgings for travellers from [[Sydney]] on their way to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and the [[Western Plains]]. Soldiers and colonial officials were some of their guests. Pembroke was granted a further {{convert|48|acre|ha|order=flip}} at what was then known as \"Twenty Mile Hollow\". He fell on hard times, heavily mortgaging the property and being sentenced to two years on a road gang for stealing slabs of wood at [[Springwood, New South Wales|Springwood]]. His sentence was later reduced to one year but forced him to sell \"The Woodman Inn\" in 1839.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606>BMACHO, 2014.</ref> In 1839 he sold it to Michael Hogan. At the time it was leased by G. K. Bryant.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nHis weatherboard building was developed into a stone inn, the Kings Arms, under Michael Hogan in 1842 (the present west wing).<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=7}}\n\nIn 1841 the grant measured {{convert|4950|x|5100|ft|m|order=flip}}. An 1842 sketch of the \"Inn at Twenty Mile Hollow\" shows a building unlike the present buildings. From 1842-44 Col.John Edward Bull had a camp for a road gang nearby. It is possible families stayed at the Inn. In 1843 James Nairn was licensee of the King's Arms Hotel, succeeded in 1846 by William Barton, 1847 by John Cobcroft and 1854 by Thomas James.<ref name=nswshr-1509/> In 1855 Hogan sold the property to William Buss. From 1856-57 Buss held the license of 'The King's Arms' Hotel. The inn was more popularly known as \"Buss\" Inn'.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606/> {{circa|1856}} a Police Lock Up was built to the inn's west (now demolished).<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=9}}\n\nBy 1862, during William Buss's occupancy, the kitchen wings were added. From 1867 until 1897 it was a private country retreat, owned by Alfred Fairfax, and from 1897 to 1907 it was a boarding house.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=7}} In 1863 a railway plan denotes the buildings as the 'King's Arms Inn' showing the main building and dairy building in their existing form. The kitchen building is in three parts. Nearby there are a number of other timber buildings, now demolished.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=13}} In 1867 Buss left a life interest in the property to his wife, Bridget Buss.<ref name=nswshr-1509/> In 1868 the railway line reached the [[Weatherboard Inn archaelological site|Weatherboard Inn]] at [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth Falls]]. In August 1868 the widow Mrs Buss sold the property to Alfred Fairfax. A March 1869 sketch of \"Buss's\" by John Vine Hall shows the present complex. In October 1869 it was advertised as 'Mountain air Woodford (late Buss's) Apartments vacant J.Sheils'.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13193212?searchTerm=Mountain |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=9 October 1869 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1869 Woodford was possibly occupied by caretaker Sheils. The property was then {{convert|90|acre|ha|order=flip}}. An 1869 drawing by Vine Hall shows the main and dairy buildings in their present form. The dairy has a shingled roof and green-painted shutters. A picket fence had been built.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=13}}\n\nA pear tree (''[[Pyrus communis]]'' cv.) has been identified on a (now) adjacent block of land that appears to date directly from the Fairfax period of ownership of the property (1860/70), suggests local horticulturist teacher with [[TAFE NSW|TAFE]], Doug Knowles.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606/> The tree is most likely to be the last remnant of an orchard and garden planted for Fairfax, who developed the property as a gentleman's residence. Fairfax renamed his home \"Woodford House\" and built the second storey east wing, primarily to accommodate his Sydney friends and their servants. It became an exclusive retreat for he and his friends. During his time here he bought more land {{circa|1868}} and then owned 90 acres on which he created an orchard and house garden to provide fresh food for his guests.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606/> Fairfax had \"house and servants\" at Woodford.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nIn 1874 an observation was made of the transit of Venus 200 yards to the west of Woodford. Members of the scientific community visited the Fairfax property to observe the phenomenon. Portable observatories were set up in tents for the observations.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nIn 1876 the property was leased or at least in the possession of Mr. Hague-Smith. In 1879 the house was still described as Mr. Fairfax's \"commodious residence and large gardens namded Woodford\". In {{circa|1880}} Hague-Smith made additions to the kitchen building and opened the property as a guest house: \"Woodford House\".<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nFrom October 1881 until 1907 it is said to have been a fashionable guest and function house. Names of clients included George Walker, Arnott, Sir [[William Patrick Manning]] and Sir Archibold Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nOn 29 June 1897 (Fairfax losing money in his financial dealings in mining ventures)<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606/> the property was put up for auction and sold to David Flannery. At this time it was described as a sanatorium with two blocks of land {{convert|40.75|acre|ha|order=flip}} and {{convert|50|acre|ha|order=flip}}. 'buildings are substantial...accommodation is large...pleasure grounds and orchard extensive...'<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=13}} Flannery subdivided and sold some of the land.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2606/><ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nPre 1902 the railway zig zag at [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] was bypassed.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nA March 1903 inventory of the contents was made, with the rooms named and another made in 1905.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=13}}\n\nPre 1906 the property was used as a private hospital by Dr. Mark Henry Long. In November 1906 it was sold under the Real Property Act (occupied by Edward Graves).<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=10}}\n\n===Use as a school===\nFrom 1907 to 1934 under lessee (and distinguished classics scholar)<ref name=nswshr-1509-2613/> John Frazer McManamey, it became a significant school, the Woodford Academy, in competition and then in succession to [[Cooerwull Academy]] at [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]], the other major Presbyterian school outside Sydney, where McManamey had previously taught.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=13}}\n\nJohn McManamey was a Scottish policeman's son from [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]], educated at an Anglican boarding school, [[All Saints' College, Bathurst|All Saints' College]] in Bathurst, then at the [[University of Sydney]], where he lived at St. Andrew's College. At University and College he was enabled to indulge his passions for classical literature, and extended them into English literature, while living a vigorous outdoor and sporting life. After graduation he was founding headmaster of Dr. Aspinall's [[Scots College (Sydney)|Scots College]] in Sydney (now in [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]]). He left to found his own school, the Australian College and then went to [[Queensland]] to be senior classics master at the renowned [[Ipswich Grammar School]].<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=7}} In 1903 he returned to NSW's central west to be rector of Cooerwull Academy, but again ventured out to create a school of his own in 1907. This was Woodford Academy, directed, like Cooerwull, towards the Sydney University entry examination and elite learning generally. This was a significant school, in competition and then in succession to Lithgow's Cooerwull Academy (which McManamey had been rector of from 1903-7). Woodford Academy was a case of adapting much older buildings to school use, while supplementing the old with a custom-made wing.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=7}}\n\nOver 300 students were educated in the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] location between 1907 and 1925, benefitting from a curriculum based on the liberal arts with commercial subjects available for those intending to enter business life. There are tales of daily morning swims, even in the winter months, to encourage hygiene and develop character. Confident that his students would \"make their mark on history\", McManamey encouraged his boys to engrave their initials into their school desks and the rock shelves that surround the school buildings. They did so, but many made their mark in ways unimaginable at the time, distinguishing themselves for their actions in both world wars.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2613>Burgess, 2014, 8</ref><ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nIn December 1908 it was subdivided and the greater part sold to Mary Jane Waterhouse, mother of [[Eben Gowrie Waterhouse]], later of Sydney University and [[Eryldene, Gordon]]. In 1910 the timber concert room was blown over.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=13}} In 1913 Mrs McManamey died. In July 1914 the remainder of {{convert|12.5|acre|ha|order=flip}} including the buildings was sold to John Frazer McManamey.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=12}}\n\nOver the duration of [[World War I]], fifty four boys from Woodford Academy enlisted to serve King and country. Their names are listed on an Honour Roll Call, and the National Trust's Woodford Academy Management Committee hopes family and friends will recognise names and come forward with additional information on the boys. This will be added to research carried out as the basis for a display at the Academy commemorating the centenary of the Anzacs from August 2014 to November 2018. Interactive ebooks are progressively developed and displayed at the Academy museum on the centenary of the month each boy enlisted for the Great War.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2613/><ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nFrom 1924-1965 the Academy Dining Hall was used for Presbyterian church services. Between 1924 and 1968 the land was further subdivided.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=12}} The Academy closed in 1925 and McManamey used the building as a private residence. He reopened the school for local children in 1930, closing it again in 1936.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2615>BMACHO #30, 2013, 17.</ref> After the Academy closed to all but private tuition in 1936,<ref name=nswshr-1509-2616>Jack, 2014: says 1934</ref> the McManamey family lived privately in the house. John Frazier McManamey died in 1946. In February 1949 Miss Gertrude McManamey inherited it.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nThe kitchen verandah was reconstructed in {{circa|1950}}s.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=13}} From the 1950s-70s the east wing was used as a shop on two occasions. The kitchen wing was used as a flat.<ref name=nswshr-1509/> In 1961 land to the academy's east was donated to the Presbyterian Church.<ref name=nswshr-1509/> In 1976 the kitchen verandah was removed.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=13}} In 1978 the [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] proposed road widening which slightly reduced the area of the site.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nFrom 1978-82 repair and conservation works were done for the National Trust of Australia by [[Clive Lucas]] P/L, including conversion of s5 to a bathroom; conversion of s9 to a kitcken; repair of windows to s9, s10 and s6; repair of rear door s8, removal of a vine and repair of stone walls to the dairy building; repair of the roof and eaves to the main building and providing new downpipes and gutters; reconstruction of the chimney over space 8.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>{{rp|page=15}}\n\n===Management by the National Trust of Australia===\nIn April 1979<ref name=nswshr-1509-2620>Jack: 2013 says 1978</ref> Miss Gertrude McManamey gifted the property to the National Trust of Australia (NSW).<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=12}} BMACHO suggests<ref name=nswshr-1509-2615/> Miss McManamey's gift was on condition she could live there until she died.

He used his own money, spending a substantial amount to restore parts of the building particularly the eastern part of the main building. He did this unheralded and in the manner which marked his ethos of service.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2621/><ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nThe National Trust received a $1m Centenary of Federation grant from the [[Australian Government]] in 2001<ref name=nswshr-1509-2615/> which O'Keefe had a major part in obtaining, to help restore the property.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2623>BMACHO, August 2014, 14.</ref> Visitation to Woodford Academy increased 600 per cent in 2013/14 due largely to a widely expanded programme of events showcasing local artists, performers and historians and partnerships in local events. New primary and high school programmes have been launched, museum displays have been updated, the dining hall repainted, sandstone re-laid on the front verandah and external timberwork repaired.<ref name=nswshr-1509-943>Silink & Hayes, 2014.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nA lively new volunteer team at Woodford Academy have turned the fortunes of the property around from 2013-2015, also making it a centre for Blue Mountains artistic innovation. Cutting-edge performances using local talent to interpret the historic complex with sound, light, coour, taste - in new ways not before contemplated. Ghosts provide evening entertainment. The \"Make your mark in history\" project, developed to commemorate students of the Academy who fought in World War I received a 2015 National Trust Heritage Award. The [[Norman Lindsay Gallery]], Everglades and Woodford Academy were all represented in the Blue Mountains Winter Magic street festival which attracted over 30,000 people.<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2464>[[National Trust of Australia]], 2015, 4.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n===Site===\nThe features contemporary with the construction of the building such as [[sandstone]] flagging, the stone tank, make a large contribution to the significance of the complex and should be considered as an integral part of the buildings. Not much seems to have survived from the Fairfax and guest house periods with the possible exception of some of the paving and perhaps the water pumps. These are also important as parts of this phase of the development of the buildings.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nOf all the site features however, the engraved (with boy students of the Academy's names: there are many such, e.g. RSBS who was Ralph Sanders Barclay Sillar, a student in 1909 and after World War I, a successful lawyer, who lived on until 1970<ref name=nswshr-1509-2599/>) on the massive rock shelves at the site's rear (east) are probably the most interesting because they graphically demonstrate the use of the building as a school in the early 20th century. The various names personalise the history of the building (sic: site).<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nIn addition to any inherent significance the landscape at the site may have (not surveyed) the existing landscape does provide an aesthetically pleasing setting for the historic buildings. A number of the mature trees are clearly remnants of the Victorian and Edwardian period(s).<ref name=nswshr-1509/><ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=24}}\n\nFour Monterey pine trees (''Pinus radiata'') flank the south-west edge of the property onto the Great Western Highway. A large mature and significant eucalypt tree grows close to the centre of the main building facing the highway. Three more Monterey pines, two poplars, a lemon-scented gum and two paths - one stone, one brick, comprise the southern front boundary plantings, running roughtly from mid-main building to both sides of the rough [[driveway]] and the property's eastern boundary shared with the Presbyterian church.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nTo the west of the building complex an area of poplars, suckers and undergrowth with Nile lilies (''Agapanthus orientalis''/''praecox''), weeds and other undergrowth existed.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/> To the north (rear) of the building complex a similar area of poplar suckers, undergrowth, rubbish tip, septic tank, piles of building debris, a fruit tree and black bean (''Castanospermum australe'') fill the \"[[courtyard]]\" space between wing buildings which are located at right angles to the main building. Areaas of sandstone paving are also part of this \"space\".<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nA concrete drive and garage building are located to the main building complex's east, the former located close to the Presbyterian church across the boundary.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2626>Stuart Read, from plan in CLP, 1984</ref><ref name=nswshr-1509/> Inspection of the site indicates curtilage lines other than the boundaries of the present land ownership are appropriate. The mid-range views of paddocks from the rear of the property are pleasant and it would be unfortunate if this area were developed. The boundary here is very close and a more suitable line is at the old fence line further to the north.<ref name=nswshr-1509/> The lot to the east (Presbyterian church) is the most intrusive of the neighbouring properties and here the boundary is also very close. A more suitable line is the west side of the church.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nNone of the neighbouring buildings are particularly detrimental to the character of the Woodford Academy. The most significant surviving feature of the site is the maintenance of the historic link between the buildings and the Great Western Highway. Here the curtilage should extend to the railway property on the other side of the road with the view of controlling development directly opposite the site.<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=16}}\n\n===Building complex===\nThe Woodford Academy shows layers of growth from the original two-roomed inn at the east end of the south block to the present footprint.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\n====Original South Wing====\nThe original south wing (i.e., east end) is a symmetrical single storey sandstone building facing south to the Great Western Highway. The gabled roof is clad in galvanised iron (Moorewood & Rogers) tiles and has a brick [[chimney]] at the east end. A [[veranda]]h on the south side is broken back to the main roof and has a beaded verandah plate, stop chamfered [[columns]] and a flagged floor. A 6-panel door with bead flush lower panels, fielded top panels and a diagonally divided toplight is at the centre of the wing. It is flanked by 8 over 8 pane double hung windows. The north wall of the original wing has 2 no. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows. Floor is abutted boards (not [[Tongue and groove|tongue-and-groove]]).<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\n====West Extension (South Wing)====\nThe west extension of the south wing is an L-shaped gabled wing with a sandstone chimney at the west end. The verandah roofline is an extension of the original verandah but is skillioned. The galvanised iron (Moorewood & Rogers) tile roof is also used on this extension and has boxed [[eaves]]. A pair of [[french doors]] with bead flush lower panel and a toplight open to the east end of the verandah. A pair of 2 panelled doors with a toplight are off centre in the south wall opening to the verandah. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows with 3 pane toplights are also in this wall.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\nA 4-panel door opens from the east side of the west leg of the wing. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows are in the north and south gabled wails with 4 over 6 pane double hung windows built to imitate [[Casement window|casements]], in the [[gable]] above. The windows in the south wall are shuttered. The west wall of the wing has 6 over 6 pane double hung windows. 2 no. [[hipped roof]] [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] form dormers are in the west roof slope and have double hung windows detailed to look like casements. The sandstone verandah flagging extends around the wing.<ref name=nswshr-1509/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 20 June 2013, the property in early 1984 (both site and buildings) were in very poor condition<ref name=nswshr-1509-2601/>{{rp|page=16}} pre repair and conservation works).

There is a fair degree of complexity in the evolution of this site and it is therefore of high archaeological significance in its ability to reveal details about possibly William James' hut, the Woodman's Inn, the King's Arms Inn, the grave yard, Woodford House, and Woodford Academy. These include matters such as the earlier configurations of the buildings and other features and the lifestyle of the occupants over time. The site has considerable historical archaeological value and research potential to demonstrate the general character of its types of occupation from the early nineteenth century onwards.

It has been extended and altered for its various uses but still retains its essential Georgian character especially in the south verandahs and their sandstone flagging. The south wing of the house retains its original small pane window sashes and attic window designed to appear as casements.
