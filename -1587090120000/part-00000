They get their name because they are split out \"wide\" (near the sidelines), farthest away from the rest of the team.  Wide receivers are among the [[40-yard dash#Average time by position|fastest players on the field]].  The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist.\n\n== Role ==\n\n[[File:Calvin Johnson midair pass cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Calvin Johnson]]]]\nThe wide receiver's principal role is to catch [[forward pass|passes]] from the [[quarterback]]. On passing plays, the receiver attempts to avoid, outmaneuver, or simply outrun defenders (typically [[cornerback]]s or [[Safety (American football position)|safeties]]) in the area of his [[Route (football)|pass route]]. If the receiver becomes open, or has an unobstructed path to the destination of a catch, he may then become the quarterback's target. Once a pass is thrown in his direction, the receiver's goal is to first catch the ball and then attempt to run downfield. Some receivers are perceived as a deep threat because of their flat-out speed, while others may be possession receivers known for not dropping passes, running crossing routes across the middle of the field, and generally, converting third down situations. A receiver's height also contributes to their expected role; taller receivers tend to play further to the outside and run deep more often, shorter receivers tend to play inside and run more routes underneath the top of the defense. \n\n[[File:Hutson-Don-1940-grainfix.jpg|thumb|[[Don Hutson]]]]\n\nA wide receiver has two potential roles during running plays. Particularly in the case of [[draw play]]s and other trick plays, he may run a pass route with the intent of drawing off defenders. Alternatively, he may block normally for the running back. Well-rounded receivers are noted for blocking defensive backs in support of teammates in addition to their pass-catching abilities; [[Hines Ward]] in particular received praise for his  blocking abilities while also becoming the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] all-time leading receiver and one of 13 in NFL history with at least 1,000 receptions.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/football/nfl/11/04/dirty/index.html]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref><ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1162231/1/index.htm]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\nSometimes wide receivers are used to run the ball, usually in some form of an [[end-around]] or [[Reverse (American football)|reverse]]. This can be effective because the defense usually does not expect them to be the ball carrier on running plays. For example, wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]] rushed the ball 87 times for 645 yards and 10 touchdowns in his 20 NFL seasons.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/players/126/]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn even rarer cases, receivers may pass the ball as part of a [[trick play]]. A receiver can legally pass the ball so long as they receive the ball behind the line of scrimmage, in the form of a handoff or backwards lateral. This sort of trick play is often employed with a receiver who has past experience playing quarterback at a lower level, such as high school, or sometimes, college. [[Antwaan Randle El]] threw a touchdown pass at the wide receiver position in [[Super Bowl XL]] playing for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] against the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Antwaan Randle El played quarterback for four years at [[Indiana University]]. \n\nWide receivers often also serve on special teams as [[kick returner]]s or [[punt returner]]s, as [[gunner (American football)|gunner]]s on kick coverage teams, or as part of the hands team during [[onside kick]]s.\n\nThe bases for all wide receivers is the route tree. The route tree uses numbers zero through nine. Zero being the go route and a nine being the hitch route or vice versa. These routes are used primarily in high school and college. In high school they are normally a part of the play call, but are usually disguised in higher levels of plays.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shakinthesouthland.com/2010/3/22/1378440/wr-basics-routes-and-the-passing}}</ref>\n\nFinally, on errant passes, receivers must frequently play a defensive role by attempting to prevent an interception. If a pass is intercepted, receivers must use their speed to chase down and tackle the ball carrier to prevent him from returning the ball for a long gain or a touchdown.\n\nIn the NFL, wide receivers can use the [[Uniform number (American football)|numbers]] 10\u201319 and 80\u201389.\n\n== History of the position ==\n\nThe wide receiver grew out of a position known as the [[end (American football)|end]]. Originally, the ends played on the [[offensive line]], immediately next to the tackles. By the rules governing the forward pass, ends (positioned at the end of the line of scrimmage) and backs (positioned behind the line of scrimmage) are [[eligible receivers]]. Most early football teams used the ends as receivers sparingly, as their position often left them in heavy traffic with many defenders around. By the 1930s, some teams were experimenting with moving one end far out near the sideline, to make them more open to receive passes. These split ends became the prototype for the modern wide receiver. [[Don Hutson]], who played college football at [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] and professionally with the [[Green Bay Packers]], was the first player to exploit the potentials of the split end position, and is widely credited as inventing the wide receiver position.\n\nAs the passing game evolved, a second wide receiver position was added. While it is possible to move the opposite end out wide for a second split end position, most teams preferred to leave that end in close to provide extra blocking protection on the quarterback's blind side. That player was essentially playing the modern day [[tight end]] position. Instead of moving the blind side end out, one of the three [[running back]]s was split wide instead, creating the flanker position. The flanker lined up off the line of scrimmage like a running back or quarterback, but split outside like a split end. Lining up behind the line of scrimmage gave flankers some advantages. Flankers have more \"space\" between themselves and a pressing defensive back, so [[cornerback]]s can not as easily \"jam\" them at the line of scrimmage. This is in addition to being eligible for [[motion (gridiron football)|motion]] plays, allowing for the flanker to move laterally before and during the snap. [[Elroy Hirsch|Elroy \"Crazy Legs\" Hirsch]] is one of the earliest players to successfully exploit the potentials of the flanker position as a member of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] during the 1950s.\n\nWhile some teams did experiment with more than two wide receivers as a gimmick or [[trick play]], most teams used the [[pro set]] as the standard set of offensive personnel (a flanker, a split end, a half back, a full back, and a tight end).  An early innovator, coach [[Sid Gillman]] used 3+ wide receiver sets as early as the 1960s.  In sets that have three, four, or five wide receivers, extra receivers are typically called slot receivers, as they play in the \"slot\" (open space) between the furthest receiver and the offensive line.  In most situations, the slot receiver lines up off the line of scrimmage like the flanker position. The first use of a slot receiver is often credited to [[Al Davis]], a Gillman assistant who took the concept with him as a coach of the 1960s [[Oakland Raiders]].  Other members of the Gillman [[coaching tree]], including [[Don Coryell]] and [[John Madden]], brought these progressive offensive ideas along with them into the 1970s and early 1980s, but it was not until the 1990s that teams began to reliably use three or more wide receivers, notably the \"[[run and shoot]]\" offense popularized by the [[Houston Cougars football|Houston Cougars]] of the NCAA and the [[Houston Oilers]] of the NFL, and the [[Hurry-up offense|\"K Gun\" offense]] used by the [[Buffalo Bills]].  [[Charlie Joiner]], a member of the \"[[Air Coryell]]\" [[San Diego Chargers]] teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s, was the first \"slot receiver\" to be his team's primary receiver.\n\nWhile the timeline differs for individual each player, wide receivers generally hit their peak between the ages of 23 and 30. A study conducted by [[Apex Fantasy Leagues]] concluded that about 80 percent of peak seasons fall within that range.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/2020/01/peak-age-nfl-wide-receiver/|title=The Peak Age For An NFL Wide Receiver|date=2020-01-29|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nWhile the general fan base and most commentators use the generic term wide receiver for all such players, specific names exist for most receiver positions:\n\n* '''Split end''' (X or SE): A receiver on the [[line of scrimmage]], necessary to meet the rule requiring seven such players at [[snap (American football)|snap]]. The split end is farthest from center on his side of the field. Split ends are also used in punt formations, where they are known as [[gunner (American football)|gunners]].<ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/football101/se.shtml]{{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n* '''Flanker/Flanker back''' (Z or FL or 6 back): A receiver lining up behind the line of scrimmage. Frequently the team's featured receiver, the flanker uses the initial buffer between himself and a [[defensive back|defender]] to avoid immediate \"jamming\" (legal defensive contact within five yards of the line of scrimmage). The flanker is generally on the same side of the formation as a [[tight end]]. As with the split end, this receiver is the farthest player from the center on his side of the field. The flanker is usually lined up just like a split end except that he is just behind the line of scrimmage, therefore being in the backfield and not on the line. Unlike the split end, the flanker can go into [[motion (football)|lateral or backward motion]] before the snap and is usually the one to do so.<ref name=\"flsl\">[http://www.phillyburbs.com/football101/sr.shtml]{{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n* '''[[Slotback]] or slot receiver'''  (Y, SB or SR): A receiver lining up in the offensive back field, horizontally positioned between the offensive tackle and the split end or between the tight end and the flanker. [[Canadian football|Canadian]] and [[arena football]] allow them to take a running start at the line; American football allows the slot receiver to move backward or laterally, but not at the same time as the flanker or any other back. They are usually larger players as they need to make catches over the middle. In American football, slot receivers are typically used in [[flexbone formation|flexbone]] or other [[triple option]] offenses, while Canadian football uses three of them in almost all formations (in addition to two split ends and a single running back).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{American football positions}}\n{{American football concepts|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:American football positions]]\n[[Category:Canadian football terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Offensive position in American and Canadian football}}\n{{Refimprove|date=February 2020}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{redirect|Split end|split ends in hair|Trichoptilosis||Split Ends (disambiguation)}}\n[[Image:Wide receiver.svg|250px|thumb|An example of a wide receiver's positioning in an offensive formation: split end (SE) (now wide receiver), [[slotback]] (SB), [[tight end]] (TE), [[wingback (American football)|wingback]] (WB), and flanker (FL) position.]]\n\nA '''wide receiver''', also referred to as '''wideouts''' or simply '''receivers''', is an offensive position in [[gridiron football]], and is a key player.

Unlike the split end, the flanker can go into [[motion (football)|lateral or backward motion]] before the snap and is usually the one to do so.<ref name=\"flsl\">[http://www.phillyburbs.com/football101/sr.shtml]{{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n* '''[[Slotback]] or slot receiver'''  (Y, SB or SR): A receiver lining up in the offensive back field, horizontally positioned between the offensive tackle and the split end or between the tight end and the flanker. [[Canadian football|Canadian]] and [[arena football]] allow them to take a running start at the line; American football allows the slot receiver to move backward or laterally, but not at the same time as the flanker or any other back. They are usually larger players as they need to make catches over the middle. In American football, slot receivers are typically used in [[flexbone formation|flexbone]] or other [[triple option]] offenses, while Canadian football uses three of them in almost all formations (in addition to two split ends and a single running back).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{American football positions}}\n{{American football concepts|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:American football positions]]\n[[Category:Canadian football terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Mike Schwartz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRole:Correction of a MINOR mistake or TYPO.

The color brown shown at right has a hue code of 30, signifying that is a shade of orange.  In the [[RGB color model]] used to create all the colors on computer and television screens,  brown is made by combining red and green light at different intensities. Brown color names are often not very precise, and some shades, such as [[beige]], can refer to a wide variety of colors, including shades of yellow or red.  Browns are usually described as light or dark,  reddish, yellowish, or gray-brown.  There are no standardized names for shades of brown; the same shade may have different names on different color lists, and sometimes the one name (such as beige or puce) can refer to several very different colors. The X11 color list of [[web colors]] lists seventeen different shades of brown, but the complete list of browns is much longer.\n\nBrown colors are dark or muted shades of reds, oranges, and yellows which are created on computer and television screens using the RGB color model and in printing with the [[CMYK color model]]. Browns can also be created by mixing two complementary colors from the RYB color model (combining all three primary colors). In theory, such combinations should produce black, but produce brown because most commercially available blue pigments tend to be comparatively weaker; the stronger red and yellow colors prevail, thus creating the following tones.

The color brown shown at right has a hue code of 30, signifying that is a shade of orange.  In the [[RGB color model]] used to create all the colors on computer and television screens,  brown is made by combining red and green light at different intensities. Brown color names are often not very precise, and some shades, such as [[beige]], can refer to a wide variety of colors, including shades of yellow or red.  Browns are usually described as light or dark,  reddish, yellowish, or gray-brown.  There are no standardized names for shades of brown; the same shade may have different names on different color lists, and sometimes the one name (such as beige or puce) can refer to several very different colors. The X11 color list of [[web colors]] lists seventeen different shades of brown, but the complete list of browns is much longer.\n\nBrown colors are dark or muted shades of reds, oranges, and yellows which are created on computer and television screens using the RGB color model and in printing with the [[CMYK color model]]. Browns can also be created by mixing two complementary colors from the RYB color model (combining all three primary colors). In theory, such combinations should produce black, but produce brown because most commercially available blue pigments tend to be comparatively weaker; the stronger red and yellow colors prevail, thus creating the following tones.

It is the third filmed version of the story released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].\n\nThe original music score is composed by [[Perry Botkin Jr.]] Former Tarzan actor [[Jock Mahoney]], billed as ''Jack O'Mahoney'', was the film's stunt coordinator. The film is marketed with the tagline ''Unlike any other \"Tarzan\" you've ever seen!'' The original actor cast in the Tarzan role was fired (or quit) early in production, resulting in the sudden casting of his stunt double, Miles O'Keeffe, in the title role. This film received extremely negative reviews,  and in some circles has been considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]], even though it was a box-office success.\n\n==Plot==\nJames Parker is a hunter in Africa, searching for a mythical \"white ape\". He is joined by his estranged daughter, Jane, after her mother's death. They discover the \"white ape\" is actually Tarzan, an uncivilized white man raised by apes living in the jungle. James continues to pursue Tarzan with the purpose of capturing him, dead or alive, and bringing him back to England.\n\nRealizing that James is on his trail, Tarzan kidnaps Jane. Jane and Tarzan become fascinated by each other. Jane is then kidnapped by natives who intend to make her a wife of the tribe leader, forcing Tarzan into action. James is killed by the Ivory King, and the natives remove Jane's clothes. Tarzan comes to the rescue and escapes from the natives. Tarzan and Jane fall in love.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Bo Derek]] &ndash; [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Parker]]\n* [[Richard Harris]] &ndash; James Parker\n* [[John Phillip Law]] &ndash; [[Harry Holt (Tarzan)|Harry Holt]]\n* [[Miles O'Keeffe]] &ndash; [[Tarzan]]\n\n==Production==\n[[Bo Derek]] was extremely popular at the time due to her appearance in ''[[10 (film)|10]]''.

It is the third filmed version of the story released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].\n\nThe original music score is composed by [[Perry Botkin Jr.]] Former Tarzan actor [[Jock Mahoney]], billed as ''Jack O'Mahoney'', was the film's stunt coordinator. The film is marketed with the tagline ''Unlike any other \"Tarzan\" you've ever seen!'' The original actor cast in the Tarzan role was fired (or quit) early in production, resulting in the sudden casting of his stunt double, Miles O'Keeffe, in the title role. This film received extremely negative reviews,  and in some circles has been considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]], even though it was a box-office success.\n\n==Plot==\nJames Parker is a hunter in Africa, searching for a mythical \"white ape\". He is joined by his estranged daughter, Jane, after her mother's death. They discover the \"white ape\" is actually Tarzan, an uncivilized white man raised by apes living in the jungle. James continues to pursue Tarzan with the purpose of capturing him, dead or alive, and bringing him back to England.\n\nRealizing that James is on his trail, Tarzan kidnaps Jane. Jane and Tarzan become fascinated by each other. Jane is then kidnapped by natives who intend to make her a wife of the tribe leader, forcing Tarzan into action. James is killed by the Ivory King, and the natives remove Jane's clothes. Tarzan comes to the rescue and escapes from the natives. Tarzan and Jane fall in love.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Bo Derek]] &ndash; [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Parker]]\n* [[Richard Harris]] &ndash; James Parker\n* [[John Phillip Law]] &ndash; [[Harry Holt (Tarzan)|Harry Holt]]\n* [[Miles O'Keeffe]] &ndash; [[Tarzan]]\n\n==Production==\n[[Bo Derek]] was extremely popular at the time due to her appearance in ''[[10 (film)|10]]''. After making ''[[A Change of Seasons (film)|A Change of Seasons]]'', she was meant to appear in ''[[High Road to China]]'' but pulled out of the film saying she only wanted to be directed by her husband John.<ref>BO TAKES HIGH ROAD TO PLAY TARZAN'S JANE: MOVIE NEWS\nLos Angeles Times (1923-1995); Los Angeles, Calif.

As interim [[Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability]] from October 2008 to May 2009, he oversaw the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) that was a major component of the U.S. government's response to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he unsuccessfully ran for [[Governor of California]] in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]].\n\nBorn and raised in Ohio, and educated at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]], Kashkari worked initially as an aerospace engineer.

Kashkari was eventually named Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Economics and Development. At Treasury, he played a number of roles in the response to the financial crisis and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] that preceded it, most notably administering the TARP.\n\nKashkari left government and began working for [[Pimco]] in 2009, leading that company's push into the [[Equity (finance)|equities]] market.
