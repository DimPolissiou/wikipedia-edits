I didn't see it coming.\"<ref name=StPeteTimesbancroft20020929/> \n\nAs described by Eric Spitznagel for ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', since \"witnesses testified that Sibrel had provoked [Aldrin], assault charges against the former astronaut were dropped.\"<ref name = PopMechspitznagel20190719/> Police either did not file, or dropped charges, based on Aldrin's lack of a prior criminal record, witness accounts of Sibrel's having drawn Aldrin to the hotel under false pretence and his aggressiveness before the punch, and Sibrel having declined to seek medical attention and having sustained \"no visible injury\".<ref name=BBCstaff20020921/><ref name = PopMechspitznagel20190719/>\n\n==Conviction for vandalism in parking dispute==\nIn July 2009, Sibrel, who at the time was working as a Nashville taxicab driver, was charged with vandalism when he jumped up and down on the hood of a car owned by a woman with whom he was having a parking dispute. Court documents show he was arrested after the driver refused to pull out of a parking space he wanted. The arresting officer wrote, \"A few moments later the parking space in front of the victim opened up and Sibrel drove into it and parked.\" Sibrel \"then walked up to the victim's car and jumped onto the hood, and then jumped up and down several times.\" The report says he caused US$1,431.33 worth of damage, after which Sibrel pleaded guilty to vandalism and was placed on probation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Phil |title=Inside Story: Apollo Conspiracy Theorist Arrested After Tirade |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711081414/http://www.newschannel5.com/story/10799169/inside-story-apollo-conspiracy-theorist-arrested-after-tirade |accessdate=21 July 2019 |publisher=NewsChannel 5 |date=July 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Regarding the Apollo program===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"33\" | Year !! width=285 | Film !! width=65 | Director !! width=65 | Producer !! width=65 | Writer !! width=65 | Run time (minutes)\n|-\n|-\n| 2001\n| style=\"text-align:left\"| ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon]]''\n| {{yes}}\n| {{yes}}\n| {{yes}}\n| 47\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2004\n| style=\"text-align:left\"| ''[[Astronauts Gone Wild|Astronauts Gone Wild: An Investigation Into the Authenticity of the Moon Landings]]\n| {{yes}}\n| {{yes}}\n|\n| 53\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"| ''Apollo 11 Monkey Business: False Photography Unedited''\n|\n| {{yes}}\n|\n| 108\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\"| ''Apollo 11 Post-Flight Press Conference''\n|\n| {{yes}}\n|\n| 83\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bill Kaysing]]\n* [[Ralph Rene]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading and viewing==\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/11/science/11WIRE-SPACE.html |title=Moon Hoax Spurs Crusade Against Bad Astronomy |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=Reuters |date=January 11, 2001 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html | author = Plait, Phil | title=Fox TV and the Apollo Moon Hoax |date=February 13, 2001 |accessdate=July 20, 2019 |publisher=BadAstronomy.com}} A thorough rebuttal of the 2001 re-airing of the Fox TV program, \"Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?\".\n* {{cite web |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/265042/speedreads-watch-a-72-year-old-buzz-aldrin-punch-a-jerk-in-the-face-for-calling-him-a-liar |title=Buzz Aldrin Punches a Jerk in the Face for Calling Him a Liar |date=July 21, 2014 |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |publisher=The Week}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/news/show/buzz_aldrin_punches_moon-landing_conspiracy_theorist |title=Buzz Aldrin Punches Moon-landing Conspiracy Theorist |date=October 16, 2002 |website=[[The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}\n* {{cite podcast |url=http://binnallofamerica.com/boaa11.25.6.html | host = Tim Binall | title = BoA: Audio, Season Two: Bart Sibrel |website=Binall of America |date=November 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 29, 2013}} [Audio blog featuring the title subject.]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|www.sibrel.com}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sibrel, Bart}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Moon landing conspiracy theorists]]\n[[Category:American conspiracy theorists]]\n[[Category:People from Nashville, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:American documentary filmmakers]]\n", "name_user": "76.99.94.80", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Sibrel"}

The sets were designed by Ludwig Kainer.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nCount Greven (Bruno de Carli) returns to his old castle after spending several years touring the world. The servants note how the count has changed: he is now withdrawn and fearful. He orders that the doors to the castle be kept locked and no one admitted. When he is left alone in his room, Greven opens a chest he brought from his travels, inside it there is a strange statue that he adds to his vast collection of rare works of art. Several days pass and a worried servant (Bernhard Goetzke) informs the town's minister (Hermann Picha) about his master's melancholia. The old man visits the castle looking to help. The count confesses the minister how, during his stay in India, he had heard of a statue of Buddha that was so beautiful that it made the sick well and the sad joyous; while visiting the temple, he stole the figure and smuggled it back home. The count tells the minister that the temple's priest swore a terrible revenge upon him for his sacrilege, and he has been living in fear of their secret powers ever since. The minister leaves shocked, believing that Greven has gone mad. The count screams in despair that he no longer wants to live, since the agony of suspense is worse than death.\n\nOne night, a turbaned figure does appear on Greven's grounds. The count demands that the Indian priest (Conrad Veidt) kills him right then and there to end his suffering, but the man refuses. He warns that - from that very day - the count will only have seven years to live life to its fullest, after which he will die by the hand of the one who loves him most. The count spends those years seeking out every joy life holds. He throws bacchanalias and hosts gambling parties, but soon these pleasures no longer satisfy him. Looking to obtain fame, Greven researches obsessively a means to cure world hunger, but after succeeding, he capriciously destroys it, all for his amusement. Still looking for fulfillment and meaning, he becomes involved with a young woman (Mechthildis Thein) and revels in the experience of love. He and the young woman are wed.\n\nNevertheless, as the fateful day approaches, he becomes paranoid and terrified once again. Desperate, he decides to leave his castle and travel around the world once again, however he can't depart from his wife and cancels his trip.

The sets were designed by Ludwig Kainer.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nCount Greven (Bruno de Carli) returns to his old castle after spending several years touring the world. The servants note how the count has changed: he is now withdrawn and fearful. He orders that the doors to the castle be kept locked and no one admitted. When he is left alone in his room, Greven opens a chest he brought from his travels, inside it there is a strange statue that he adds to his vast collection of rare works of art. Several days pass and a worried servant (Bernhard Goetzke) informs the town's minister (Hermann Picha) about his master's melancholia. The old man visits the castle looking to help. The count confesses the minister how, during his stay in India, he had heard of a statue of Buddha that was so beautiful that it made the sick well and the sad joyous; while visiting the temple, he stole the figure and smuggled it back home. The count tells the minister that the temple's priest swore a terrible revenge upon him for his sacrilege, and he has been living in fear of their secret powers ever since. The minister leaves shocked, believing that Greven has gone mad. The count screams in despair that he no longer wants to live, since the agony of suspense is worse than death.\n\nOne night, a turbaned figure does appear on Greven's grounds. The count demands that the Indian priest (Conrad Veidt) kills him right then and there to end his suffering, but the man refuses. He warns that - from that very day - the count will only have seven years to live life to its fullest, after which he will die by the hand of the one who loves him most. The count spends those years seeking out every joy life holds. He throws bacchanalias and hosts gambling parties, but soon these pleasures no longer satisfy him. Looking to obtain fame, Greven researches obsessively a means to cure world hunger, but after succeeding, he capriciously destroys it, all for his amusement. Still looking for fulfillment and meaning, he becomes involved with a young woman (Mechthildis Thein) and revels in the experience of love. He and the young woman are wed.\n\nNevertheless, as the fateful day approaches, he becomes paranoid and terrified once again. Desperate, he decides to leave his castle and travel around the world once again, however he can't depart from his wife and cancels his trip. Greven then takes the statue and throws it into a lake, hoping the curse of the priest goes away with it, only to find it back in his home right after. Trusting no one - he even suspects that will be his wife's hand that will slay him - he shoots himself. The statue is retrieved from Greven's castle and carried back to India in the hands of the mysterious priest.<ref name=screen>''Conrad Veidt on Screen: A Comprehensive Illustrated Filmography'' p.34</ref><ref name=beyond>''Beyond Caligari: The Films of Robert Wiene'' p.40-41</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Bruno Decarli]] as Count Greven \n* [[Conrad Veidt]] as Indian Priest \n* [[Bernhard Goetzke]] as Manservant\n* [[Hermann Picha]] as The Minister\n* [[Mechthildis Thein]] as Greven's Lover\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe film was well received by contemporary critics, who praised Wiene's interpretation of psychology and portrayal of paranoia.<ref name=screen/>\n\n== Availability ==\nAs with many of Wiene's lesser known works, ''Fear'' has not been released in any format for home media, making it an obscure and rare film.

Following the invitation of [[Elio Vittorini]], he presented a selection of theatrical works by [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[Bertold Brecht]] and [[Wystan Hugh Auden]], whose works were not yet popular in [[Italy]] in that period. In 1950 Orsenigo started working at [[Piccolo Teatro di Milano]] thanks to its director [[Paolo Grassi]]. He directed [[Alfred Jarry]]'s piece ''Ubu Roy'' and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].\nIn that occasion, Orsenigo met Pierluigi Pizzi, who was a beginner at that time. The two started working together and Pizzi drew scenography and costumes for Orsenigo's works. Later in the Eighties, [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] stated he was interested in Orsenigo's theatrical works.<ref>Salvatore Quasimodo, ''Il poeta a teatro'' in ''Spirali'', 1984: ''\"La compagnia del 'TB 49' ha presentato la sera del 27 giugno sul palcoscenico del Piccolo Teatro di Milano \"Ubu Roi\" di Alfred Jarry. La sala non aveva tutti i posti occupati, \u00e8 vero; forse l'inizio dell'estate allontana il pubblico dagli spettacoli di teatro puro o la diffidenza verso quel 'TB 49' ermetico ha reso pi\u00f9 intima e polemica la rappresentazione di Ubu-Roi. C'erano giovani, per\u00f2: il gruppo pi\u00f9 pericoloso della cultura in movimento: i pittori astrattisti e neorealisti, poeti e scrittori accesi da fuochi sinuosi e ironici, esistenzialisti votati alla chitarra degli chansonniers e ragazze vibranti, senza noia e nausea.\"''</ref>\nIn the Fifties, Orsenigo also met the writer and critic Raffaele Carrieri. Orsenigo was also a good painter and Carrieri loved his works. Because of this, in 1981 Orsenigo had his first exhibition in Milan for which [[Achille Bonito Oliva]] wrote the catalogue.<ref>Achille Bonito Oliva, ''Vittorio Orsenigo'', Studio Ennesse, Milano, 1982</ref>\nOrsenigo exhibited again in 1984 in [[Milan]]<ref>''Vittorio Orsenigo'', Catalogo della mostra, 16 aprile 1984. Testo di Giorgio Verzotti ed uno dell'Artista. Con 23 ill., Galleria Arte Borgogna, 1984</ref> and in 1985 at Palazzo dei Diamanti in [[Ferrara]].<ref>''Vittorio Orsenigo'', Catalogo della mostra, Galleria Civica di Arte Moderna - Palazzo Diamanti, Galleria Massari, 20 ottobre - 24 novembre 1985.  Testo di G\u00e8rard-George Leimaire. Stralci critici di Raffaele Carrieri, Franco russoli, Achille Bonito Oliva, Italo Mussa. Con 5 ill. a colori, Comune di Ferrara, 1985</ref>\n\n===Writer===\nIn the Fifties, Orsenigo had already developed some interest in writing. His first book was a collection of poems named ''Come gli occhi di sabbia''; later in 1954 he published the tale ''La demenza di giacomo''. But only in the Nineties he restarted his activity with ''La linea gotica'' and published some works on the Italian magazines ''Resine Letterarie'' and ''La nuova prosa''. In the same years Orsenigo also performed translations for the Sellerio and Archinto. In 2001 his friend [[Giuseppe Pontiggia]] wrote the preface of ''Settore editoriale''; Orsenigo exchanged the courtesy five years later for Pontiggia's ''Lettere''. \nThe Italian critic Massimo Onofri started looking at Orsenigo's work in 2004. One year after, when ''Commedianti a Milano'' was published, he stated that'' \"more than a memorial, it is a milanese meditation.'' [...]'' if ''Visite'' <ref>Referring to the novel ''Visite guidate''</ref> concerns the irremediabile loss of the only loved son, ''Commedianti'' would look as a book of euphoric and utopica youthness, filled with uncompleted novels and never published books, uncompleted as it is life itself. But remain the fact that writing for true writers always turns around few obsessions:  [[Salvatore Quasimodo|Quasimodo]] got a [[Nobel Prize]] and disappeared. Vittorini, Banfi, Carrieri \u2013 a part from the Nobel \u2013 made the same joke. It is not their fault, but the raging of deaths makes the search for the detail more difficult\"''.<ref>''\"pi\u00f9 che una memoria, \u00e8 una meditazione milanese. [...]  se le ''Visite'' hanno a che fare con la perdita irrimediabile dell'unico e amatissimo figlio, i ''Commedianti'' parrebbe il libro  di un euforica e utopica giovinezza, folta di romanzi incompiuti e di volumi mai pubblicati, incompiuta essa stessa come la vita. Ma rimane il fatto  che la scrittura dei veri scrittori ruota sempre attorno a poche ossessioni: Quasimodo si \u00e8 preso il Nobel ed \u00e8 sparito di scena. Vittorini, Banfi, Carrieri \u2013 Nobel a parte \u2013 stesso scherzo. Non sar\u00e0 colpa loro ma l'imperversare delle morti rende la ricerca del dettaglio  pi\u00f9 difficile\"''. Massimo Onofri, ''Il Diario della settimana'', n\u00b0 36, anno X, 23 settembre 2005</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Orsenigo was already 83 years old and succeeded to extend his fame with two best-sellers: ''L'uccellino della radio'' and ''La camera d'ambra'', the latest published with a preface by [[Sergio Romano (writer)|Sergio Romano]]. His novels were published for the publishers Archinto and [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli Imprimatur]]; in 2015 was the time for ''A Enea Finzi non sparano in fronte'', set during the war period.\n\n===Style===\nOrsenigo has a direct realistic style, but filled with imaginations and frequent digressions. He wrote about places where he used to live: [[Milan]] during the [[Second World War]] (''Commedianti a Milano'', ''L'uccellino della radio''), mountains and woods (''Il pizzini di amblar'') and exotic lands (''Una camera tutta d'ambra'', ''Tanti viaggi'').\nDaniela Marcheschi noted that Orsenigo is \"''Bizzar and digressive following a humoristic tradition that, through [[Carlo Porta|Porta]] and Rajberti, had prosperous developments in Milan's cultur and in the Italian literature of the XIX century afterwords''\".<ref>Afterword for ''Cosa trovi nell'acqua, 2014, Archinto</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n* ''Come gli occhi di sabbia'', anni '50\n\n===Narrative===\n* ''La demenza di Giacomo'', 1954\n* ''La linea gotica'', Marietti, 1990\n* ''I libri di Sfax'', Greco&Greco, 1991 (con lo pseudonimo di Claude Solenzara)\n* ''Fotografie'', rivista Nuova Prosa (romanzo a puntate)\n* ''E... venti racconti appena incominciati'', Greco&Greco, 1995\n* ''Mulino da preghiera'', Greco&Greco, 1996\n* ''Il verme solitario e altri animali quasi domestici'', Greco&Greco, 1997, with [[Guido Almansi]], [[Roberto Barbolini]], Lucio Klobas, [[Roberto Pazzi]], Giovanni Pederiali\n* ''Centotre storie di seduzione (e una postilla)'', Mobydick, 1998\n* ''In Africa con Alain'', Greco&Greco\n* ''Dreyfus'', Collana Cristallo di Rocca n. 10, Greco&Greco, 1999, {{ISBN|9788879802130}}, with [[Giangilberto Monti]]\n* ''Piuma danzante'', Greco&Greco, 1999\n* ''Messaggi dal piccolo zoo'', Archinto, 1999 {{ISBN|9788877682680}}\n* ''Storie zoppe'', Lupetti e Manni, 1995 {{ISBN|9788886302364}}\n* ''Corpo'', Mobydick, 2001\n* ''Settore editoriale'', Archinto, 2001\n* ''Visite guidate'', Archinto, 2004 {{ISBN|9788877684011}}\n* ''Commedianti a Milano'', Aliberti, 2005 {{ISBN|9788874240692}}\n* ''Telefono'', Gaffi, 2006 {{ISBN|9788887803822}}\n* ''Lettere a Giuseppe Pontiggia: il cercatore di funghi in Carinzia'', Archinto, 2006\n* ''L'uccellino della radio'', Gaffi, 2008\n* ''Vittorio Imbriani, Dio ne scampi dagli Orsenigo & Vittorio Orsenigo, Dio ne scampi dagli Imbriani'', Aragno editore\n* ''Rina ne uccide quattro'', Aliberti, 2009 {{ISBN|9788874244256}}\n* ''Collezioni: un amoroso safari'', Archinto, 2009 {{ISBN|9788877685216}}\n* ''Spiagge'', Greco & Greco, 2010 {{ISBN|9788879805216}}\n* ''Tanti viaggi'', Archinto, 2011 {{ISBN|9788877685810}}\n* ''La camera d'ambra'', Greco & Greco, 2013 {{ISBN|9788879806411}}\n* ''I pizzini di Amblar'', Lietocolle,  2013 {{ISBN|9788878487604}}\n* ''Cosa trovi nell'acqua'', Archinto, 2014, {{ISBN|9788877686640}}\n* ''A Enea Finzi non sparano in fronte'', Imprimatur RCS libri, 2015, {{ISBN|9788868303464}}\n\n===Translations and curatorships===\n* [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], ''Il poeta assassinato'', Greco&Greco, 1991 \n* [[Carlo Collodi]], ''Giannettino''\n* [[Carlo Collodi]], ''Pip\u00ec lo scimmiottino color di rosa''\n* Angelo Maria Ricci, ''Gli sposi fedeli''\n* [[Samuel Johnson]], ''La storia di Rasselas Principe di Abissinia'', Sellerio, 1993\n* ''A Giacomo Casanova.

Something similar happened with ''Sorry but I call you love'' (''Scusa ma ti chiamo amore'') (2007), prequel of ''sorry but I want to marry you'' (2009) (''Scusa ma ti voglio sposare'') whose premiere was in 2010.\n\nIn 2017 he wrote Three times you(Tre volte te/ Tres veses tu) which was the last book of the series of Three meters above heaven.\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n* ''Tre metri sopra il cielo'' (1992)\n* ''Ho voglia di te'' (2006; English: ''I Want You'')\n* ''Scusa ma ti chiamo amore'' (2007) \n* ''Cercasi Niki disperatamente'' (2007)\n* ''Amore 14'' (2008)\n* ''Scusa ma ti voglio sposare'' (2009)\n\n== Films ==\n'''Director'''\n* ''Palla al centro'' (1987)\n* ''[[College (TV series)|College]]'' (1990)\n* ''Classe mista 3\u00b0 A'' (1996)\n* ''[[Scusa ma ti chiamo amore]]'' (2008), based on his novel of the same name\n* ''[[Scusa ma ti voglio sposare]]'' (2009), based on his novel of the same name\n* ''[[Amore 14]]'' (2010), based on his novel of the same name\n* ''[[Universitari]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Non c'\u00e8 campo]]'' (2017)\n\n'''Screenwriter'''\n* ''[[I ragazzi della 3\u00aa C]]'' (1987-1989) - TV series\n* ''[[Natura contro|Cannibal Holocaust II]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[College (TV series)|College]]'' (1990) - TV series\n* ''[[Tre metri sopra il cielo]]'' (2004)\n* ''Ho voglia di te'' (2006)\n* ''[[Scusa ma ti chiamo amore]]'' (2008) \n* ''Scusa ma ti voglio sposare'' (2009)\n* ''Amore 14'' (2010)\n* ''Universitari'' (2013)\n* ''Non c'\u00e8 campo'' (2017)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb name|595062}}\n* [http://www.federicomoccia.it/ Official website]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moccia, Federico}}\n[[Category:1963 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian novelists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian male writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century Italian novelists]]\n[[Category:21st-century male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Bearcat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:recat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Moccia"}
