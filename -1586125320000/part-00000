The film is loosely based on the [[Under the Skin (novel)|2000 novel]] by [[Michel Faber]]. It stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as an otherworldly woman who preys on men in [[Scotland]]. The film premiered at [[Telluride Film Festival]] on 29 August 2013. It was released in the UK on 14 March 2014 and the United States on 4 April 2014.\n\nGlazer developed ''Under the Skin'' for over a decade; he and co-screenwriter Walter Campbell pared it back from an elaborate, special effects-heavy concept to a sparse story focusing on an alien perspective of the human world. Most characters were played by non-actors, and many scenes were filmed with [[hidden camera]]s.\n\nWith a total worldwide gross of \u00a35.2 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=undertheskin2014.htm|title=Under the Skin (2014) (2014) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> ''Under the Skin'' was a [[Box office bomb|box office failure]]. Nevertheless, it received critical acclaim, particularly for Johansson's performance, Glazer's direction, and [[Micachu|Mica Levi]]'s score. It received [[List of accolades received by Under the Skin (2013 film)|multiple awards]] and was named one of the best films of the year and the decade by several publications. It ranks 61st on the [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]] list.\n\n== Plot ==<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, film summaries must be between 400 and 700  words. Please don't add unnecessary detail. -->\nIn [[Glasgow]], a motorcyclist ([[Jeremy McWilliams]]) retrieves an inert young woman (Lynsey Taylor Mackay) from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) dons her clothes. After buying clothes and make-up at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van around Scotland, picking up men. She lures a man (Joe Szula) into a dilapidated house. As he undresses, following the woman into a void, he is submerged in a liquid abyss.\n\nAt a beach, the woman attempts to pick up a swimmer ([[Kry\u0161tof H\u00e1dek]]), but is interrupted by the cries of a drowning couple. The swimmer rescues the husband, but the husband rushes back into the water to save his wife and both drown. As the swimmer lies exhausted on the beach, the woman strikes his head with a rock, drags him to the van, and drives away, ignoring the couple's distraught baby. Later that night, the motorcyclist retrieves the swimmer's belongings, ignoring the baby, who is still on the beach.\n\nThe woman visits a nightclub and picks up another man ([[Paul Brannigan]]). At the house, he follows her into the void and is submerged in the liquid. Suspended beneath the surface, he sees the swimmer floating naked beside him, alive but bloated and almost immobile. When he reaches to touch him, the swimmer's body collapses and a red mass empties through a trough. A series of burning flashes are then shown, suggesting the process is used to great fuel.\n\nThe next day, the woman receives a rose from a street vendor, purchased from another man in traffic. She then listens to a radio report about the missing family from the beach. The woman then seduces a lonely man with facial disfigurement ([[Adam Pearson (actor)|Adam Pearson]]) but lets him leave after examining herself in a mirror. The motorcyclist intercepts the man and bundles him into a car, then sets out in pursuit of the woman with three other motorcyclists.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Highlands]], the woman abandons the van in the fog. She walks to a restaurant and attempts to eat cake, but retches and spits it out. At a bus stop, she meets a man (Michael Moreland) who offers to help her. At his house, he prepares a meal for her and they watch television. Alone in her room, she examines her body in a mirror. They visit a ruined castle, where the man carries her over a puddle and helps her down some steps. At his house, they kiss and begin to have sex, but the woman stops and examines her genitals.\n\nWandering in a forest, the woman meets a commercial logger (Dave Acton) and shelters in a [[bothy]]. She awakes to find the logger molesting her. She runs into the wilderness but he catches and attempts to rape her; he tears her skin, revealing a black, featureless body. As the woman extricates herself from her skin, the man douses her in fuel and burns her alive. Elsewhere, the motorcyclist stands on a mountaintop and looks out across a snowy field.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nDirector [[Jonathan Glazer]] decided to adapt [[Michel Faber]]'s novel ''[[Under the Skin (novel)|Under the Skin]]'' (2000) after finishing his debut film ''[[Sexy Beast]]'' (2000), but work did not begin until he had finished his second film, ''[[Birth (film)|Birth]]'' (2004).<ref name=\":11\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/06/under-the-skin-director-jonathan-glazer-scarlett-johansson|title=Under the Skin: why did this chilling masterpiece take a decade? |last=Leigh |first=Danny | date=2014-03-06 | website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> Glazer's producer James Wilson sent him a script that closely adapted the novel; Glazer admired the script but had no interest in filming it, saying: \"I knew then that I absolutely didn't want to film the book.

Please don't add unnecessary detail. -->\nIn [[Glasgow]], a motorcyclist ([[Jeremy McWilliams]]) retrieves an inert young woman (Lynsey Taylor Mackay) from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) dons her clothes. After buying clothes and make-up at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van around Scotland, picking up men. She lures a man (Joe Szula) into a dilapidated house. As he undresses, following the woman into a void, he is submerged in a liquid abyss.\n\nAt a beach, the woman attempts to pick up a swimmer ([[Kry\u0161tof H\u00e1dek]]), but is interrupted by the cries of a drowning couple. The swimmer rescues the husband, but the husband rushes back into the water to save his wife and both drown. As the swimmer lies exhausted on the beach, the woman strikes his head with a rock, drags him to the van, and drives away, ignoring the couple's distraught baby. Later that night, the motorcyclist retrieves the swimmer's belongings, ignoring the baby, who is still on the beach.\n\nThe woman visits a nightclub and picks up another man ([[Paul Brannigan]]). At the house, he follows her into the void and is submerged in the liquid. Suspended beneath the surface, he sees the swimmer floating naked beside him, alive but bloated and almost immobile. When he reaches to touch him, the swimmer's body collapses and a red mass empties through a trough.\n\nThe next day, the woman receives a rose from a street vendor, purchased from another man in traffic. She then listens to a radio report about the missing family from the beach. The woman then seduces a lonely man with facial disfigurement ([[Adam Pearson (actor)|Adam Pearson]]) but lets him leave after examining herself in a mirror. The motorcyclist intercepts the man and bundles him into a car, then sets out in pursuit of the woman with three other motorcyclists.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Highlands]], the woman abandons the van in the fog. She walks to a restaurant and attempts to eat cake, but retches and spits it out. At a bus stop, she meets a man (Michael Moreland) who offers to help her. At his house, he prepares a meal for her and they watch television. Alone in her room, she examines her body in a mirror. They visit a ruined castle, where the man carries her over a puddle and helps her down some steps. At his house, they kiss and begin to have sex, but the woman stops and examines her genitals.\n\nWandering in a forest, the woman meets a commercial logger (Dave Acton) and shelters in a [[bothy]]. She awakes to find the logger molesting her. She runs into the wilderness but he catches and attempts to rape her; he tears her skin, revealing a black, featureless body. As the woman extricates herself from her skin, the man douses her in fuel and burns her alive.

The Christian Socialist Movement, since 2013 known as [[Christians on the Left]], is one formal group.{{sfn|Leech|2000|pp=677\u2013678}}\n\nOther earlier figures are also viewed as Christian socialists, such as the nineteenth century writers [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] (''The Kingdom of Christ'', 1838), [[John Ruskin]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'', 1862), [[Charles Kingsley]] ([[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|''The Water-Babies'']], 1863), [[Thomas Hughes]] (''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'', 1857), [[Frederick James Furnivall]] (co-creator of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), [[Adin Ballou]] (''Practical Christian Socialism'', 1854), and [[Francis Bellamy]] (a [[Baptist]] minister and the author of the United States' [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]).\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Biblical age===\nElements that would form the basis of Christian socialism are found in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=19}}\n\n====Old Testament====\nOld Testament had divided perspectives on the issue of poverty. One part of the Jewish tradition held that poverty was judgment of God upon the wicked while viewing prosperity as a reward for the good, stating that \"The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the wicked suffers want\" (Prov. 13:25).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=20}}\n\nHowever, there are other sections that instruct generosity to the \"have nots\" of society. The [[Torah]] instructs followers to treat neighbours equally and to be generous to have nots, such as stating:\n{{quote|You shall not oppress your neighbour...but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord|([[Book of Leviticus|Lev]] 19:13, 18).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=21}}}}\n{{quote|He [the [[God in Christianity|Lord]] your God] executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. Love the sojourner therefore; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt|(Deut. 10:18\u201319).{{sfn|Cort|1988}}}}\n{{quote|When you reap in your harvest in the field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it...When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again...When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless and the widow. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I command you to do this|([[Book of Deuteronomy|Deut]]. 24:19\u201322).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=19}}}}\n\nSome of the [[Psalms]] include many references to [[social justice]] for the poor:\n{{quote|''Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked''|(Ps. 82 (81): 3, 4).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=22}}}}\n{{quote|''Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in his commandments!...He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honour''|(Ps. 112 (111): 1, 9).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=22}}}}\n\n[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] emphasizes the need for \"justice\" and \"righteousness\" that is described as conduct that emphasizes love for those who are poor and to oppose oppression and injustice towards the poor.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=23}} The prophet [[Isaiah]] (759\u2013694 B.C.) to whom is attributed the first thirty-nine chapters of the [[Book of Isaiah]] (\"Proto-Isaiah\"), followed upon Amos' themes of justice and righteousness involving the poor as necessary for followers of God, denouncing those who do not do these things, stating:\n{{quote|''Even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood...cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow''|(Isa. 1:15\u201317).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=23}}}}\n\nThe [[Book of Sirach]], one of the [[Deuterocanonical]] or [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocryphal]] books of the Old Testament, denounces the pursuit of wealth, stating:\n{{quote|''He who loves gold will not be justified, and he who pursues money will be led astray by it. Many have come to ruin because of gold, and their destruction has met them face to face. It is a stumbling block to those who are devoted to it, and every fool will be taken captive by it''|(Sir. 31: 5\u20137).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=28}}}}\n\n====New Testament====\nIn the New Testament, [[Jesus]] in Matthew 25:31\u201346 identifies himself with the hungry, the poor, the sick, and the prisoners.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=31}} Matthew 25:31\u201346 is a major component of Christianity and is considered the cornerstone of Christian socialism.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=31}} Another key statement in the New Testament that is an important component of Christian socialism is Luke 10:25\u201337 that follows the statement \"You shall love your neighbour as yourself\" with the question \"And who is my neighbour?\", and in the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] Jesus gives the revolutionary response that the neighbour includes anyone in need, even people we might be expected to shun.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=32}} (The [[Samaritans]] were considered a heretical sect by Jews and neither would usually deal with the other.){{sfn|Cort|1988|p=32}}\n\n[[Image:Giovanni Paolo Pannini 001.jpg|thumb|right|400px|\"Jesus Expels the Moneylenders from the Temple\" by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]]]]\nIn the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus says, \"Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied\" (Luke 6:20, 21).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=37}}\n\nChristian socialists note that [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], the brother of Jesus of Nazareth, in the [[Epistle of James]] criticizes the rich intensely and in strong language:\n{{Quote|Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up for treasure for the last days. Behold, the wages of the labourers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter|(Jam. 5:1\u20136).{{sfn|Cort|1988|pp=41\u201342}}}}\n\nDuring the New Testament period and beyond, there is evidence that many Christian communities practiced forms of sharing, redistribution and communism.{{sfn|Montero|2017}}\n\n===Church Fathers age===\n[[Basil of Caesarea]] (c. 330\u2013379), the [[Church Fathers|Father]] of the Eastern monks who became [[Bishop of Caesarea]], established a complex around the church and monastery that included hostels, almshouses, and hospitals for infectious diseases.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=43}} During the great famine of 368, Basil denounced against profiteers and the indifferent rich.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=43}} Basil wrote the sermon on ''The Rich Fool'' in which he states:\n{{quote|Who is the covetous man? One for whom plenty is not enough. Who is the defrauder? One who takes away what belongs to everyone. And are not you covetous, are you not a defrauder, when you keep for private use what you were given for distribution? When some one strips a man of his clothes we call him a thief. And one who might clothe the naked and does not\u2014should not he be given the same name? The bread in your hoard belongs to the hungry; the cloak in your wardrobe belongs to the naked; the shoes you let rot belong to the barefoot; the money in your vaults belongs to the destitute. All you might help and do not\u2014to all these you are doing wrong{{sfn|Cort|1988|pp=43\u201344}}}}\n\n[[John Chrysostom]] declared his reasons for his attitude towards the rich and position of attitude towards wealth by saying:\n{{quote|I am often reproached for continually attacking the rich. Yes, because the rich are continually attacking the poor. But those I attack are not the rich as such, only those who misuse their wealth. I point out constantly that those I accuse are not the rich, but the rapacious; wealth is one thing, covetousness another. Learn to distinguish.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=45}}}}\n\n===19th century to present===\nA variety of socialist perspectives emerged in 19th century Britain, beginning with [[John Ruskin]].\n\n====John Ruskin====\nThe influential [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art critic [[John Ruskin]] expounded theories about social justice in ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860). In it, he stated four goals that might be called \"socialist\" although Ruskin did not use the term.{{sfn|Ruskin|1872|pp=xi\u2013xiii}}\n# \"training schools for youth, established at government cost\"\n# in connection with these schools, the government should establish \"manufactories and workshops, for the production and sale of every necessary of life\"\n# all unemployed people should be \"set to work\" or trained for work if needed or forced to work if necessary\n# \"for the old and destitute, comfort and home should be provided\"\n\nRuskin was not \"an authentic Socialist in any of its various nineteenth-century meanings.\" His only real contact with the Christian Socialists came through the [[Working Men's College]]. However, he influenced later socialist thinking, especially [[William Morris]].{{sfn|Norman|1987|pp=122, 132}}\n\n====Artists====\nThe painters of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] were influenced and sponsored by Ruskin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html |title=Pre-Raphaelites: An Introduction |last=Landow |first=George P. |year=2015 |orig-year=1989 |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> The artist [[William Morris]] was a leader of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] founded in December 1884.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/morris/wmsocialm.html |title=Morris's Socialism |last=Cody |first=David |year=2002 |orig-year=1987 |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Fabian Society====\nThe [[Fabian Society]] was founded in the same year; [[Sydney Webb|Sydney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] were among its leading members.

It is a view that the teachings of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] compel [[Christians]] to support [[communism]] as the ideal [[social system]].

This opinion was moderated an encyclical issued by [[Pope Pius XI]] on 15 May 1931 ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', wherein Pius describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism. Pius XI called upon true socialism to distance itself from totalitarian communism as a matter of clarity and also as a matter of principle. Communists were accused of attempting to overthrow all existing civil society, and Christian socialism, if allied to communism, was deemed to be an [[oxymoron]] because of this.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Pius XI famously wrote at the time that \"no one can be at the same time a good Catholic and a true socialist\",<ref>{{cite magazine |date=8 July 1957 |title=Socialism & the Vatican |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825096,00.html |url-access=subscription |magazine=Time |volume=70 |issue=2 |page=19 |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> yet had clarified that a Catholic was free to vote for the British Labour Party, the UK affiliate of the Socialist International. Nonetheless, prominent Catholic Socialists did exist during Pope Pius XI's era, such as [[Dorothy Day]] of the United States of America, and [[Michael O'Flanagan|Father Michael O'Flanagan]] of Ireland.\n\nPope Benedict XVI addressed the Italian Senate, declaring, \u201cIn many respects democratic socialism was and is close to Catholic social doctrine; in any case, it contributed toward the formation of a social consciousness.\u201d <ref>https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/without-roots-the-west-relativism-christianity-islam.html</ref>\n\n[[Pope Francis]] has shown sympathy to socialist causes with claims such as that capitalism is \"Terrorism against all of Humanity\"<ref name=\"Knight2016\">{{Cite web |title=Pope Francis: Capitalism is 'Terrorism Against All of Humanity' |last=Knight |first=Nika |work=Common Dreams |date=2 August 2016 |access-date=8 September 2018 |url= https://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/08/02/pope-francis-capitalism-terrorism-against-all-humanity |quote=}}</ref> and that \"it is the communists who think like Christians.

One of the pastors in the movement, Jacques Kaltenbach, was also to have a formative influence on [[Andr\u00e9 and Magda Trocm\u00e9|Andr\u00e9 Trocm\u00e9]].{{sfn|Chalamet|2013}}\n\nUnder the Vichy regime, which had seen the emergence of other forms of witness (particularly the support of internees in the camps, and aiding Jews to escape), the movement was reborn to tackle the problems of a changing world. It expressed a Christian socialism, more or less in line with the beginning of a new political left. Political activism was very broad and included the denunciation of torture, East\u2013West debate on European integration and taking a stance on the process of decolonization. It facilitated meetings between employers, managers and trade unionists to discern a new economic order.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAfter the events of [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]], Calvinism in France became much more left-wing in its orientation.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\">{{cite magazine |last1=Wells |first1=Paul |date=May 1988 |title=L'\u00c9glise C'est Moi: The French Churches and the 'Me' Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kBtZ5WdrI8C&pg=PA14 |magazine=Third Way |volume=11 |issue=5 |location=London |publisher=Hymns Ancient & Modern |pages=14\u201316 |access-date=4 June 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> One doctrinal text produced in this period, ''Church and Authorities'', was described as Marxist in its orientation.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\"/> Churches now seized for themselves the political and social issues to tackle, such as nuclear power and justice for the Third World.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Social Christianity movement temporarily discontinued and its journal, ''Other Times'', ceased to be published.<ref name=\"France Culture 2010\"/> However, the movement was relaunched on 10 June 2010 with a petition signed by over 240 people<ref name=\"France Culture 2010\"/> and now maintains an active presence with its own website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianismesocial.org |title=Accueil |website=...Se r\u00e9clamant du christianisme social |language=French |trans-title=Welcome |access-date=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nEconomically, Calvinists have supported capitalism and have been in the vanguard of promoting market capitalism<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite magazine |date=16 April 1998 |title=Prim but Punchy |url=http://www.economist.com/node/160426 |url-access=limited |magazine=The Economist |volume=346 |issue=8064 |page=48 |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> and have produced many of France's leading entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"The Economist\"/> With regard to politics and social issues however, they are very much socialists.<ref name=\"Wells 1988\"/> Three of France's post-war prime ministers have been Calvinists, despite Protestants only making up two percent of the population.

Its beginnings may be traced to [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] (1684\u20131761), of Llanddowror, [[Carmarthenshire]], whose sympathy for the poor led him to set on foot a system of circulating charity schools for the education of children.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} However, until the nineteenth century, the prevailing thought amongst Welsh non-conformists was that \"it would be wiser if the churches limited their activities to those of the altar and not to meddle at all with the state and social questions\". This stemmed partly from the traditional nonconformist belief in the separation of church and state.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=3}}\n\nIn his influential sermon, ''Y Ddwy Alwedigaeth'' (The Two Vocations), [[Emrys ap Iwan]] challenged this passive pietism: \"We must not think, like the old Methodists, Puritans and some Catholics, that we can only seek Godliness outside our earthly vocation.\" He condemned those Christians who limited godliness to directly religious matters such as Sabbath observance and personal devotion. He declared that all earthly things, including language and culture, have some kind of divine origin.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=4}}\n\nMany of the founders of the Welsh nationalist social-democratic party, [[Plaid Cymru]] were also devout Calvinists,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} including [[John Edward Daniel]]. Daniel was the theologian credited for bringing neo-orthodoxy to Wales. Daniel argued that God did not create man as an isolated individual but as a social being.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe second generation of Plaid Cymru leaders included [[R. Tudur Jones]]. His political stance, combined with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine, created an integrated vision that was significant to the religious life of Christian Wales in the later half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Davies|Jenkins|Baines|Lynch|2008}} Jones argued that the \"state should be a servant, to preserve order and to allow men to live the good life\".{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=5}}\n\nToday, many Calvinist socialists in Wales support same-sex marriage on the grounds that it delivers marriage equality in the eyes of the state while still allowing churches to follow their own conscience, thus upholding the traditional Protestant belief in separation of church and state.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=7}}\n\nThe Calvinist tradition in Plaid Cymru has also influenced its non-violent approach.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} \"The ideal is no fist violence, no verbal violence, and no heart violence.... Christians... point to the New Testament example of Jesus Christ clearing the temple. Here there is no suggestion of violence against people; rather the tables are turned as a symbolic act. The life and teaching of Jesus Christ were seen as the foundations of nonviolent direct action [for Plaid Cymru members]... loving their enemies on the one hand, but not compromising on what they saw as an issue of moral rightness.\"{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=6}} Plaid Cymru continues to see itself as very much part of the Christian pacifist tradition.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=7}}\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Lawrence Reed]], in ''Rendering Unto Caesar'', writes that Jesus was not a socialist in that he promoted voluntary giving and charity rather than the mandatory taking by government (taxes).{{sfn|Reed|2015}}{{Dubious|Criticism section dubious|date=December 2018}} Johnnie Moore (Professor of Religion at [[Liberty University]]) writing on the homepage of [[Fox News Radio]]'s [[Todd Starnes]], says Jesus was a capitalist.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Moore | first1=Johnnie | title=Was Jesus a Socialist or a Capitalist? | url=http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/was-jesus-a-socialist-or-a-capitalist.html | publisher=Fox News Radio | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230518/http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/was-jesus-a-socialist-or-a-capitalist.html | archive-date=5 October 2016 | url-status=unfit | access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>{{Dubious|Criticism section dubious|date=December 2018}} [[Bryan Fischer]], of the [[American Family Association]], says Jesus was a capitalist who advocated \"''voluntary'' redistribution of wealth\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Bryan|authorlink1=Bryan Fischer|title=Jesus Was Not a Socialist|url=http://www.afa.net/the-stand/bible/2015/10/jesus-was-not-a-socialist/|website=The Stand|publisher=American Family Association|date=15 October 2015|access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>{{Dubious|Criticism section dubious|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Charles Haddon Spurgeon]] was critical of socialist doctrines, and warned that those who seek socialism \"may soon have too much of it.\"  Specifically, he regarded collectivist Christianity as inferior to faith on an individual level.

The Christian Socialist Movement, since 2013 known as [[Christians on the Left]], is one formal group.{{sfn|Leech|2000|pp=677\u2013678}}\n\nOther earlier figures are also viewed as Christian socialists, such as the nineteenth century writers [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] (''The Kingdom of Christ'', 1838), [[John Ruskin]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'', 1862), [[Charles Kingsley]] ([[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|''The Water-Babies'']], 1863), [[Thomas Hughes]] (''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'', 1857), [[Frederick James Furnivall]] (co-creator of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), [[Adin Ballou]] (''Practical Christian Socialism'', 1854), and [[Francis Bellamy]] (a [[Baptist]] minister and the author of the United States' [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]).\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Biblical age===\nElements that would form the basis of Christian socialism are found in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=19}}\n\n====Old Testament====\nOld Testament had divided perspectives on the issue of poverty. One part of the Jewish tradition held that poverty was judgment of God upon the wicked while viewing prosperity as a reward for the good, stating that \"The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the wicked suffers want\" (Prov. 13:25).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=20}}\n\nHowever, there are other sections that instruct generosity to the \"have nots\" of society. The [[Torah]] instructs followers to treat neighbours equally and to be generous to have nots, such as stating:\n{{quote|You shall not oppress your neighbour...but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord|([[Book of Leviticus|Lev]] 19:13, 18).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=21}}}}\n{{quote|He [the [[God in Christianity|Lord]] your God] executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. Love the sojourner therefore; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt|(Deut. 10:18\u201319).{{sfn|Cort|1988}}}}\n{{quote|When you reap in your harvest in the field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it...When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again...When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless and the widow. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I command you to do this|([[Book of Deuteronomy|Deut]]. 24:19\u201322).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=19}}}}\n\nSome of the [[Psalms]] include many references to [[social justice]] for the poor:\n{{quote|''Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked''|(Ps. 82 (81): 3, 4).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=22}}}}\n{{quote|''Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in his commandments!...He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honour''|(Ps. 112 (111): 1, 9).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=22}}}}\n\n[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] emphasizes the need for \"justice\" and \"righteousness\" that is described as conduct that emphasizes love for those who are poor and to oppose oppression and injustice towards the poor.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=23}} The prophet [[Isaiah]] (759\u2013694 B.C.) to whom is attributed the first thirty-nine chapters of the [[Book of Isaiah]] (\"Proto-Isaiah\"), followed upon Amos' themes of justice and righteousness involving the poor as necessary for followers of God, denouncing those who do not do these things, stating:\n{{quote|''Even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood...cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow''|(Isa. 1:15\u201317).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=23}}}}\n\nThe [[Book of Sirach]], one of the [[Deuterocanonical]] or [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocryphal]] books of the Old Testament, denounces the pursuit of wealth, stating:\n{{quote|''He who loves gold will not be justified, and he who pursues money will be led astray by it. Many have come to ruin because of gold, and their destruction has met them face to face. It is a stumbling block to those who are devoted to it, and every fool will be taken captive by it''|(Sir. 31: 5\u20137).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=28}}}}\n\n====New Testament====\nIn the New Testament, [[Jesus]] in Matthew 25:31\u201346 identifies himself with the hungry, the poor, the sick, and the prisoners.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=31}} Matthew 25:31\u201346 is a major component of Christianity and is considered the cornerstone of Christian socialism.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=31}} Another key statement in the New Testament that is an important component of Christian socialism is Luke 10:25\u201337 that follows the statement \"You shall love your neighbour as yourself\" with the question \"And who is my neighbour?\", and in the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] Jesus gives the revolutionary response that the neighbour includes anyone in need, even people we might be expected to shun.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=32}} (The [[Samaritans]] were considered a heretical sect by Jews and neither would usually deal with the other.){{sfn|Cort|1988|p=32}}\n\n[[Image:Giovanni Paolo Pannini 001.jpg|thumb|right|400px|\"Jesus Expels the Moneylenders from the Temple\" by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]]]]\nIn the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus says, \"Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied\" (Luke 6:20, 21).{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=37}}\n\nChristian socialists note that [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], the brother of Jesus of Nazareth, in the [[Epistle of James]] criticizes the rich intensely and in strong language:\n{{Quote|Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up for treasure for the last days. Behold, the wages of the labourers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter|(Jam. 5:1\u20136).{{sfn|Cort|1988|pp=41\u201342}}}}\n\nDuring the New Testament period and beyond, there is evidence that many Christian communities practiced forms of sharing, redistribution and communism.{{sfn|Montero|2017}}\n\nSome of the Bible verses which inspired the communal economic arrangements of the [[Hutterite|Hutterites]] are found in the book of Acts:\n:\"All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.\" (Acts 2, verses 44 and 45)\n:\"All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions were his own, but they shared everything they had.\" (Acts 4, verse 32)\n:\"There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from their sales and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need.\" (Acts 4, verses 34 and 35)\n\n===Church Fathers age===\n[[Basil of Caesarea]] (c. 330\u2013379), the [[Church Fathers|Father]] of the Eastern monks who became [[Bishop of Caesarea]], established a complex around the church and monastery that included hostels, almshouses, and hospitals for infectious diseases.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=43}} During the great famine of 368, Basil denounced against profiteers and the indifferent rich.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=43}} Basil wrote the sermon on ''The Rich Fool'' in which he states:\n{{quote|Who is the covetous man? One for whom plenty is not enough. Who is the defrauder? One who takes away what belongs to everyone. And are not you covetous, are you not a defrauder, when you keep for private use what you were given for distribution? When some one strips a man of his clothes we call him a thief. And one who might clothe the naked and does not\u2014should not he be given the same name? The bread in your hoard belongs to the hungry; the cloak in your wardrobe belongs to the naked; the shoes you let rot belong to the barefoot; the money in your vaults belongs to the destitute. All you might help and do not\u2014to all these you are doing wrong{{sfn|Cort|1988|pp=43\u201344}}}}\n\n[[John Chrysostom]] declared his reasons for his attitude towards the rich and position of attitude towards wealth by saying:\n{{quote|I am often reproached for continually attacking the rich. Yes, because the rich are continually attacking the poor. But those I attack are not the rich as such, only those who misuse their wealth. I point out constantly that those I accuse are not the rich, but the rapacious; wealth is one thing, covetousness another. Learn to distinguish.{{sfn|Cort|1988|p=45}}}}\n\n===19th century to present===\nA variety of socialist perspectives emerged in 19th century Britain, beginning with [[John Ruskin]].\n\n====John Ruskin====\nThe influential [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art critic [[John Ruskin]] expounded theories about social justice in ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860).

This opinion was moderated an encyclical issued by [[Pope Pius XI]] on 15 May 1931 ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', wherein Pius describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism. Pius XI called upon true socialism to distance itself from totalitarian communism as a matter of clarity and also as a matter of principle. Communists were accused of attempting to overthrow all existing civil society, and Christian socialism, if allied to communism, was deemed to be an [[oxymoron]] because of this.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Pius XI famously wrote at the time that \"no one can be at the same time a good Catholic and a true socialist\",<ref>{{cite magazine |date=8 July 1957 |title=Socialism & the Vatican |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825096,00.html |url-access=subscription |magazine=Time |volume=70 |issue=2 |page=19 |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref> yet had clarified that a Catholic was free to vote for the British Labour Party, the UK affiliate of the Socialist International.

Political activism was very broad and included the denunciation of torture, East\u2013West debate on European integration and taking a stance on the process of decolonization.

This stemmed partly from the traditional nonconformist belief in the separation of church and state.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=3}}\n\nIn his influential sermon, ''Y Ddwy Alwedigaeth'' (The Two Vocations), [[Emrys ap Iwan]] challenged this passive pietism: \"We must not think, like the old Methodists, Puritans and some Catholics, that we can only seek Godliness outside our earthly vocation.\" He condemned those Christians who limited godliness to directly religious matters such as Sabbath observance and personal devotion. He declared that all earthly things, including language and culture, have some kind of divine origin.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=4}}\n\nMany of the founders of the Welsh nationalist social-democratic party, [[Plaid Cymru]] were also devout Calvinists,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} including [[John Edward Daniel]].

Daniel argued that God did not create man as an isolated individual but as a social being.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe second generation of Plaid Cymru leaders included [[R. Tudur Jones]]. His political stance, combined with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine, created an integrated vision that was significant to the religious life of Christian Wales in the later half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Davies|Jenkins|Baines|Lynch|2008}} Jones argued that the \"state should be a servant, to preserve order and to allow men to live the good life\".{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=5}}\n\nToday, many Calvinist socialists in Wales support same-sex marriage on the grounds that it delivers marriage equality in the eyes of the state while still allowing churches to follow their own conscience, thus upholding the traditional Protestant belief in separation of church and state.{{sfn|Llwyd|2015|p=7}}\n\nThe Calvinist tradition in Plaid Cymru has also influenced its non-violent approach.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} \"The ideal is no fist violence, no verbal violence, and no heart violence....

The first time she realizes this, she is in a truck with her high school's basketball captain and star, Clay Boone, who tries to rape her. She has a seizure and teleports, in the course of which she inadvertently crushes much of his truck when her ability to teleport first manifests, leaving him a paraplegic. The show goes on to explore Henry's need to reconcile what her assailant tried to do with the consequence, and her feelings about discovering she can teleport and [[Psionics|psionically]] move objects from a distance, which are triggered by her feelings of fear regarding the assault.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles, a teenage girl who possesses the ability to teleport, though has no control over her destination.

The series is executive produced by Lauren LeFranc, [[Doug Liman]], [[David Bartis]], and Gene Klein. LeFranc also acts as showrunner for the series. In July 2018, the series was renewed for a second season consisting of ten episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2019. ''Impulse'' was canceled in March 2020.\n\n==Premise==\n''Impulse'' follows 16-year-old Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles who discovers she has the ability to [[Teleportation in fiction|teleport]] but has no control over her destination. The first time she realizes this, she is in a truck with her high school's basketball captain and star, Clay Boone, who tries to rape her. She has a seizure and teleports, in the course of which she inadvertently crushes much of his truck when her ability to teleport first manifests, leaving him a paraplegic. The show goes on to explore Henry's need to reconcile what her assailant tried to do with the consequence, and her feelings about discovering she can teleport and [[Psionics|psionically]] move objects from a distance, which are triggered by her feelings of fear regarding the assault.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles, a teenage girl who possesses the ability to teleport, though has no control over her destination. She first realizes she has this capability while in the middle of being sexually assaulted. Her powers activate through emotional distress. She eventually is taught to control her powers. \n**Carina Battrick portrays a younger Henry Coles in a supporting role.\n*[[Sarah Desjardins]] as Jenna Faith Hope, Henry's soon-to-be stepsister and confidante.

She eventually witnesses a man teleporting away right before her eyes and confronts Henry about it.\n* Craig Arnold as Lucas Boone, a local mechanic, drug trafficker, and the eldest son of car and drug dealer Bill Boone. After spending time with the Millers and learning their religious ways, he returns to Reston and declares his unwavering devotion and allegiance to Henry as penance for what his father and brother put her through. \n* Tanner Stine as Clay Boone, a star of the local basketball team and Bill Boone's youngest son. A classmate of Henry's, Clay develops an interest in her when she begins attending school. While making out in his truck, he attempts to rape her. The assault causes her latent ability to teleport to activate, resulting in her having a seizure and teleporting away out of self-preservation. The resulting spatial distortion of Henry's escape crushes much of Clay's truck and leaves him without the use of his legs.

The principal islands are about {{convert|300|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[South America]]'s southern [[Patagonia]]n coast, and about {{convert|752|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} from the [[Cape Dubouzet|northern tip]] of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], at a latitude of about 52\u00b0S. The archipelago, with an area of {{convert|4700|sqmi|km2|abbr=off}}, comprises [[East Falkland]], [[West Falkland]] and 776 smaller islands. As a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]], the Falklands have internal [[self-governance]], and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The Falkland Islands' capital is [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] on East Falkland.\n\nControversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements.

Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarians|Gibraltarian]] and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], Falkland Islanders are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].\n\nThe islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|subantarctic oceanic]] and [[tundra climate]] zones, and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching  {{convert|700|m|ft|order=flip}}. They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from [[introduced species]]. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism and sheep farming, with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the [[Falkland Islands Government]], remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{see also|List of Falkland Islands placenames}}\n\nThe name \"Falkland Islands\" comes from [[Falkland Sound]], the [[strait]] that separates the two main islands.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p = 73}} The name \"Falkland\" was applied to the channel by [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]], captain of an English expedition which landed on the islands in 1690.

The principal islands are about {{convert|300|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[South America]]'s southern [[Patagonia]]n coast, and about {{convert|752|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} from the [[Cape Dubouzet|northern tip]] of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], at a latitude of about 52\u00b0S. The archipelago, with an area of {{convert|4700|sqmi|km2|abbr=off}}, comprises [[East Falkland]], [[West Falkland]] and 776 smaller islands. As a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]], the Falklands have internal [[self-governance]], and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The Falkland Islands' capital is [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] on East Falkland.\n\nControversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|reasserted its rule in 1833]], but Argentina maintains its [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claim to the islands]]. In April 1982, Argentine military forces [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded the islands]]. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the [[Falklands War]]. Almost all Falklanders [[2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum|favour]] the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory. Its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom]].\n\nThe population (3,398 inhabitants in 2016)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fig.gov.fk/policy/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/5-statistics/4788-falkland-islands-census-2016-report/0?Itemid=0#page=14|title=2016 Census Report|year=2017|publisher=Policy and Economic Development Unit, Falkland Islands Government|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124232820/http://www.fig.gov.fk/policy/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/5-statistics/4788-falkland-islands-census-2016-report/0?Itemid=0|archive-date=24 January 2018|url-status=}}</ref> consists primarily of native-born [[Falkland Islanders]], the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarians|Gibraltarian]] and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], Falkland Islanders are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].\n\nThe islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|subantarctic oceanic]] and [[tundra climate]] zones, and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching  {{convert|700|m|ft|order=flip}}. They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from [[introduced species]].
