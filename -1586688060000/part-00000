Its goal is to investigate the processes that underlie human [[language learning]] by testing subjects' ability to learn a made-up grammar in a laboratory setting. It was developed to evaluate the processes of human language learning but has also been utilized to study [[implicit learning]] in a more general sense. The area of interest is typically the subjects' ability to detect patterns and statistical regularities during a training phase and then use their new knowledge of those patterns in a testing phase. The testing phase can either use the symbols or sounds used in the training phase or transfer the patterns to another set of symbols or sounds as surface structure.\n\nMany researchers propose that the rules of the artificial grammar are learned on an implicit level since the rules of the grammar are never explicitly presented to the participants.  The paradigm has also recently been utilized for other areas of research such as [[language learning aptitude]], structural priming <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Michelle|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|last3=Pine|first3=Julian M.|last4=Blything|first4=Ryan|last5=Rowland|first5=Caroline F.|date=May 2015|title=When and how do children develop knowledge of verb argument structure?

Miller]]<ref name=\"Miller, 1958\">{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=G.A.|title=Free recall of redundant strings of letters.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1958|volume=56|issue=6|pages=485\u2013491|doi=10.1037/h0044933|pmid=13611173}}</ref> established the paradigm of artificial grammar learning in order to investigate the influence of explicit grammar structures on human learning, he designed a grammar model of letters with different sequences. His research demonstrated that it was easier to remember a structured grammar sequence than a random sequence of letters. His explanation was that learners could identify the common characteristics between learned sequences and accordingly encode them to a memory set. He predicted that subjects could identify which letters will most likely appear together as a sequence repeatedly and which letters would not and that the subjects would use this information to form memory sets. Those memory sets served participants as a strategy later on during their memory tests.\n\nReber<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\" /> doubted Miller's explanation. He claimed that if participants could encode the grammar rules as productive memory sets, then they should be able to verbalize their strategy in detail. He conducted research that led to the development of the modern AGL paradigm. This research used a synthetic grammar learning model to test implicit learning. AGL became the most used and tested model in the field. As in the original paradigm developed by Miller, participants were asked to memorize a list of letter strings which were created from an artificial grammar rule model. It was only during the test phase that participants were told that there was a set of rules behind the letter sequences they memorized. They were then instructed to categorize new letter strings based on the same set of rules which they had not previously been exposed to. They classified new letter strings as \"grammatical\" (constructed from the grammar rule), vs. \"randomly constructed\" sequences. If subjects correctly sorted the new strings above chance level, it could be inferred that subjects had acquired the grammatical rule structure without any explicit instruction of the rules. Reber<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\" /> found that participants sorted out new strings above chance level. While they reported using strategies during the sorting task, they could not actually verbalize those strategies. Subjects could identify which strings were grammatically correct but could not identify the rules that composed grammatical strings.\n\nThis research was replicated and expanded upon by many others.<ref name=\"Mathews et al., 1989\">{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=R.C.|author2=Buss, R.

These studies also identified common characteristics for the implicitly acquired knowledge:\n\n#Abstract representation for the set of rules.\n#Unconscious strategies that can be tested with performance.\n\n== The modern paradigm ==\n\nThe modern AGL paradigm can be used to investigate explicit and implicit learning, although it is most often used to test implicit learning. In a typical AGL experiment, participants are required to memorize strings of letters previously generated by a specific [[grammar]]. The length of the strings usually ranges from 2-9 letters per string. An example of such a grammar is shown in figure 1.\n\n[[File:Artificial grammar learning example.jpg|framed|center]]\n\nFigure 1: '''Example of an artificial grammar rule'''\n* Ruleful strings:'''VXVS, TPTXVS'''  Unruleful strings:'''VXXXS, TPTPS'''\n\nIn order to compose a grammatically \"ruleful\" string of letters, according to the predetermined grammar rule, a subject must follow the rules for the pairing of letters as represented in the model (figure 1). When observing a violation of the grammatical rule system that composes the string, it is considered an \"unruleful\" or randomly constructed string.\n\nIn the case of a standard AGL implicit learning task,<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\">{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=A.S.|title=Implicit learning of artificial grammars.|journal=Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1967|volume=5|issue=6|pages=855\u2013863|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(67)80149-x}}</ref> subjects are not told that the strings are based on a specific grammar. Instead, they are simply given the task to memorize the letter strings for a memory. After the learning phase, subjects are told that the letter strings presented during the learning phase were based on specific rules, but are not explicitly told what the rules are. During a test phase, the subjects are instructed to categorize new letter strings as \"ruleful\" or \"unruleful\". The dependent variable usually measured is the percentage of correctly categorized strings. Implicit learning is considered to be successful when the percentage of correctly sorted strings is significantly higher than chance level. If this significant difference is found, it indicates the existence of a learning process that is more involved than memorizing the presented letter strings.<ref name=\"Seger, 1994\">{{cite journal|last=Seger|first=C.A.|title=Implicit learning.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1994|volume=115|issue=2|pages=163\u2013196|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.2.163|pmid=8165269}}</ref>\n\n==Bayesian learning==\nThe mechanism behind the implicit learning that is hypothesized to occur while people engage in artificial grammar learning is [[statistical learning]] or, more specifically, [[Bayesian learning]]. Bayesian learning takes into account types of biases or \"prior probability distributions\" individuals have that contribute to the outcome of implicit learning tasks. These biases can be thought of as a probability distribution that contains the probability that each possible hypothesis is likely to be correct. Due to the structure of the [[Bayesian model]], the inferences output by the model are in the form of a probability distribution rather than a single most probable event. This output distribution is a \"posterior probability distribution\". The posterior probability of each hypothesis in the original distribution is the probability of the hypothesis being true given the data and the probability of data given the hypothesis is true.<ref name=\"Kapatsinski, 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Kapatsinski|first=V.|title=The Architecture of Grammar in Artificial Grammar Learning: Formal Biases in the Acquisition of Morphophonology and the Nature of the Learning Task.|journal=Indiana University|year=2009|pages=1\u2013260|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/ef2c4969c167d0581a932fe2fcfd5fff/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y}}</ref>\nThis Bayesian model for learning is fundamental for understanding the pattern detection process involved in implicit learning and, therefore, the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of artificial grammar learning rules. It is hypothesized that the implicit learning of grammar involves predicting co-occurrences of certain words in a certain order. For example,  \"the dog chased the ball\" is a sentence that can be learned as grammatically correct on an implicit level due to the high co-occurrence of \"chase\" being one of the words to follow \"dog\". A sentence like \"the dog cat the ball\" is implicitly recognized as grammatically incorrect due to the lack of utterances that contain those words paired in that specific order. This process is important for teasing apart thematic roles and parts of speech in grammatical processing (see [[grammar]]). While the labeling of the thematic roles and parts of speech is explicit, the identification of words and parts of speech is implicit.\n\n==Explanatory models==\n\nTraditional approaches to AGL claim that the stored knowledge obtained during the learning phase is abstract.<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\" /> Other approaches<ref name=\"Brooks & Vokey, 1991\" /><ref name=\"Vokey & Brooks, 1992\">{{cite journal|last=Vokey|first=J.R.|author2=Brooks, L.R.|title=Salience of item knowledge in learning artificial grammar.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1992|volume=18|issue=2|pages=328\u2013344|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.18.2.328}}</ref> argue that this stored knowledge is concrete and consists of [[wikt:exemplar|exemplars]] of strings encountered during the learning phase or \"chunks\" of these exemplars.<ref name=\"Perruchet & Pacteau, 1990\" /><ref name=\"Servan-Schreiber & Anderson, 1990\">{{cite journal|last=Servan-Schreiber|first=E.|author2=Anderson, J.R.|title=Chunking as a mechanism of implicit learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1990|volume=16|issue=4|pages=592\u2013608|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.16.4.592}}</ref> In any case, it is assumed that the information stored in memory is retrieved in the test phase and is used to aid decisions about letter strings.<ref name=\"Pothos, 2007\">{{cite journal|last=Pothos|first=E.M.|title=Theories of artificial grammar learning|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2007|volume=133|issue=2|pages=227\u2013244|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.227|pmid=17338598|citeseerx=10.1.1.137.1619}}</ref><ref name=\"Poznanski & Tzelgov, 2010\">{{cite journal|last=Poznanski|first=Y.|author2=Tzelgov, J.|title=What is implicit in implicit artificial grammar learning?|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2010|volume=63|issue=8|pages=1495\u20132015|doi=10.1080/17470210903398121|pmid=20063258}}</ref> \nThree main approaches attempt to explain the AGL phenomena:\n \n# ''Abstract Approach'': According to this traditional approach, participants acquire an abstract representation of the artificial grammar rule in the learning stage.

During the testing stage, participants do not sort the new strings according to an abstract rule; instead they will sort them according to their similarity to the examples stored in memory from the learning stage. There are multiple opinions concerning how concrete the learned knowledge really is. Brooks & Vokey<ref name=\"Brooks & Vokey, 1991\" /><ref name=\"Vokey & Brooks, 1992\" />  argue that all of the knowledge stored in memory is represented as concrete examples of the full examples studied during the learning stage. The strings are sorted during the testing stage according to a full representation of the string examples from the learning stage. On the other hand, Perruchet & Pacteau<ref name=\"Perruchet & Pacteau, 1990\" /> claimed that the knowledge of the strings from the learning stage is stored in the form of \"memory chunks\" where 2 - 3 letters are learned as a sequence along with knowledge about their permitted location in the full string.<ref name=\"Perruchet & Pacteau, 1990\" /><ref name=\"Servan-Schreiber & Anderson, 1990\" />\n# ''Dual Factor approach'': Dual process learning model, combines the approaches described above.

Amnesiacs were able to classify stimuli as \"grammatical\" vs. \"randomly constructed\" just as well as participants in the control group. While able to successfully complete the task, amnesiacs were not able to explicitly recall grammatical \"chunks\" of the letter sequence while the control group was able to explicitly recall them. When performing the task with the same grammar rules but a different sequence of letters than those that they were previously tested on, both amnesiacs and the control group were able to complete the task (although performance was better when the task was completed using the same set of letters used for training). The results of the experiment support the dual factor approach to artificial grammar learning in that people use abstract information to learn rules for grammars and use concrete, exemplar-specific memory for chunks. Since the amnesiacs were unable to store specific \"chunks\" in memory, they completed the task using an abstract set of rules. The control group was able to store these specific chunks in memory and (as evidenced by recall) did store these examples in memory for later reference.\n\n==Automaticity debate==\n\nAGL research has been criticized due to the \"automatic question\": Is AGL considered to be an automatic process? During encoding (see [[encoding (memory)]]), performance can be automatic in the sense of occurring without conscious monitoring (without conscious guidance by the performer's intentions). In the case of AGL, it was claimed that implicit learning is an automatic process due to the fact that it is done with no intention of learning a specific grammar rule.<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\" /> This complies with the classic definition of an \"automatic process\" as a fast, unconscious, effortless process that may start unintentionally. When aroused, it continues until it is over without the ability to stop or ignore its consequences.<ref name=\"Hasher & Zacks, 1979\">{{cite journal|last=Hasher|first=L.|author2=Zacks, R.|title=Automatic and effortful processes in memory|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|year=1979|volume=108|issue=3|pages=356\u2013388|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.108.3.356 }}</ref><ref name=\"Schneider, Dumais & Shiffrin, 1984\">{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=W. |author2=Dumais, S.

The process is complex and contains encoding and [[recall (memory)|recall]] or retrieval. Both encoding and retrieval could be interpreted as automatic processes since what was encoded during the learning stage is not necessary for the task intentionally performed during the test stage.<ref name=\"Perlman & Tzelgov, 2006\">{{cite journal|last=Perlman|first=A.|author2=Tzelgov, J.|title=Interaction between encoding and retrieval in the domain of sequence learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2006|volume=32|issue=1|pages=118\u2013130|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.32.1.118 |pmid=16478345}}</ref> Researchers need to differentiate between implicitness as referring to the process of learning or knowledge encoding and also as referring to performance during the test phase or knowledge retrieval. Knowledge encoded during training may include many aspects of the presented stimuli (whole strings, relations among elements, etc.). The contribution of the various components to performance depends on both the specific instruction in the acquisition phase and the requirements of the retrieval task.<ref name=\"Poznanski & Tzelgov, 2010\" /> Therefore, the instructions on every phase are important in order to determine whether or not each stage will require automatic processing. Each phase should be evaluated for automaticity separately.\n\nOne hypothesis that contradicts the automaticity of AGL is the \"mere exposure effect\". The mere exposure effect is increased affect towards a stimulus that is the result of nonreinforced, repeated exposure to the stimulus.<ref name=\"Manza, Zizak & Reber, 1998\">{{cite journal|last=Manza|first=L. |author2=Zizak, D. |author3=Reber, A.S.|title=Artificial grammar learning and the mere exposure effect: Emotional preference tasks and the implicit learning process|journal=In Stadler, M.A. & Frensch, P.A.

Stimuli for these experiments included line drawings, polygons and nonsense words (which are types of stimuli used in AGL research). These experiments exposed participants to each stimulus up to 25 times. Following each exposure participants were asked to rate the degree to which each stimulus suggested \"good\" vs. \"bad\" effect on a 7-point scale. In addition to the main pattern of results, it was also found in several experiments that participants rated higher positive affect for previously exposed items than for novel items. Since [[implicit cognition]] should not reference previous study episodes, the effects on affect ratings should not have been observed if processing of this stimuli is truly implicit. The results of these experiments suggests that different categorization of the strings may occur due to differences in affect associated with the strings and not due to implicitly learned grammar rules.\n\n==Artificial intelligence==\n\nSince the advent of computers and [[artificial intelligence]], computer programs have been adapted that attempt to simulate the implicit learning process observed in the AGL paradigm. The AI programs first adapted to simulate both natural and artificial grammar learning used the following basic structure:\n\n;Given: A set of grammatical sentences from some language.\n\n;Find: A procedure for recognizing and/or generating all grammatical sentences in that language.\n\nAn early model for AI grammar learning is Wolff's SNPR System.<ref name=\"WOLFF1982\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wolff | first1 = J.G. | year = 1982 | title = Language acquisition, data compression and generalization | url = http://www.cognitionresearch.org/papers/ll/lang_comm_1982/wolff_1982.doc | journal = Language & Communication | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 57\u201389 | doi = 10.1016/0271-5309(82)90035-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"MacWhinney, 1987\" /> The program acquires a series of letters with no pauses or punctuation between words and sentences. The program then examines the string in subsets and looks for common sequences of symbols and defines \"chunks\" in terms of these sequences (these chunks are akin to the exemplar-specific chunks described for AGL). As the model acquires these chunks through exposure, the chunks begin to replace the sequences of unbroken letters. When a chunk precedes or follows a common chunk, then the model determines disjunctive classes in terms of the first set.<ref name=\"MacWhinney, 1987\">{{cite book|last=MacWhinney|first=B.|title=Mechanisms of language acquisition|year=1987|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Hillsdale, NJ|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-XJAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781317757405}}</ref> For example, when the model encounters \"the-dog-chased\" and \"the-cat-chased\" it classifies \"dog\" and \"cat\" as being members of the same class since they both precede \"chase\". While the model sorts chunks into classes, it does explicitly define these groups (e.g., noun, verb). Early AI models of grammar learning such as these ignored the importance of negative instances of grammar's effect on grammar acquisition and were also lacking in the ability to connect grammatical rules to [[pragmatics]] and [[semantics]]. Newer models have attempted to factor these details in.\nThe Unified Model<ref name=\"MacWhinney, 2008\">{{cite journal|last=MacWhinney|first=B.|title=A Unified Model|journal=In Robinson, P. & Ellis, N. (Eds.), Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition|year=2008|volume=Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}</ref> attempts to take both of these factors into account. The model breaks down grammar according to \"cues\". Languages mark case roles using five possible cue types: word order, case marking, agreement, intonation and verb-based expectation (see [[grammar]]). The influence that each cue has over a language's grammar is determined by its \"cue strength\" and \"cue validity\". Both of these values are determined using the same formula, except that cue strength is defined through experimental results and cue validity is defined through corpus counts from language databases. The formula for cue strength/validity is as follows:\n\n: Cue strength/cue validity = cue availability * cue reliability\n\nCue availability is the proportion of times that the cue is available over the times that it is needed. Cue reliability is the proportion of times that the cue is correct over the total occurrences of the cue. By incorporating cue reliability along with cue availability, The Unified Model is able to account for the effects of negative instances of grammar since it takes accuracy and not just frequency into account. As a result, this also accounts for the semantic and pragmatic information since cues that do not produce grammar in the appropriate context will have low cue strength and cue validity. While MacWhinney's model<ref name=\"MacWhinney, 2008\" /> also simulates natural grammar learning, it attempts to model the implicit learning processes observed in the AGL paradigm.\n\n==Cognitive neuroscience and the AGL paradigm==\n\nContemporary studies with AGL have attempted to identify which structures are involved in the acquisition of grammar and implicit learning. Agrammatic aphasic patients (see [[Agrammatism]]) were tested with the AGL paradigm. The results show that breakdown of language in agrammatic aphasia is associated with an impairment in artificial grammar learning, indicating damage to domain-general neural mechanisms sub serving both language and sequential learning.<ref name=\"Christiansen et al., 2010\">{{cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=M.H. |author2=Kelly, M.L. |author3=Shillcock, R.C. |author4=Greenfield, K.|title=Impaired artificial grammar learning in agrammatism|journal=Cognition|year=2010|volume=116|issue=3|pages=383\u2013393|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.015 |pmid=20605017|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d822a0d7b20b7cd15c103d213bfa906e6c45cae2 }}</ref>\nDe Vries, Barth, Maiworm, Knecht, Zwitserlood & Fl\u00f6el<ref name=\"De Vries, 2010\">{{cite journal|last=De Vries|first=M.H. |author2=Barth, A.C.R. |author3=Maiworm, S. |author4=Knecht, S. |author5=Zwisterlood, P.  |author6=Floel, A.|title=Electrical stimulation of Broca's area enhances implicit learning of artificial grammar|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2010|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2427\u20132436|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21385|pmid=19925194 |citeseerx=10.1.1.469.3005 }}</ref> found that electrical stimulation of [[Broca's area]] enhances implicit learning of an artificial grammar.

Its goal is to investigate the processes that underlie human [[language learning]] by testing subjects' ability to learn a made-up grammar in a laboratory setting. It was developed to evaluate the processes of human language learning but has also been utilized to study [[implicit learning]] in a more general sense. The area of interest is typically the subjects' ability to detect patterns and statistical regularities during a training phase and then use their new knowledge of those patterns in a testing phase. The testing phase can either use the symbols or sounds used in the training phase or transfer the patterns to another set of symbols or sounds as surface structure.\n\nMany researchers propose that the rules of the artificial grammar are learned on an implicit level since the rules of the grammar are never explicitly presented to the participants.  The paradigm has also recently been utilized for other areas of research such as [[language learning aptitude]], structural priming <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Michelle|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|last3=Pine|first3=Julian M.|last4=Blything|first4=Ryan|last5=Rowland|first5=Caroline F.|date=May 2015|title=When and how do children develop knowledge of verb argument structure?

Miller]]<ref name=\"Miller, 1958\">{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=G.A.|title=Free recall of redundant strings of letters.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1958|volume=56|issue=6|pages=485\u2013491|doi=10.1037/h0044933|pmid=13611173}}</ref> established the paradigm of artificial grammar learning in order to investigate the influence of explicit grammar structures on human learning, he designed a grammar model of letters with different sequences. His research demonstrated that it was easier to remember a structured grammar sequence than a random sequence of letters. His explanation was that learners could identify the common characteristics between learned sequences and accordingly encode them to a memory set. He predicted that subjects could identify which letters will most likely appear together as a sequence repeatedly and which letters would not and that the subjects would use this information to form memory sets. Those memory sets served participants as a strategy later on during their memory tests.\n\nReber<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\" /> doubted Miller's explanation. He claimed that if participants could encode the grammar rules as productive memory sets, then they should be able to verbalize their strategy in detail. He conducted research that led to the development of the modern AGL paradigm. This research used a synthetic grammar learning model to test implicit learning. AGL became the most used and tested model in the field. As in the original paradigm developed by Miller, participants were asked to memorize a list of letter strings which were created from an artificial grammar rule model. It was only during the test phase that participants were told that there was a set of rules behind the letter sequences they memorized. They were then instructed to categorize new letter strings based on the same set of rules which they had not previously been exposed to. They classified new letter strings as \"grammatical\" (constructed from the grammar rule), vs. \"randomly constructed\" sequences. If subjects correctly sorted the new strings above chance level, it could be inferred that subjects had acquired the grammatical rule structure without any explicit instruction of the rules. Reber<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\" /> found that participants sorted out new strings above chance level. While they reported using strategies during the sorting task, they could not actually verbalize those strategies. Subjects could identify which strings were grammatically correct but could not identify the rules that composed grammatical strings.\n\nThis research was replicated and expanded upon by many others.<ref name=\"Mathews et al., 1989\">{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=R.C.|author2=Buss, R.

In a typical AGL experiment, participants are required to memorize strings of letters previously generated by a specific [[grammar]]. The length of the strings usually ranges from 2-9 letters per string. An example of such a grammar is shown in figure 1.\n\n[[File:Artificial grammar learning example.jpg|framed|center]]\n\nFigure 1: '''Example of an artificial grammar rule'''\n* Ruleful strings:'''VXVS, TPTXVS'''  Unruleful strings:'''VXXXS, TPTPS'''\n\nIn order to compose a grammatically \"ruleful\" string of letters, according to the predetermined grammar rule, a subject must follow the rules for the pairing of letters as represented in the model (figure 1). When observing a violation of the grammatical rule system that composes the string, it is considered an \"unruleful\" or randomly constructed string.\n\nIn the case of a standard AGL implicit learning task,<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\">{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=A.S.|title=Implicit learning of artificial grammars.|journal=Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1967|volume=5|issue=6|pages=855\u2013863|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(67)80149-x}}</ref> subjects are not told that the strings are based on a specific grammar. Instead, they are simply given the task to memorize the letter strings for a memory. After the learning phase, subjects are told that the letter strings presented during the learning phase were based on specific rules, but are not explicitly told what the rules are. During a test phase, the subjects are instructed to categorize new letter strings as \"ruleful\" or \"unruleful\". The dependent variable usually measured is the percentage of correctly categorized strings. Implicit learning is considered to be successful when the percentage of correctly sorted strings is significantly higher than chance level. If this significant difference is found, it indicates the existence of a learning process that is more involved than memorizing the presented letter strings.<ref name=\"Seger, 1994\">{{cite journal|last=Seger|first=C.A.|title=Implicit learning.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1994|volume=115|issue=2|pages=163\u2013196|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.2.163|pmid=8165269}}</ref>\n\n==Bayesian learning==\nThe mechanism behind the implicit learning that is hypothesized to occur while people engage in artificial grammar learning is [[statistical learning]] or, more specifically, [[Bayesian learning]]. Bayesian learning takes into account types of biases or \"prior probability distributions\" individuals have that contribute to the outcome of implicit learning tasks. These biases can be thought of as a probability distribution that contains the probability that each possible hypothesis is likely to be correct. Due to the structure of the [[Bayesian model]], the inferences output by the model are in the form of a probability distribution rather than a single most probable event. This output distribution is a \"posterior probability distribution\". The posterior probability of each hypothesis in the original distribution is the probability of the hypothesis being true given the data and the probability of data given the hypothesis is true.<ref name=\"Kapatsinski, 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Kapatsinski|first=V.|title=The Architecture of Grammar in Artificial Grammar Learning: Formal Biases in the Acquisition of Morphophonology and the Nature of the Learning Task.|journal=Indiana University|year=2009|pages=1\u2013260|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/ef2c4969c167d0581a932fe2fcfd5fff/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y}}</ref>\nThis Bayesian model for learning is fundamental for understanding the pattern detection process involved in implicit learning and, therefore, the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of artificial grammar learning rules. It is hypothesized that the implicit learning of grammar involves predicting co-occurrences of certain words in a certain order. For example,  \"the dog chased the ball\" is a sentence that can be learned as grammatically correct on an implicit level due to the high co-occurrence of \"chase\" being one of the words to follow \"dog\". A sentence like \"the dog cat the ball\" is implicitly recognized as grammatically incorrect due to the lack of utterances that contain those words paired in that specific order. This process is important for teasing apart thematic roles and parts of speech in grammatical processing (see [[grammar]]). While the labeling of the thematic roles and parts of speech is explicit, the identification of words and parts of speech is implicit.\n\n==Explanatory models==\n\nTraditional approaches to AGL claim that the stored knowledge obtained during the learning phase is abstract.<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\" /> Other approaches<ref name=\"Brooks & Vokey, 1991\" /><ref name=\"Vokey & Brooks, 1992\">{{cite journal|last=Vokey|first=J.R.|author2=Brooks, L.R.|title=Salience of item knowledge in learning artificial grammar.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1992|volume=18|issue=2|pages=328\u2013344|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.18.2.328}}</ref> argue that this stored knowledge is concrete and consists of [[wikt:exemplar|exemplars]] of strings encountered during the learning phase or \"chunks\" of these exemplars.<ref name=\"Perruchet & Pacteau, 1990\" /><ref name=\"Servan-Schreiber & Anderson, 1990\">{{cite journal|last=Servan-Schreiber|first=E.|author2=Anderson, J.R.|title=Chunking as a mechanism of implicit learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1990|volume=16|issue=4|pages=592\u2013608|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.16.4.592}}</ref> In any case, it is assumed that the information stored in memory is retrieved in the test phase and is used to aid decisions about letter strings.<ref name=\"Pothos, 2007\">{{cite journal|last=Pothos|first=E.M.|title=Theories of artificial grammar learning|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2007|volume=133|issue=2|pages=227\u2013244|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.227|pmid=17338598|citeseerx=10.1.1.137.1619}}</ref><ref name=\"Poznanski & Tzelgov, 2010\">{{cite journal|last=Poznanski|first=Y.|author2=Tzelgov, J.|title=What is implicit in implicit artificial grammar learning?|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2010|volume=63|issue=8|pages=1495\u20132015|doi=10.1080/17470210903398121|pmid=20063258}}</ref> \n3 main approaches attempt to explain the AGL phenomena:\n \n# ''Abstract Approach'': According to this traditional approach, participants acquire an abstract representation of the artificial grammar rule in the learning stage.

During the testing stage, participants do not sort the new strings according to an abstract rule; instead they will sort them according to their similarity to the examples stored in memory from the learning stage. There are multiple opinions concerning how concrete the learned knowledge really is. Brooks & Vokey<ref name=\"Brooks & Vokey, 1991\" /><ref name=\"Vokey & Brooks, 1992\" />  argue that all of the knowledge stored in memory is represented as concrete examples of the full examples studied during the learning stage. The strings are sorted during the testing stage according to a full representation of the string examples from the learning stage. On the other hand, Perruchet & Pacteau<ref name=\"Perruchet & Pacteau, 1990\" /> claimed that the knowledge of the strings from the learning stage is stored in the form of \"memory chunks\" where 2 - 3 letters are learned as a sequence along with knowledge about their permitted location in the full string.<ref name=\"Perruchet & Pacteau, 1990\" /><ref name=\"Servan-Schreiber & Anderson, 1990\" />\n# ''Dual Factor approach'': Dual process learning model, combines the approaches described above. This approach proposes that a person will rely on concrete knowledge when they can. When they cannot rely on concrete knowledge (for example on a [[transfer of learning]] task), the person will use abstract knowledge of the rules.<ref name=\"Mathews et al., 1989\" /><ref name=\"McAndrews & Moscovitch, 1985\">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=M.P.|author2=Moscovitch, M.|title=Rule-based and exemplar-based classification in artificial grammar learning|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1985|volume=13|issue=5|pages=469\u2013475|doi=10.3758/bf03198460|pmid=4088057}}</ref><ref name=\"Reber, 1989\">{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=A.S.|title=Implicit Learning and Tacit Knowledge|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1989|volume=118|issue=3|pages=219\u2013235|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.118.3.219 |citeseerx=10.1.1.207.6707}}</ref><ref name=\"Reber & Allen, 1978\">{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=A.S.|author2=Allen, R.|title=Analogic abstraction strategies in synthetic grammar learning: A functionalist interpretation|journal=Cognition|year=1978|volume=6|issue=3|pages=189\u2013221|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(78)90013-6 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48e0d495b1666e2511238ec3661df4e06cd31e98}}</ref>\n\nResearch with [[amnesia]] patients suggests the \"Dual Factor approach\" may be the most accurate model.<ref name=\"Knowlton & Squire, 1996\">{{cite journal|last=Knowlton|first=B.J.|author2=Squire, L.R.|title=Artificial Grammar Learning Depends on Implicit Acquisition of Both Abstract and Exemplar-Specific Information|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=1|pages=169\u2013181|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.1.169|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b91aeded7d1306e5a19741af7c9ed31107e894fa}}</ref> A series of experiments with amnesiac patients support the idea that AGL involves both abstract concepts and concrete exemplars. Amnesiacs were able to classify stimuli as \"grammatical\" vs. \"randomly constructed\" just as well as participants in the control group. While able to successfully complete the task, amnesiacs were not able to explicitly recall grammatical \"chunks\" of the letter sequence while the control group was able to explicitly recall them. When performing the task with the same grammar rules but a different sequence of letters than those that they were previously tested on, both amnesiacs and the control group were able to complete the task (although performance was better when the task was completed using the same set of letters used for training). The results of the experiment support the dual factor approach to artificial grammar learning in that people use abstract information to learn rules for grammars and use concrete, exemplar-specific memory for chunks. Since the amnesiacs were unable to store specific \"chunks\" in memory, they completed the task using an abstract set of rules. The control group was able to store these specific chunks in memory and (as evidenced by recall) did store these examples in memory for later reference.\n\n==Automaticity debate==\n\nAGL research has been criticized due to the \"automatic question\": Is AGL considered to be an automatic process? During encoding (see [[encoding (memory)]]), performance can be automatic in the sense of occurring without conscious monitoring (without conscious guidance by the performer's intentions). In the case of AGL, it was claimed that implicit learning is an automatic process due to the fact that it is done with no intention of learning a specific grammar rule.<ref name=\"Reber, 1967\" /> This complies with the classic definition of an \"automatic process\" as a fast, unconscious, effortless process that may start unintentionally. When aroused, it continues until it is over without the ability to stop or ignore its consequences.<ref name=\"Hasher & Zacks, 1979\">{{cite journal|last=Hasher|first=L.|author2=Zacks, R.|title=Automatic and effortful processes in memory|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|year=1979|volume=108|issue=3|pages=356\u2013388|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.108.3.356 }}</ref><ref name=\"Schneider, Dumais & Shiffrin, 1984\">{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=W. |author2=Dumais, S.

The process is complex and contains encoding and [[recall (memory)|recall]] or retrieval. Both encoding and retrieval could be interpreted as automatic processes since what was encoded during the learning stage is not necessary for the task intentionally performed during the test stage.<ref name=\"Perlman & Tzelgov, 2006\">{{cite journal|last=Perlman|first=A.|author2=Tzelgov, J.|title=Interaction between encoding and retrieval in the domain of sequence learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2006|volume=32|issue=1|pages=118\u2013130|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.32.1.118 |pmid=16478345}}</ref> Researchers need to differentiate between implicitness as referring to the process of learning or knowledge encoding and also as referring to performance during the test phase or knowledge retrieval. Knowledge encoded during training may include many aspects of the presented stimuli (whole strings, relations among elements, etc.). The contribution of the various components to performance depends on both the specific instruction in the acquisition phase and the requirements of the retrieval task.<ref name=\"Poznanski & Tzelgov, 2010\" /> Therefore, the instructions on every phase are important in order to determine whether or not each stage will require automatic processing. Each phase should be evaluated for automaticity separately.\n\nOne hypothesis that contradicts the automaticity of AGL is the \"mere exposure effect\". The mere exposure effect is increased affect towards a stimulus that is the result of nonreinforced, repeated exposure to the stimulus.<ref name=\"Manza, Zizak & Reber, 1998\">{{cite journal|last=Manza|first=L. |author2=Zizak, D. |author3=Reber, A.S.|title=Artificial grammar learning and the mere exposure effect: Emotional preference tasks and the implicit learning process|journal=In Stadler, M.A. & Frensch, P.A. (Eds.), Handbook of Implicit Learning|year=1998|volume=Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.|pages=201\u2013222}}</ref> Results from over 200 experiments on this effect indicate that there is a positive relationship between mean \"goodness\" rating and frequency of stimulus exposure. Stimuli for these experiments included line drawings, polygons and nonsense words (which are types of stimuli used in AGL research). These experiments exposed participants to each stimulus up to 25 times. Following each exposure participants were asked to rate the degree to which each stimulus suggested \"good\" vs. \"bad\" effect on a 7-point scale. In addition to the main pattern of results, it was also found in several experiments that participants rated higher positive affect for previously exposed items than for novel items. Since [[implicit cognition]] should not reference previous study episodes, the effects on affect ratings should not have been observed if processing of this stimuli is truly implicit. The results of these experiments suggests that different categorization of the strings may occur due to differences in affect associated with the strings and not due to implicitly learned grammar rules.\n\n==Artificial intelligence==\n\nSince the advent of computers and [[artificial intelligence]], computer programs have been adapted that attempt to simulate the implicit learning process observed in the AGL paradigm. The AI programs first adapted to simulate both natural and artificial grammar learning used the following basic structure:\n\n;Given: A set of grammatical sentences from some language.\n\n;Find: A procedure for recognizing and/or generating all grammatical sentences in that language.\n\nAn early model for AI grammar learning is Wolff's SNPR System.<ref name=\"WOLFF1982\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wolff | first1 = J.G. | year = 1982 | title = Language acquisition, data compression and generalization | url = http://www.cognitionresearch.org/papers/ll/lang_comm_1982/wolff_1982.doc | journal = Language & Communication | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 57\u201389 | doi = 10.1016/0271-5309(82)90035-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"MacWhinney, 1987\" /> The program acquires a series of letters with no pauses or punctuation between words and sentences. The program then examines the string in subsets and looks for common sequences of symbols and defines \"chunks\" in terms of these sequences (these chunks are akin to the exemplar-specific chunks described for AGL). As the model acquires these chunks through exposure, the chunks begin to replace the sequences of unbroken letters. When a chunk precedes or follows a common chunk, then the model determines disjunctive classes in terms of the first set.<ref name=\"MacWhinney, 1987\">{{cite book|last=MacWhinney|first=B.|title=Mechanisms of language acquisition|year=1987|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Hillsdale, NJ|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-XJAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781317757405}}</ref> For example, when the model encounters \"the-dog-chased\" and \"the-cat-chased\" it classifies \"dog\" and \"cat\" as being members of the same class since they both precede \"chase\". While the model sorts chunks into classes, it does explicitly define these groups (e.g., noun, verb). Early AI models of grammar learning such as these ignored the importance of negative instances of grammar's effect on grammar acquisition and were also lacking in the ability to connect grammatical rules to [[pragmatics]] and [[semantics]]. Newer models have attempted to factor these details in.\nThe Unified Model<ref name=\"MacWhinney, 2008\">{{cite journal|last=MacWhinney|first=B.|title=A Unified Model|journal=In Robinson, P. & Ellis, N. (Eds.), Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition|year=2008|volume=Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}</ref> attempts to take both of these factors into account. The model breaks down grammar according to \"cues\". Languages mark case roles using five possible cue types: word order, case marking, agreement, intonation and verb-based expectation (see [[grammar]]). The influence that each cue has over a language's grammar is determined by its \"cue strength\" and \"cue validity\". Both of these values are determined using the same formula, except that cue strength is defined through experimental results and cue validity is defined through corpus counts from language databases. The formula for cue strength/validity is as follows:\n\n: Cue strength/cue validity = cue availability * cue reliability\n\nCue availability is the proportion of times that the cue is available over the times that it is needed. Cue reliability is the proportion of times that the cue is correct over the total occurrences of the cue. By incorporating cue reliability along with cue availability, The Unified Model is able to account for the effects of negative instances of grammar since it takes accuracy and not just frequency into account. As a result, this also accounts for the semantic and pragmatic information since cues that do not produce grammar in the appropriate context will have low cue strength and cue validity. While MacWhinney's model<ref name=\"MacWhinney, 2008\" /> also simulates natural grammar learning, it attempts to model the implicit learning processes observed in the AGL paradigm.\n\n==Cognitive neuroscience and the AGL paradigm==\n\nContemporary studies with AGL have attempted to identify which structures are involved in the acquisition of grammar and implicit learning. Agrammatic aphasic patients (see [[Agrammatism]]) were tested with the AGL paradigm. The results show that breakdown of language in agrammatic aphasia is associated with an impairment in artificial grammar learning, indicating damage to domain-general neural mechanisms sub serving both language and sequential learning.<ref name=\"Christiansen et al., 2010\">{{cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=M.H. |author2=Kelly, M.L. |author3=Shillcock, R.C. |author4=Greenfield, K.|title=Impaired artificial grammar learning in agrammatism|journal=Cognition|year=2010|volume=116|issue=3|pages=383\u2013393|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.015 |pmid=20605017|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d822a0d7b20b7cd15c103d213bfa906e6c45cae2 }}</ref>\nDe Vries, Barth, Maiworm, Knecht, Zwitserlood & Fl\u00f6el<ref name=\"De Vries, 2010\">{{cite journal|last=De Vries|first=M.H. |author2=Barth, A.C.R. |author3=Maiworm, S. |author4=Knecht, S. |author5=Zwisterlood, P.  |author6=Floel, A.|title=Electrical stimulation of Broca's area enhances implicit learning of artificial grammar|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2010|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2427\u20132436|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21385|pmid=19925194 |citeseerx=10.1.1.469.3005 }}</ref> found that electrical stimulation of [[Broca's area]] enhances implicit learning of an artificial grammar.

Video games are involving Latin American communities more and more. This page talks about populations of Latin America and Latino gamers: What games they like to play? Do they play on their computers and or cell phones? And what video games affect Latin American populations. Moreover, what about gender and age affects gamers? And what are the differences to white gamers? What does this mean to show the different culture of Latino Americans?\n\n== Population ==\nVideo games draw in a large population in the United States.

It is the conceptual equivalent to HTTP/1.1 name-based [[virtual hosting]], but for HTTPS. The desired hostname is not encrypted in the original SNI extension, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested.\n\n==Background of the problem==\n\nWhen making a TLS connection, the client requests a [[digital certificate]] from the web server. Once the server sends the certificate, the client examines it and compares the name it was trying to connect to with the name(s) included in the certificate. If a match occurs, the connection proceeds as normal. If a match is not found, the user may be warned of the discrepancy and the connection may abort as the mismatch may indicate an attempted [[man-in-the-middle attack]]. However, some applications allow the user to bypass the warning to proceed with the connection, with the user taking on the responsibility of trusting the certificate and, by extension, the connection. \n\nHowever it may be difficult \u2014 or even impossible, due to lack of a full list of all names in advance \u2014 to obtain a single certificate that covers all names a server will be responsible for. A server that is responsible for multiple hostnames is likely to need to present a different certificate for each name (or small group of names). Since 2005, CAcert has run experiments on different methods of using TLS on virtual servers.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/VhostTaskForce |title=CAcert VHostTaskForce |work=CAcert Wiki |access-date=27 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822082355/http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/VhostTaskForce |archive-date=22 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Most of the experiments are unsatisfactory and impractical.  For example, it is possible to use ''subjectAltName'' to contain multiple domains controlled by one person<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/3908/what-is-a-multiple-domain-ucc-ssl-certificate?locale=en |title=What is a Multiple Domain (UCC) SSL Certificate? |publisher=[[GoDaddy]] }}</ref> in a single certificate.  Such \"unified communications certificates\" must be reissued every time the list of domains changes.\n\n[[Virtual hosting#Name-based|Name-based virtual hosting]] allows multiple DNS hostnames to be hosted by a single server (usually a web server) on the same IP address. To achieve this, the server uses a hostname presented by the client as part of the protocol (for HTTP the name is presented in the [[list of HTTP header fields#Requests|host header]]). However, when using HTTPS, the TLS handshake happens before the server sees any HTTP headers. Therefore, it is not possible for the server to use the information in the HTTP host header to decide which certificate to present and as such only names covered by the same certificate can be served from the same IP address.\n\nIn practice, this means that an HTTPS server can only serve one domain (or small group of domains) per IP address for secured and efficient browsing. Assigning a separate IP address for each site increases the cost of hosting, since requests for IP addresses must be justified to the [[regional Internet registry]] and [[IPv4 address exhaustion|IPv4 addresses are now exhausted]]. The result is that many websites are effectively constrained from using secure communications over IPv4. [[IPv6]] address space is not exhausted, so websites served using IPv6 are unaffected by this issue.\n\n== How SNI fixes the problem ==\nSNI addresses this issue by having the client send the name of the virtual domain as part of the TLS negotiation's '''ClientHello''' message.<ref name=\"Paul's Journal\">{{cite web\n | url = http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2005/04/24/tls-server-name-indication/\n | work = Paul's Journal\n | title = TLS Server Name Indication\n}}</ref> This enables the server to select the correct virtual domain early and present the browser with the certificate containing the correct name. Therefore, with clients and servers that implement SNI, a server with a single IP address can serve a group of domain names for which it is impractical to get a common certificate.\n\nSNI was added to the [[IETF]]'s [[Request for Comments|Internet RFCs]] in June 2003 through RFC 3546, ''Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions''. The latest version of the standard is RFC 6066.\n\n== Security implications (ESNI) ==\n\nThe desired hostname is not encrypted, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested.

The arena replaced the old [[Winston-Salem Memorial Coliseum]], which was torn down for the LJVM Coliseum's construction.\n\nBanners hang in the rafters commemorating past players' retired numbers (including [[Chris Paul]], [[Tim Duncan]], and [[Randolph Childress]]) and the late [[Skip Prosser]]. There are also banners recognizing the Demon Deacons' past NCAA and ACC successes. The arena is home to the Screamin' Demon student section.

He has wrestled in the [[American Wrestling Association]], the [[Jim Crockett Promotions|National Wrestling Alliance]], [[National Wrestling Federation]], [[Pro Wrestling USA]] and the [[World Wrestling Council]]. It was reported on several wrestling websites that Winters died due to a heart attack January 27, 2015.\n\nWinters was also one of the top stars of Joel Goodhart's Tri-State Wrestling Alliance. He and his tag team partner [[Johnny Hotbody]], as the '''Dog Pound''', were the first TWA Tag Team Champions. However, it was his feud with [[D.C. Drake]] that brought him national attention in the wrestling world. One of the earliest displays of modern \"[[hardcore wrestling]]\", [[Bill Apter]] wrote \"professional wrestling would be forever changed due to this escalated level of violence\" after watching their first match in 1990.\n\nHe was one of many former TWA wrestlers later brought into [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]] by [[Tod Gordon]]. Teaming with one-time rival [[Tony Stetson]], the two feuded with [[The Super Destroyers]] ([[Doug Stahl]] & [[A.J. Petrucci]]) and The Suicide Blondes ([[Chris Candido]], [[Johnny Weiss|Johnny Hotbody]] and [[Chris Michaels]]) over the [[ECW Tag Team Championship]] before turning on each other. Winters is also credited for training several future ECW stars including Don E. Allen, [[Glen Osbourne]] and [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early life and career (1982-1990)===\nA native of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Larry Winters made his professional debut in 1982. That year, he traveled to the [[Midwestern United States]] to appear for Ohio Championship Wrestling's debut show in [[Maple Heights, Ohio|Maple Heights]] on November 6, 1982. A three-day weekend supercard, others who appeared on the card included Luis Martinez, J.W. Hawk, J.R.

He has wrestled in the [[American Wrestling Association]], the [[Jim Crockett Promotions|National Wrestling Alliance]], [[National Wrestling Federation]], [[Pro Wrestling USA]] and the [[World Wrestling Council]]. It was reported on several wrestling websites that Winters died due to a heart attack January 27, 2015.\n\nWinters was also one of the top stars of Joel Goodhart's Tri-State Wrestling Alliance. He and his tag team partner [[Johnny Hotbody]], as the '''Dog Pound''', were the first TWA Tag Team Champions. However, it was his feud with [[D.C. Drake]] that brought him national attention in the wrestling world. One of the earliest displays of modern \"[[hardcore wrestling]]\", [[Bill Apter]] wrote \"professional wrestling would be forever changed due to this escalated level of violence\" after watching their first match in 1990.\n\nHe was one of many former TWA wrestlers later brought into [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]] by [[Tod Gordon]]. Teaming with one-time rival [[Tony Stetson]], the two feuded with [[The Super Destroyers]] ([[Doug Stahl]] & [[A.J. Petrucci]]) and The Suicide Blondes ([[Chris Candido]], [[Johnny Weiss|Johnny Hotbody]] and [[Chris Michaels]]) over the [[ECW Tag Team Championship]] before turning on each other. Winters is also credited for training several future ECW stars including Don E. Allen, [[Glen Osbourne]] and [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early life and career (1982-1990)===\nA native of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Larry Winters made his professional debut in 1982.

He began his coaching career as a high school rugby coach at [[Parktown Boys' High School]]'s First XV before returning to his old school as a teacher and as coach of the school's First XV. White's success with the school team resulted in him being appointed as provincial schools coach. He coached various under-19 and under-21 sides before assisting Springbok squad preparations by doing video analysis for them. From 1997 to 1999 he was a technical advisor to Nick Mallet, being part of the 17 Test winning record by the Springboks. In 1999 he was the assistant coach to the  U-21 Springboks, coached by Eric Sauls and captained by John Smit. While assistant coach of the U-21 they won the SANZAR tournament in Argentina, beating England, Ireland, Wales, Australia, France en route to the finals and then beat New Zealand in the final. From 2000-2001 he was an assistant to Harry Viljoen at the Springboks. By this time he was well known for his technical prowess in rugby circles, and he lived up to his reputation by coaching the under-21 Springbok side to a victory in the U-21 Rugby Union World Cup in 2002.\n\n==Springbok coach==\n{{tone|date=October 2015}}\nWhite was appointed as head coach of the national team in early 2004 following South Africa's poor performance at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]] and the [[Kamp Staaldraad]] scandal. His first move was to install [[John Smit]] as captain, which drew a substantial amount of criticism,<ref>{{cite web |title=Smit a true warrior |url=https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/RugbyWorldCup2011/Smit-a-true-warrior-20110824 |website=Sport24 |publisher=SAPA |accessdate=31 January 2020 |date=24 August 2011}}</ref> despite the success they achieved leading the Springboks.\n\n===2004===\nWhite started his Springbok coaching career with a 2\u20130 series win over Ireland, followed by wins over Wales and a combined [[Pacific Islanders rugby union team|Pacific Islanders]] team in the [[2004 June rugby union tests]]. He then proceeded to coach South Africa to their first Tri-Nations trophy since 1998. Soon after the [[Tri Nations Series#2004 Series|2004 Tri Nations]] victory, White's contract was extended to after the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nIn the [[2004 end-of-year rugby union internationals|November Internationals]], South Africa attempted a [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]], beating Wales and Scotland, but losing to Ireland and England. They concluded the Tour with a win over Argentina in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe Springbok resurgence was recognised with a sweep of the major [[World Rugby Awards#200|International Rugby Board Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Rugby Awards Past Winners |url=https://www.world.rugby/awards/past-winners?lang=en |website=World Rugby |accessdate=31 January 2020 |date=9 November 2014}}</ref> The Boks were named ''Team of the Year'', White ''Coach of the Year'', and flanker [[Schalk Burger]] ''Player of the Year''.\n\n===2005===\nIn the [[2005 Tri Nations Series]], the Springboks and All Blacks each won 3 tests, but New Zealand won the Championship on bonus points.\n\n===2006===\nThe 2006 season got off to a strong start with a 36\u201316 win over a confident Scotland contingent; fresh off the back of beating both France and England and finishing third in the Six Nations of that year. This optimism was soon replaced by intense apprehension and frustration over the following months as the Boks narrowly beat the same Scotland side the following week as Springbok kingpin Schalk Burger suffered a career-threatening neck injury in the very same game. A disappointing loss to France in Cape Town left the side bereft of confidence ahead of a Tri-Nations opener against Australia. A member of the conditioning team stated that the Boks no longer felt they were in a comfort zone going into the Tri-Nations.\n\nPerhaps the lowest point in Springbok history, alongside the 2002 drubbing at the hands of England; the Springboks were dealt a record defeat to Australia by 49 points to nil. The matched was marred by very inaccurate play, punctuated by flyhalf Jaco Van Der Westhyzen's purported 'drop kick' just outside his 22 after fumbling the ball. Larkham led his charges magnificently in exposing the Springboks defensive frailties and shattering any chance of a Bok revival.\n\nA week later and the Boks put up a much stronger showing against New Zealand. Though the Boks frustrating ill-discipline allowed for the All Blacks to tally a total of seven penalties to pull away comfortably. Pressure was beginning to mount at this point, and so too injuries. The Boks gave New Zealand a real working over at the breakdown and dominated the All Black line-out throughout; but the aforementioned ill-discipline and the sublime Dan Carter were too much to contain in the end. Bakkies Botha injured his calf on the eve of this test requiring surgery and joined stalwart Schalk Burger as a long-term injury.\n\nJake rallied his troops in the Springbok's final match of their away tour in the newly expanded Tri-Nations. The Springboks looked set to seal their first win of the competition until a late try by Mat Rogers allowed for Mortlock to score the winning conversion and compound Bok woes. The loss splintered morale and soon political turmoil would engulf the team as Jake White's tenure was put into question. Supposed secret meetings in England and the issue of transformation put considerable strain on the team as a meeting with the powerful All Blacks loomed later in August. Numerous journalists in South Africa with strong ties to Cheeky Watson campaigned viciously for the removal of Jake. This a knee-jerk reaction to Jake's refusal to play Luke Watson and name him captain of the side.\n\nWith the Boks now on home soil they had time to reflect on their failings and regroup. Despite this brief reprieve the beleaguered Boks seemed to undo their good work in the previous two tests in exhibiting yet another poor defensive display that harkened back to the 49\u20130 loss in their opening game. A burst of three tries inside ten minutes allowed New Zealand to dominate the game and confirm their status as the preeminent force in world rugby. A strong fightback by the Boks was not enough as they were held at arm's length and masterfully picked off.\n\nBacks firmly planted to the wall the Springboks were determined to end their campaign strongly and salvage some measure of respectability. Jake seemed to find the right balance in the back row and the Boks stubbornly defeated New Zealand in a disciplined and accurate display at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium. The Boks rolled up to Ellis Park the following week to right the wrongs of their heartbreaking loss to Australia in their final away match; they provided another very strong showing with yet another disciplined and accurate display. The standout feature of this match was the manner in which Solly Tyibilika outplayed his more fancied opposite George Smith \u2013 regarded by many as the greatest fetcher of his era.\n\nWith back-to-back wins over their Tri-Nations rivals Jake White decided to rest the remainder of his front line players for the [[2006 South Africa rugby union tour of Ireland and England|up-coming End of Year Tour]]. They started their campaign against Ireland in celebration of 100 years of Bok rugby. The Irish however had other ideas and put away three tries that exposed the poor defence of Pierre Spies in particular and Bryan Habana out of position at 13. Spies was twice caught charging out of the line and the Irish swiftly punished that opening each time. The Springboks, fielding a largely experimental side, fought hard as Habana and debutant Francois Steyn dotted down in the second half. That comeback was roundly ended by Horgan after O'Driscoll expertly put him away to seal the game.\n\nNext up was a two test encounter against England at fortress Twickenham. The Springboks had not beaten England since the Spring Tour of 2000 where the Boks won 18\u201313. England exacted revenge a week later and had built a period of dominance spanning six years. Even more disconcerting was that the Boks had not won at Twickenham since 1997; this leaving the Boks with a nine-year hoodoo to break. The Boks dominated England for much of the first test and seemed certain of victory until a late try by Phil Vickery gave England the result. A key turning point in the game was the injury to Butch James. His replacement, Andr\u00e9 Pretorius failed to deliver the steadiness Butch provided and missed an important penalty. However, the Boks gained confidence from this display and relished their second chance to redeem themselves.\n\nUnlike the first test, England got off to a strong start with stinging attacks that left the Boks defending for most of the first 30 minutes. In fact, it wasn't until the 26th minute that the Boks launched their first serious attack started by nuggety scrumhalf Ricky Januarie. England finally scored on the half-hour mark, but a missed conversion signalled the end of their dominance. The Boks got to work dominating the English with bruising defence, probing tactical kicks and set piece superiority. Burly prop CJ Van Der Linde punctating the Bok's dominance in brushing aside two defenders as he burst his way through England's defensive line and dotting down for a crucial score. Andr\u00e9 Pretorius nailed three drop-goals which left the English on the ropes. As England became more desperate and lost for invention, the game slipped further away from them. The curse of the Red Rose was final lifted in arguably the most important victory of the 2006 campaign. The result unfortunately ended the tenure of Andy Robinson as England dubiously replaced him with Brian Ashton. Jake White however just managed to stave off his critics and end what was an emotionally exhausting season.\n\nThe final analysis was that this was a year of growth as much as it was a disappointing lost opportunity. Injuries to Schalk Burger (broken neck), Bakkies Botha (calf surgery), Jean De Villiers (cracked rib), Bryan Habana (cracked rib), Butch James (groin and knee), Andr\u00e9 Pretorius (groin), Joe Van Niekerk (C5 & C6 vertebrae), Jacques Cronje (cracked rib), Danie Rossouw (hamstring), Juan Smith (left quadriceps), Eddie Andrews (back), BJ Botha (back surgery), CJ Van Der Linde (Leg), Gurthro Steenkamp (broken hand), Pedrie Wannenburg (wrist surgery), Marius Joubert (fractured hand) among other lesser injuries stretched the Bok's depth to its limit. The blessing was that it allowed the Boks to break their reliance on certain individuals and expand their depth in blooding new players and testing new combinations. Francois Steyn was undoubtedly the find of the season alongside the elusive Ruan Pienaar. Jake also found depth in Wynand Olivier and Pierre Spies; the former being used extensively in plugging gaps left by injuries in the backline. Jake lamented the many lost opportunities of this campaign but was optimistic about the various changes they made to their defensive patterns and saw it as an important learning cuve ahead of the World Cup the following year.\n\n===2007: World Champions and \"Resignation\"===\n[[File:Man of the moment Jake White.jpg|thumb|Jake White with the [[William Webb Ellis Cup]] (2007)]]\nThe Springboks could not have started their campaign any better as they utterly demolished England in back-to-back tests. Again, this being very important in the context of their World Cup campaign, as they faced the World Champions in the same group. England must however be credited for their resolve in the second test where a Jonny Wilkinson led side actually led the game at half-time. South Africa were guilty of sloppy play in the opening 40 minutes which was met by stern midfield defence by the English. A powerful scrum aided England in securing a measure of dominance. Fresh from the break however South Africa stepped up and rampantly tore into their guests. This culminated in two 50 pointers in as many weeks. The fans suddenly began to believe in their side again. Then came more political meddlings to sour the mood. Oregan Hoskins \u2013 President of SARU \u2013 proceeded to override Jake White in the selection of Luke Watson as an addition to the 45-man squad submitted by Jake to the South African Rugby Union. Luke Watson went on to represent South Africa in ten tests, his first and solitary test of this particular year being in the following Samoan test at Ellis Park. In a game that was well suited to the fetcher Watson did very little to justify his position in the team. His performance was disjointed and substandard. This prompted Jake to reject him authoritatively \u2013 something Jake's successor, Peter de Villiers would do the following year after similarly poor performances. The Springboks won this test convincingly on the scoreboard but Samoa were not to be beaten without a fight in a typical arm-wrestle of a test.\n\nWith the Spring Tour successfully negotiated the Boks embarked on their Tri-Nations opener. They began their campaign at home against Australia in a powerful display. They attacked the fringes with strong carries by their big ball carriers and tied up the Australians before attacking wide. Guilty of missing several opportunities they did however leave victory late as the audacious Francois Steyn blasted over two monstrous drop-goals to seal the result. This set up a tense encounter with arch-rivals New Zealand. The Boks were on course to seal the result before Graham Henry unloaded his bench. His fresh reserves gave New Zealand a much stronger finish which resulted in a match winning try by New Zealand flyer Joe Rokocoko.\n\nFollowing this test Jake announced that he would be resting his key players for the remainder of the competition. This was met with staunch criticism from their SANZAR partners which went so far as John O'Neill \u2013 Head of the Australian Rugby Union \u2013 castigated South Africa for not fielding full strength sides on their away leg. O'Neill also said the Springboks had cost Australian Rugby at least 10,000 paying customers at the test in Sydney because of their decision to leave 20 of their best players in South Africa. O'Neill was incensed by comments by Springboks coach Jake White, who said the injury to stand-in Springboks captain Bobby Skinstad justified his decision to rest leading players such as Victor Matfield, Schalk Burger and Bryan Habana. \"Now you know why I didn't bring those other guys here,\" White said. \"I could be sitting here with my front-line players out for six months.\" O'Neill retorted: \"Some of the stuff Jake White has said are the most extraordinary of contradictions. He is basically saying that because Bobby Skinstad has a broken rib, that supports his decision to leave all the players behind. He is basically saying that his only objective this year is the World Cup. He has made it clear that whatever he has to do in between \u2013 so be it.\n\nThat said, the makeshift Springbok side made a mockery of their critics as they led a full strength Australian side 17\u20130 after 40 minutes. Wickus Van Heerden powering over and Breyton Paulse latching onto a wide pass by Nathan Sharpe. Hougaard missed two kickable penalties however. This was Stephen Larkham and George Gregan's final game in Australia; an emotional occasion. Thus they were not to be beaten without a fight. Australia had an attacking line-out inside South Africa's 22, they employed a deceptive play which appeared to be a forward drive with Gregan standing afar but was instead a rouse which had Larkham cut the Boks and send Mark Gerrard over for their opening points. From here the Australians showed just how dangerous their back division could be and scored two further tries to escape an embarrassing defeat and send off their legendary heroes with a victory. The Boks went into the final game of the tournament seemingly without a hope of winning. The All Blacks were deemed far too powerful for this makeshift team. That said they decided to take the fight to their hosts front the first second as JP Pietersen fielded a kick-off and ran right through several would-be tacklers. They played with greater endeavour than what was to be expected. The half-time interval saw New Zealand on fractionally ahead 6\u20133. New Zealand would not see their first try until eleven minutes from time when Rokocoko's flick pass found Leonard. This broke the Boks and two further tries were scored to add gloss to the final score, Carter dotting down after the hooter had sounded. It was noted that the Boks rush defence frustrated the All Blacks and prevented them from executing wider attacking plays. Breyton Paulse in particular was adept at cutting off their outside backs and limiting the All Blacks. Had Hougaard not missed two vital kicks the result may not have been so comfortable.\n\nThe Boks unfortunately ended bottom of the table, but had displayed great strength in depth and resolve. Later Eddie Jones would join the Bok camp in a consultancy capacity. He revealed that he worked on the linkage between 9 and 10 and the motion of the ball. It added a little more variety to the Boks in what was an otherwise powerful Springbok side with great skills and considerable fitness. The latter being a part of Jake's plan for the World Cup which was timed perfectly.\n\nThe Boks went into the World Cup off the back of two strong wins against Namibia and Scotland. Scotland providing very stern opposition. Captain John Smit remarked that the opening game against Samoa was the most physical he had ever played. The Samoans were full of running and put considerable strain on the Bok's defensive line. They scored the first try through Gavin Williams to bring the score to 9\u20137. It was an intense arm-wrestle throughout the first half in spite of Montgomery and Habana's tries which gave South Africa a 21\u20137 half-time lead. The second half started in much the same manner it ended; with Samoa lashing into the Boks. Jean De Villiers was taken off with a torn bicep and replaced by Frans Steyn. Frans impact was immense and his first touch of the ball was the break out of his own 22 and send JP Pietersen down the touchline in a breathtaking attack. His physicality in defence of his channel and elusive power on attack seemed to lift the Springboks. He provided the assured authority that Jean was never able to provide. This combined with the Boks superior set-pieces set the tone for a ruthless demolition of Samoa. The game ended with eight tries to the Boks, a cruel end to what was a heroic showing by the Samoans. The result drew the attention of rest of the teams in the competition and it was clear the Boks had rolled up with intent. Bryan Habana's quartet of tries reflective of the Bok's willingness to attack with efficient ruthlessness.\n\nTheir next encounter was a crucial clash with World Champions England. England, now on a three-game losing streak to the Boks, were on the ropes after a scrappy and poor showing against the USA. It took no longer than four minutes before Du Preez sent Juan Smith over for a try. The Boks dominated their opposition, displaying a tactically astute game plan. Du Preez was the mastermind and he orchestrated South Africa's next try as he regathered a loose ball and tore through England's defence; he sent JP Pietersen over for his first try of the evening and later in the second half broke away on the blindside to put JP Pietersen away for his second. This victory set the tone for South Africa's triumph. They employed a strong tactical kicking game backed-up by stout defence and the best line-out in the world. With a clinical counter-attacking game the Boks were able to vary their approach and ended the year the number one ranked team in the world.\nThe Springboks' final pool match was against the US in Montpellier. They ran in nine tries to two to win 64\u201315 and finish on top of Pool A. The only downside was a knee injury to prop [[B. J. Botha]], which would rule him out for the rest of the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/australia/rugby/story/72128.html|date=1 October 2007|publisher=ESPN Scrum|title=Springboks hit by Botha blow}}</ref> White was pleased with his team's efforts:\n<blockquote>What we wanted to accomplish was to get some structure and continuity to our game. Some of the tries we scored were very pleasing. I don't think the US are as weak as the scoreline suggests. The most important thing was that we put things together on a game day. We haven't been executing them that well so far, but I was happy with the way we kept the ball alive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/72115.html|date=1 October 2007|title=Springboks maintain momentum|publisher=ESPN Scrum}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFurther accolades were to follow; the day after the World Cup final victory, White was named IRB Coach of the Year for the second time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/history/awards/newsid=2020608.html#habana+named+irb+player+year|title=Habana named IRB Player of the Year|publisher=IRB.com|date=21 October 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023042904/http://www.irb.com/history/awards/newsid%3D2020608.html#habana+named+irb+player+year|archivedate=23 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nOn 29 October, barely a week after the Springboks' World Cup success, the South African Rugby Union (SARU) confirmed that White had not re-applied for the position of Springboks coach and would therefore not be considered for the role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/72771.html|publisher=ESPN Scrum|title=White opts out of Springboks running|date=29 October 2007}}</ref> Although White's contract expired on 31 December, he was angry with the way the SARU had acted, stating that his contract did not require him to apply and that he had asked for time to consider his options, but had not been granted his request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/7068128.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=White confirms South Africa exit|date=31 October 2007}}</ref>\nShortly after finishing as Springbok coach, White released his autobiography, ''In Black and White, The Jake White Story''.

But the Bulls were determined to keep their unblemished finals record at home intact, and worked their way back into the game to lead 23\u201319 with 14 minutes to go. Then Bulls captain [[Dewald Potgieter]] turned down three opportunities to score penalty goals, instead opting each time to go for a try, presumably to put the game beyond the Brumbies' reach. In the 78th minute, the Brumbies seized their chance when fly-half [[Matt Toomua]] made an incisive break and passed to [[Tevita Kuridrani]] who touched down to help give the Brumbies a 26\u201323 lead. There was still time for one last kick-off, but the Bulls lost possession, enabling the Brumbies to kick the ball into touch and celebrate a victory which White described as \"the greatest the Brumbies have ever had\".<ref name=\"bullslose\"/> The Brumbies then had to travel to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] where they would have to face the [[Chiefs (rugby union)|Chiefs]] in the [[2013 Super Rugby Final]]. The Brumbies had led the match 9\u20130 with 20 minutes gone, however a burst of penalties saw the Chiefs even the score by the 31st minute. A try late on in the first half by [[Christian Lealiifano]] saw the Brumbies lead 16\u20139 at half time. Early on in the second half, Lealiifano booted a further two penalties to reach their final score of 22, with Lealiifano having scored all the points. But two tries conceded at the 63rd and 67th minute by [[Liam Messam]] and [[Robbie Robinson (rugby player)|Robbie Robinson]] saw the home side lead 24\u201322 with 10 minutes to go. Despite a strong attack by the Brumbies, the Chiefs defence remained strong and the match finished 27\u201322.\n\nIn 2013 Brumbies beat [[British and Irish Lions]] 14-12 during [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|their Australian tour]], which was the first Lions loss to a non-international side since 2005, when they lost to [[M\u0101ori All Blacks]], though they had a draw with [[Emerging Springboks]] in 2009.\n\nAfter a successful stint with the Brumbies, White was believed to be a strong contender for the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] head coaching role when [[Robbie Deans]] resigned. However, he beaten to the role by fellow Super Rugby coach [[Ewen McKenzie]].

On 15 February, the Sharks started their [[2014 Super Rugby season|2014 Super Rugby campaign]] in the best way possible with a bonus-point 31\u201316 victory against arch-rivals the [[Bulls (rugby union)|Bulls]] in Durban.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/rugby-union/jake-whites-sharks-launch-super-rugby-title-bid-with-win-over-bulls/story-e6frg7o6-1226828492674|publisher=The Australian|title=Jake White's Sharks launch Super Rugby title bid with win over Bulls|date=16 February 2014}}</ref><br>\nBut the Sharks' first major hurdle of the season came during the re-match against the Bulls in Pretoria on 22 March. Up to that stage, the Sharks had been undefeated. In addition to losing the match 23\u201319, their starting halves combination was injured early. Pat Lambie was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn bicep tendon, and [[Cobus Reinach]] fractured his hand, which would cause him to miss eight weeks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/sharks-blow-as-pat-lambie-ruled-out-for-season-20140325-hvmfb.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|title=Sharks blow as Pat Lambie ruled out for season|date=25 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhite went on to coach the Sharks to top of the South African conference, finishing third overall in the table. They had to host the [[Highlanders (rugby union)|Highlanders]] in the quarter-finals, where for much of the match, the home side led, finishing 31\u201327. Unfortunately for the Sharks, they had to travel to [[Christchurch]] to face the [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] who were favourite to win the competition. The Sharks lost the match 38\u20136, conceding 5 tries, 4 of which came in the second half. The result came as a massive surprise for some, since the Sharks had the best defence in the competition in the normal season.\n\nLike with the Brumbies, two months after leading the Sharks to that Semi-final, White resigned as Director of Rugby, to pursue an international role ahead of the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]].<ref name=\"White steps down\">{{cite press release | url=http://www.sharksrugby.co.za/index.php/component/articles/?view=article&id=2655644 | title=White steps down | publisher=Sharks | date=29 September 2014 | accessdate=29 September 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101307/http://sharksrugby.co.za/index.php/component/articles/?view=article&id=2655644 | archivedate=29 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Tonga===\nOn 13 October 2014, White joined [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]] as a member of the backroom staff, and acted as a technical advisor for head coach [[Mana Otai]] for the Test Tour of Europe.<ref>http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-news/tonga-add-jake-white-coaching-staff-6105248</ref><ref>http://www.espnscrum.com/other/rugby/story/244109.html</ref><ref>http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/Jake-White-gets-role-with-Tonga-20141013</ref> White and Otai led Tonga to 2 from 3 wins during their [[2014 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2014 European Tour]]. The tour began with a 23\u20139 victory over [[Georgia national rugby union team|Georgia]], which included a late surge off tries during the closing quarter to secure the win. The following week, Tonga kept their 100% win rate intact against the [[United States national rugby union team|United States]], winning 40\u201312 in [[Gloucester]]. The 'Ikale Tahi were praised heavily{{By whom|date=February 2016}} for their defensive abilities in their opening two matches of their tour, keeping Georgia tryless completely and the United States tryless in the second half. But Tonga were also praised for their new attacking flair, and with hand in ball, with some people{{Who|date=February 2016}} expecting a first-ever clean sweep on European tour heading into the final match against Scotland. Jake White had believed to be the main inputter into this new structure. Despite the first half being a close 14\u201312 at half time, Scotland ran away with the match in the second half, scoring a further 3 tries to win 37\u201312.\n\nMana Otai had hoped to keep White on board for the World Cup, and until December 2014, there had still been no official announcement on White's future with Tonga.\n\n===Montpellier===\nOn 30 December, Jake White was announced as the new boss for French club [[Montpellier H\u00e9rault Rugby|Montpellier]], where he would oversee all coaching aspects for the club.<ref>[http://www.planetrugby.co.uk/story/0,25883,3551_9625452,00.html Montpellier unveil White as new boss]</ref> This came after a poor run of results in both the [[2014\u201315 Top 14 season]] and the [[2014\u201315 European Rugby Champions Cup]].

He began his coaching career as a high school rugby coach at [[Parktown Boys' High School]]'s First XV before returning to his old school as a teacher and as coach of the school's First XV. White's success with the school team resulted in him being appointed as provincial schools coach. He coached various under-19 and under-21 sides before assisting Springbok squad preparations by doing video analysis for them. From 1997 to 1999 he was a technical advisor to Nick Mallet, being part of the 17 Test winning record by the Springboks. In 1999 he was the assistant coach to the  U-21 Springboks, coached by Eric Sauls and captained by John Smit. While assistant coach of the U-21 they won the SANZAR tournament in Argentina, beating England, Ireland, Wales, Australia, France en route to the finals and then beat New Zealand in the final. From 2000-2001 he was an assistant to Harry Viljoen at the Springboks. By this time he was well known for his technical prowess in rugby circles, and he lived up to his reputation by coaching the under-21 Springbok side to a victory in the U-21 Rugby Union World Cup in 2002.\n\n==Springbok coach==\n{{tone|date=October 2015}}\nWhite was appointed as head coach of the national team in early 2004 follwing South Africa's poor performance at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]] and the [[Kamp Staaldraad]] scandal. His first move was to install [[John Smit]] as captain, which drew a substantial amount of criticism<ref>{{cite web |title=Smit a true warrior |url=https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/RugbyWorldCup2011/Smit-a-true-warrior-20110824 |website=Sport24 |publisher=SAPA |accessdate=31 January 2020 |date=24 August 2011}}</ref>, despite the success they achieved leading the Springboks.\n\n===2004===\nWhite started his Springbok coaching career with a 2-0 series win over Ireland, followed by wins over Wales and a combined [[Pacific Islanders rugby union team|Pacific Islanders]] team in the [[2004 June rugby union tests]]. He then proceeded to coach South Africa to their first Tri-Nations trophy since 1998. Soon after the [[Tri Nations Series#2004 Series|2004 Tri Nations]] victory, White's contract was extended to after the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nIn the [[2004_end-of-year_rugby_union_internationals|November Internationals]], South Africa attempted a [[Grand_Slam_(rugby_union)|Grand Slam]], beating Wales and Scotland, but losing to Ireland and England. They concluded the Tour with a win over Argentina in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe Springbok resurgence was recognised with a sweep of the major [[World_Rugby_Awards#200|International Rugby Board Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Rugby Awards Past Winners |url=https://www.world.rugby/awards/past-winners?lang=en |website=World Rugby |accessdate=31 January 2020 |date=9 November 2014}}</ref> The Boks were named ''Team of the Year'', White ''Coach of the Year'', and flanker [[Schalk Burger]] ''Player of the Year''.\n\n===2005===\nIn the [[2005 Tri Nations Series]], the Springboks and All Blacks each won 3 tests, but New Zealand won the Championship on bonus points.\n\n===2006===\nThe 2006 season got off to a strong start with a 36\u201316 win over a confident Scotland contingent; fresh off the back of beating both France and England and finishing third in the Six Nations of that year. This optimism was soon replaced by intense apprehension and frustration over the following months as the Boks narrowly beat the same Scotland side the following week as Springbok kingpin Schalk Burger suffered a career-threatening neck injury in the very same game. A disappointing loss to France in Cape Town left the side bereft of confidence ahead of a Tri-Nations opener against Australia. A member of the conditioning team stated that the Boks no longer felt they were in a comfort zone going into the Tri-Nations.\n\nPerhaps the lowest point in Springbok history, alongside the 2002 drubbing at the hands of England; the Springboks were dealt a record defeat to Australia by 49 points to nil. The matched was marred by very inaccurate play, punctuated by flyhalf Jaco Van Der Westhyzen's purported 'drop kick' just outside his 22 after fumbling the ball. Larkham led his charges magnificently in exposing the Springboks defensive frailties and shattering any chance of a Bok revival.\n\nA week later and the Boks put up a much stronger showing against New Zealand. Though the Boks frustrating ill-discipline allowed for the All Blacks to tally a total of seven penalties to pull away comfortably. Pressure was beginning to mount at this point, and so too injuries. The Boks gave New Zealand a real working over at the breakdown and dominated the All Black line-out throughout; but the aforementioned ill-discipline and the sublime Dan Carter were too much to contain in the end. Bakkies Botha injured his calf on the eve of this test requiring surgery and joined stalwart Schalk Burger as a long term injury.\n\nJake rallied his troops in the Springbok's final match of their away tour in the newly expanded Tri-Nations. The Springboks looked set to seal their first win of the competition until a late try by Mat Rogers allowed for Mortlock to score the winning conversion and compound Bok woes. The loss splintered morale and soon political turmoil would engulf the team as Jake White's tenure was put into question. Supposed secret meetings in England and the issue of transformation put considerable strain on the team as a meeting with the powerful All Blacks loomed later in August. Numerous journalists in South Africa with strong ties to Cheeky Watson campaigned viciously for the removal of Jake. This a knee-jerk reaction to Jake's refusal to play Luke Watson and name him captain of the side.\n\nWith the Boks now on home soil they had time to reflect on their failings and regroup. Despite this brief reprieve the beleaguered Boks seemed to undo their good work in the previous two tests in exhibiting yet another poor defensive display that harkened back to the 49\u20130 loss in their opening game. A burst of three tries inside ten minutes allowed New Zealand to dominate the game and confirm their status as the preeminent force in world rugby. A strong fightback by the Boks was not enough as they were held at arm's length and masterfully picked off.\n\nBacks firmly planted to the wall the Springboks were determined to end their campaign strongly and salvage some measure of respectability. Jake seemed to find the right balance in the back row and the Boks stubbornly defeated New Zealand in a disciplined and accurate display at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium. The Boks rolled up to Ellis Park the following week to right the wrongs of their heartbreaking loss to Australia in their final away match; they provided another very strong showing with yet another disciplined and accurate display. The standout feature of this match was the manner in which Solly Tyibilika outplayed his more fancied opposite George Smith \u2013 regarded by many as the greatest fetcher of his era.\n\nWith back-to-back wins over their Tri-Nations rivals Jake White decided to rest the remainder of his front line players for the [[2006 South Africa rugby union tour of Ireland and England|up-coming End of Year Tour]]. They started their campaign against Ireland in celebration of 100 years of Bok rugby. The Irish however had other ideas and put away three tries that exposed the poor defence of Pierre Spies in particular and Bryan Habana out of position at 13. Spies was twice caught charging out of the line and the Irish swiftly punished that opening each time. The Springboks, fielding a largely experimental side, fought hard as Habana and debutant Francois Steyn dotted down in the second half. That comeback was roundly ended by Horgan after O'Driscoll expertly put him away to seal the game.\n\nNext up was a two test encounter against England at fortress Twickenham. The Springboks had not beaten England since the Spring Tour of 2000 where the Boks won 18\u201313. England exacted revenge a week later and had built a period of dominance spanning six years. Even more disconcerting was that the Boks had not won at Twickenham since 1997; this leaving the Boks with a nine-year hoodoo to break. The Boks dominated England for much of the first test and seemed certain of victory until a late try by Phil Vickery gave England the result. A key turning point in the game was the injury to Butch James. His replacement, Andr\u00e9 Pretorius failed to deliver the steadiness Butch provided and missed an important penalty. However, the Boks gained confidence from this display and relished their second chance to redeem themselves.\n\nUnlike the first test, England got off to a strong start with stinging attacks that left the Boks defending for most of the first 30 minutes. In fact, it wasn't until the 26th minute that the Boks launched their first serious attack started by nuggety scrumhalf Ricky Januarie. England finally scored on the half-hour mark, but a missed conversion signalled the end of their dominance. The Boks got to work dominating the English with bruising defence, probing tactical kicks and set piece superiority. Burly prop CJ Van Der Linde punctating the Bok's dominance in brushing aside two defenders as he burst his way through England's defensive line and dotting down for a crucial score. Andr\u00e9 Pretorius nailed three drop-goals which left the English on the ropes. As England became more desperate and lost for invention, the game slipped further away from them. The curse of the Red Rose was final lifted in arguably the most important victory of the 2006 campaign. The result unfortunately ended the tenure of Andy Robinson as England dubiously replaced him with Brian Ashton. Jake White however just managed to stave off his critics and end what was an emotionally exhausting season.\n\nThe final analysis was that this was a year of growth as much as it was a disappointing lost opportunity. Injuries to Schalk Burger (broken neck), Bakkies Botha (calf surgery), Jean De Villiers (cracked rib), Bryan Habana (cracked rib), Butch James (groin and knee), Andr\u00e9 Pretorius (groin), Joe Van Niekerk (C5 & C6 vertebrae), Jacques Cronje (cracked rib), Danie Rossouw (hamstring), Juan Smith (left quadriceps), Eddie Andrews (back), BJ Botha (back surgery), CJ Van Der Linde (Leg), Gurthro Steenkamp (broken hand), Pedrie Wannenburg (wrist surgery), Marius Joubert (fractured hand) among other lesser injuries stretched the Bok's depth to its limit. The blessing was that it allowed the Boks to break their reliance on certain individuals and expand their depth in blooding new players and testing new combinations. Francois Steyn was undoubtedly the find of the season alongside the elusive Ruan Pienaar. Jake also found depth in Wynand Olivier and Pierre Spies; the former being used extensively in plugging gaps left by injuries in the backline. Jake lamented the many lost opportunities of this campaign but was optimistic about the various changes they made to their defensive patterns and saw it as an important learning cuve ahead of the World Cup the following year.\n\n===2007: World Champions and \"Resignation\"===\n[[File:Man of the moment Jake White.jpg|thumb|Jake White with the [[William Webb Ellis Cup]] (2007)]]\nThe Springboks could not have started their campaign any better as they utterly demolished England in back-to-back tests. Again, this being very important in the context of their World Cup campaign, as they faced the World Champions in the same group. England must however be credited for their resolve in the second test where a Jonny Wilkinson led side actually led the game at half-time. South Africa were guilty of sloppy play in the opening 40 minutes which was met by stern midfield defence by the English. A powerful scrum aided England in securing a measure of dominance. Fresh from the break however South Africa stepped up and rampantly tore into their guests. This culminated in two 50 pointers in as many weeks. The fans suddenly began to believe in their side again. Then came more political meddlings to sour the mood. Oregan Hoskins \u2013 President of SARU \u2013 proceeded to override Jake White in the selection of Luke Watson as an addition to the 45-man squad submitted by Jake to the South African Rugby Union. Luke Watson went on to represent South Africa in ten tests, his first and solitary test of this particular year being in the following Samoan test at Ellis Park. In a game that was well suited to the fetcher Watson did very little to justify his position in the team. His performance was disjointed and substandard. This prompted Jake to reject him authoritatively \u2013 something Jake's successor, Peter de Villiers would do the following year after similarly poor performances. The Springboks won this test convincingly on the scoreboard but Samoa were not to be beaten without a fight in a typical arm-wrestle of a test.\n\nWith the Spring Tour successfully negotiated the Boks embarked on their Tri-Nations opener. They began their campaign at home against Australia in a powerful display. They attacked the fringes with strong carries by their big ball carriers and tied up the Australians before attacking wide. Guilty of missing several opportunities they did however leave victory late as the audacious Francois Steyn blasted over two monstrous drop-goals to seal the result. This set up a tense encounter with arch-rivals New Zealand. The Boks were on course to seal the result before Graham Henry unloaded his bench. His fresh reserves gave New Zealand a much stronger finish which resulted in a match winning try by New Zealand flyer Joe Rokocoko.\n\nFollowing this test Jake announced that he would be resting his key players for the remainder of the competition. This was met with staunch criticism from their SANZAR partners which went so far as John O'Neill \u2013 Head of the Australian Rugby Union \u2013 castigated South Africa for not fielding full strength sides on their away leg. O'Neill also said the Springboks had cost Australian Rugby at least 10,000 paying customers at the test in Sydney because of their decision to leave 20 of their best players in South Africa. O'Neill was incensed by comments by Springboks coach Jake White, who said the injury to stand-in Springboks captain Bobby Skinstad justified his decision to rest leading players such as Victor Matfield, Schalk Burger and Bryan Habana. \"Now you know why I didn't bring those other guys here,\" White said. \"I could be sitting here with my front-line players out for six months.\" O'Neill retorted: \"Some of the stuff Jake White has said are the most extraordinary of contradictions. He is basically saying that because Bobby Skinstad has a broken rib, that supports his decision to leave all the players behind. He is basically saying that his only objective this year is the World Cup. He has made it clear that whatever he has to do in between \u2013 so be it.\n\nThat said, the makeshift Springbok side made a mockery of their critics as they led a full strength Australian side 17\u20130 after 40 minutes. Wickus Van Heerden powering over and Breyton Paulse latching onto a wide pass by Nathan Sharpe. Hougaard missed two kickable penalties however. This was Stephen Larkham and George Gregan's final game in Australia; an emotional occasion. Thus they were not to be beaten without a fight. Australia had an attacking line-out inside South Africa's 22, they employed a deceptive play which appeared to be a forward drive with Gregan standing afar but was instead a rouse which had Larkham cut the Boks and send Mark Gerrard over for their opening points. From here the Australians showed just how dangerous their back division could be and scored two further tries to escape an embarrassing defeat and send off their legendary heroes with a victory. The Boks went into the final game of the tournament seemingly without a hope of winning. The All Blacks were deemed far too powerful for this makeshift team. That said they decided to take the fight to their hosts front the first second as JP Pietersen fielded a kick-off and ran right through several would-be tacklers. They played with greater endeavour than what was to be expected. The half-time interval saw New Zealand on fractionally ahead 6\u20133. New Zealand would not see their first try until eleven minutes from time when Rokocoko's flick pass found Leonard. This broke the Boks and two further tries were scored to add gloss to the final score, Carter dotting down after the hooter had sounded. It was noted that the Boks rush defence frustrated the All Blacks and prevented them from executing wider attacking plays. Breyton Paulse in particular was adept at cutting off their outside backs and limiting the All Blacks. Had Hougaard not missed two vital kicks the result may not have been so comfortable.\n\nThe Boks unfortunately ended bottom of the table, but had displayed great strength in depth and resolve. Later Eddie Jones would join the Bok camp in a consultancy capacity. He revealed that he worked on the linkage between 9 and 10 and the motion of the ball. It added a little more variety to the Boks in what was an otherwise powerful Springbok side with great skills and considerable fitness. The latter being a part of Jake's plan for the World Cup which was timed perfectly.\n\nThe Boks went into the World Cup off the back of two strong wins against Namibia and Scotland. Scotland providing very stern opposition. Captain John Smit remarked that the opening game against Samoa was the most physical he had ever played. The Samoans were full of running and put considerable strain on the Bok's defensive line. They scored the first try through Gavin Williams to bring the score to 9\u20137. It was an intense arm-wrestle throughout the first half in spite of Montgomery and Habana's tries which gave South Africa a 21\u20137 half-time lead. The second half started in much the same manner it ended; with Samoa lashing into the Boks. Jean De Villiers was taken off with a torn bicep and replaced by Frans Steyn. Frans impact was immense and his first touch of the ball was the break out of his own 22 and send JP Pietersen down the touchline in a breathtaking attack. His physicality in defence of his channel and elusive power on attack seemed to lift the Springboks. He provided the assured authority that Jean was never able to provide. This combined with the Boks superior set-pieces set the tone for a ruthless demolition of Samoa. The game ended with eight tries to the Boks, a cruel end to what was a heroic showing by the Samoans. The result drew the attention of rest of the teams in the competition and it was clear the Boks had rolled up with intent. Bryan Habana's quartet of tries reflective of the Bok's willingness to attack with efficient ruthlessness.\n\nTheir next encounter was a crucial clash with World Champions England. England, now on a three-game losing streak to the Boks, were on the ropes after a scrappy and poor showing against the USA. It took no longer than four minutes before Du Preez sent Juan Smith over for a try. The Boks dominated their opposition, displaying a tactically astute game plan. Du Preez was the mastermind and he orchestrated South Africa's next try as he regathered a loose ball and tore through England's defence; he sent JP Pietersen over for his first try of the evening and later in the second half broke away on the blindside to put JP Pietersen away for his second. This victory set the tone for South Africa's triumph. They employed a strong tactical kicking game backed-up by stout defence and the best line-out in the world. With a clinical counter-attacking game the Boks were able to vary their approach and ended the year the number one ranked team in the world.\nThe Springboks' final pool match was against the US in Montpellier. They ran in nine tries to two to win 64\u201315 and finish on top of Pool A. The only downside was a knee injury to prop [[B. J. Botha]], which would rule him out for the rest of the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/australia/rugby/story/72128.html|date=1 October 2007|publisher=ESPN Scrum|title=Springboks hit by Botha blow}}</ref> White was pleased with his team's efforts:\n<blockquote>What we wanted to accomplish was to get some structure and continuity to our game. Some of the tries we scored were very pleasing. I don't think the US are as weak as the scoreline suggests. The most important thing was that we put things together on a game day.

But the Bulls were determined to keep their unblemished finals record at home intact, and worked their way back into the game to lead 23\u201319 with 14 minutes to go. Then Bulls captain [[Dewald Potgieter]] turned down three opportunities to score penalty goals, instead opting each time to go for a try, presumably to put the game beyond the Brumbies' reach. In the 78th minute, the Brumbies seized their chance when fly-half [[Matt Toomua]] made an incisive break and passed to [[Tevita Kuridrani]] who touched down to help give the Brumbies a 26\u201323 lead. There was still time for one last kick-off, but the Bulls lost possession, enabling the Brumbies to kick the ball into touch and celebrate a victory which White described as \"the greatest the Brumbies have ever had\".<ref name=\"bullslose\"/> The Brumbies then had to travel to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] where they would have to face the [[Chiefs (rugby union)|Chiefs]] in the [[2013 Super Rugby Final]]. The Brumbies had led the match 9\u20130 with 20 minutes gone, however a burst of penalties saw the Chiefs even the score by the 31st minute. A try late on in the first half by [[Christian Lealiifano]] saw the Brumbies lead 16\u20139 at half time. Early on in the second half, Lealiifano booted a further two penalties to reach their final score of 22, with Lealiifano having scored all the points. But two tries conceded at the 63rd and 67th minute by [[Liam Messam]] and [[Robbie Robinson (rugby player)|Robbie Robinson]] saw the home side lead 24\u201322 with 10 minutes to go. Despite a strong attack by the Brumbies, the Chiefs defence remained strong and the match finished 27\u201322.\n\nIn 2013 Brumbies beat [[British and Irish Lions]] 14-12 during [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|their Australian tour]], which was the first Lions loss to a non-international side since 2005, when they lost to [[M\u0101ori All Blacks]], though they had a draw with [[Emerging Springboks]] in 2009.\n\nAfter a successful stint with the Brumbies, White was believed to be a strong contender for the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] head coaching role when [[Robbie Deans]] resigned. However, he beaten to the role by fellow Super Rugby coach [[Ewen McKenzie]]. Surprisingly, after just two mounts after leading the Brumbies to second in the Super Rugby, White resigned from his post at the Brumbies explaining he wanted to return home to South Africa.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/jake-white-shocks-brumbies-by-quitting-20130925-2ueul.html Jake White shocks Brumbies by quitting]</ref> On 7 October 2013, White was appointed director of rugby at the [[Sharks (rugby union)|Sharks]], replacing Brendan Venter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/southafrica/rugby/story/201235.html|title=Sharks appoint Jake White as director of rugby|publisher=ESPN Scrum|date=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sharks 2014 ===\nOne of White's first actions as the Sharks' director of rugby was to establish [[Pat Lambie]] at fly-half for the upcoming Super Rugby season, saying that he felt that the talented Springbok utility back had been \"messed around\" with enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/super-rugby-2014/rugby/story/207323.html|title=Jake White anoints Pat Lambie Sharks fly-half|date=27 November 2013|publisher=ESPN Scrum}}</ref>\nWhite also announced that [[Francois Steyn]] would play at 12, the inside centre position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/super-rugby-2014/rugby/story/211535.html|title=Jake White backs Lambie-Steyn as playmakers|date=20 January 2014|publisher=ESPN Scrum}}</ref> The decision was partly to provide Steyn some much-needed stability, but also because he felt that playing Steyn at inside centre would help Lambie:\n<blockquote>With Frans at 12, you will see a much better Pat Lambie.

{"title_page": "Kill stealing", "text_new": "{{short description|Practice in online games}}\nIn [[multiplayer video game]]s, particularly in MOBAs, [[first-person shooter]]s, [[MMORPG]]s and [[MUD]]s, '''kill stealing''' is the practice of obtaining credit for killing an [[mob (gaming)|enemy]] when another player has put more effort into the kill. This usually happens when a game only keeps track of which player defeats an enemy, leading to the so-called [[Last-hitting (game design)|last-hitting]] mechanics. If one player whittles down some enemy's [[health point]]s, but a different player eventually finishes the enemy off, this second player might obtain all of the loot or [[experience point]]s from the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRMeBQAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses|publisher=CRC Press|last=Schell|first=Jesse|page=410|isbn=1466598646|date=2014-11-06}}</ref> Kill stealing is common when the rewards for finishing enemies off are highly desired within the game.\n\nSome players feel that kill stealing is a dishonorable practice.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxAuOTt9cvIC&pg=PA122 |title= Communities in Cyberspace |author=Peter Kollock |isbn=978-0-203-19495-9 |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> A good faith attempt to secure a kill on an enemy that might otherwise have gotten away can sometimes be perceived as a kill steal if the other player believes the kill was already certain.\n\n==Overview==\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2014}}\nThere are two main causes for kill stealing: the desire for the reward and the desire to cause other players [[griefing|grief]]. Kill stealing is predominantly done to gain the rewards from a kill. [[Griefer]]s kill steal as only one of their tactics in annoying other players.{{R|jennings-macris}} However, there are side-reasons towards kill stealing, with a few being unintentional, i.e. killing an enemy with low player HP, and then killing another enemy - in a panic - which is being dealt by someone else.\n\nComplaints of kill stealing are sometimes heard in online first-person shooters. In most of these games, the credit for a kill goes to the player who deals the killing shot. Players usually ignore complaints of kill stealing in FPSs because the rewards are less significant and because these games move much faster (i.e., it was probably accidental). Furthermore, in FPS combat, players are usually either allies (in which case the kill's credit going to one player or another has no in-game meaning beyond ego) or in direct enmity with one another (providing both a justification for cutthroat tactics, and a generally immediate means of redress). Kill stealing can sometimes specifically refer to the disruption of a particularly \"interesting\" kill that would have earned a lot of extra points beyond the kill itself.\n\nBy contrast, in most MMORPGs players may be competing for the same in-game resources, but are not generally in direct conflict with one another. (In situations where they are, such as two opposite-faction players in a [[World of Warcraft]] player-versus-player server, there is usually little animosity towards kill-stealing, as there is a means of redress and prevention, and it is seen as part of the general struggle between Horde and Alliance)\n\nIn team based game modes, many players overreact when they do not understand the objective is for the team to win, rather than individual progression.\n\n== Prevention ==\nMany newer MMORPGs implement game designs that distributes the reward more fairly to those who fought a creature. Rewards can be distributed based on how much the player contributed to defeating the creature. A player that does 30% of the damage gains 30% of the money and experience points rewarded for defeating the creature. A game might have a more sophisticated way to measure a player's contribution to the fight as well.
