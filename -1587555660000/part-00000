At a press conference in May 2005 in London Ontario Canada, Sheerin told the United Press International that Canadian Arrow was nearing completion and that it was missing only one important component in its plan to develop its space tourism business: money. Geoff Sheerin proudly announced, \"We have found our Paul Allen\".

MirCorp was a joint venture with RSC Energia. RSC Energia launched the first satellite (Sputnik), sent the first man to orbit the Earth (Yuri Gagarin), built the Mir Space Station, and is a major partner in the International Space Station.\n\n==Canadian Arrow==\n{{main | Canadian Arrow}}\nThe Canadian Arrow is a 16.5 m tall two-stage rocket, where the second stage is a three-person space capsule. In a somewhat conservative approach, the design of the rocket engine and aerodynamics are based on the well proven [[V-2]] design from [[World War II|WWII]]. The vehicle will launch vertically from the ground, on a [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital]] trajectory, and will return to Earth via parachutes and make a water landing, similar to the [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]]s of the [[Project Mercury#Spacecraft|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini]] and [[Project Apollo#Spacecraft|Apollo]] spacecraft.\n\n==Silver Dart==\n[[File:H silver dart land 02.1.jpg|thumb|The proposed Silver Dart spacecraft.]]\nBased on the FDL-7, a [[lifting body]] aircraft designed for [[Low Earth orbit|near earth orbital]] flight by the [[US Airforce Flight Dynamics Laboratory]],<ref name=\"Reed\">\n{{cite book\n | last       = Reed\n | first      = R.

The dancer's costume, with its small vest and gauzy blouse, seems to have been inspired by contemporary Awalem (Egyptian slang for ''Dancers'') women's clothing. Where the Awalem woman of the period would have worn an elbow-length blouse tucked in to her skirt at the waist, however, this dancer's sheer blouse is open over her bare breasts and her nude abdomen is thrust toward the viewer of the painting. \n\nOver time, ''danse du ventre'' came to be used in French for all solo, torso-articulated dances of Middle Eastern origin. The English translation \"belly dance\" seems to have made its first appearance in 1889 in reference to the Egyptian dancers who performed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] that was held in Paris that year.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe informal, social form of the dance is known as ''[[Baladi#Raqs Baladi|Raqs Baladi]]'' ('Dance of the Country' or 'Folk Dance') in [[Egyptian Arabic]] and is considered an indigenous dance. ''[[Raqs Sharqi]]'' ('Eastern Dance') is a broad category of professional forms of the dance, including forms of belly dance as we know it today, such as Raqs Baladi, Sa'idi, Ghawazee and Awalim. \n\n[[File:Randa Kamel Egyptian Bellydancer 2007 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.7|alt=Randa Kamel, Egyptian belly dancer|Randa Kamel, Egyptian belly dancer]]Belly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the hips.<ref name=\"Varga2011\">{{cite book|last=Varga Dinicu|first=Carolena|title=You Asked Aunt Rocky: Answers & Advice About Raqs Sharqi & Raqs Shaabi|year=2011|publisher=RDI Publications, LLC|location=Virginia Beach, VA, USA|isbn=978-0-9830690-4-1|page=218}}</ref> Unlike many Western [[dance]] forms, the focus of the dance is on isolations of the [[torso]] muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these isolations appear similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are sometimes driven differently and have a different feeling or emphasis.\n\nIn common with most folk dances, there is no universal naming scheme for belly dance movements. Some dancers and dance schools have developed their own naming schemes, but none of these is universally recognized. One of the most common naming schemes is that of the Salimpour Format, introduced by Suhaila and Jamila Salimpour. Jamila Salimpour was the first to coin many now-popular names of belly dance moves,<ref>[https://salimpourformatinflorida.com/about-the-format/ The Salimpour Legacy]</ref><ref>http://www.sabriyetekbilek.com/workshops-with-suhaila-salimpour</ref> including steps such as the Basic Egyptian, Choo Choo, Maya, and Turkish Drop. But these commonly-held terms are the exception, rather than the rule, in the belly dance world.\n\n===Movements found in belly dance===\nMany of the movements characteristic of belly dance can be grouped into the following categories:<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Josephine|title=The JWAAD Book of Bellydance|year=2012|publisher=JWAAD Ltd |location=Croydon, UK |isbn=978-0-9573105-0-6 |pages=60\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n* '''Percussive movements''': Staccato movements, most commonly of the hips, used to punctuate the music or accent a beat. Typical movements in this group include hip drops, vertical hip rocks, outwards hip hits, hip lifts and hip twists. Percussive movements using other parts of the body can include lifts or drops of the ribcage and shoulder accents.\n* '''Fluid movements''': Flowing, sinuous movements in which the body is in continuous motion, used to interpret melodic lines and lyrical sections in the music, or modulated to express complex instrumental improvisations. These movements require a great deal of abdominal muscle control. Typical movements include horizontal and vertical figures of 8 or infinity loops with the hips, horizontal or tilting hip circles, and undulations of the hips and abdomen. These basic shapes may be varied, combined and embellished to create an infinite variety of complex, textured movements.\n* '''Shimmies, shivers and vibrations''': Small, fast, continuous movements of the hips or ribcage, which create an impression of texture and depth of movement. Shimmies are commonly layered over other movements, and are often used to interpret rolls on the [[tablah]] or [[riq]] or fast strumming of the [[oud]] or [[qanun (instrument)]]. There are many types of shimmy, varying in size and method of generation. Some common shimmies include relaxed, up and down hip shimmies, straight-legged knee-driven shimmies, fast, tiny hip vibrations, twisting hip shimmies, bouncing 'earthquake' shimmies, and relaxed shoulder or ribcage shimmies.\n\nIn addition to these torso movements, dancers in many styles will use level changes, travelling steps, turns and spins. The arms are used to frame and accentuate movements of the hips, for dramatic gestures, and to create beautiful lines and shapes with the body, particularly in the more balletic, Westernised styles. Other movements may be used as occasional accents, such as low kicks and arabesques, backbends, and head tosses.\n\n==In the Middle East==\n\n===Origins and history===\n[[File:Tahmasp, Humayun Meeting.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|alt=Mural painting of a meeting between Shah Tahmasp and the Mughal emperor Humayun at the Chehel Sutun Palace, found in Isfahan, Iran|Mural painting of a meeting between Shah Tahmasp and the Mughal emperor Humayun found in Iran]]Belly dancing is believed to have had a long history in the [[Middle East]], but reliable evidence about its origins is scarce, and accounts of its history are often highly speculative.<ref name=\"Deagon\"/> Several Greek and Roman sources including [[Juvenal]] and [[Martial]] describe dancers from Asia Minor and Spain using undulating movements, playing [[castanets]], and sinking to the floor with \"quivering thighs\", descriptions that are certainly suggestive of the movements that are today associated with belly dance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buonaventura|first=Wendy|title=Serpent of the Nile: Women and Dance in the Arab World|year=1989|publisher=Saqi|isbn=978-0-86356-628-8|page=13}}</ref> Later, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, European travellers in the Middle East such as [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] and [[Flaubert]] wrote extensively of the dancers they saw there, including the [[Almeh|Awalim]] and [[Ghawazee]] of Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buonaventura|first=Wendy|title=Serpent of the Nile: Women and Dance in the Arab World|year=1989|publisher=Saqi|isbn=978-0-86356-628-8|pages=56\u201376}}</ref>\nIn the [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire#Dance|Ottoman Empire]], belly dance was performed by both boys and women in the Sultan's palace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://azizasaid.wordpress.com/2008/08/31/a-question-of-kocek-men-in-skirts/|title=A Question of K\u00f6\u00e7ek \u2013 Men in Skirts|website=Azizasaid}}</ref>\n\n===Social context===\n[[File:Belly dancer, Carmen Fragoso performing in Oriental Cabaret.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.6|alt=Mexican Carmen Fragoso is among the new generation of dancers known for their online presence.|[[Mexico|Mexican]] Carmen Fragoso is among the new generation of dancers known for their [[Influencer marketing|online presence]].]]Belly dance in the Middle East has two distinct social contexts: as a folk or social dance, and as a performance art.\n\nAs a social dance, belly dance (also called [[Baladi|Raqs Baladi]] or Raqs Shaabi in this context) is performed at celebrations and social gatherings by ordinary people (male and female, young and old), in their ordinary clothes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Josephine|title=The JWAAD Book of Bellydance|year=2012|publisher=JWAAD Ltd.|isbn=978-0-9573105-0-6|page=11}}</ref> In more conservative or traditional societies, these events may be gender segregated, with separate parties where men and women dance separately.<ref>{{cite book|last=Al-Rawi|first=Rosina Fawzia|title=Grandmother's Secrets: The Ancient Rituals and Healing Power of Belly Dancing |year=1999|publisher=Interlink Books|isbn=978-1-56656-302-4|pages=20\u201322}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, professional dance performers were the [[Almeh|Awalim]] (primarily musicians and poets), [[Ghawazi]], and [[K\u00f6\u00e7ekler]].

The modern Egyptian belly dance style (and the modern costume) are said to have originated in Cairo's nightclubs.

(Other genres of performing arts were not affected.) The ban was lifted in September 2004, but a culture of exclusivity and selectivity remained.

The Turkish style of belly dance is lively and playful, with a greater outward projection of energy than the more contained and artistic Egyptian style. Turkish dancers are known for their energetic, athletic (even [[gymnastic]]) style, and their adept use of [[finger cymbals]], also known as [[zill|zils]], which are commonly used in Egyptian style and movies.  Connoisseurs of Turkish style often say a dancer who cannot play the zils is not an accomplished dancer. Floorwork, which has been banned in Egypt since the mid-20th century, is still an important part of Turkish belly dance.\n\nAnother distinguishing element of Turkish style is the use of a {{music|time|9|8}} rhythm, divided as {{serif|'''2+2+2+3'''}}, often referred to as the [[Karsilama]] rhythm. Kar\u015filama, in Turkish dance, is not a rhythm but a folk dance performed in a line, whereas a {{music|time|9|8}} (dokuz sekiz) rhythm defines the count of the rhythm and is used in both kar\u015filama and Roman havasi.\n\nMany professional dancers and musicians in Turkey continue to be of [[Romani people|Romani]] heritage, and the Roma people of Turkey have had a strong influence on the Turkish style.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mourat|first=Elizabeth 'Artemis'|title=Turkish Dancing|url=http://www.serpentine.org/artemis/turkishdance.html}}</ref>\n\n===In Lebanon===\nLebanese style belly dance is somewhere between the Egyptian and Turkish styles. Lebanese dance takes from the classic oriental dance, but still incorporates a feisty, modern edge. There are large steps, backward leans to the torso, twisting hip rotations, large and busy arms and lots of shimmies. The types of techniques that are used in Lebanese style dance are quick layered shimmies and subtle internal movements.  Lebanese dancers sometimes include kicks, splits, deep back bends, and Turkish drops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://babayagamusic.com/Encyclopedic-Dictionary-Ethnic-Arts/lebanese-belly-dance.htm|title=LEBANESE BELLY DANCE|website=babayagamusic.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}</ref>\n\n==Outside the Middle East==\n[[File:Bellydance-ikebukuro-japan-sept24-2016.ogv|thumb|right|alt=A video of a belly dancer on stage in Japan, 2016|(video) A belly dancer on stage in [[Japan]], 2016]]{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}Belly dance was popularized in the West during the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of the 18th and 19th centuries, when [[orientalism|Orientalist]] artists depicted romanticized images of [[harem]] life in the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n===In North America===\nAlthough there were dancers of this type at the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia, it was not until the 1893 Chicago [[World's Fair]] that it gained national attention. The term \"belly dancing\" is often credited to [[Sol Bloom]], the Fair's entertainment director, but he referred to the dance as ''danse du ventre'', the name used by the French in Algeria. In his memoirs, Bloom states, \"when the public learned that the literal translation was \"belly dance\", they delightedly concluded that it must be salacious and immoral ... I had a gold mine.\" Authentic dancers from several Middle Eastern and North African countries performed at the Fair, including Syria, Turkey and Algeria\u2014but it was the dancers in the Egyptian Theater of The Street in the Cairo exhibit who gained the most notoriety.  The fact that the dancers were uncorseted and gyrated their hips was shocking to Victorian sensibilities.  There were no soloists, but it is claimed that a dancer nicknamed [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]] stole the show. Some claim the dancer was [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Farida Mazar Spyropoulos]], but this fact is disputed.<ref>Donna Carlton (1995) ''Looking for Little Egypt''. Bloomington, Indiana: International Dance Discovery Books. {{ISBN|0-9623998-1-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe popularity of these dancers subsequently spawned dozens of imitators, many of whom claimed to be from the original troupe. Victorian society continued to be affronted by the dance, and dancers were sometimes arrested and fined.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1893/12/07/archives/no-more-midway-dancing-three-of-the-egyptian-girls-finded-each.html|title=NO MORE MIDWAY DANCING; THREE OF THE EGYPTIAN GIRLS FINDED EACH.

A short film, \"Fatima's Dance\", was widely distributed in the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon]] theaters. It drew criticism for its \"immodest\" dancing, and was eventually censored. Belly dance drew men in droves to burlesque theaters, and to carnival and circus lots.\n\n[[Thomas Edison]] made several [[film]]s of dancers in the 1890s.  These included a Turkish dance, and Crissie Sheridan in 1897,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/varsmp.1143|title=Crissie Sheridan / Thomas A.

W. Griffith's silent film ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', her goal being to lift dance to a respectable art form at a time when dancers were considered to be women of loose morals. Hollywood began producing films such as ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', ''[[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]]'', and ''[[Salom\u00e9 (1923 film)|Salom\u00e9]]'', to capitalize on Western fantasies of the orient.\n\nWhen immigrants from Arab states began to arrive in New York in the 1930s, dancers started to perform in nightclubs and restaurants.  In the late 1960s and early '70s many dancers began teaching. Middle Eastern or Eastern bands took dancers with them on tour, which helped spark interest in the dance.\n\nAlthough using Turkish and Egyptian movements and music, American Cabaret (\"AmCab\") belly dancing has developed its own distinctive style, using props and encouraging audience interaction.\n\nIn 1987, a distinctively American style of group improvisational dance, [[American Tribal Style Belly Dance]], (ATS), was created.  Although a unique and wholly modern style, its steps are based on existing dance techniques, including those from [[North India]], the Middle East, and [[Africa]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalbellydance.org/about.html|title=About Tribal Bellydance|website=Tribalbellydance.org}}</ref>   Many forms of [[Tribal Fusion (dance form)|\"Tribal Fusion\"]] belly dance have also developed, incorporating elements from many other dance and music styles including [[flamenco]], ballet, [[burlesque]], [[hula hoop]] and even [[hip hop]]. [[Gothic bellydance|\"Gothic Belly Dance\"]] is a style which incorporates elements from [[Goth subculture]].\n\n===In Spain===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}[[File:Dalilah bailando danza oriental en la Esfinge.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|alt=Spaniard Dalilah, 1957|Spaniard [[Dalilah (bellydancer)|Dalilah]], 1957]]Belly dancers are thought to have come to Spain from Lebanon in the time of the [[Phoenicia]]ns (11th Century BC to 5th Century BC). When Arab family of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad]] came to Spain, they sent Basque singers and dancers to Damascus and Egypt for training in the Middle Eastern style. These dancers came to be known as Al-Andalus dancers. It is theorised that the fusion of the Al-Andalus style with the dances of the [[Romani people in Spain|Gypsies]] led to the creation of [[flamenco]].\n\n===In Australia===\nThe first wave of interest in belly dancing in Australia was during the late 1970s to 1980s with the influx of migrants and refugees escaping troubles in the Middle East, including drummer [[Jamal Zraika]].  These immigrants created a social scene including numerous Lebanese and Turkish restaurants, providing employment for belly dancers. [[Rozeta Ahalyea]] is widely regarded as the \"mother\" of Australian belly dance,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/australia/womans-day-australia/20190624/283055530942445|title=PressReader.com - Your favorite newspapers and magazines.|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref> training early dance pioneers such as [[Amera Eid]] and [[Terezka Drnzik]]. Belly dance has now spread across the country, with belly dance communities in every capital city and many regional centres.\n\n===In the United Kingdom===\nBelly dance has been in evidence in the UK since the early 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a thriving Arabic club scene in London, with live Arabic music and belly dancing a regular feature,<ref>{{cite web|last=Asmahan of London|title=Gilded Serpent, Part 1|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2012/01/15/asmahan-arabic-nightclubs-london-part1/|work=Gilded Serpent}}</ref> but the last of these closed in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Asmahan of London|title=Gilded Serpent, Part 2|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2012/03/09/asmahan-golden-era-arab-nightclubs-london-p2/|work=Gilded Serpent|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> Several prominent members of the British belly dance community began their dance careers working in these clubs.\n\nToday, there are fewer traditional venues for Arabic dance in the UK; however, there is a large amateur belly dance community.

[[American Tribal Style]] and [[Tribal Fusion]] belly dance are also popular.\n\n==Costume==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe costume most commonly associated with belly dance is the 'bedlah' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u062f\u0644\u0629}}; literally \"suit\") style, which typically includes a fitted top or bra, a fitted hip belt, and a full-length skirt or [[harem pants]]. The bra and belt may be richly decorated with beads, sequins, crystals, coins, beaded fringe and embroidery. The belt may be a separate piece, or sewn into a skirt.\n\n[[Badia Masabni]], a Cairo [[cabaret]] owner during the early 20th century, is credited with creating the modern bedlah style. It has been suggested that the bedlah was inspired by glamorous Hollywood costuming, or created to appeal to Western visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2013/03/28/leyla-amir-bedlah-not-from-hollywood/|title=Gilded Serpent}}</ref>  Earlier costumes were made up of a full skirt, light chemise and tight cropped vest with heavy embellishments and jewelry.\n\nAs well as the two-piece bedlah costume, full length dresses are sometimes worn, especially when dancing more earthy [[baladi]] styles. Dresses range from closely fitting, highly decorated gowns, which often feature heavy embellishments and mesh-covered cutouts, to simpler designs which are often based on traditional clothing.\n\n===Costume in Egypt===\nIn Egypt dancers wear a bedlah. Alternatively, they may wear a dress with mesh-filled cutouts. Egypt has laws in place<ref>[[Raqs sharqi#Costume]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=September 2019}} regarding what dancers can and cannot wear, and according to Act No. 430 of the law on the censorship of literary works, dancers must cover their lower bodies, including the breast and stomach area.<ref> [https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/42216/Egypt-s-regulations-on-belly-dancing-attire Article in Egypt Today: Egypt's regulations on belly dancing attire] </ref> Typically a sheer, skin-colored mesh fabric covering the stomach is enough. Many dancers in Cairo ignore these rules, as they are rarely enforced and the consequences for performing with a bare belly may simply be a fine. However, there have been multiple incidents of foreign belly dancers being arrested over their costumes.\n\n===Costume in Lebanon===\nAs there is no prohibition on showing the abdomen in Lebanon, the bedlah style is more common. The skirts tend to be more sheer than Egyptian outfits, showing more of the dancer's body. The veil is more widely used than in Egypt. High heels are commonly worn. Lebanese dancers have more freedom than Egyptian style dancers in the type of costume they choose to wear.\n\n===Costume in Turkey===\nTurkish costumes are usually in the bedlah style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oddleentertainment.co.uk/hire-a-belly-dancer-oddle-entertainmen/|title=Everything You Need To Know About Belly Dancing|last=Patterson|first=Alice|date=|website=Oddle Entertainment Agency|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref> Distinctive features of many Turkish costumes include a V-shaped or triangular belt which may be shaped or contoured around the top edge, and a great deal of embellishment and beaded fringing on both the bra and the belt. Skirts are often fuller than their Egyptian counterparts, and are likely to be made of chiffon or velvet rather than lycra.\n\nIn the 1980s and '90s a very revealing costume style developed with skirts designed to display both legs up to the hip, and plunging bras or even pasties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orientaldancer.net/belly-dance-library/belly-dance-costumes/belly-dance-costumes.php|website=Orientaldancer.net|title=Belly Dance Costumes}}</ref> Such styles still exist in some venues but there are also many Turkish belly dancers who wear more moderate costumes. Even so, many Turkish belly dance costumes reflect the playful, flirty style of Turkish belly dance.\n\n===Tribal style costumes===\n[[File:Costume Decorations.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|alt=Decorations on a tribal-style bellydance costume bra|Decorations on a tribal-style bellydance costume bra]]Tribal belly dance costumes draw inspiration from traditional folkloric costumes across the globe and include circle skirts, pantaloons, and turbans or headdresses decked with feathers or flowers.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Health==\nBelly dance is a non-impact, weight-bearing exercise and is thus suitable for all ages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dallal|first=Tamalyn|title=Belly Dancing For Fitness|year=2004|publisher=Ulysses Press|location=Berkley|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1sYgd9gunLEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=belly+dance+fitness|isbn=9781569754108}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lo Iacono|first=Valeria|title=WorldBellydance.com|url= http://www.worldbellydance.com/health-benefits-belly-dance/}}</ref> Many of the moves involve isolations, which improves flexibility of the torso. Belly dance moves are beneficial to the spine, as the full-body undulation moves lengthen (decompress) and strengthen the entire column of spinal and abdominal muscles in a gentle way.\n\nDancing with a veil can help build strength in the upper body, arm and shoulders. Playing the [[zill]]s trains fingers to work independently and builds strength.

The lead character, Jade ([[Giovanna Antonelli]]), used it to entice her lover Lucas ([[Murilo Ben\u00edcio]]) and to soothe and seduce her husband Said (Dalton Vigh).\n\nSeveral [[James Bond films]] (including ''From Russia with Love'') and [[music video]]s have featured belly dancers. In ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', the belly dancer Saida wears a spent bullet in her navel, which Bond accidentally swallows while trying to retrieve it. In addition, Sinbad and the Minotaur featured characters who belly danced such as Luna and Al-Jibbar's Harem slave girls.\n\nDocumentaries about belly dance include ''[[American Bellydancer]]'', ''Journey of Desire: A Foreign Dancer in Cairo'', ''Belly, Sensual...

The dancer's costume, with its small vest and gauzy blouse, seems to have been inspired by contemporary Awalem (Egyptian slang for ''Dancers'') women's clothing. Where the Awalem woman of the period would have worn an elbow-length blouse tucked in to her skirt at the waist, however, this dancer's sheer blouse is open over her bare breasts and her nude abdomen is thrust toward the viewer of the painting. \n\nOver time, ''danse du ventre'' came to be used in French for all solo, torso-articulated dances of Middle Eastern origin. The English translation \"belly dance\" seems to have made its first appearance in 1889 in reference to the Egyptian dancers who performed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] that was held in Paris that year.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe informal, social form of the dance is known as ''[[Baladi#Raqs Baladi|Raqs Baladi]]'' ('Dance of the Country' or 'Folk Dance') in [[Egyptian Arabic]] and is considered an indigenous dance. ''[[Raqs Sharqi]]'' ('Eastern Dance') is a broad category of professional forms of the dance, including forms of belly dance as we know it today, such as Raqs Baladi, Sa'idi, Ghawazee and Awalim. \n\n[[File:Randa Kamel Egyptian Bellydancer 2007 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.7|alt=Randa Kamel, Egyptian belly dancer|Randa Kamel, Egyptian belly dancer]]Belly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the hips.<ref name=\"Varga2011\">{{cite book|last=Varga Dinicu|first=Carolena|title=You Asked Aunt Rocky: Answers & Advice About Raqs Sharqi & Raqs Shaabi|year=2011|publisher=RDI Publications, LLC|location=Virginia Beach, VA, USA|isbn=978-0-9830690-4-1|page=218}}</ref> Unlike many Western [[dance]] forms, the focus of the dance is on isolations of the [[torso]] muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these isolations appear similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are sometimes driven differently and have a different feeling or emphasis.\n\nIn common with most folk dances, there is no universal naming scheme for belly dance movements. Some dancers and dance schools have developed their own naming schemes, but none of these is universally recognized. One of the most common naming schemes is that of the Salimpour Format, introduced by Suhaila and Jamila Salimpour. Jamila Salimpour was the first to coin many now-popular names of belly dance moves,<ref>[https://salimpourformatinflorida.com/about-the-format/ The Salimpour Legacy]</ref><ref>http://www.sabriyetekbilek.com/workshops-with-suhaila-salimpour</ref> including steps such as the Basic Egyptian, Choo Choo, Maya, and Turkish Drop. But these commonly-held terms are the exception, rather than the rule, in the belly dance world.\n\n===Movements found in belly dance===\nMany of the movements characteristic of belly dance can be grouped into the following categories:<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Josephine|title=The JWAAD Book of Bellydance|year=2012|publisher=JWAAD Ltd |location=Croydon, UK |isbn=978-0-9573105-0-6 |pages=60\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n* '''Percussive movements''': Staccato movements, most commonly of the hips, used to punctuate the music or accent a beat. Typical movements in this group include hip drops, vertical hip rocks, outwards hip hits, hip lifts and hip twists. Percussive movements using other parts of the body can include lifts or drops of the ribcage and shoulder accents.\n* '''Fluid movements''': Flowing, sinuous movements in which the body is in continuous motion, used to interpret melodic lines and lyrical sections in the music, or modulated to express complex instrumental improvisations. These movements require a great deal of abdominal muscle control. Typical movements include horizontal and vertical figures of 8 or infinity loops with the hips, horizontal or tilting hip circles, and undulations of the hips and abdomen. These basic shapes may be varied, combined and embellished to create an infinite variety of complex, textured movements.\n* '''Shimmies, shivers and vibrations''': Small, fast, continuous movements of the hips or ribcage, which create an impression of texture and depth of movement. Shimmies are commonly layered over other movements, and are often used to interpret rolls on the [[tablah]] or [[riq]] or fast strumming of the [[oud]] or [[qanun (instrument)]]. There are many types of shimmy, varying in size and method of generation. Some common shimmies include relaxed, up and down hip shimmies, straight-legged knee-driven shimmies, fast, tiny hip vibrations, twisting hip shimmies, bouncing 'earthquake' shimmies, and relaxed shoulder or ribcage shimmies.\n\nIn addition to these torso movements, dancers in many styles will use level changes, travelling steps, turns and spins. The arms are used to frame and accentuate movements of the hips, for dramatic gestures, and to create beautiful lines and shapes with the body, particularly in the more balletic, Westernised styles. Other movements may be used as occasional accents, such as low kicks and arabesques, backbends, and head tosses.\n\n==In the Middle East==\n\n===Origins and history===\n[[File:Tahmasp, Humayun Meeting.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|alt=Mural painting of a meeting between Shah Tahmasp and the Mughal emperor Humayun at the Chehel Sutun Palace, found in Isfahan, Iran|Mural painting of a meeting between Shah Tahmasp and the Mughal emperor Humayun found in Iran]]Belly dancing is believed to have had a long history in the [[Middle East]], but reliable evidence about its origins is scarce, and accounts of its history are often highly speculative.<ref name=\"Deagon\"/> Several Greek and Roman sources including [[Juvenal]] and [[Martial]] describe dancers from Asia Minor and Spain using undulating movements, playing [[castanets]], and sinking to the floor with \"quivering thighs\", descriptions that are certainly suggestive of the movements that are today associated with belly dance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buonaventura|first=Wendy|title=Serpent of the Nile: Women and Dance in the Arab World|year=1989|publisher=Saqi|isbn=978-0-86356-628-8|page=13}}</ref> Later, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, European travellers in the Middle East such as [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] and [[Flaubert]] wrote extensively of the dancers they saw there, including the [[Almeh|Awalim]] and [[Ghawazee]] of Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buonaventura|first=Wendy|title=Serpent of the Nile: Women and Dance in the Arab World|year=1989|publisher=Saqi|isbn=978-0-86356-628-8|pages=56\u201376}}</ref>\nIn the [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire#Dance|Ottoman Empire]], belly dance was performed by both boys and women in the Sultan's palace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://azizasaid.wordpress.com/2008/08/31/a-question-of-kocek-men-in-skirts/|title=A Question of K\u00f6\u00e7ek \u2013 Men in Skirts|website=Azizasaid}}</ref>\n\n===Social context===\n[[File:Belly dancer, Carmen Fragoso performing in Oriental Cabaret.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.6|alt=Mexican Carmen Fragoso is among the new generation of dancers known for their online presence.|[[Mexico|Mexican]] Carmen Fragoso is among the new generation of dancers known for their [[Influencer marketing|online presence]].]]Belly dance in the Middle East has two distinct social contexts: as a folk or social dance, and as a performance art.\n\nAs a social dance, belly dance (also called [[Baladi|Raqs Baladi]] or Raqs Shaabi in this context) is performed at celebrations and social gatherings by ordinary people (male and female, young and old), in their ordinary clothes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Josephine|title=The JWAAD Book of Bellydance|year=2012|publisher=JWAAD Ltd.|isbn=978-0-9573105-0-6|page=11}}</ref> In more conservative or traditional societies, these events may be gender segregated, with separate parties where men and women dance separately.<ref>{{cite book|last=Al-Rawi|first=Rosina Fawzia|title=Grandmother's Secrets: The Ancient Rituals and Healing Power of Belly Dancing |year=1999|publisher=Interlink Books|isbn=978-1-56656-302-4|pages=20\u201322}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, professional dance performers were the [[Almeh|Awalim]] (primarily musicians and poets), [[Ghawazi]], and [[K\u00f6\u00e7ekler]].

The Turkish style of belly dance is lively and playful, with a greater outward projection of energy than the more contained and artistic Egyptian style. Turkish dancers are known for their energetic, athletic (even [[gymnastic]]) style, and their adept use of [[finger cymbals]], also known as [[zill|zils]], which are commonly used in Egyptian style and movies.  Connoisseurs of Turkish style often say a dancer who cannot play the zils is not an accomplished dancer. Floorwork, which has been banned in Egypt since the mid-20th century, is still an important part of Turkish belly dance.\n\nAnother distinguishing element of Turkish style is the use of a {{music|time|9|8}} rhythm, divided as {{serif|'''2+2+2+3'''}}, often referred to as the [[Karsilama]] rhythm. Kar\u015filama, in Turkish dance, is not a rhythm but a folk dance performed in a line, whereas a {{music|time|9|8}} (dokuz sekiz) rhythm defines the count of the rhythm and is used in both kar\u015filama and Roman havasi.\n\nMany professional dancers and musicians in Turkey continue to be of [[Romani people|Romani]] heritage, and the Roma people of Turkey have had a strong influence on the Turkish style.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mourat|first=Elizabeth 'Artemis'|title=Turkish Dancing|url=http://www.serpentine.org/artemis/turkishdance.html}}</ref>\n\n===In Lebanon===\nLebanese style belly dance is somewhere between the Egyptian and Turkish styles. Lebanese dance takes from the classic oriental dance, but still incorporates a feisty, modern edge. There are large steps, backward leans to the torso, twisting hip rotations, large and busy arms and lots of shimmies. The types of techniques that are used in Lebanese style dance are quick layered shimmies and subtle internal movements.  Lebanese dancers sometimes include kicks, splits, deep back bends, and Turkish drops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://babayagamusic.com/Encyclopedic-Dictionary-Ethnic-Arts/lebanese-belly-dance.htm|title=LEBANESE BELLY DANCE|website=babayagamusic.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}</ref>\n\n==Outside the Middle East==\n[[File:Bellydance-ikebukuro-japan-sept24-2016.ogv|thumb|right|alt=A video of a belly dancer on stage in Japan, 2016|(video) A belly dancer on stage in [[Japan]], 2016]]{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}Belly dance was popularized in the West during the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of the 18th and 19th centuries, when [[orientalism|Orientalist]] artists depicted romanticized images of [[harem]] life in the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n===In North America===\nAlthough there were dancers of this type at the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia, it was not until the 1893 Chicago [[World's Fair]] that it gained national attention. The term \"belly dancing\" is often credited to [[Sol Bloom]], the Fair's entertainment director, but he referred to the dance as ''danse du ventre'', the name used by the French in Algeria. In his memoirs, Bloom states, \"when the public learned that the literal translation was \"belly dance\", they delightedly concluded that it must be salacious and immoral ... I had a gold mine.\" Authentic dancers from several Middle Eastern and North African countries performed at the Fair, including Syria, Turkey and Algeria\u2014but it was the dancers in the Egyptian Theater of The Street in the Cairo exhibit who gained the most notoriety.  The fact that the dancers were uncorseted and gyrated their hips was shocking to Victorian sensibilities.  There were no soloists, but it is claimed that a dancer nicknamed [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]] stole the show. Some claim the dancer was [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Farida Mazar Spyropoulos]], but this fact is disputed.<ref>Donna Carlton (1995) ''Looking for Little Egypt''. Bloomington, Indiana: International Dance Discovery Books. {{ISBN|0-9623998-1-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe popularity of these dancers subsequently spawned dozens of imitators, many of whom claimed to be from the original troupe. Victorian society continued to be affronted by the dance, and dancers were sometimes arrested and fined.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1893/12/07/archives/no-more-midway-dancing-three-of-the-egyptian-girls-finded-each.html|title=NO MORE MIDWAY DANCING; THREE OF THE EGYPTIAN GIRLS FINDED EACH.

A short film, \"Fatima's Dance\", was widely distributed in the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon]] theaters. It drew criticism for its \"immodest\" dancing, and was eventually censored. Belly dance drew men in droves to burlesque theaters, and to carnival and circus lots.\n\n[[Thomas Edison]] made several [[film]]s of dancers in the 1890s.  These included a Turkish dance, and Crissie Sheridan in 1897,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/varsmp.1143|title=Crissie Sheridan / Thomas A.

W. Griffith's silent film ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', her goal being to lift dance to a respectable art form at a time when dancers were considered to be women of loose morals. Hollywood began producing films such as ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', ''[[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]]'', and ''[[Salom\u00e9 (1923 film)|Salom\u00e9]]'', to capitalize on Western fantasies of the orient.\n\nWhen immigrants from Arab states began to arrive in New York in the 1930s, dancers started to perform in nightclubs and restaurants.  In the late 1960s and early '70s many dancers began teaching. Middle Eastern or Eastern bands took dancers with them on tour, which helped spark interest in the dance.\n\nAlthough using Turkish and Egyptian movements and music, American Cabaret (\"AmCab\") belly dancing has developed its own distinctive style, using props and encouraging audience interaction.\n\nIn 1987, a distinctively American style of group improvisational dance, [[American Tribal Style Belly Dance]], (ATS), was created.  Although a unique and wholly modern style, its steps are based on existing dance techniques, including those from [[North India]], the Middle East, and [[Africa]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalbellydance.org/about.html|title=About Tribal Bellydance|website=Tribalbellydance.org}}</ref>   Many forms of [[Tribal Fusion (dance form)|\"Tribal Fusion\"]] belly dance have also developed, incorporating elements from many other dance and music styles including [[flamenco]], ballet, [[burlesque]], [[hula hoop]] and even [[hip hop]]. [[Gothic bellydance|\"Gothic Belly Dance\"]] is a style which incorporates elements from [[Goth subculture]].\n\n===In Spain===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}[[File:Dalilah bailando danza oriental en la Esfinge.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|alt=Spaniard Dalilah, 1957|Spaniard [[Dalilah (bellydancer)|Dalilah]], 1957]]Belly dancers are thought to have come to Spain from Lebanon in the time of the [[Phoenicia]]ns (11th Century BC to 5th Century BC). When Arab family of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad]] came to Spain, they sent Basque singers and dancers to Damascus and Egypt for training in the Middle Eastern style. These dancers came to be known as Al-Andalus dancers. It is theorised that the fusion of the Al-Andalus style with the dances of the [[Romani people in Spain|Gypsies]] led to the creation of [[flamenco]].\n\n===In Australia===\nThe first wave of interest in belly dancing in Australia was during the late 1970s to 1980s with the influx of migrants and refugees escaping troubles in the Middle East, including drummer [[Jamal Zraika]].  These immigrants created a social scene including numerous Lebanese and Turkish restaurants, providing employment for belly dancers. [[Rozeta Ahalyea]] is widely regarded as the \"mother\" of Australian belly dance,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/australia/womans-day-australia/20190624/283055530942445|title=PressReader.com - Your favorite newspapers and magazines.|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref> training early dance pioneers such as [[Amera Eid]] and [[Terezka Drnzik]]. Belly dance has now spread across the country, with belly dance communities in every capital city and many regional centres.\n\n===In the United Kingdom===\nBelly dance has been in evidence in the UK since the early 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a thriving Arabic club scene in London, with live Arabic music and belly dancing a regular feature,<ref>{{cite web|last=Asmahan of London|title=Gilded Serpent, Part 1|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2012/01/15/asmahan-arabic-nightclubs-london-part1/|work=Gilded Serpent}}</ref> but the last of these closed in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Asmahan of London|title=Gilded Serpent, Part 2|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2012/03/09/asmahan-golden-era-arab-nightclubs-london-p2/|work=Gilded Serpent|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> Several prominent members of the British belly dance community began their dance careers working in these clubs.\n\nToday, there are fewer traditional venues for Arabic dance in the UK; however, there is a large amateur belly dance community.

[[American Tribal Style]] and [[Tribal Fusion]] belly dance are also popular.\n\n==Costume==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe costume most commonly associated with belly dance is the 'bedlah' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u062f\u0644\u0629}}; literally \"suit\") style, which typically includes a fitted top or bra, a fitted hip belt, and a full-length skirt or [[harem pants]]. The bra and belt may be richly decorated with beads, sequins, crystals, coins, beaded fringe and embroidery. The belt may be a separate piece, or sewn into a skirt.\n\n[[Badia Masabni]], a Cairo [[cabaret]] owner during the early 20th century, is credited with creating the modern bedlah style. It has been suggested that the bedlah was inspired by glamorous Hollywood costuming, or created to appeal to Western visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2013/03/28/leyla-amir-bedlah-not-from-hollywood/|title=Gilded Serpent}}</ref>  Earlier costumes were made up of a full skirt, light chemise and tight cropped vest with heavy embellishments and jewelry.\n\nAs well as the two-piece bedlah costume, full length dresses are sometimes worn, especially when dancing more earthy [[baladi]] styles. Dresses range from closely fitting, highly decorated gowns, which often feature heavy embellishments and mesh-covered cutouts, to simpler designs which are often based on traditional clothing.\n\n===Costume in Egypt===\nIn Egypt dancers wear a bedlah. Alternatively, they may wear a dress with mesh-filled cutouts. Egypt has laws in place<ref>[[Raqs sharqi#Costume]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=September 2019}} regarding what dancers can and cannot wear, and according to Act No. 430 of the law on the censorship of literary works, dancers must cover their lower bodies, including the breast and stomach area.<ref> [https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/42216/Egypt-s-regulations-on-belly-dancing-attire Article in Egypt Today: Egypt's regulations on belly dancing attire] </ref> Typically a sheer, skin-colored mesh fabric covering the stomach is enough. Many dancers in Cairo ignore these rules, as they are rarely enforced and the consequences for performing with a bare belly may simply be a fine. However, there have been multiple incidents of foreign belly dancers being arrested over their costumes.\n\n===Costume in Lebanon===\nAs there is no prohibition on showing the abdomen in Lebanon, the bedlah style is more common. The skirts tend to be more sheer than Egyptian outfits, showing more of the dancer's body. The veil is more widely used than in Egypt. High heels are commonly worn. Lebanese dancers have more freedom than Egyptian style dancers in the type of costume they choose to wear.\n\n===Costume in Turkey===\nTurkish costumes are usually in the bedlah style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oddleentertainment.co.uk/hire-a-belly-dancer-oddle-entertainmen/|title=Everything You Need To Know About Belly Dancing|last=Patterson|first=Alice|date=|website=Oddle Entertainment Agency|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref> Distinctive features of many Turkish costumes include a V-shaped or triangular belt which may be shaped or contoured around the top edge, and a great deal of embellishment and beaded fringing on both the bra and the belt. Skirts are often fuller than their Egyptian counterparts, and are likely to be made of chiffon or velvet rather than lycra.\n\nIn the 1980s and '90s a very revealing costume style developed with skirts designed to display both legs up to the hip, and plunging bras or even pasties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orientaldancer.net/belly-dance-library/belly-dance-costumes/belly-dance-costumes.php|website=Orientaldancer.net|title=Belly Dance Costumes}}</ref> Such styles still exist in some venues but there are also many Turkish belly dancers who wear more moderate costumes. Even so, many Turkish belly dance costumes reflect the playful, flirty style of Turkish belly dance.\n\n===Tribal style costumes===\n[[File:Costume Decorations.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|alt=Decorations on a tribal-style bellydance costume bra|Decorations on a tribal-style bellydance costume bra]]Tribal belly dance costumes draw inspiration from traditional folkloric costumes across the globe and include circle skirts, pantaloons, and turbans or headdresses decked with feathers or flowers.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Health==\nBelly dance is a non-impact, weight-bearing exercise and is thus suitable for all ages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dallal|first=Tamalyn|title=Belly Dancing For Fitness|year=2004|publisher=Ulysses Press|location=Berkley|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1sYgd9gunLEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=belly+dance+fitness|isbn=9781569754108}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lo Iacono|first=Valeria|title=WorldBellydance.com|url= http://www.worldbellydance.com/health-benefits-belly-dance/}}</ref> Many of the moves involve isolations, which improves flexibility of the torso. Belly dance moves are beneficial to the spine, as the full-body undulation moves lengthen (decompress) and strengthen the entire column of spinal and abdominal muscles in a gentle way.\n\nDancing with a veil can help build strength in the upper body, arm and shoulders. Playing the [[zill]]s trains fingers to work independently and builds strength. The legs and long muscles of the back are strengthened by hip movements.<ref>Coluccia, Pina, Anette Paffrath, and Jean Putz. ''Belly Dancing: The Sensual Art of Energy and Spirit''.

The lead character, Jade ([[Giovanna Antonelli]]), used it to entice her lover Lucas ([[Murilo Ben\u00edcio]]) and to soothe and seduce her husband Said (Dalton Vigh).\n\nSeveral [[James Bond films]] (including ''From Russia with Love'') and [[music video]]s have featured belly dancers. In ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', the belly dancer Saida wears a spent bullet in her navel, which Bond accidentally swallows while trying to retrieve it. In addition, Sinbad and the Minotaur featured characters who belly danced such as Luna and Al-Jibbar's Harem slave girls.\n\nDocumentaries about belly dance include ''[[American Bellydancer]]'', ''Journey of Desire: A Foreign Dancer in Cairo'', ''Belly, Sensual... Scarred... Sacred'', and ''Bellydancers of Cairo''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Raqs sharqi]]\n* [[Baladi]]\n* [[Ghawazi]]\n* [[Almeh]]\n* [[K\u00f6\u00e7ek]]\n* [[Persian dance]]\n* [[American Tribal Style Belly Dance]]\n* [[Improv Tribal Style Belly Dance]]\n* [[Tribal Fusion]]\n* [[M'alayah]]\n* [[Glossary of belly dance terms]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Raqs Sharqi}}\n* [https://www.listice.com/top-dance-styles-around-the-world/ Top Dance Styles around the World]\n{{Dance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Belly Dance}}\n[[Category:Belly dance| ]]\n[[Category:Egyptian culture]]\n[[Category:Egyptian dances]]\n[[Category:Arab culture]]\n[[Category:Arab society]]\n[[Category:Arab dance]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern dances]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Salhabub", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belly_dance"}
