On December 11, 1928, he was expelled from France and until 1930 was constantly harassed by the [[Law enforcement in Belgium|Belgian]], [[Law enforcement in France|French]], [[Law enforcement in the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Law enforcement in Germany|German]] and [[Grand Ducal Police|Luxembourg]] police during subsequent transfers and spent a lot of time in prison. He received a residence permit in France only in 1935, shortly before leaving for Spain. However, he continued to be widely published in the anarchist press in [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]], [[Switzerland]], the [[USA]] and [[Third French Republic|France]]. <ref> {{Cite web | url = http://www.anarca-bolo.ch/cbach/biografie.php? Id = 4 | title = Berneri Camillo Luigi | author = | website = anarca-bolo.ch | date = | publisher =}} </ref>\n\nDespite all his limitations, this period allowed him to read books on various topics such as [[science]], [[psychology]] and [[teleology]]. He wrote [[anti-religious]] articles and brochures as well as pieces on the [[Women's rights|emancipation of women]]. He also completed his dissertation, ''The Anti-Semitic Jew'', where he studied the forced or voluntary [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation of Jews]]. The poet [[Andre Speer]], considered this book \u201cof paramount importance\u201d. Other important writings of his during this time were ''Spying'', ''Fascist Spying Abroad'' and ''Mussolini conquering the Balearic Islands''.\n\nHe also wrote about anarchism, where he defends personal positions:\n\n{{quote|We must move away from romanticism. Look at the masses, I would say, in perspective. There are not homogeneous people, but crowds, diverse, divided into groups. There is no revolutionary will of the masses, but revolutionary moments in which the masses are a huge lever.}}\n\n{{quote|If we want to achieve a significant revision of our revolutionary power, we must get rid of ideological [[a priori]]s and conveniently postponing the solution of tactical and constructive problems for tomorrow. I mean that the biggest danger of stopping and deviating from the revolution lies in the conservative tendency of the masses.}}\n\n=== Spanish Civil War ===\n[[File: Berneri1.jpg | alt = | thumb | Camillo Berneri in 1936]]\nOnce the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, Berneri was among the first to rush to [[Revolutionary Catalonia|Catalonia]], the center of a revolution spearheaded by the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]: here he found himself alongside [[Carlo Rosselli]] with a large number of [[Anti-fascism#Italy: against Fascism and Mussolini|Italian]] and [[International Brigades|International]] anti-fascists.<ref> {{Cite web | url = https://gimenologues.org/spip.php?Article685 | title = Les Italiens - Charla sur les volontaires internationaux | author = | website = gimenologues.org | date = 2016-10-06 | publisher =}} </ref> Beyond militant solidarity, Carlo Rosselli was tied to his critical support for the prospects of [[Bolshevism]], while in those years Camillo Berneri collaborated with the clandestine organ of the libertarian socialist movement \"Giustizia e Libert\u00e0\", arguing with Rosselli on the stark differences between [[libertarian socialism]] and [[Authoritarian socialism|despotic socialism]]. Together with Rosselli, he organized the first column of Italian volunteers to fight on the [[Aragon front]], which were incorporated into the militia column of [[Joaqu\u00edn Ascaso]]. On August 28, 1936, Camillo Berneri took part in [[Battle of Monte Pelado]] near [[Huesca]]: \u201cWe defended our position with 130 people against 600, hardened and with strong weapons, for four hours of battle.\" He eventually needed to leave the front due to medical problems and returned to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhere he created and was editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''Class War'', also collaborating in the CNT-FAI radio station in Barcelona. During his stay in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bBerneri came to be under the surveillance of [[OVRA]], the secret police of fascist Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graham| first=Helen|title=The Spanish Republic at War 1936-1939 | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|page=295}}</ref>\n\nBerneri was a staunch defender of the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] and was one of the first to argue that only an [[anti-capitalist]] struggle can counter [[fascism]] and that the problem with [[anti-fascism]] is the rejection of the principles of the [[Social revolution]]. He constantly reiterates that revolution must be won on social, not military, grounds. Thus, he opposed the [[Militarism | militarization]] of the militias, which had brought the first victories against state forces. <ref> {{cite book| title = Guerre de Classes en Espagne et textes libertaires|publisher = [[Spartacus Editions]] | date = 1977}}</ref> He stood against those who advocated the idea of \u200b\u200b\u201cfirst beat [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\u201d, and stood for the close connection between the war and the social revolution: \u201cVictory in war is necessary; however, the war will not be won by limiting the problem to the purely military conditions of victory, but by linking them to the political and social conditions of victory. '' '<ref>{{Cite news|title = La R\u00e9volution et la Guerre d\u2019Espagne | last=Brou\u00e9|first=P.| url = https://www.marxists.org/francais/broue/works/1961/00/PBET_Esp_1_11.htm | website = Guerra di Classe | date = 1936-11-05}}</ref>\n\nBerneri was also very critical of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]-[[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|FAI]]'s participation in the Republican government. Berneri worried about the growing isolation of the revolutionary and libertarian achievements in [[Revolutionary Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Regional Defence Council of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Sovereign Council of Asturias and Le\u00f3n|other regions]], and fought vigorously for the close connection of war and revolution. Such is the substance of many of his articles and speeches, such as of the famous open letter to the anarchist [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Minister of Health]] [[Federica Montseny]], who with three other anarchists participated in the government of [[Largo Caballero]]: <ref>Camillo Berneri, ''[http://www.theyliewedie.org/ressources/biblio/fr/Berneri_Camillo_ -_Lettre_ouverte_a_la_camarade_Frederica_Montseny.html Lettre ouverte \u00e0 la camarade Frederica Montseny]''</ref>\n\n{{quote|The time has come to understand whether the anarchists in the government are [[vestals]] of the fire, which is about to go out, or whether they now serve only as the [[Phrygian cap]] of politicians, flirting with the enemy or with the forces of restoration of the \"republic of all classes.\" The dilemma of war or revolution no longer makes sense. The only significant dilemma is this: either victory over Franco through a revolutionary war, or defeat. <ref> Collectif, [http://kropot.free.fr/anarchie-histoire3.htm '' Barcelone, mai 1937 - la contre-r\u00e9volution '', in '' Les Anars des origines \u00e0 hier soir ''], Alternative libertaire, 1996 </ref>}}\n\nIn his 1936 book ''Thought and Battle'', Berneri gave critical comments on the situation, warning of the danger of a [[Stalinist]] coup, and marked his surprise at the \"anarchist government.\" His political suggestions for hitting the operational bases of fascism were numerous, though unheeded, such as [[Proclamation of Independence of Morocco|proclaiming the independence of Morocco]], coordinating military efforts and gradually strengthening socialization. \n\n=== Political assassination ===\n\nBerneri was soon exposing the fierce repressions carried out by Stalinists]] that had prevailed since the advent of the government of [[Juan Negr\u00edn]]: the victims of massacres and disappearances included thousands of non-communists, anarchists and also [[Anti-Stalinist left|non-Stalinist communists]], like the [[POUM]]. On May 5, 1937, Camillo Berneri and his anarchist friend [[Francesco Barbieri]] were taken out of their apartment by a dozen plainclothes men with red armbands and policemen. The corpses of the two Italian anarchists were found riddled with bullets. [[Giovanna Berneri]] raised the children of [[Antonio Cieri]], who also fell in Spain. On Camillo Berneri's death, the [[Italian Socialist Party|socialist]] leader [[Pietro Nenni]] wrote: \"If the anarchist Berneri had fallen on a barricade in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bfighting against the popular government, we would have nothing to say, and in the severity of his destiny we would find the strict law of the revolution. But Berneri was assassinated, and we must say it\".\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Anarchism in Italy]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{Cite book |last1=D'Errico |first1=Stefano |title=Anarchismo e politica: nel problemismo e nella critica all'anarchismo del ventesimo secolo, il programma minimo dei libertari del terzo millennio : rilettura antologica e biografica di Camillo Berneri |date=2007 |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-8483-527-7 |publisher=Mimesis |location=Milano |oclc=849145792 |df=mdy-all }}\n* {{Cite encyclopedia |last1=De Felice |first1=Renzo |authorlink=Renzo De Felice |title=BERNERI, Camillo Luigi |volume=9 |date=1967 |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/camillo-luigi-berneri_(Dizionario-Biografico) |language=it-IT |encyclopedia=[[Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani]] |df=mdy-all }}\n* {{Cite book |last1=De Maria |first1=Carlo |title=Camillo Berneri: tra anarchismo e liberalismo |date=2004 |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-464-6041-7 |publisher=F.

On December 11, 1928, he was expelled from France and until 1930 was constantly harassed by the [[Law enforcement in Belgium|Belgian]], [[Law enforcement in France|French]], [[Law enforcement in the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Law enforcement in Germany|German]] and [[Grand Ducal Police|Luxembourg]] police during subsequent transfers and spent a lot of time in prison. He received a residence permit in France only in 1935, shortly before leaving for Spain. However, he continued to be widely published in the anarchist press in [[Fascist Italy|Italy]], [[Switzerland]], the [[USA]] and [[Third French Republic|France]]. <ref> {{Cite web | url = http://www.anarca-bolo.ch/cbach/biografie.php? Id = 4 | title = Berneri Camillo Luigi | author = | website = anarca-bolo.ch | date = | publisher =}} </ref>\n\nDespite all his limitations, this period allowed him to read books on various topics such as [[science]], [[psychology]] and [[teleology]]. He wrote [[anti-religious]] articles and brochures as well as pieces on the [[Women's rights|emancipation of women]]. He also completed his dissertation, ''The Anti-Semitic Jew'', where he studied the forced or voluntary [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation of Jews]]. The poet [[Andre Speer]], considered this book \u201cof paramount importance\u201d. Other important writings of his during this time were ''Spying'', ''Fascist Spying Abroad'' and ''Mussolini conquering the Balearic Islands''.\n\nHe also wrote about anarchism, where he defends personal positions:\n\n{{quote|We must move away from romanticism. Look at the masses, I would say, in perspective. There are not homogeneous people, but crowds, diverse, divided into groups. There is no revolutionary will of the masses, but revolutionary moments in which the masses are a huge lever.}}\n\n{{quote|If we want to achieve a significant revision of our revolutionary power, we must get rid of ideological [[a priori]]s and conveniently postponing the solution of tactical and constructive problems for tomorrow. I mean that the biggest danger of stopping and deviating from the revolution lies in the conservative tendency of the masses.}}\n\n=== Spanish Civil War ===\n[[File: Berneri1.jpg | alt = | thumb | Camillo Berneri in 1936]]\nOnce the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, Berneri was among the first to rush to [[Revolutionary Catalonia|Catalonia]], the center of a revolution spearheaded by the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]: here he found himself alongside [[Carlo Rosselli]] with a large number of [[Anti-fascism#Italy: against Fascism and Mussolini|Italian]] and [[International Brigades|International]] anti-fascists.<ref> {{Cite web | url = https://gimenologues.org/spip.php?Article685 | title = Les Italiens - Charla sur les volontaires internationaux | author = | website = gimenologues.org | date = 2016-10-06 | publisher =}} </ref> Beyond militant solidarity, Carlo Rosselli was tied to his critical support for the prospects of [[Bolshevism]], while in those years Camillo Berneri collaborated with the clandestine organ of the libertarian socialist movement \"Giustizia e Libert\u00e0\", arguing with Rosselli on the stark differences between [[libertarian socialism]] and [[Authoritarian socialism|despotic socialism]]. Together with Rosselli, he organized the first column of Italian volunteers to fight on the [[Aragon front]], which were incorporated into the militia column of [[Joaqu\u00edn Ascaso]]. On August 28, 1936, Camillo Berneri took part in [[Battle of Monte Pelado]] near [[Huesca]]: \u201cWe defended our position with 130 people against 600, hardened and with strong weapons, for four hours of battle.\" He eventually needed to leave the front due to medical problems and returned to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhere he created and was editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''Class War'', also collaborating in the CNT-FAI radio station in Barcelona. During his stay in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bBerneri came to be under the surveillance of [[OVRA]], the secret police of fascist Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graham| first=Helen|title=The Spanish Republic at War 1936-1939 | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|page=295}}</ref>\n\nBerneri was a staunch defender of the [[Spanish Revolution]] and was one of the first to argue that only an [[anti-capitalist]] struggle can counter [[fascism]] and that the problem with [[anti-fascism]] is the rejection of the principles of the [[Social revolution]]. He constantly reiterates that revolution must be won on social, not military, grounds. Thus, he opposed the [[Militarism | militarization]] of the militias, which had brought the first victories against state forces. <ref> {{cite book| title = Guerre de Classes en Espagne et textes libertaires|publisher = [[Spartacus Editions]] | date = 1977}}</ref> He stood against those who advocated the idea of \u200b\u200b\u201cfirst beat [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\u201d, and stood for the close connection between the war and the social revolution: \u201cVictory in war is necessary; however, the war will not be won by limiting the problem to the purely military conditions of victory, but by linking them to the political and social conditions of victory. '' '<ref>{{Cite news|title = La R\u00e9volution et la Guerre d\u2019Espagne | last=Brou\u00e9|first=P.| url = https://www.marxists.org/francais/broue/works/1961/00/PBET_Esp_1_11.htm | website = Guerra di Classe | date = 1936-11-05}}</ref>\n\nBerneri was also very critical of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]-[[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|FAI]]'s participation in the Republican government. Berneri worried about the growing isolation of the revolutionary and libertarian achievements in [[Revolutionary Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Regional Defence Council of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Sovereign Council of Asturias and Le\u00f3n|other regions]], and fought vigorously for the close connection of war and revolution. Such is the substance of many of his articles and speeches, such as of the famous open letter to the anarchist [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Minister of Health]] [[Federica Montseny]], who with three other anarchists participated in the government of [[Largo Caballero]]: <ref>Camillo Berneri, ''[http://www.theyliewedie.org/ressources/biblio/fr/Berneri_Camillo_ -_Lettre_ouverte_a_la_camarade_Frederica_Montseny.html Lettre ouverte \u00e0 la camarade Frederica Montseny]''</ref>\n\n{{quote|The time has come to understand whether the anarchists in the government are [[vestals]] of the fire, which is about to go out, or whether they now serve only as the [[Phrygian cap]] of politicians, flirting with the enemy or with the forces of restoration of the \"republic of all classes.\" The dilemma of war or revolution no longer makes sense. The only significant dilemma is this: either victory over Franco through a revolutionary war, or defeat. <ref> Collectif, [http://kropot.free.fr/anarchie-histoire3.htm '' Barcelone, mai 1937 - la contre-r\u00e9volution '', in '' Les Anars des origines \u00e0 hier soir ''], Alternative libertaire, 1996 </ref>}}\n\nIn his 1936 book ''Thought and Battle'', Berneri gave critical comments on the situation, warning of the danger of a [[Stalinist]] coup, and marked his surprise at the \"anarchist government.\" His political suggestions for hitting the operational bases of fascism were numerous, though unheeded, such as [[Proclamation of Independence of Morocco|proclaiming the independence of Morocco]], coordinating military efforts and gradually strengthening socialization. \n\n=== Political assassination ===\n\nBerneri was soon exposing the fierce repressions carried out by Stalinists]] that had prevailed since the advent of the government of [[Juan Negr\u00edn]]: the victims of massacres and disappearances included thousands of non-communists, anarchists and also [[Anti-Stalinist left|non-Stalinist communists]], like the [[POUM]]. On May 5, 1937, Camillo Berneri and his anarchist friend [[Francesco Barbieri]] were taken out of their apartment by a dozen plainclothes men with red armbands and policemen. The corpses of the two Italian anarchists were found riddled with bullets. [[Giovanna Berneri]] raised the children of [[Antonio Cieri]], who also fell in Spain. On Camillo Berneri's death, the [[Italian Socialist Party|socialist]] leader [[Pietro Nenni]] wrote: \"If the anarchist Berneri had fallen on a barricade in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bfighting against the popular government, we would have nothing to say, and in the severity of his destiny we would find the strict law of the revolution.

The northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. Mississippi's highest point is [[Woodall Mountain]] at 807 feet (246 m) above sea level adjacent to the [[Cumberland Plateau]]; the lowest is the Gulf of Mexico. Mississippi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] classification.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe state's name is derived from the [[Mississippi River]], which flows along its western boundary. Settlers named it after the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word ''misi-ziibi'' (\"Great River\").\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Map of Mississippi NA.png|thumb|upright=1.35| ]]\n[[File:Wolf-River-swamp-North-Mississippi.jpg|thumb|Bottomland hardwood swamp near [[Ashland, Mississippi|Ashland]]]]\n\nMississippi is bordered to the north by [[Tennessee]], to the east by [[Alabama]], to the south by [[Louisiana]] and a narrow coast on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; and to the west, across the Mississippi River, by Louisiana and [[Arkansas]].\n\nIn addition to its namesake, major rivers in Mississippi include the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]], the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]], the [[Yazoo River]], the [[Pascagoula River]], and the [[Tombigbee River]]. Major lakes include [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]], [[Arkabutla Lake]], [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]], and [[Grenada Lake]] with the largest lake being Sardis Lake.\n\nMississippi is entirely composed of [[lowland]]s, the highest point being [[Woodall Mountain]], in the [[foothills]] of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], {{convert|807|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. The lowest point is sea level at the [[Gulf Coast]]. The state's mean elevation is {{convert|300|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\nMost of Mississippi is part of the East Gulf Coastal Plain. The [[coastal plain]] is generally composed of low hills, such as the Pine Hills in the south and the North Central Hills. The Pontotoc Ridge and the Fall Line Hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations. Yellow-brown [[loess]] soil is found in the western parts of the state. The northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Alabama Black Belt]].\n\nThe coastline includes large bays at [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]]. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico proper by the shallow [[Mississippi Sound]], which is partially sheltered by [[Petit Bois Island (Mississippi)|Petit Bois Island]], [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn Island]], [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|East and West Ship Islands]], [[Deer Island (Mississippi)|Deer Island]], [[Round Island (Mississippi)|Round Island]], and [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]].\n\nThe northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. The plain is narrow in the south and widens north of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. The region has rich soil, partly made up of [[silt]] which had been regularly deposited by the [[Flood plain|flood waters]] of the Mississippi River.\n\nAreas under the management of the [[National Park Service]] include:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ms}}</ref>\n*[[Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site]] near [[Baldwyn, Mississippi|Baldwyn]]\n*[[Gulf Islands National Seashore]]\n*[[Natchez National Historical Park]] in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]\n*[[Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail]] in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]]\n*[[Natchez Trace Parkway]]\n*[[Tupelo National Battlefield]] in Tupelo\n*[[Vicksburg National Military Park|Vicksburg National Military Park and Cemetery]] in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n\n[[File:JacksonMS Downtown Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Jackson, Mississippi]]]]\n[[File:25thAve&13thSt.jpg|thumb|Northwest view of Gulfport Harbor Square Commercial Historic District]]\n[[File:Strawberry Patch Park 2009.jpg|thumb|Strawberry Patch Park, Madison]]\n[[File:Mississippi 90.jpg|thumb|Map with all counties and their county seats|alt=]]\n\nMississippi City Population Rankings of at least 50,000 ([[United States Census Bureau]] as of 2017):<ref name=\"Annual Population Estimates\">{{cite web|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}.

Temperatures average about 81\u00b0[[Fahrenheit|F]] (about 27\u00b0[[Celsius|C]]) in July and about 42&nbsp;\u00b0F (about 9&nbsp;\u00b0C) in January. The temperature varies little statewide in the summer; however, in winter, the region near [[Mississippi Sound]] is significantly warmer than the inland portion of the state. The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from {{cvt|-19|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, in 1966, at [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]] in the northeast, to {{cvt|115|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, in 1930, at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] in the north. Heavy snowfall rarely occurs, but isn't unheard of, such as during the [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]]. Yearly [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] generally increases from north to south, with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid. Thus, [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in the northwest, gets about 50&nbsp;inches (about 1,270&nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], in the south, about 61 inches (about 1,550&nbsp;mm). Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi; snow is occasional in the southern part of the state.\n\nThe late summer and fall is the seasonal period of risk for [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico, especially in the southern part of the state. [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969 and [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, which killed 238 people in the state, were the most devastating hurricanes to hit the state. Both caused nearly total [[storm surge]] destruction of structures in and around [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]].\n\nAs in the rest of the [[Deep South]], thunderstorms are common in Mississippi, especially in the southern part of the state. On average, Mississippi has around 27 [[tornado]]es annually; the northern part of the state has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part a higher frequency later in the year. Two of the five deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history have occurred in the state. These storms struck [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], in southwest Mississippi (see [[The Great Natchez Tornado]]) and [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], in the northeast corner of the state. About seven F5 tornadoes have been recorded in the state.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \"style=text-align:center;font-size:90%;\" \n| colspan = \"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\" | Monthly normal high and low temperatures (\u00b0F) for various Mississippi cities\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; height:16px;\"| Gulfport\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 61/43\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 64/46\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 70/52\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 77/59\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 84/66\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 89/72\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 91/74\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 91/74\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 87/70\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 79/60\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 70/51\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 63/45\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; height:16px;\"| Jackson\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 55/35\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 60/38\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 68/45\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 75/52\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 89/68\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 91/71\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 91/70\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 86/65\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 77/52\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 66/43\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 58/37\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; height:16px;\"| Meridian\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 58/35\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 63/38\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 70/44\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 77/50\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 84/60\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 90/67\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 93/70\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 93/70\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 88/64\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 78/51\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 68/43\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 60/37\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; height:16px;\"| Tupelo\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 50/30\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 56/34\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 65/41\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 74/48\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 81/58\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 88/66\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 91/70\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 91/68\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 85/62\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 75/49\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 54/33\n|-\n| colspan = \"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\" | Source:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustravelweather.com/mississippi/|title=Mississippi Weather-Mississippi Weather Forecast-Mississippi Climate|website=ustravelweather.com|accessdate=September 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121155657/http://www.ustravelweather.com/mississippi/|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|}\n\n{{Weather box/concise_F\n| location=Mississippi (1980\u20132010)\n| source=USA.com<ref name=\"USA\">\n  {{cite web|title=Climatological Information for Mississippi |\n  website=USA.com |date=2003 |url=http://www.usa.com/mississippi-state-weather.htm#HistoricalTemperature}}</ref>\n| 54.3| 58.7| 67.2| 75.2| 82.6| 88.9| 91.4| 91.5| 86.3| 76.9| 66.5| 56.6 <!--highs-->\n| 33.3| 36.7| 43.8| 51.3| 60.3| 67.6| 70.6| 69.7| 63| 51.9| 43.1| 35.7 <!--lows-->\n|5.0|5.2|5.1|5.0|5.1|4.4|4.5|3.9|3.6|4.1|4.9|5.7 <!--precipitation-->\n}}\n\n===Ecology, flora, and fauna===\n\n[[File:Welcometomississippi i-20.jpg|right|thumb|Leaving Alabama on I-20/59]]\n[[File:Clark creek natural area ms.jpg|thumb|Clark Creek Natural Area, Wilkinson County]]\n\nMississippi is heavily forested, with over half of the state's area covered by wild or cultivated trees.

The river's flooding created natural levees, which planters had built higher to try to prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops. Temporary workers built [[levees]] along the Mississippi River on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded.\n\nFrom 1858 to 1861, the state took over levee building, accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor. In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work. Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land. Many of the Irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established.<ref>{{cite book|first=David R. |last=Roediger|title=The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class|location=New York|publisher=Verso|year=1999|page=146|isbn=978-1859842409}}</ref> Before the [[American Civil War]], the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height, although in some areas they reached twenty feet.\n\nFlooding has been an integral part of Mississippi history, but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply wood fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth. The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river. After the Civil War, major floods swept down the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882. Such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those constructed after the war.<ref name=\"John Otto Solomon 1999, pp.10-11\">{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880\u20131930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties.\n\nIn 1879, the [[United States Congress]] created the [[Mississippi River Commission]], whose responsibilities included aiding state levee boards in the construction of levees.

In 1884, the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee District was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern Delta counties; also included were some counties in [[Arkansas]] which were part of the Delta.<ref name=\"about the levee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leveeboard.org/about_the_levee/history/physical_development.html |title=About the levee: Physical development of a levee system |publisher=Leveeboard.org |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513142502/http://www.leveeboard.org/about_the_levee/history/physical_development.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFlooding overwhelmed northwestern Mississippi in 1912\u20131913, causing heavy damage to the levee districts. Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association's lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts, on a scale of 2:1. Although U.S. participation in [[World War I]] interrupted funding of levees, the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880\u20131930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|page=50|isbn=978-0313289637}}</ref> Scientists now understand the levees have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of the floodplains. The region was severely damaged due to the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], which broke through the levees. There were losses of millions of dollars in property, stock and crops. The most damage occurred in the lower Delta, including [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington]] and [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar]] counties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solomon|date=1999|title=The Final Frontiers|page=70}}</ref>\n\nEven as scientific knowledge about the Mississippi River has grown, upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years. Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river. Such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, strengthening the river's current. The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of Mississippi}}\n{{Wikipedia:WikiProject Mississippi/MississippiSymbols}}\n\nNear 10,000 BC [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s or [[Paleo-Indians]] arrived in what today is referred to as the [[Southern United States|American South]].<ref name=\"guy_prentice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |title=Pushmataha, Choctaw Indian Chief |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Prentice |first=Guy |year=2003 |publisher=Southeast Chronicles |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202132723/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2007 }}\n</ref> Paleo-Indians in the South were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who pursued the [[Pleistocene megafauna|megafauna]] that became extinct following the end of the [[Pleistocene]] age.

The French called the greater territory \"[[Louisiana (New France)|New France]]\"; the Spanish continued to claim part of the [[Gulf coast]] area (east of [[Mobile Bay]]) of present-day southern [[Alabama]], in addition to the entire area of present-day [[Florida]].\n[[File:Pushmataha high resolution.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Pushmataha]], Choctaw Principal Chief]]\n\nThrough the 18th century, the area was ruled variously by Spanish, French, and British colonial governments. The colonists imported African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] as laborers. Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of [[free people of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), mostly [[multiracial]] descendants of European men and enslaved or free black women, and their [[mixed-race]] children. In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men. Even as more European women joined the settlements, the men had interracial unions among women of African descent (and increasingly, multiracial descent), both before and after marriages to European women. Often the European men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settled property on them; they often freed the mothers and their children if enslaved, as part of contracts of ''[[pla\u00e7age]]''. With this [[social capital]], the free people of color became artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements, although not so large a free community as in the city of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.\n\nAfter Great Britain's victory in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]), the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. They also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country and Quebec. After the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]], the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish rule as part of [[West Florida]]. In 1819 the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all of [[East Florida]] in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], and in 1822 both were merged into the [[Florida Territory]].\n\n===United States territory===\n\n{{Main|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Organic act#List of organic acts|Mississippi Territory}}\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u201383), Britain ceded this area to the new United States of America. The [[Mississippi Territory]] was [[Territories of the United States|organized]] on April 7, 1798, from territory ceded by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to the United States. Their original colonial charters theoretically extended west to the Pacific Ocean. The Mississippi Territory was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the United States and Spain.\n\nFrom 1800 to about 1830, the United States purchased some lands ([[Treaty of Doak's Stand]]) from Native American tribes for new settlements of European Americans; they were mostly migrants from other Southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ben |last=Wynne|title=Mississippi (On-The-Road Histories)|year=2007|page=12|isbn=978-1566566667}}</ref> On September 27, 1830, the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] was signed between the U.S. Government and the [[Choctaw]]. The Choctaw agreed to sell their traditional homelands in Mississippi and Alabama, for compensation and [[Indian Removal|removal]] to reservations in [[Indian Territory]] (now Oklahoma). This opened up land for sale to [[European-American]] immigrant settlement. Article 14 in the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in the state to become U.S. citizens, as they were considered to be giving up their tribal membership. They were the second major non-European ethnic group to do so (the Cherokee were the first).<ref name=\"us_citizenship\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0310.htm#mn15 \n |title=Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties Vol. II, Treaties \n |accessdate=April 16, 2008 \n |last=Kappler \n |first=Charles \n |year=1904 \n |publisher=Government Printing Office \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517182743/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0310.htm \n |archivedate=May 17, 2008 \n |df=mdy-all \n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"david_baird\">\n{{Cite book\n| last = Baird\n| first = W.

They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for [[secession]]. Mississippi was a slave society, with the economy dependent on slavery. The state was thinly settled, with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and towns.\n\nBy 1860, the enslaved African-American population numbered 436,631 or 55% of the state's total of 791,305 persons.

The first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves. During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled for dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce. More than 80,000 Mississippians fought in the [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Civil War]], and casualties were extremely heavy. Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s long siege of [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] finally gained the Union control of the river in 1863.\n\nIn the postwar period, [[freedmen]] withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations. The majority of blacks left the Southern Baptist Church, sharply reducing its membership. They created independent black Baptist congregations. By 1895 they had established numerous black Baptist state associations and the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] of black churches.<ref name=\"campbell\"/>\n\nIn addition, independent black denominations, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (established in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in the early 19th century) and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (established in New York City), sent [[missionaries]] to the South in the postwar years. They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the South.

The convention adopted universal suffrage; did away with property qualifications for [[suffrage]] or for office, a change that also benefited both blacks and poor whites; provided for the state's first public school system; forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel.<ref name=\"dubois\">{{cite book|first=W.

After the Civil War, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land. In addition, black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and selling timber, and eventually advance to ownership. The new farmers included many freedmen, who by the late 19th century achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands. In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were [[African American]].<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/> But many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by hard, personal labor.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nDemocrats had regained control of the state legislature in 1875, after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the \"white line\" campaign, based on asserting [[white supremacy]]. Democratic whites were well armed and formed [[paramilitary]] organizations such as the [[Red Shirts (southern United States)|Red Shirts]] to suppress black voting. From 1874 to the elections of 1875, they pressured whites to join the Democrats, and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known \"riots\" in cities around the state to intimidate blacks. They killed a total of 150 blacks, although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many. A total of three white Republicans and five white Democrats were reported killed. In rural areas, deaths of blacks could be covered up. Riots (better described as massacres of blacks) took place in Vicksburg, Clinton, Macon, and in their counties, as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and [[lynching|lynched]] known black leaders, destroying local political organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wharton|first=V.

Together with imposition of [[Jim Crow]] and racial segregation laws, whites increased violence against blacks, lynching mostly men, through the period of the 1890s and extending to 1930. Cotton crops failed due to [[boll weevil]] infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans. With control of the ballot box and more access to credit, white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands.

By 1920, the third generation after freedom, most African Americans in Mississippi were landless laborers again facing poverty.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/> Starting about 1913, tens of thousands of black Americans left Mississippi for the [[Northern United States|North]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial cities such as [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City|New York]]. They sought jobs, better education for their children, the right to vote, relative freedom from discrimination, and better living. In the migration of 1910\u20131940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors.\n\nBlacks also faced violence in the form of lynching, shooting, and the burning of churches. In 1923, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] stated \"the Negro feels that life is not safe in Mississippi and his life may be taken with impunity at any time upon the slightest pretext or provocation by a white man\".<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/ref/collection/leader/id/9763|title=The Louisville Leader.

The lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as Chicago and Detroit, seeking employment, where they also competed with European immigrants. The state depended on agriculture, but mechanization put many farm laborers out of work.\n\nBy 1900, many white ministers, especially in the towns, subscribed to the [[Social Gospel]] movement, which attempted to apply Christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day.

The African-American call for social equality resonated throughout the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and [[World War II]] in the 1940s.\n\nThe [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] from the South started in the 1940s, lasting until 1970. Almost half a million people left Mississippi in the second migration, three-quarters of them black. Nationwide during the first half of the 20th century, African Americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs. The Second Great Migration included destinations in the [[Western United States|West]], especially [[California]], where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher paying jobs to both African Americans and whites.\n\nBlacks and whites in Mississippi generated rich, quintessentially American music traditions: [[gospel music]], [[country music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[rock and roll]]. All were invented, promulgated or heavily developed by Mississippi musicians, many of them African American, and most came from the [[Mississippi Delta]]. Many musicians carried their music north to Chicago, where they made it the heart of that city's jazz and blues.\n\nSo many African Americans left in the Great Migration that after the 1930s, they became a minority in Mississippi. In 1960 they made up 42% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 United States Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}, accessed March 13, 2008</ref> The whites maintained their discriminatory voter registration processes established in 1890, preventing most blacks from voting, even if they were well educated. Court challenges were not successful until later in the century. After World War II, African-American veterans returned with renewed commitment to be treated as full citizens of the United States and increasingly organized to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights.\n\nThe [[Civil Rights Movement]] had many roots in religion, and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism. Mississippi was a center of activity, based in black churches, to educate and register black voters, and to work for integration. In 1954 the state had created the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], a tax-supported agency, chaired by the Governor, that claimed to work for the state's image but effectively spied on activists and passed information to the local White Citizens' Councils to suppress black activism. [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Councils]] had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling (''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'') that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. They used intimidation and economic blackmail against activists and suspected activists, including teachers and other professionals. Techniques included loss of jobs and eviction from rental housing.\n\nIn the summer of 1964 students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters in Mississippi and establish [[Freedom Schools]]. The [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] was established to challenge the all-white Democratic Party of the [[Solid South]]. Most white politicians resisted such changes. Chapters of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its sympathizers used violence against activists, most notably the [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]] in 1964 during the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign. This was a catalyst for Congressional passage the following year of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Registration of African-American voters increased and black candidates ran in the 1967 elections for state and local offices. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party fielded some candidates.

The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of [[racial segregation]]. In the civil rights era, people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.\n\nAs the demographer [[William H. Frey]] noted, \"In Mississippi, I think it's [identifying as mixed race] changed from within.\"<ref name=\"NYTrace\"/> Historically in Mississippi, after [[Indian removal]] in the 1830s, the major groups were designated as black (African American), who were then mostly enslaved, and white (primarily European American). [[Matthew Snipp]], also a demographer, commented on the increase in the 21st century in the number of people identifying as being of more than one race: \"In a sense, they're rendering a more accurate portrait of their racial heritage that in the past would have been suppressed.\"<ref name=\"NYTrace\"/>\n\nAfter having accounted for a majority of the state's population since well before the Civil War and through the 1930s, today [[African American]]s constitute approximately 37 percent of the state's population.

African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern [[Mississippi Delta|Yazoo Delta]], and the southwestern and the central parts of the state. These are areas where, historically, African Americans owned land as farmers in the 19th century following the Civil War, or worked on cotton plantations and farms.<ref>James C.

They educated their children privately. [[Industrialization]] did not reach many areas until the late 20th century. The planter [[aristocracy]], the elite of [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] Mississippi, kept the tax structure low for their own benefit, making only private improvements. Before the war the most successful planters, such as [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] President [[Jefferson Davis]], owned riverside properties along the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers in the Mississippi Delta. Away from the riverfronts, most of the Delta was undeveloped frontier.\n\nDuring the Civil War, 30,000 Mississippi soldiers, mostly white, died from wounds and disease, and many more were left crippled and wounded. Changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the South caused severe losses in wealth. In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi had been more than $500&nbsp;million, of which $218&nbsp;million (43 percent) was estimated as the value of slaves. By 1870, total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177&nbsp;million.<ref>W. E. B. DuBois,''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860\u20131880''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p. 432</ref>\n\nPoor whites and landless former slaves suffered the most from the postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', p. 437</ref> It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', pp. 432, 434</ref>\n\nBlacks cleared land, selling timber and developing bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement for them and their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nAfter the Civil War, the state refused for years to build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the reliance on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of the [[boll weevil]] in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912\u20131913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.<ref name=\"Solomon Final Frontiers\"/>\n\nIt was not until 1884, after the flood of 1882, that the state created the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta District Levee Board and started successfully achieving longer term plans for levees in the upper Delta.<ref name=\"about the levee\"/> Despite the state's building and reinforcing levees for years, the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] broke through and caused massive flooding of {{convert|27000|sqmi|km2}} throughout the Delta, homelessness for hundreds of thousands, and millions of dollars in property damages. With the Depression coming so soon after the flood, the state suffered badly during those years. In the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], hundreds of thousands of African Americans migrated North and West for jobs and chances to live as full citizens.\n\n===Entertainment and tourism===\n\nThe legislature's 1990 decision to legalize casino gambling along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast has led to increased revenues and economic gains for the state.

The first school for black students was not established until 1862.\n\nDuring Reconstruction in 1871, black and white Republicans drafted a constitution that was the first to provide for a system of free [[public education]] in the state. The state's dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools. In the early 20th century, there were still few schools in rural areas, particularly for black children. With seed money from the [[Julius Rosenwald]] Fund, many rural black communities across Mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for their children. Essentially, many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities, in many cases donating land and/or labor to build such schools.<ref>James D.

In the majority-black Mississippi Delta counties, white parents worked through [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Councils]] to set up private [[segregation academies]], where they enrolled their children. Often funding declined for the public schools.<ref name=\"bolton178\"/>\n\nBut in the state as a whole, only a small minority of white children were withdrawn from public schools. State officials believed they needed to maintain public education to attract new businesses. After several years of integration, whites often dominated local systems anyway, maintaining white supremacy. Many black parents complained that they had little representation in school administration, and that many of their former administrators and teachers had been pushed out. They have had to work to have their interests and children represented.<ref name=\"bolton178\">Bolton, Charles C.

Mississippi musicians created new forms by combining and creating variations on musical traditions from Africa with the musical traditions of white Southerners, a tradition largely rooted in Scots\u2013Irish music.\n\nThe state is creating a [[Mississippi Blues Trail]], with dedicated markers explaining historic sites significant to the history of blues music, such as [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]]'s Riverside Hotel, where [[Bessie Smith]] died after her auto accident on [[U.S. Route 61|Highway 61]]. The Riverside Hotel is just one of many historical blues sites in Clarksdale. The [[Delta Blues Museum]] there is visited by tourists from all over the world. Close by is \"Ground Zero\", a contemporary blues club and restaurant co-owned by actor [[Morgan Freeman]].\n\n[[Elvis Presley]], who created a sensation in the 1950s as a crossover artist and contributed to rock 'n' roll, was a native of [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]].

Mississippi is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|32nd largest]] and [[List of U.S. states by population|34th-most populous]] of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|50 United States]]. Mississippi is bordered to the north by [[Tennessee]], to the east by [[Alabama]], to the south by the [[Gulf of Mexico]], to the southwest by [[Louisiana]], and to the northwest by [[Arkansas]]. Mississippi's western boundary is largely defined by the [[Mississippi River]]. [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] is both the state's [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] and largest city. [[Jackson metropolitan area, Mississippi|Greater Jackson]], with an estimated population of 580,166 in 2018, is the most populous [[Metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan area]] in Mississippi and the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|95th-most populous]] in the United States.\n\nOn December 10, 1817, Mississippi became the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|20th state]] admitted to the Union. By 1860, Mississippi was the nation's top [[cotton]] producing state and [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved persons]] accounted for 55% of the state population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/161/cotton-in-a-global-economy-mississippi-1800-1860|title=Cotton in a Global Economy: Mississippi (1800-1860) {{!}} Mississippi History Now|website=mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> Mississippi declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the Union on March 23, 1861, and was one of the seven original [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]].

The northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. Mississippi's highest point is [[Woodall Mountain]] at 807 feet (246 m) above sea level adjacent to the [[Cumberland Plateau]]; the lowest is the Gulf of Mexico. Mississippi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] classification.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe state's name is derived from the [[Mississippi River]], which flows along its western boundary. Settlers named it after the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word ''misi-ziibi'' (\"Great River\").\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Map of Mississippi NA.png|thumb|upright=1.35| ]]\n[[File:Wolf-River-swamp-North-Mississippi.jpg|thumb|Bottomland hardwood swamp near [[Ashland, Mississippi|Ashland]]]]\n\nMississippi is bordered to the north by [[Tennessee]], to the east by [[Alabama]], to the south by [[Louisiana]] and a narrow coast on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; and to the west, across the Mississippi River, by Louisiana and [[Arkansas]].\n\nIn addition to its namesake, major rivers in Mississippi include the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]], the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]], the [[Yazoo River]], the [[Pascagoula River]], and the [[Tombigbee River]]. Major lakes include [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]], [[Arkabutla Lake]], [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]], and [[Grenada Lake]] with the largest lake being Sardis Lake.\n\nMississippi is entirely composed of [[lowland]]s, the highest point being [[Woodall Mountain]], in the [[foothills]] of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], {{convert|807|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. The lowest point is sea level at the [[Gulf Coast]]. The state's mean elevation is {{convert|300|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\nMost of Mississippi is part of the East Gulf Coastal Plain. The [[coastal plain]] is generally composed of low hills, such as the Pine Hills in the south and the North Central Hills. The Pontotoc Ridge and the Fall Line Hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations. Yellow-brown [[loess]] soil is found in the western parts of the state. The northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Alabama Black Belt]].\n\nThe coastline includes large bays at [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]]. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico proper by the shallow [[Mississippi Sound]], which is partially sheltered by [[Petit Bois Island (Mississippi)|Petit Bois Island]], [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn Island]], [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|East and West Ship Islands]], [[Deer Island (Mississippi)|Deer Island]], [[Round Island (Mississippi)|Round Island]], and [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]].\n\nThe northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. The plain is narrow in the south and widens north of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. The region has rich soil, partly made up of [[silt]] which had been regularly deposited by the [[Flood plain|flood waters]] of the Mississippi River.\n\nAreas under the management of the [[National Park Service]] include:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ms}}</ref>\n*[[Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site]] near [[Baldwyn, Mississippi|Baldwyn]]\n*[[Gulf Islands National Seashore]]\n*[[Natchez National Historical Park]] in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]\n*[[Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail]] in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]]\n*[[Natchez Trace Parkway]]\n*[[Tupelo National Battlefield]] in Tupelo\n*[[Vicksburg National Military Park|Vicksburg National Military Park and Cemetery]] in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n\n[[File:JacksonMS Downtown Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Jackson, Mississippi]]]]\n[[File:25thAve&13thSt.jpg|thumb|Northwest view of Gulfport Harbor Square Commercial Historic District]]\n[[File:Strawberry Patch Park 2009.jpg|thumb|Strawberry Patch Park, Madison]]\n[[File:Mississippi 90.jpg|thumb|Map with all counties and their county seats|alt=]]\n\nMississippi City Population Rankings of at least 50,000 ([[United States Census Bureau]] as of 2017):<ref name=\"Annual Population Estimates\">{{cite web|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}.

Temperatures average about 81\u00b0[[Fahrenheit|F]] (about 27\u00b0[[Celsius|C]]) in July and about 42&nbsp;\u00b0F (about 9&nbsp;\u00b0C) in January. The temperature varies little statewide in the summer; however, in winter, the region near [[Mississippi Sound]] is significantly warmer than the inland portion of the state. The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from {{cvt|-19|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, in 1966, at [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]] in the northeast, to {{cvt|115|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, in 1930, at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] in the north. Heavy snowfall rarely occurs, but isn't unheard of, such as during the [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]]. Yearly [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] generally increases from north to south, with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid. Thus, [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in the northwest, gets about 50&nbsp;inches (about 1,270&nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], in the south, about 61 inches (about 1,550&nbsp;mm). Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi; snow is occasional in the southern part of the state.\n\nThe late summer and fall is the seasonal period of risk for [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico, especially in the southern part of the state. [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969 and [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, which killed 238 people in the state, were the most devastating hurricanes to hit the state. Both caused nearly total [[storm surge]] destruction of structures in and around [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]].\n\nAs in the rest of the [[Deep South]], thunderstorms are common in Mississippi, especially in the southern part of the state. On average, Mississippi has around 27 [[tornado]]es annually; the northern part of the state has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part a higher frequency later in the year.

The river's flooding created natural levees, which planters had built higher to try to prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops. Temporary workers built [[levees]] along the Mississippi River on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded.\n\nFrom 1858 to 1861, the state took over levee building, accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor. In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work. Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land. Many of the Irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established.<ref>{{cite book|first=David R. |last=Roediger|title=The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class|location=New York|publisher=Verso|year=1999|page=146|isbn=978-1859842409}}</ref> Before the [[American Civil War]], the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height, although in some areas they reached twenty feet.\n\nFlooding has been an integral part of Mississippi history, but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply wood fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth. The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river. After the Civil War, major floods swept down the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882. Such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those constructed after the war.<ref name=\"John Otto Solomon 1999, pp.10-11\">{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880\u20131930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties.\n\nIn 1879, the [[United States Congress]] created the [[Mississippi River Commission]], whose responsibilities included aiding state levee boards in the construction of levees. Both white and black transient workers were hired to build the levees in the late 19th century. By 1882, levees averaged seven feet in height, but many in the southern Delta were severely tested by the flood that year.<ref name=\"John Otto Solomon 1999, pp.10-11\"/> After the 1882 flood, the levee system was expanded. In 1884, the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee District was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern Delta counties; also included were some counties in [[Arkansas]] which were part of the Delta.<ref name=\"about the levee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leveeboard.org/about_the_levee/history/physical_development.html |title=About the levee: Physical development of a levee system |publisher=Leveeboard.org |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513142502/http://www.leveeboard.org/about_the_levee/history/physical_development.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFlooding overwhelmed northwestern Mississippi in 1912\u20131913, causing heavy damage to the levee districts. Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association's lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts, on a scale of 2:1. Although U.S. participation in [[World War I]] interrupted funding of levees, the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880\u20131930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|page=50|isbn=978-0313289637}}</ref> Scientists now understand the levees have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of the floodplains. The region was severely damaged due to the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], which broke through the levees. There were losses of millions of dollars in property, stock and crops. The most damage occurred in the lower Delta, including [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington]] and [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar]] counties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solomon|date=1999|title=The Final Frontiers|page=70}}</ref>\n\nEven as scientific knowledge about the Mississippi River has grown, upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years. Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river. Such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, strengthening the river's current. The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of Mississippi}}\n{{Wikipedia:WikiProject Mississippi/MississippiSymbols}}\n\nNear 10,000 BC [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s or [[Paleo-Indians]] arrived in what today is referred to as the [[Southern United States|American South]].<ref name=\"guy_prentice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |title=Pushmataha, Choctaw Indian Chief |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Prentice |first=Guy |year=2003 |publisher=Southeast Chronicles |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202132723/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2007 }}\n</ref> Paleo-Indians in the South were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who pursued the [[Pleistocene megafauna|megafauna]] that became extinct following the end of the [[Pleistocene]] age.

Both were [[Mound builder (people)|mound builder]] cultures. Those of the [[Mississippian culture]] were the largest and most complex, constructed beginning about 950&nbsp;AD. The peoples had a trading network spanning the continent from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. Their large earthworks, which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts, still stand throughout the [[Mississippi River Valley|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River Valley|Ohio River]] valleys.\n[[File:Choctaw Village by Francois Bernard.jpg|thumb|''Choctaw Village near the Chefuncte'', by Francois Bernard, 1869, Peabody Museum\u2014Harvard University.

Other tribes who inhabited the territory of Mississippi (and whose names were honored by colonists in local towns) include the [[Natchez people|Natchez]], the [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]], and the [[Biloxi people|Biloxi]].\n\nThe first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]], who passed through the northeast part of the state in 1540, in his second expedition to the New World.\n\n===Colonial era===\n\n{{Main|New France|Louisiana (New France)|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|New Spain|West Florida|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)|Spanish West Florida}}\n\nIn April 1699, French colonists established the first European settlement at ''[[Fort Maurepas]]'' (also known as Old Biloxi), built in the vicinity of present-day [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]] on the Gulf Coast. It was settled by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]]. In 1716, the French founded [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on the Mississippi River (as ''[[Fort Rosalie]]''); it became the dominant town and trading post of the area. The French called the greater territory \"[[Louisiana (New France)|New France]]\"; the Spanish continued to claim part of the [[Gulf coast]] area (east of [[Mobile Bay]]) of present-day southern [[Alabama]], in addition to the entire area of present-day [[Florida]].\n[[File:Pushmataha high resolution.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Pushmataha]], Choctaw Principal Chief]]\n\nThrough the 18th century, the area was ruled variously by Spanish, French, and British colonial governments. The colonists imported African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] as laborers. Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of [[free people of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), mostly [[multiracial]] descendants of European men and enslaved or free black women, and their [[mixed-race]] children. In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men. Even as more European women joined the settlements, the men had interracial unions among women of African descent (and increasingly, multiracial descent), both before and after marriages to European women. Often the European men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settled property on them; they often freed the mothers and their children if enslaved, as part of contracts of ''[[pla\u00e7age]]''. With this [[social capital]], the free people of color became artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements, although not so large a free community as in the city of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.\n\nAfter Great Britain's victory in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]), the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. They also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country and Quebec. After the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]], the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish rule as part of [[West Florida]]. In 1819 the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all of [[East Florida]] in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], and in 1822 both were merged into the [[Florida Territory]].\n\n===United States territory===\n\n{{Main|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Organic act#List of organic acts|Mississippi Territory}}\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u201383), Britain ceded this area to the new United States of America. The [[Mississippi Territory]] was [[Territories of the United States|organized]] on April 7, 1798, from territory ceded by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to the United States. Their original colonial charters theoretically extended west to the Pacific Ocean. The Mississippi Territory was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the United States and Spain.\n\nFrom 1800 to about 1830, the United States purchased some lands ([[Treaty of Doak's Stand]]) from Native American tribes for new settlements of European Americans; they were mostly migrants from other Southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ben |last=Wynne|title=Mississippi (On-The-Road Histories)|year=2007|page=12|isbn=978-1566566667}}</ref> On September 27, 1830, the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] was signed between the U.S. Government and the [[Choctaw]].

This opened up land for sale to [[European-American]] immigrant settlement. Article 14 in the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in the state to become U.S. citizens, as they were considered to be giving up their tribal membership.

The forced migration of the Choctaw, together with other southeastern tribes removed as a result of the Act, became known as the [[Trail of Tears]].\n\nWhen [[King Cotton|cotton was king]] during the 1850s, Mississippi plantation owners\u2014especially those of the Delta and Black Belt central regions\u2014became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market, and free labor gained through their holding enslaved African Americans. They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for [[secession]]. Mississippi was a slave society, with the economy dependent on slavery. The state was thinly settled, with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and towns.\n\nBy 1860, the enslaved African-American population numbered 436,631 or 55% of the state's total of 791,305 persons.

The first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves. During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled for dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce. More than 80,000 Mississippians fought in the [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Civil War]], and casualties were extremely heavy. Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s long siege of [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] finally gained the Union control of the river in 1863.\n\nIn the postwar period, [[freedmen]] withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations. The majority of blacks left the Southern Baptist Church, sharply reducing its membership. They created independent black Baptist congregations. By 1895 they had established numerous black Baptist state associations and the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] of black churches.<ref name=\"campbell\"/>\n\nIn addition, independent black denominations, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (established in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in the early 19th century) and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (established in New York City), sent [[missionaries]] to the South in the postwar years. They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the South.

Some among the black delegates were [[freedmen]], but others were educated free blacks who had migrated from the North. The convention adopted universal suffrage; did away with property qualifications for [[suffrage]] or for office, a change that also benefited both blacks and poor whites; provided for the state's first public school system; forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel.<ref name=\"dubois\">{{cite book|first=W.

After the Civil War, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land. In addition, black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and selling timber, and eventually advance to ownership. The new farmers included many freedmen, who by the late 19th century achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands. In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were [[African American]].<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/> But many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by hard, personal labor.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nDemocrats had regained control of the state legislature in 1875, after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the \"white line\" campaign, based on asserting [[white supremacy]]. Democratic whites were well armed and formed [[paramilitary]] organizations such as the [[Red Shirts (southern United States)|Red Shirts]] to suppress black voting. From 1874 to the elections of 1875, they pressured whites to join the Democrats, and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known \"riots\" in cities around the state to intimidate blacks. They killed a total of 150 blacks, although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many. A total of three white Republicans and five white Democrats were reported killed. In rural areas, deaths of blacks could be covered up. Riots (better described as massacres of blacks) took place in Vicksburg, Clinton, Macon, and in their counties, as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and [[lynching|lynched]] known black leaders, destroying local political organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wharton|first=V.

Together with imposition of [[Jim Crow]] and racial segregation laws, whites increased violence against blacks, lynching mostly men, through the period of the 1890s and extending to 1930. Cotton crops failed due to [[boll weevil]] infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans. With control of the ballot box and more access to credit, white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands. They also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n[[File:All these children.jpg|thumb|Child workers, [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]], 1911, by [[Lewis Hine]]]]\n\n===20th century to present===\n\nIn 1900, blacks made up more than half of the state's population. By 1910, a majority of black farmers in the Delta had lost their land and become [[sharecropper]]s. By 1920, the third generation after freedom, most African Americans in Mississippi were landless laborers again facing poverty.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/> Starting about 1913, tens of thousands of black Americans left Mississippi for the [[Northern United States|North]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial cities such as [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City|New York]]. They sought jobs, better education for their children, the right to vote, relative freedom from discrimination, and better living. In the migration of 1910\u20131940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors.\n\nBlacks also faced violence in the form of lynching, shooting, and the burning of churches. In 1923, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] stated \"the Negro feels that life is not safe in Mississippi and his life may be taken with impunity at any time upon the slightest pretext or provocation by a white man\".<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/ref/collection/leader/id/9763|title=The Louisville Leader.

The lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as Chicago and Detroit, seeking employment, where they also competed with European immigrants. The state depended on agriculture, but mechanization put many farm laborers out of work.\n\nBy 1900, many white ministers, especially in the towns, subscribed to the [[Social Gospel]] movement, which attempted to apply Christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day.

The African-American call for social equality resonated throughout the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and [[World War II]] in the 1940s.\n\nThe [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] from the South started in the 1940s, lasting until 1970. Almost half a million people left Mississippi in the second migration, three-quarters of them black. Nationwide during the first half of the 20th century, African Americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs. The Second Great Migration included destinations in the [[Western United States|West]], especially [[California]], where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher paying jobs to both African Americans and whites.\n\nBlacks and whites in Mississippi generated rich, quintessentially American music traditions: [[gospel music]], [[country music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[rock and roll]]. All were invented, promulgated or heavily developed by Mississippi musicians, many of them African American, and most came from the [[Mississippi Delta]]. Many musicians carried their music north to Chicago, where they made it the heart of that city's jazz and blues.\n\nSo many African Americans left in the Great Migration that after the 1930s, they became a minority in Mississippi. In 1960 they made up 42% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 United States Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}, accessed March 13, 2008</ref> The whites maintained their discriminatory voter registration processes established in 1890, preventing most blacks from voting, even if they were well educated. Court challenges were not successful until later in the century. After World War II, African-American veterans returned with renewed commitment to be treated as full citizens of the United States and increasingly organized to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights.\n\nThe [[Civil Rights Movement]] had many roots in religion, and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism. Mississippi was a center of activity, based in black churches, to educate and register black voters, and to work for integration. In 1954 the state had created the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], a tax-supported agency, chaired by the Governor, that claimed to work for the state's image but effectively spied on activists and passed information to the local White Citizens' Councils to suppress black activism. [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Councils]] had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling (''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'') that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. They used intimidation and economic blackmail against activists and suspected activists, including teachers and other professionals. Techniques included loss of jobs and eviction from rental housing.\n\nIn the summer of 1964 students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters in Mississippi and establish [[Freedom Schools]]. The [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] was established to challenge the all-white Democratic Party of the [[Solid South]]. Most white politicians resisted such changes. Chapters of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its sympathizers used violence against activists, most notably the [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]] in 1964 during the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign. This was a catalyst for Congressional passage the following year of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Registration of African-American voters increased and black candidates ran in the 1967 elections for state and local offices. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party fielded some candidates.

The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of [[racial segregation]]. In the civil rights era, people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.\n\nAs the demographer [[William H. Frey]] noted, \"In Mississippi, I think it's [identifying as mixed race] changed from within.\"<ref name=\"NYTrace\"/> Historically in Mississippi, after [[Indian removal]] in the 1830s, the major groups were designated as black (African American), who were then mostly enslaved, and white (primarily European American). [[Matthew Snipp]], also a demographer, commented on the increase in the 21st century in the number of people identifying as being of more than one race: \"In a sense, they're rendering a more accurate portrait of their racial heritage that in the past would have been suppressed.\"<ref name=\"NYTrace\"/>\n\nAfter having accounted for a majority of the state's population since well before the Civil War and through the 1930s, today [[African American]]s constitute approximately 37 percent of the state's population.

African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern [[Mississippi Delta|Yazoo Delta]], and the southwestern and the central parts of the state. These are areas where, historically, African Americans owned land as farmers in the 19th century following the Civil War, or worked on cotton plantations and farms.<ref>James C.

They educated their children privately. [[Industrialization]] did not reach many areas until the late 20th century. The planter [[aristocracy]], the elite of [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] Mississippi, kept the tax structure low for their own benefit, making only private improvements. Before the war the most successful planters, such as [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] President [[Jefferson Davis]], owned riverside properties along the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers in the Mississippi Delta. Away from the riverfronts, most of the Delta was undeveloped frontier.\n\nDuring the Civil War, 30,000 Mississippi soldiers, mostly white, died from wounds and disease, and many more were left crippled and wounded. Changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the South caused severe losses in wealth. In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi had been more than $500&nbsp;million, of which $218&nbsp;million (43 percent) was estimated as the value of slaves. By 1870, total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177&nbsp;million.<ref>W. E. B. DuBois,''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860\u20131880''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p. 432</ref>\n\nPoor whites and landless former slaves suffered the most from the postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', p. 437</ref> It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', pp. 432, 434</ref>\n\nBlacks cleared land, selling timber and developing bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement for them and their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nAfter the Civil War, the state refused for years to build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the reliance on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of the [[boll weevil]] in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912\u20131913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.<ref name=\"Solomon Final Frontiers\"/>\n\nIt was not until 1884, after the flood of 1882, that the state created the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta District Levee Board and started successfully achieving longer term plans for levees in the upper Delta.<ref name=\"about the levee\"/> Despite the state's building and reinforcing levees for years, the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] broke through and caused massive flooding of {{convert|27000|sqmi|km2}} throughout the Delta, homelessness for hundreds of thousands, and millions of dollars in property damages. With the Depression coming so soon after the flood, the state suffered badly during those years. In the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], hundreds of thousands of African Americans migrated North and West for jobs and chances to live as full citizens.\n\n===Entertainment and tourism===\n\nThe legislature's 1990 decision to legalize casino gambling along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast has led to increased revenues and economic gains for the state.

The first school for black students was not established until 1862.\n\nDuring Reconstruction in 1871, black and white Republicans drafted a constitution that was the first to provide for a system of free [[public education]] in the state. The state's dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools. In the early 20th century, there were still few schools in rural areas, particularly for black children. With seed money from the [[Julius Rosenwald]] Fund, many rural black communities across Mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for their children. Essentially, many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities, in many cases donating land and/or labor to build such schools.<ref>James D.

In the majority-black Mississippi Delta counties, white parents worked through [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Councils]] to set up private [[segregation academies]], where they enrolled their children. Often funding declined for the public schools.<ref name=\"bolton178\"/>\n\nBut in the state as a whole, only a small minority of white children were withdrawn from public schools. State officials believed they needed to maintain public education to attract new businesses. After several years of integration, whites often dominated local systems anyway, maintaining white supremacy. Many black parents complained that they had little representation in school administration, and that many of their former administrators and teachers had been pushed out. They have had to work to have their interests and children represented.<ref name=\"bolton178\">Bolton, Charles C.
