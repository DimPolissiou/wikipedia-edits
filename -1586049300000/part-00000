Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011\u20132012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines |year=2010}}</ref> In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11216/1164959-57-0.stm |title=Law could restrict school construction projects |author=Kaitlynn Riely |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0330&pn=1459 |author1=Pennsylvania General Assembly |title=SB330 of 2011 |date=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |title=Property tax reform final piece of state budget |author=Eric Boehm |work=PA Independent |date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704192251/http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the School District 2006\u20132007 through 2011\u20132012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for 2006\u20132007 through 2010\u20132011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n*2006\u201307 - 5.3%, Base 3.9%\t\n*2007\u201308 - 4.6%, Base 3.4%\t\n*2008\u201309 - 6.0%, Base 4.4%\t\n*2009\u201310 - 5.6%, Base 4.1%\t\n*2010\u201311 - 4.0%, Base 2.9%\t\n*2011\u201312 - 1.9%, Base 1.4%\n*2012\u201313 - 2.3%, Base 1.7%<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012\u20132013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012</ref>\n\nFor the 2012\u201313 budget year, Upper Darby School Board applied for 2 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special education costs and teacher pension costs.

Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes.

Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011\u20132012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines |year=2010}}</ref> In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11216/1164959-57-0.stm |title=Law could restrict school construction projects |author=Kaitlynn Riely |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0330&pn=1459 |author1=Pennsylvania General Assembly |title=SB330 of 2011 |date=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |title=Property tax reform final piece of state budget |author=Eric Boehm |work=PA Independent |date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704192251/http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the School District 2006\u20132007 through 2011\u20132012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for 2006\u20132007 through 2010\u20132011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n*2006\u201307 - 5.3%, Base 3.9%\t\n*2007\u201308 - 4.6%, Base 3.4%\t\n*2008\u201309 - 6.0%, Base 4.4%\t\n*2009\u201310 - 5.6%, Base 4.1%\t\n*2010\u201311 - 4.0%, Base 2.9%\t\n*2011\u201312 - 1.9%, Base 1.4%\n*2012\u201313 - 2.3%, Base 1.7%<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012\u20132013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012</ref>\n\nFor the 2012\u201313 budget year, Upper Darby School Board applied for 2 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special education costs and teacher pension costs.

Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.

His father was appointed as the president of No. 1 Middle School of [[Duyun]] where he met Ren Zhengfei's mother Cheng Yuanzhao, the elder Ren became a member of the Communist Party in 1958. His mother was a senior teacher at the No. 1 Middle School of Duyun. Ren has five younger sisters and one younger brother.{{sfnb|Li Hongwen|2019|p=2}}\n\nIn the 1960s, after he received his engineering degree, Ren Zhengfei began his career as a civil engineer. But job prospects proved precarious in a China shaken by the turmoil of the [[Cultural_Revolution|Cultural Revolution]]. He joined the ranks of the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) in 1974 to work on a project making [[Synthetic_fiber|synthetic fiber]]  in Liao Yang. He said no one wanted to work in this poor and remote area of central China, and the Chinese government was forced to send the army to complete this project by recruiting those who agreed to help build new plant. Thus, Ren Zhengfei found a career in the military, which he called \u201cfortuitous.\u201d The modest engineer found success and he rose to the rank of deputy director. As a reward, he was invited to the National Science Conference in 1978 as a delegate of the PLA and he attended the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party in 1982.\n\nIn 1983, a turning point in his engineering career forced him to shift to entrepreneurship. His entire engineering corps was disbanded by the Chinese government and he left the army after a remarkable rise.

After 1949, his father was appointed as the president of No. 1 Middle School of [[Duyun]] where he met Ren Zhengfei's mother Cheng Yuanzhao, the elder Ren became a member of the Communist Party in 1958. His mother was a senior teacher at the No. 1 Middle School of Duyun. Ren has five younger sisters and one younger brother.{{sfnb|Li Hongwen|2019|p=2}}\n\nIn the 1960s, after he received his engineering degree, Ren Zhengfei began his career as a civil engineer. But job prospects proved precarious in a China shaken by the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. He joined the ranks of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) in 1974 to work on a project making synthetic fiber in Liao Yang. He said no one wanted to work in this poor and remote area of central China, and the Chinese government was forced to send the army to complete this project by recruiting those who agreed to help build new plant. Thus, Ren Zhengfei found a career in the military, which he called \u201cfortuitous.\u201d The modest engineer found success and he rose to the rank of deputy director. As a reward, he was invited to the National Science Conference in 1978 as a delegate of the PLA and he attended the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party in 1982.\n\nIn 1983, a turning point in his engineering career forced him to shift to entrepreneurship. His entire engineering corps was disbanded by the Chinese government and he left the army after a remarkable rise. But he had only a modest pension and was forced to work for the logistics department of the Shenzhen South Sea Oil Corporation.

[[Highway]]s are generally organized by a [[route number]] or letter. These designations are generally displayed along the route by means of a [[highway shield]]. Each system has its own unique shield design that will allow quick identification to which system the route belongs. Below is a list of the different highway shields used throughout the [[United States]].\n\n==Interstate Highways==\n{{main|Interstate Highway System}}\n{{multiple image|background color=white|image_style=border-color:white\n|title=\n|align=right\n|total_width=338\n|caption_align=center\n|width1=600|height1=600|image1=I-90.svg|alt1=Interstate 90 route marker|caption1=Standard Interstate\n|width2=750|height2=600|image2=I-476.svg|alt2=Interstate 476 route marker|caption2=Standard Interstate, wide\n|width3=620|height3=600|image3=I-80 (IA).svg|alt3=Interstate 80 (Iowa) route marker|caption3=California- and Iowa-style Interstate\n|width4=600|height4=600|image4=Business Loop 19.svg|alt4=Business Loop 19 route marker|caption4=Business Loop\n|width5=600|height5=600|image5=Business Spur 44.svg|alt5=Business Spur 44 route marker|caption5=Business Spur\n}}\n\nThe Interstate Highway System is a federally funded and administered (but state-maintained) system of [[freeway]]s that forms the transportation backbone of the U.S., with millions of Americans relying on it for commutes, long-distance travel, and freight transport daily.  Interstate highways are all constructed to [[Interstate Highway standards|precise standards]], designed to maximize high-speed travel safety and efficiency.  Interstate Highways also contain auxiliary routes, which are normally assigned a three-digit route number.  All Interstate Highways are part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], a network of highways deemed essential to the defense, economy, and mobility of the country.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==U.S. Highways==\n{{main|United States Numbered Highway System|Special route}}\n{{multiple image|background color=white|image_style=border-color:white\n|title=\n|align=right\n|total_width=338\n|caption_align=center\n|width1=600|height1=600|image1=US 20.svg|alt1=U.S. Highway 20 route marker|caption1=<small>Standard U.S. Highway</small>\n|width2=750|height2=600|image2=US 287.svg|alt2=U.S. Highway 287 route marker|caption2=<small>Standard U.S. Highway, wide</small>\n|width3=600|height3=600|image3=US 6 (CA).svg|alt3=U.S. Highway 6 route marker|caption3=<small>California-style U.S. Highway</small>\n|width4=600|height4=600|image4=US 81 (1961).svg|alt4=U.S. Highway 81 historic route marker|caption4=<small>1961-era U.S. Highway</small>\n|width5=600|height5=600|image5=US 27 Michigan 1948.svg|alt5=U.S. Highway 27 historic route marker|caption5=<small>1948-era U.S. Highway</small>\n|width6=600|height6=600|image6=US 66 Arizona 1926.svg|alt6=U.S. Highway 66 historic route marker|caption6=<small>1926-era U.S. Highway</small>\n}}\n\nThe United States Numbered Highway System is an older system consisting mostly of surface-level trunk roads, coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] and maintained by state and local governments. U.S. Highways have been relegated to regional and intrastate traffic, as they have been largely supplanted by the Interstate system for long-distance travel except in areas (especially in the west) where the Interstate system is absent or underdeveloped. This has led to the decommissioning and truncation of U.S. Highways that were formerly vital long-haul routes, such as [[U.S. Route 21]] and [[U.S. Route 66]].\n{{clear right}}\n\n==State

system. State highways are of varying standards, capacity, and quality. Some state highways become so heavily traveled they are built to Interstate Highway standards. Others are more lightly traveled and have low capacity.\n\nMany state highway markers are designed to suggest the geographic shape of the state or some other state symbol such as its flag. Most of the others are generically rectangular or some other neutral shape. The default design for state highway markers is the [[circular highway shield]], which is how state highways are designated on most maps and atlases. Currently, five states\u2014[[Delaware]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], and [[New Jersey]]\u2014use the circular shield for road signage on their state highways.<ref>{{cite book |title= [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] |chapter-url= http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2d.htm#section2D11 |chapter= Section 2D.11 Design of Route Signs |author= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |year= 2009 |edition= 2009 2nd revised |location= Washington, DC |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |quote= Guidance: State Route signs...should be rectangular and should be approximately the same size as the U.S. Route sign....The shape of the white area should be circular in the absence of any determination to the contrary by the individual State concerned. }}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n===Federal district and territory highways===\n{{multiple image\n| background color = white\n| image_style = border-color:white\n| title = Federal district and territory highway shields\n| align = right\n| total_width = 338\n| caption_align = center\n| width1 = 600\n| height1 = 600\n| image1 = American Samoa Highway 001.svg\n| alt1 = American Samoa route marker\n| caption1 = [[List of highways in American Samoa|American Samoa]]\n| width2 = 600\n| height2 = 750\n| image2 = DC-295.svg\n| alt2 = District of Columbia route marker\n| caption2 = [[List of numbered highways in Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]\n| width3 = 1046\n| height3 = 1716\n| image3 = Guam route marker 1.svg\n| alt3 = Guam route marker\n| caption3 = [[List of highways in Guam|Guam]]\n| width4 = 600\n| height4 = 600\n| image4 = Northern Mariana Islands 30.svg\n| alt4 = Northern Mariana Islands route marker\n| caption4 = [[List of numbered highways in the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Marianas]]\n| width5 = 600\n| height5 = 600\n| image5 = PR primary 1.svg\n| alt5 = Puerto Rico route marker\n| caption5 = [[List of highways in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] Primary\n| width6 = 600\n| height6 = 600\n| image6 = Circle sign 10.svg\n| alt6 = U.S. Virgin Islands route marker\n| caption6 = [[List of United States Virgin Islands highways|Virgin Islands]]\n| direction = \n}}\n\nThere are also numbered highways in the [[District of Columbia]] and [[Territories of the United States|territories]].

Interstate highways are all constructed to [[Interstate Highway standards|precise standards]], designed to maximize high-speed travel safety and efficiency.  Interstate Highways also contain auxiliary routes, which are normally assigned a three-digit route number.

U.S. Highways have been relegated to regional and intrastate traffic, as they have been largely supplanted by the Interstate system for long-distance travel except in areas (especially in the west) where the Interstate system is absent or underdeveloped. This has led to the decommissioning and truncation of U.S. Highways that were formerly vital long-haul routes, such as [[U.S. Route 21]] and [[U.S. Route 66]].\n{{clear right}}\n\n==State

system. State highways are of varying standards, capacity, and quality. Some state highways become so heavily traveled they are built to Interstate Highway standards. Others are more lightly traveled and have low capacity.\n\nMany state highway markers are designed to suggest the geographic shape of the state or some other state symbol such as its flag. Most of the others are generically rectangular or some other neutral shape. The default design for state highway markers is the [[circular highway shield]], which is how state highways are designated on most maps and atlases. Currently, five states\u2014[[Delaware]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], and [[New Jersey]]\u2014use the circular shield for road signage on their state highways.<ref>{{cite book |title= [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] |chapter-url= http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2d.htm#section2D11 |chapter= Section 2D.11 Design of Route Signs |author= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |year= 2009 |edition= 2009 2nd revised |location= Washington, DC |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |quote= Guidance: State Route signs...should be rectangular and should be approximately the same size as the U.S. Route sign....The shape of the white area should be circular in the absence of any determination to the contrary by the individual State concerned. }}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n===Federal district and territory highways===\n{{multiple image\n| background color = white\n| image_style = border-color:white\n| title = Federal district and territory highway shields\n| align = right\n| total_width = 338\n| caption_align = center\n| width1 = 600\n| height1 = 600\n| image1 = American Samoa Highway 001.svg\n| alt1 = American Samoa route marker\n| caption1 = [[List of highways in American Samoa|American Samoa]]\n| width2 = 600\n| height2 = 750\n| image2 = DC-295.svg\n| alt2 = District of Columbia route marker\n| caption2 = [[List of numbered highways in Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]\n| width3 = 1046\n| height3 = 1716\n| image3 = Guam route marker 1.svg\n| alt3 = Guam route marker\n| caption3 = [[List of highways in Guam|Guam]]\n| width4 = 600\n| height4 = 600\n| image4 = Northern Mariana Islands 30.svg\n| alt4 = Northern Mariana Islands route marker\n| caption4 = [[List of numbered highways in the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Marianas]]\n| width5 = 600\n| height5 = 600\n| image5 = PR primary 1.svg\n| alt5 = Puerto Rico route marker\n| caption5 = [[List of highways in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] Primary\n| width6 = 600\n| height6 = 600\n| image6 = Circle sign 10.svg\n| alt6 = U.S. Virgin Islands route marker\n| caption6 = [[List of United States Virgin Islands highways|Virgin Islands]]\n| direction = \n}}\n\nThere are also numbered highways in the [[District of Columbia]] and [[Territories of the United States|territories]].
