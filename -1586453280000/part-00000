The systems include the 302&nbsp;mm WS-1 (100&nbsp;km range), the improved 302&nbsp;mm WS-1B (180&nbsp;km range), the 122&nbsp;mm WS-1E (40&nbsp;km), the 400&nbsp;mm WS-2 (200&nbsp;km range), as well as many other models. The WS-1 series weapon system did not enter PLA service and has order from Thailand. The WS-2 may finally see PLA service in the future. It's worth noticing that although sharing the same name, there are other developers for different models of Weishi series multiple rocket launchers (MRL) other than the primary developer SCAIC.\n\nChina Aerospace Long-March International ALIT (CASC) has published a table showing the ranges of most of the WS rockets. There are unguided, guided and precision guided rockets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/JosephHDempsey/status/834742834049720320|title=A rocket for every occasion - #China ALBIT (CASC) markets respective range and precision options at #IDEX2017pic.twitter.com/a4vgVXZjn0|first=Joseph|last=Dempsey|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== WS-1 ==\nSCAIC began to develop an unguided large-calibre multiple launch rocket system for the PLA ground forces in the late 1980s. The resulting Weishi-1 (WS-1) 302&nbsp;mm, 4-tube multiple rocket system was first tested in 1990. However, the weapon system failed to impress the PLA, and no production order was received. The ground equipment of the WS-1 comprises: a rocket launch truck, a transport and loading truck and a firing command truck.\n\nA WS-1 rocket battalion is equipped with:\n\n*DZ-88B firing command truck (4 men): 1;\n*MF-4 rocket launch truck (3 men): 6~9;\n*QY-88 transport and loading truck (3 men): 6~9;\n*High-altitude meteorological radar (3 men): 1;\n*Rockets per launch truck: 40~60 ;\n\n[[Khaibar-1]] could be based on Weishi Rockets.\n\n=== WS-1B ===\nSCAIC continued the WS-1 development in the 1990s and introduced the improved WS-1B in the late 1990s. The WS-1B mainly targeted foreign customers and was actively marketed by Beijing-based China National Precision Machinery Corporation (CPMIEC).

It is speculated that WS-2 is going to be a cheaper alternative to the expensive short range ballistic missiles in Chinese inventory. The WS-2 is fitted with a simple cascade inertial terminal guidance to compensate for the degraded accuracy caused by the long distance flight of the rocket. In 2008, it was revealed that sub-munitions are developed for WS-2, including a specialized anti-radar version, which is a rocket containing three [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]].  Once the rocket is fired to the target area, the UAVs are released the same way like other sub-munitions.  The seekers would seek out target radar signals as UAVs began to cruise, and once locked on to the radar, UAV would home in and attack.  Some domestic Chinese military enthusiasts have claimed such technology was based on the principle of Israeli Harpy anti-radar UAVs, but this could not be confirmed by independent sources outside China.\n\nA WS-1E and WS-2 rocket battalion shared the same equipment and is armed with:\n*Firing command truck (5 men): 1;\n*Rocket launch truck (3 men): 6;\n*Transport and loading truck (3 men): 6~9;\n*Rockets per launch truck: 30~48;\n*Preparation time (from traveling to firing) < 12 minutes\n*Firing density: better than 1/600 m\n*Accuracy: better than 0.3%\n\n=== WS-2B ===\nUpgraded version with 200&nbsp;km range.<ref name=china1>{{cite web|url=http://military.china.com/zh_cn/important/11052771/20070114/13876559.html|title=\u6050\u6016:\u4e2d\u56fdWS-2D\u706b\u7bad\u70ae\u5c04\u7a0b\u7adf\u8fbe400\u516c\u91cc[\u56fe&#93;-\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053-\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51-\u4e2d\u56fd\u6700\u5927\u804c\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u95e8\u6237|publisher=Military.china.com|date=2007-01-14|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033837/http://military.china.com/zh_cn/important/11052771/20070114/13876559.html|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== WS-2C ===\nUpgraded version with GPS guidance and 350&nbsp;km range.<ref name=china1 /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-2_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113165704/https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-2_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html |archive-date=2018-11-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> It also features passive homing guidance.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== WS-2D ===\nUpgraded version with GPS guidance and 400&nbsp;km range and ability to launch lethal unmanned aerial vehicles.<ref>https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-2_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html</ref>\n\n== WS-3 ==\nBuilt by China Aerospace Long-March International Trade (Alit) \u2013 a subsidiary of [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]] (CASC) \u2013 the WS-3 features 6 rectangular missile containers for 406&nbsp;mm rockets,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-3_400mm_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112143011/https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-3_400mm_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html |archive-date=2018-11-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> it has simple cascade inertial terminal guidance and has a range of 70-200 km.<ref>{{cite web|title=WS-3 Precision Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System|url=http://cloud.alitchina.com/en/?c=show&m=view&id=20|publisher=Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co., Ltd (ALIT)|accessdate=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\n=== WS-3A ===\nAlso built by ALIT, the WS-3A is an upgraded version of the WS-3 with simple cascade inertial terminal guidance updated by civilian GPS/GLONASS, but can be upgraded to military GPS/GLONASS upon customer's request.<ref>{{cite web|title=WS-3A Precision Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System|url=http://cloud.alitchina.com/en/?c=show&m=view&id=19|publisher=Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co., Ltd (ALIT)|accessdate=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\n=== WS-3 ASW missile ===\nWS-3 ASW Rocket is a modified WS-3A carrying rocket assisted anti-submarine (ASW) torpedo, which is developed by Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of [[China Poly Group Corporation]].

The main difference between the SY300 and its WS-2/3 predecessor is that for WS-2/3, the control section of the forward control surfaces and the warhead are integrated into a single unit, but they are separated in SY-300.

As a low cost alternative to more expensive ballistic missiles, the accuracy of SY400 is increased by adding GPS to correct the cascade inertial navigational guidance, and according to the developer, the accuracy can be further improved if military grade GPS signals are used to replacing the existing civilian GPS signal.  Another feature of SY-400 is that it shares the same launching vehicle and fire control system of [[B-611#BP-12A|BP-12A ballistic missile]], thus simplifying logistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://war.163.com/10/1119/09/6LRGIR5N00011MTO.html|title=[\u72ec\u5bb6\u4e13\u8bbf&#93;SY400\u6218\u672f\u5bfc\u5f39\u6700\u5927\u5c04\u7a0b180\u516c\u91cc_\u7f51\u6613\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u5fc3|publisher=War.163.com|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032216/http://war.163.com/10/1119/09/6LRGIR5N00011MTO.html|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.popsci.com/blog-network/eastern-arsenal/sy-400-guided-rocket-makes-tv-debut |title=SY-400 Guided Rocket Makes TV Debut |access-date=2017-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918033031/http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/eastern-arsenal/sy-400-guided-rocket-makes-tv-debut |archive-date=2017-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 [[Qatar]] bought SY-400.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/qatar-parades-new-chinese-short-range-ballistic-missile-system/ |title=Qatar Parades New Chinese Short-Range Ballistic Missile System |access-date=2017-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105059/https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/qatar-parades-new-chinese-short-range-ballistic-missile-system/ |archive-date=2017-12-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== CM-400AKG ===\nThe '''CM-400AKG''' is an air-launched derivative of the SY-400 tactical ballistic missile developed by the [[China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation]].<ref name=\"janes_2014-10-22\">{{cite web|author=Richard D.

The FG-42/43 rocket motor is a single chamber, solid rocket motor with an advanced hydroxy-terminated polybutadine (HTPB) composition rocket propellant. The rocket of the WS-2 system features four control surfaces in the middle section of the rocket for terminal guidance.\n\nThe rocket can be fitted with various types of warheads including anti-armour/personnel submunition, blasting, fuel air explosive (FAE), and high-explosive (HE). The ZDB-2 blasting warhead is loaded with steel balls and prefabricated fragments. The SZB-1 submunition warhead is designed to destroy large area targets such as armour formation and infantry troops. When the SZB-1 submunition warhead detonates, around 500 bullets are expelled under high pressure.\n\n== Launch truck ==\nThe launch truck is available in a number of variants. The MF-4 launch truck is based on a Chinese indigenous 6X6 truck chassis. The HF-4 launch truck is based on the more capable Tiema [[XC2200]] 6X6 truck. The WS-2 uses a heavier 8X8 Taian [[TA580/TAS5380]] truck chassis. The launch tubes have an elevation range of 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 and azimuth range of -30\u00b0 to +30\u00b0. The truck is equipped with four hydraulically operated stabilisers which are lowered in preparation for the rocket launch.\n\n== Operators ==\n[[File:Weishi operators.png|thumb|300px|Map of Weishi operators in blue]]\n\n=== Current operators ===\n*{{ALG}} - 70 SR-5<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.menadefense.net/2017/11/19/lalgerie-achete-mlrs-sr5/|title=L'Alg\u00e9rie ach\u00e8te des MLRS SR5|date=2017-11-19|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129025602/https://www.menadefense.net/2017/11/19/lalgerie-achete-mlrs-sr5/|archive-date=2017-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*{{ARM}} - AR-1A\n*{{AZE}} - T-300 Kas\u0131rga\n*{{BAN}} - WS-22<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/bangladeshs-ambitious-military-modernization-drive/|author=Shakil Bin Mushtaq|title=Bangladesh's Ambitious Military Modernization Drive|place=Bangladesh|date=2018-01-09|accessdate=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423132305/https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/bangladeshs-ambitious-military-modernization-drive/|archive-date=2019-04-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*{{BHR}} - SR-5<ref>{{cite news|url=http://defence-blog.com/news/royal-bahraini-army-gets-chinese-sr5-multiple-launch-rocket-systems.html|author=Dylan Malyasov|title=Royal Bahraini Army gets Chinese SR5 multiple launch rocket systems|place=Bahrain and China|date=2016-10-28|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129044136/http://defence-blog.com/news/royal-bahraini-army-gets-chinese-sr5-multiple-launch-rocket-systems.html|archive-date=2017-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*{{BLR}} - A200<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard D Fisher Jr|title=Belarus reveals purchase of Chinese A200 guided MLRS|url=http://www.janes.com/article/52493/belarus-reveals-purchase-of-chinese-a200-guided-mlrs|website=IHS Jane's Defence Weekly|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-07-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703013904/http://www.janes.com/article/52493/belarus-reveals-purchase-of-chinese-a200-guided-mlrs|archivedate=2015-07-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*[[File:Flag of Hamas.svg|25px]] [[Hamas]] \u2013 WS-1E<ref>{{cite news|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/hamas-using-rockets-against-israel/1159/|title=Hamas using rockets against Israel|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032926/https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/hamas-using-rockets-against-israel/1159/|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*{{PRK}} - WS1B '''[[KN-09 (MRL)]]''' (?)\n*{{MOR}} - 6-8 Batteries of WS-2D .\n*{{MYA}} - SY-400<ref>https://www.armyrecognition.com/april_2020_news_defense_global_security_army_industry/myanmar_to_receive_first_batch_of_chinese_sy-400_short-range_ballistic_missiles.html</ref>\n*{{PAK}} - A-100\n*{{PRC}}\n*{{QAT}} - SY-400 & BP-12A\n*{{SUD}} - Sudan has acquired an unconfirmed number of the advanced Chinese WS-2 Multiple Rocket launcher In 2009.\n*{{TAN}} - A-100\n*{{THA}} - WS-1B as DTI-1, SR-5 as DTI-2.

It is speculated that WS-2 is going to be a cheaper alternative to the expensive short range ballistic missiles in Chinese inventory. The WS-2 is fitted with a simple cascade inertial terminal guidance to compensate for the degraded accuracy caused by the long distance flight of the rocket. In 2008, it was revealed that sub-munitions are developed for WS-2, including a specialized anti-radar version, which is a rocket containing three [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]].  Once the rocket is fired to the target area, the UAVs are released the same way like other sub-munitions.  The seekers would seek out target radar signals as UAVs began to cruise, and once locked on to the radar, UAV would home in and attack.  Some domestic Chinese military enthusiasts have claimed such technology was based on the principle of Israeli Harpy anti-radar UAVs, but this could not be confirmed by independent sources outside China.\n\nA WS-1E and WS-2 rocket battalion shared the same equipment and is armed with:\n*Firing command truck (5 men): 1;\n*Rocket launch truck (3 men): 6;\n*Transport and loading truck (3 men): 6~9;\n*Rockets per launch truck: 30~48;\n*Preparation time (from traveling to firing) < 12 minutes\n*Firing density: better than 1/600 m\n*Accuracy: better than 0.3%\n\n=== WS-2B ===\nUpgraded version with 200&nbsp;km range.<ref name=china1>{{cite web|url=http://military.china.com/zh_cn/important/11052771/20070114/13876559.html|title=\u6050\u6016:\u4e2d\u56fdWS-2D\u706b\u7bad\u70ae\u5c04\u7a0b\u7adf\u8fbe400\u516c\u91cc[\u56fe&#93;-\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053-\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51-\u4e2d\u56fd\u6700\u5927\u804c\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u95e8\u6237|publisher=Military.china.com|date=2007-01-14|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033837/http://military.china.com/zh_cn/important/11052771/20070114/13876559.html|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== WS-2C ===\nUpgraded version with GPS guidance and 350&nbsp;km range.<ref name=china1 /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-2_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113165704/https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-2_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html |archive-date=2018-11-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> It also features passive homing guidance.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== WS-2D ===\nUpgraded version with GPS guidance and 400&nbsp;km range and ability to launch lethal unmanned aerial vehicles.<ref>https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-2_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html</ref>\n\n== WS-3 ==\nBuilt by China Aerospace Long-March International Trade (Alit) \u2013 a subsidiary of [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]] (CASC) \u2013 the WS-3 features 6 rectangular missile containers for 406&nbsp;mm rockets,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-3_400mm_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112143011/https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-3_400mm_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html |archive-date=2018-11-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> it has simple cascade inertial terminal guidance and has a range of 70-200 km.<ref>{{cite web|title=WS-3 Precision Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System|url=http://cloud.alitchina.com/en/?c=show&m=view&id=20|publisher=Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co., Ltd (ALIT)|accessdate=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\n=== WS-3A ===\nAlso built by ALIT, the WS-3A is an upgraded version of the WS-3 with simple cascade inertial terminal guidance updated by civilian GPS/GLONASS, but can be upgraded to military GPS/GLONASS upon customer's request.<ref>{{cite web|title=WS-3A Precision Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System|url=http://cloud.alitchina.com/en/?c=show&m=view&id=19|publisher=Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co., Ltd (ALIT)|accessdate=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\n=== WS-3 ASW missile ===\nWS-3 ASW Rocket is a modified WS-3A carrying rocket assisted anti-submarine (ASW) torpedo, which is developed by Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of [[China Poly Group Corporation]].

The main difference between the SY300 and its WS-2/3 predecessor is that for WS-2/3, the control section of the forward control surfaces and the warhead are integrated into a single unit, but they are separated in SY-300.

As a low cost alternative to more expensive ballistic missiles, the accuracy of SY400 is increased by adding GPS to correct the cascade inertial navigational guidance, and according to the developer, the accuracy can be further improved if military grade GPS signals are used to replacing the existing civilian GPS signal.  Another feature of SY-400 is that it shares the same launching vehicle and fire control system of [[B-611#BP-12A|BP-12A ballistic missile]], thus simplifying logistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://war.163.com/10/1119/09/6LRGIR5N00011MTO.html|title=[\u72ec\u5bb6\u4e13\u8bbf&#93;SY400\u6218\u672f\u5bfc\u5f39\u6700\u5927\u5c04\u7a0b180\u516c\u91cc_\u7f51\u6613\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u5fc3|publisher=War.163.com|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032216/http://war.163.com/10/1119/09/6LRGIR5N00011MTO.html|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.popsci.com/blog-network/eastern-arsenal/sy-400-guided-rocket-makes-tv-debut |title=SY-400 Guided Rocket Makes TV Debut |access-date=2017-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918033031/http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/eastern-arsenal/sy-400-guided-rocket-makes-tv-debut |archive-date=2017-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 [[Qatar]] bought SY-400.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/qatar-parades-new-chinese-short-range-ballistic-missile-system/ |title=Qatar Parades New Chinese Short-Range Ballistic Missile System |access-date=2017-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105059/https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/qatar-parades-new-chinese-short-range-ballistic-missile-system/ |archive-date=2017-12-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== CM-400AKG ===\nThe '''CM-400AKG''' is an air-launched derivative of the SY-400 tactical ballistic missile developed by the [[China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation]].<ref name=\"janes_2014-10-22\">{{cite web|author=Richard D.

The FG-42/43 rocket motor is a single chamber, solid rocket motor with an advanced hydroxy-terminated polybutadine (HTPB) composition rocket propellant. The rocket of the WS-2 system features four control surfaces in the middle section of the rocket for terminal guidance.\n\nThe rocket can be fitted with various types of warheads including anti-armour/personnel submunition, blasting, fuel air explosive (FAE), and high-explosive (HE). The ZDB-2 blasting warhead is loaded with steel balls and prefabricated fragments. The SZB-1 submunition warhead is designed to destroy large area targets such as armour formation and infantry troops. When the SZB-1 submunition warhead detonates, around 500 bullets are expelled under high pressure.\n\n== Launch truck ==\nThe launch truck is available in a number of variants. The MF-4 launch truck is based on a Chinese indigenous 6X6 truck chassis. The HF-4 launch truck is based on the more capable Tiema [[XC2200]] 6X6 truck. The WS-2 uses a heavier 8X8 Taian [[TA580/TAS5380]] truck chassis. The launch tubes have an elevation range of 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 and azimuth range of -30\u00b0 to +30\u00b0. The truck is equipped with four hydraulically operated stabilisers which are lowered in preparation for the rocket launch.\n\n== Operators ==\n[[File:Weishi operators.png|thumb|300px|Map of Weishi operators in blue]]\n\n=== Current operators ===\n*{{ALG}} - 70 SR-5<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.menadefense.net/2017/11/19/lalgerie-achete-mlrs-sr5/|title=L'Alg\u00e9rie ach\u00e8te des MLRS SR5|date=2017-11-19|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129025602/https://www.menadefense.net/2017/11/19/lalgerie-achete-mlrs-sr5/|archive-date=2017-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*{{ARM}} - AR-1A\n*{{AZE}} - T-300 Kas\u0131rga\n*{{BAN}} - WS-22<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/bangladeshs-ambitious-military-modernization-drive/|author=Shakil Bin Mushtaq|title=Bangladesh's Ambitious Military Modernization Drive|place=Bangladesh|date=2018-01-09|accessdate=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423132305/https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/bangladeshs-ambitious-military-modernization-drive/|archive-date=2019-04-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*{{BHR}} - SR-5<ref>{{cite news|url=http://defence-blog.com/news/royal-bahraini-army-gets-chinese-sr5-multiple-launch-rocket-systems.html|author=Dylan Malyasov|title=Royal Bahraini Army gets Chinese SR5 multiple launch rocket systems|place=Bahrain and China|date=2016-10-28|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129044136/http://defence-blog.com/news/royal-bahraini-army-gets-chinese-sr5-multiple-launch-rocket-systems.html|archive-date=2017-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*{{BLR}} - A200<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard D Fisher Jr|title=Belarus reveals purchase of Chinese A200 guided MLRS|url=http://www.janes.com/article/52493/belarus-reveals-purchase-of-chinese-a200-guided-mlrs|website=IHS Jane's Defence Weekly|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-07-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703013904/http://www.janes.com/article/52493/belarus-reveals-purchase-of-chinese-a200-guided-mlrs|archivedate=2015-07-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*[[File:Flag of Hamas.svg|25px]] [[Hamas]] \u2013 WS-1E<ref>{{cite news|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/hamas-using-rockets-against-israel/1159/|title=Hamas using rockets against Israel|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032926/https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/hamas-using-rockets-against-israel/1159/|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*{{PRK}} - WS1B '''[[KN-09 (MRL)]]''' (?)\n*{{MOR}} - 6-8 Batteries of WS-2D .\n*{{PAK}} - A-100\n*{{PRC}}\n*{{QAT}} - SY-400 & BP-12A\n*{{SUD}} - Sudan has acquired an unconfirmed number of the advanced Chinese WS-2 Multiple Rocket launcher In 2009.\n*{{TAN}} - A-100\n*{{THA}} - WS-1B as DTI-1, SR-5 as DTI-2.

{"title_page": "Trey Ellis", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{BLP sources|date=September 2018}}\n{{BLP self-published|date=September 2018}}\n{{third-party|date=September 2018}}\n{{More footnotes|date=June 2010}}\n}}\n\n'''Trey Ellis''' (born 1962) is an [[United States|American]] [[novelist]], [[screenwriter]], [[professor]], [[playwright]],<ref>{{citation|last=Ellis|first=Trey|url=http://writertreyellis.tumblr.com/about|title=Trey Ellis|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> and [[essayist]].\nHe was born in Washington D.C. and graduated from [[Hopkins School]] and [[Phillips Academy, Andover]], where he studied under [[Alexander Theroux]] before attending [[Stanford University]], where he was the editor of the [[Stanford Chaparral]] and wrote his first novel, ''Platitudes'' in a creative writing class taught by [[Gilbert Sorrentino]]. He is an associate professor in the Graduate School of the Arts at [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Novels and memoirs==\nHis first novel, ''Platitudes'', was published in 1988 and reissued by Northeastern University Press in 2003, along with his 1989 essay \"The New Black Aesthetic\". ''Platitudes'' follows the story of Earle, a black, private high-school student in New York City. The novel itself wrestles with many concepts outlines in \"The New Black Aesthetic,\" namely the existence of the cultural mulatto. Earle, as a second generation middle-class, black nerd, embodies this identity\u2014on his visit to Harlem he feels entirely out of place. Alongside this narrative is the story of Dorothy, a black, private high-school student who does live in Harlem and yet can navigate easily in her largely white social circles.\n\nThe novel makes extensive use of structure. Largely a metafictional work, Ellis moves between a more post-modern, deconstructed style and a more traditional, black female style through the voices of fictional authors Wellington and Ishee Ayam. Ellis' exaggerated representations of each style is humorous, essentially complicating the hegemonic artistic voice of the Black Arts Movement.\n\nAs a black nerd, Earle complicates traditional ideas of black masculinity. He occupies a place as an intellectual outsider, excluded from the mainstream, and yet the nerd identity is hyper-white. This idea of how blackness can be diverse and differ from typical ideas blackness accurately depict what the NBA is trying to say.\n\nHe is also the author of the novels ''Home Repairs'' (1993) and ''Right Here, Right Now'' (1999), which received an [[American Book Award]].  His latest book is ''Bedtime Stories: Adventures in the Land of Single-Fatherhood'' (2008), a memoir of his life as a single father of two.\n\n==Film==\nHis work for the screen includes the [[Peabody Award]]-winning and  [[Emmy]]-nominated ''[[The Tuskegee Airmen]]'', and ''Good Fences'', starring [[Danny Glover]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]], which was shortlisted for the [[International PEN|PEN]] award for Best Teleplay of the year, and was nominated for a [[Black Reel]] award.  In 1994, he co-wrote ''The Inkwell'' under the pen name Tom Ricostronza.\n\n==Essays==\nHis essays have appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[GQ]]'', among other places. He is a regular [[blog]]ger on [[The Huffington Post]] and lives in [[Manhattan]], where he is an [[associate professor]] at the [[Columbia University]] Graduate School of Film.\n\n==Plays==\nHis work for the theater includes the plays ''[[Fly (play)|Fly]]'' and ''Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing'' and most recently ''Holy Mackerel''.\n\n\"Holy Mackerel\" by Trey Ellis had its first live staged reading in 2016. The play follows the evolution of The Amos \u2018N' Andy Show which ran from the late 1920s to the late 1950s and was a household favorite. Before it became a television show, it was America\u2019s most listened to radio show. During the time, it was voiced by white actors, and many people criticized the show for the way it was \u201cvilified as modern-day Uncle Toms for wanting the same opportunities for success that their white counterparts took for granted.\u201d However Amos \u2018n Andy also \u201cintroduc[ed] America to a range of black people who included doctors and lawyers, and depicted the black family at a time when no one else was doing so.\u201d When the show transitioned to television, they hired black actors. While it continued to disappoint some viewers, many people (black and white) tuned in every week to watch the show. But after only 2 seasons, the show was cancelled due to boycotting led by Walter White, head of the NAACP. In 2016, Trey Ellis, author of \u201cThe New Black Aesthetic\u201d, staged a reading of his new play, \"Holy Mackerel\" which follows the rise and fall of The Amos 'N\u2019 Andy Show. In Ellis\u2019 own words, \"When I discovered that everything I thought I knew about Amos 'N' Andy was wrong, that it was one of TV's first ever sitcoms and the all-black cast were some of the most brilliant comedians to ever walk the earth, I knew I had to bring their story back to life,\u201d said Ellis. \u201c'Holy Mackerel!', the phrase the show invented, is a comedy about the tragedy of what happened to them.\u201d In this way, Ellis is, himself, exemplifying notions of the New Black Aesthetic or the constant redefining of blackness both as it stands today as well as re-examining old works through new lenses. \n\n==The New Black Aesthetic==\nEllis is also known for the small piece he wrote titled \"New Black Aesthetic\" (NBA) which describes the change in the overall image of \"blackness\" that has emerged in our society in the past few decades. In this essay, Ellis argues that there is a more broad way to characterize middle class blacks today, and with this new characterization comes a new aesthetic movement.\n{{Quotation|I now know that I'm not the only black person who sees the black aesthetic as much more than just Africa and jazz.  Finally finding a large body of the like-minded armors me with the nearly undampenable enthusiasm of the born again.  And my friends and I\u2014a minority's minority mushrooming with the current black bourgeoisie boom\u2014have inherited an open-ended New Black Aesthetic from a few Seventies pioneers that shamelessly borrows and reassembles across both race and class lines.<ref>Ellis, Trey. \"The New Black Aesthetic.\" Callaloo 38. Winter (1989): 233-243</ref>}}  The NBA represents, in Ellis' mind, a new stage in cultural interaction for black Americans.  He does not deny that there are many aspects of American society that still work against the interests of black Americans, but the emergence of the NBA opens up an aesthetic realm that was, until recently, closed to blacks in America.  It signals an opening of socially acceptable aesthetic possibilities for blacks beyond \"Africa and jazz.\"  Now, for example, black students go to colleges to be art majors rather than always pursuing a law degree or going to medical school upon graduating because their parents have given them the means to do so. In this short piece, Ellis includes interviews from black filmmaker, Spike Lee, as well as the black band, Fishbone. He uses these as examples of thriving hybrids, or people who don\u2019t leave behind their culture to be successful.  Ellis' novel ''Platitudes'' takes advantage of the NBA in order to represent some of the new aesthetic possibilities available to blacks in America.  He also talks about the concept of the \"cultural mulatto,\" or someone who can relate to multiple cultures the same way a multiracial person can relate to their different heritages. He refers to Whitney Houston and Lionel Richie as \"neutered mutations\" that chose to conform and commercialize their once soulful style just so they could maximize their profits by appealing to multiple cultures.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chaney|first=Michael|title=Trey Ellis Biorgraphy|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/4297/Ellis-Trey.html|accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural mulatto===\nThe phrase, coined by Ellis in his essay \"The New Black Aesthetic,\" (NBA) refers to a black individual who possesses the ability to thrive and successfully exist in a white society while simultaneously maintaining all facets of his or her complex cultural identity. Ellis signifies two types of cultural mulattoes: \"thriving hybrids\" and \"neutered mutants\". \nThe thriving hybrid has transcended the stereotypes associated with blackness and predicates their identity on their individuality as opposed to their blackness. They recognize the position that society has placed on them because of their race, but they don't let it inhibit their growth. Ellis writes: \"Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world.\"\n\nEllis appropriates the somewhat offensive term [[mulatto]] in his creation of rhetoric to describe this contemporary black locus as a means to challenge prevalent notions of multiracial; or in this case, \"culturally multiracial\", black people falling subject to the fate of the [[tragic mulatto]], or \"neutered mutant\".  The tragic mulatto is an individual who, while struggling to fit into white culture, alienates him or herself from black culture.  \"Today's cultural mulattoes echo those 'tragic mulattoes' critic Sterling Brown wrote about in the Thirties only when they too forget they are wholly black.\"<ref name=\"Ellis, Trey 2003\">Ellis, Trey (2003). Platitudes and 'The New Black Aesthetic'. Boston: Northeastern University Press.</ref> While prevalent as a stereotypical figure in 19th- and 20th-century American literature, the tragic mulattoes need not exist in postmodern society. The NBA, as characterized by Ellis, allows space for the cultural mulatto to perform a self-defined, authentic form of identity that does not rely on the self-deluding practice of negating his or her blackness. Relatedly, the cultural mulatto need not perform a \"superblackness\" to overcompensate for \"[[acting white]]\" or to gain cultural credibility from the black community. On the converse Ellis also defines the \"neutered mutation,\" a cultural mulatto who tries hard to please both worlds and ends up pleasing neither.<ref name=\"Ellis, Trey 2003\"/> Cultural mulattoes exist in great numbers and, fueled by the ideology of the NBA, space for hybridity is opened and, subsequently, feelings of dislocation in a strictly dichotomous society are collectively obliterated.\n\nThrough their skills that allow successful navigation in both the white and black social spheres, the cultural mulattoes that typify the NBA are using their access to higher education and various breeds of dominant cultural capital to make \"atypically black\" art and earn respect devoid of essentialist racial categorizations.\n\n===Contemporary Examples===\nAs B.D. Ashe points out, we are still currently in this era of the New Black Aesthetic, or what he calls the \u201cPost-soul Aesthetic\u201d. According to him, \u201cThere has been no fundamental, sociocultural paradigm shift akin to the Civil Rights movement to alter the post-soul aesthetic focus\u201d or to thrust black Americans into a new way of being and existing.<ref>Ashe, B. D. (2007). Theorizing the Post-Soul Aesthetic: An Introduction. African American Review, 41(4), 609-623.</ref> As it is, there are a number of modern examples that emphasize the NBA's persistence through the contemporary moment. \nSome current examples of this would be television shows like [[Donald Glover]]\u2019s [[Atlanta (TV series)]] or [[Issa Rae]]\u2019s [[Insecure (TV series)]]. As characters Issa and \u201cEarn\u201d also ([[Donald Glover]]) display their ability to navigate white spaces to varying degrees and embody the idea of the \u201ccultural mulatto\u201d. For Issa, this is a common occurrence at her workplace with her boss and white coworkers. For Earn, this is best established in the episode Juneteenth in which, while at a Juneteenth celebration attended by mostly white people, he and his girlfriend play along with the expectations of the attendees to an almost ludicrous degree. Throughout most of the party, the white people that Earn and his girlfriend interact with are oblivious to their game.\n\nEven further than television, there are examples of artists who exemplify the New Black Aesthetic through mediums such as music. One vocal artist who embodies this idea that blackness can and does exist in a multi-faceted way is [[Janelle Monae]]. Specifically, in her album [[Dirty Computer]], Monae gives a voice to the kind of blackness that she embodies as a queer black woman. Janelle Monae doesn't cater to a specific black or white audience, but an audience that can relate to the experiences she speaks of in her music. While many of the songs on Dirty Computer speak of the challenges black people face in America, Monae focuses on these issues in a way that empowers people like herself. She uses her music to empower black queer women when these voices have been historically ignored. Dirty Computer truly is a work that encapsulates Eliss's image of the New Black Aesthetic by being a compilation of intersecting black identities that reflect Janelle Monae's existence as a thriving hybrid. Monae expresses this identity clearly in her album, as well as through her personal style and her refusal to conform to anyone\u2019s idea of what she should and shouldn\u2019t be. This solidifies her place as a trendsetter, rule breaker, and cultural mulatto.\n\n==''Platitudes''==\n''Platitudes'' is a 1988 [[metafiction]]. It tells the tale of competing African-American fictional characters, Dewayne and Isshee, as they struggle to define blackness using two cultural mulatto characters. This novel provides examples of what Ellis describes as New Black Aesthetic in his 1989 essay of the same title.\n\n===Plot summary===\nTrey Ellis is most famous for his first work of metafiction called ''Platitudes''. The metafictional component of ''Platitudes'' helps the reader explore the New Black Aesthetic by portraying one story in which the two fictional authors, Dewayne and Isshee, embody two different ideas and perspectives on how black should be expressed and another story of two characters\u2019 struggle to fit into the white world as a \u201ccultural mulatto\u201d. In ''Platitudes'', the story begins with an experimental Black writer by the name of Dewayne Wellington. He is trying to figure out how to write his novel. He scoffs at the mainstream image of \"authentic blackness\" by creating the character Earle, a chubby teenage New Yorker who only thinks about sex (that he is not having) and academics. This is a departure from the stereotypical young black male who is assumed to only care about girls/sex, basketball, and hip hop music. He is in all sense what Ellis calls the [[cultural mulatto]].  Earle is a black 16-year-old who lives and attends school in the wealthy neighborhoods of the Upper West Side, Manhattan. While Earle is phenotypically black, he is quite assimilated into white culture. While most of his surroundings and relationships are with white people, Earle is also portrayed as a nerd which is often regarded as having \u201cwhite\u201d attributes as well as being someone who is intelligent, lacks social skills, and has a hyper-focus on a particular field, in Earle's case that is computer programming. However, Earle tries to explore his black roots when he visits the diner in Harlem where he meets Dorothy for the first time.  Dorothy is the attractive female character Dewayne creates.  She attends the private St. Rita's School for Girls in Manhattan. Although she lives in inner-city, Harlem, she socializes and attends school on the primarily white side of the city. Dorothy is a part of the popular crowd at school and wants to live the wealthy lifestyle despite her background. Dorothy is considered a \"cultural mulatto\" because she is someone who is able to thrive in the white world while still embracing her racial identity. She is comfortable among her white friends and even has some power and status among them, but she is also aware of her black identity and how she differs from her them. After asking for advice on how to write his novel, Dewayne encounters Isshee Ayam, an African American feminist writer. She ridicules his works and attempts to \"correct\" his mistakes by creating her own renditions of the story with more feminist elements. She changes the setting of the story to rural Lowndes County, Georgia as well as most of the characters' traits. As the story goes on, Wellington compromises some of his original ideas to accommodate some of Ayam's preferences. The two narratives of Dewayne and Isshee begin to align as the authors\u2019 writing styles and stories reflect each other's styles and beliefs. By altering the story in accordance to both of the authors\u2019 writing styles and beliefs of how the black characters should be portrayed, Ellis expresses the concept that there is no one black identity that can be defined. Instead, blackness should be defined separately in the case of each person's life through their interactions with the culture and his or her experiences. Along with the aligning of the two stories, a relationship buds between Dewayne Wellington and Isshee Ayam. All in all, a majority of the events that happen in the story of Earle and Dorothy are an indirect reflection of the dynamics of Dewayne Wellington's relationship with Isshee Ayam. In the end, as Earle and Dorothy reconnect and consummate their relationship, Isshee and Dewayne do as well when Isshee visits Dewayne in the last chapter of the novel. Ellis uses Isshee's and Dewayne's novel and of two characters who provide examples of the cultural mulatto to portray the \"new black aesthetic\" and the absence of a single black identity.\n\n=== Analysis ===\nIn ''Platitudes'', Ellis depicts the tension between two African-American authors, Isshee and Dewayne, as they debate on the proper portrayal of Black characters. Isshee objects to Dewayne's portrayal of Black women, claiming he presented them in an \u201catavistic\u201d sense, overtly sexualized by Earle, a protagonist in their stories (15).<ref name=\"Ellis\">Ellis, Trey (1988). Platitudes. Boston: Northeastern University Press, {{ISBN|978-1555535865}}</ref> In opposition to Dewayne's story, Isshee recreates his characters as strong, intelligent female characters reinforcing the stereotype of the \u201cStrong Black Woman\u201d. Isshee transforms Earle's doting, White mother into a Mammy figure that she calls \u201cSister Pride\u201d (41).<ref name=Ellis /> And she endows Dorothy, the other protagonist in their stories, the beautiful, hyper sexualized teen into a girl with \u201ckeen intellect\u201d(42).<ref name=Ellis /> Isshee develops Dorothy into \u201cthe first black female J.D.-M.D.-Ph.D. in the history of the land\u201d (42, 43).<ref name=Ellis /> Through this conflict, Ellis demonstrates the tension that exists in the literary sphere with the transformation of soul literature, Ishee's narrative to post-soul literature, Dewayne's narrative. Isshee recreates the narrative to an \u201cAfro-American glory-stor[y]\u201d while Dewayne gives a modern, sensual take on middle-class African-Americans (19).<ref name=Ellis /> Isshee's failure to represent other forms of blackness within her literature represents the theme of respectability that existed within the soul era that Dewayne does away with, resembling New Black Aesthetic and [[Mark Anthony Neal|Post-Soul Aesthetic]].\n\nIn Dewayne's narrative of Earle and Dorothy, both belong to the class of the Black post-bourgeoisie.  Earle is the son of a working-class white mother. His existence is the product of the Civil Rights Movement which sanctioned the ability for him to live unpunished within the white world of Downtown Harlem. While Dorothy, is a resident of urban Uptown Harlem and the daughter of a restaurateur. She comes from humble beginnings, but she shares the same privileges as Earle able to transverse both white and black worlds and still fit in. Their integration in both worlds indicates their ability to participate socially and culturally as members of both space. Earle and Dorothy are cultural mulattoes, a term coined by Ellis in his essay \u201cThe New Black Aesthetic\u201d (NBA).\nHowever, Earle and Dorothy are different types of cultural mulattoes. Earle is a neutered mutation, another neologism created by Ellis, mainly \u201cwhite-cultured\u201d he is able to fit into the white society, downtown Harlem, but he is unable to blend with ease in uptown Harlem, the black world.  His inability to blend with the black world is demonstrated by the double consciousness he experiences while in a restaurant in uptown Harlem. He perceives himself through the eyes of others thinking ''\u201cStop fooling around and just look mean so they won\u2019t know you\u2019re not from uptown\u201d'' (23).<ref name=Ellis /> His counterpart, Dorothy is a thriving hybrid, another neologism by Ellis, she is capable of blending into the landscapes of both worlds, yet she is still self-conscious of her presence in both spaces. She views Earle and herself as commuters between the two worlds and contemplates the loneliness they share that comes from being interlopers between the two worlds (147).<ref name=Ellis />\n\nAs a part of Ellis' NBA (also related to Mark Anthony Neal's concept of the post-soul aesthetic),<ref>Neal, Mark Anthony. \"You Remind Me of Something.\" Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic. New York: Routledge, 2002. 1-22. Print.</ref> Earle represents a sort of new black male whose narrative is free to explore his non-archetypically \"black\" conflicts. This NBA tenet is repeatedly evident in the presentation of Earle's relationship to masculinity and the stereotype of black hypermasculinity throughout the novel. Traditionally race and gender intersected in black men to create a hypermasculine archetype; however, Earle is an NBA black male who struggles with understanding and asserting such masculinity in key moments. For example, when Dorothy's boyfriend (hypermasculine LeVon) usurps him as her potential love interest, his response was not aggressive, or even particularly assertive: \"I can\u2019t believe it. She\u2019s not only got a boyfriend but he\u2019s Gigantor the Thunder Tyrant. I should\u2019ve known. She\u2019s too beautiful for you fatso, why can\u2019t you just settle for a tubby acnehead with halitosis who hates you.\" (141). The self-deprecation of his physical size and shape relative to LeVon's indicated Earle's internalization of his failure in hypermasculinity. Earle's problematized relationship to masculinity is an example of black literature speaking to the experiences of black people who don\u2019t resonate with hypermasculinity\u2014a prime illustration of Ellis\u2019 NBA democratization of the black authenticity. This process serves to create a discourse in which black people with non-standard black experiences represented in the NBA and PSA are allowed and encouraged to explore their discomfort with blackness as Earle does.\n\n=== Genre ===\n''Platitudes'' is a realistic [[metafiction]], a [[story within a story]]. The story of Isshee and Dewayne's correspondence frames the [[bildungsroman]], coming-of-age, narratives about Earle and Dorothy. The novel falls under the genre of New Black Aesthetic, art produced by the post-bourgeoisie Black that portrays cultural hybridity and escapes the boundaries of civil rights literature and their themes of respectability.\n\n=== Structure ===\nLike most postmodern literature, the structure of this novel is discontinuous. Ellis maintains the aleatory disconnection by constantly changing the style of the novel; he shifts from dialogue to stream of consciousness to a third-person omniscient point of view. Ellis breaks the normal flow of extended prose not by default of this being a metafiction but because he writes the novel in an [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] format. The novel is a bricolage of letters, menus, exams, songs and other documents.\n\n=== Themes ===\nOne theme of the novel is the question of how to represent blackness. This theme is portrayed in the novel through the conflict between Dewayne and Ishee. The two characters argue on how they think black people should be represented in their works. While Dewayne's style is postmodern and depicts atypical forms of blackness, Ishee's style is more traditional and characters are like those found in many works of African American literature. An example of this is found in a comparison of Earle's mother in Dewayne's version of the story vs. in Ishee's. The disparity in how the two authors choose to represent the black matriarch echoes the differences in style between different schools of black thinkers present in the time the book was written. Even in what they serve to their children, these two mothers depict the differences in representation that the two authors espouse. Through the conclusion reached between the two characters, Ellis seems to suggest that a synthesis of these two styles should be worked toward. It is only when Dewayne and Ishee reconcile their differences and give in to their feelings for one another that the conclusion of the story they are writing can be reached. Far from the postmodern beating out the traditional, or the experimental taking a back seat to the realist, the honest black experience of the time can only be told through a combination of the two approaches. In the narratives of Dewayne and Ishee several stereotypes of Black literature are explored, both common and unexpected. Here are a few:\n* The Black geek, Earle in Dewayne's narrative. He is technologically skilled and has ambitions of an undergraduate education at Caltech or M.I.T..\n* The Black masculine figure, Levon, Dorothy's athletic boyfriend in Dewayne's narrative. He is described as the \u201chumongous black\u201d football player \u201cwho looks like he could rip out a door\u201d (140).<ref name=\"Ellis\" />\n* The Jezebel figure, the portrayal of Black females as lascivious, promiscuous, and hypersexual. Dewayne's Dorothy and Isshee's Darcelle are portrayed as Jezebels.\n* The mammy figure in Isshee's story, Earle's Black mother, \u201cSister Pride\u201d. She is a desexualized, self-sacrificing, religious, strong Black woman.\n* The absent Black fathers appear in both Isshee's and Dewayne's stories, Earle and Dorothy are always fatherless.\nThe theme of representation is shown in the ways Earle chooses to align himself within the different communities of Uptown and Downtown. In Downtown Harlem, Earle is friends with other geeks and nerds and this nerdom, is a marker of whiteness. In Uptown Harlem, Earle aligns himself with Black Politics by assisting with the campaign of a Black politician.\n\n==Additional work==\nHe was also the subject of a half-hour documentary aired nationally on PBS, part of a series called, \"A Moveable Feast\" (television documentary).

Chet Ellis is most famous for his 2017 essay entitled, \"The Colors of Privilege\" where he addresses race in his small predominately white town, Westport, Ct.

He is an associate professor in the Graduate School of the Arts at [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Novels and memoirs==\nHis first novel, ''Platitudes'', was published in 1988 and reissued by Northeastern University Press in 2003, along with his 1989 essay \"The New Black Aesthetic\". ''Platitudes'' follows the story of Earle, a black, private high-school student in New York City. The novel itself wrestles with many concepts outlines in \"The New Black Aesthetic,\" namely the existence of the cultural mulatto. Earle, as a second generation middle-class, black nerd, embodies this identity\u2014on his visit to Harlem he feels entirely out of place. Alongside this narrative is the story of Dorothy, a black, private high-school student who does live in Harlem and yet can navigate easily in her largely white social circles.\n\nThe novel makes extensive use of structure. Largely a metafictional work, Ellis moves between a more post-modern, deconstructed style and a more traditional, black female style through the voices of fictional authors Wellington and Ishee Ayam. Ellis' exaggerated representations of each style is humorous, essentially complicating the hegemonic artistic voice of the Black Arts Movement.\n\nAs a black nerd, Earle complicates traditional ideas of black masculinity. He occupies a place as an intellectual outsider, excluded from the mainstream, and yet the nerd identity is hyper-white. This idea of how blackness can be diverse and differ from typical ideas blackness accurately depict what the NBA is trying to say.\n\nHe is also the author of the novels ''Home Repairs'' (1993) and ''Right Here, Right Now'' (1999), which received an [[American Book Award]].  His latest book is ''Bedtime Stories: Adventures in the Land of Single-Fatherhood'' (2008), a memoir of his life as a single father of two.\n\n==Film==\nHis work for the screen includes the [[Peabody Award]]-winning and  [[Emmy]]-nominated ''[[The Tuskegee Airmen]]'', and ''Good Fences'', starring [[Danny Glover]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]], which was shortlisted for the [[International PEN|PEN]] award for Best Teleplay of the year, and was nominated for a [[Black Reel]] award.  In 1994, he co-wrote ''The Inkwell'' under the pen name Tom Ricostronza.\n\n==Essays==\nHis essays have appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[GQ]]'', among other places. He is a regular [[blog]]ger on [[The Huffington Post]] and lives in [[Manhattan]], where he is an [[associate professor]] at the [[Columbia University]] Graduate School of Film.\n\n==Plays==\nHis work for the theater includes the plays ''[[Fly (play)|Fly]]'' and ''Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing'' and most recently ''Holy Mackerel''.\n\n\"Holy Mackerel\" by Trey Ellis had its first live staged reading in 2016. The play follows the evolution of The Amos \u2018N' Andy Show which ran from the late 1920s to the late 1950s and was a household favorite. Before it became a television show, it was America\u2019s most listened to radio show. During the time, it was voiced by white actors, and many people criticized the show for the way it was \u201cvilified as modern-day Uncle Toms for wanting the same opportunities for success that their white counterparts took for granted.\u201d However Amos \u2018n Andy also \u201cintroduc[ed] America to a range of black people who included doctors and lawyers, and depicted the black family at a time when no one else was doing so.\u201d When the show transitioned to television, they hired black actors. While it continued to disappoint some viewers, many people (black and white) tuned in every week to watch the show. But after only 2 seasons, the show was cancelled due to boycotting led by Walter White, head of the NAACP. In 2016, Trey Ellis, author of \u201cThe New Black Aesthetic\u201d, staged a reading of his new play, \"Holy Mackerel\" which follows the rise and fall of The Amos 'N\u2019 Andy Show. In Ellis\u2019 own words, \"When I discovered that everything I thought I knew about Amos 'N' Andy was wrong, that it was one of TV's first ever sitcoms and the all-black cast were some of the most brilliant comedians to ever walk the earth, I knew I had to bring their story back to life,\u201d said Ellis. \u201c'Holy Mackerel!', the phrase the show invented, is a comedy about the tragedy of what happened to them.\u201d In this way, Ellis is, himself, exemplifying notions of the New Black Aesthetic or the constant redefining of blackness both as it stands today as well as re-examining old works through new lenses. \n\n==The New Black Aesthetic==\nEllis is also known for the small piece he wrote titled \"New Black Aesthetic\" (NBA) which describes the change in the overall image of \"blackness\" that has emerged in our society in the past few decades. In this essay, Ellis argues that there is a more broad way to characterize middle class blacks today, and with this new characterization comes a new aesthetic movement.\n{{Quotation|I now know that I'm not the only black person who sees the black aesthetic as much more than just Africa and jazz.  Finally finding a large body of the like-minded armors me with the nearly undampenable enthusiasm of the born again.  And my friends and I\u2014a minority's minority mushrooming with the current black bourgeoisie boom\u2014have inherited an open-ended New Black Aesthetic from a few Seventies pioneers that shamelessly borrows and reassembles across both race and class lines.<ref>Ellis, Trey. \"The New Black Aesthetic.\" Callaloo 38. Winter (1989): 233-243</ref>}}  The NBA represents, in Ellis' mind, a new stage in cultural interaction for black Americans.  He does not deny that there are many aspects of American society that still work against the interests of black Americans, but the emergence of the NBA opens up an aesthetic realm that was, until recently, closed to blacks in America.  It signals an opening of socially acceptable aesthetic possibilities for blacks beyond \"Africa and jazz.\"  Now, for example, black students go to colleges to be art majors rather than always pursuing a law degree or going to medical school upon graduating because their parents have given them the means to do so. In this short piece, Ellis includes interviews from black filmmaker, Spike Lee, as well as the black band, Fishbone. He uses these as examples of thriving hybrids, or people who don\u2019t leave behind their culture to be successful.  Ellis' novel ''Platitudes'' takes advantage of the NBA in order to represent some of the new aesthetic possibilities available to blacks in America.  He also talks about the concept of the \"cultural mulatto,\" or someone who can relate to multiple cultures the same way a multiracial person can relate to their different heritages. He refers to Whitney Houston and Lionel Richie as \"neutered mutations\" that chose to conform and commercialize their once soulful style just so they could maximize their profits by appealing to multiple cultures.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chaney|first=Michael|title=Trey Ellis Biorgraphy|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/4297/Ellis-Trey.html|accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural mulatto===\nThe phrase, coined by Ellis in his essay \"The New Black Aesthetic,\" (NBA) refers to a black individual who possesses the ability to thrive and successfully exist in a white society while simultaneously maintaining all facets of his or her complex cultural identity. Ellis signifies two types of cultural mulattoes: \"thriving hybrids\" and \"neutered mutants\". \nThe thriving hybrid has transcended the stereotypes associated with blackness and predicates their identity on their individuality as opposed to their blackness. They recognize the position that society has placed on them because of their race, but they don't let it inhibit their growth. Ellis writes: \"Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world.\"\n\nEllis appropriates the somewhat offensive term [[mulatto]] in his creation of rhetoric to describe this contemporary black locus as a means to challenge prevalent notions of multiracial; or in this case, \"culturally multiracial\", black people falling subject to the fate of the [[tragic mulatto]], or \"neutered mutant\".  The tragic mulatto is an individual who, while struggling to fit into white culture, alienates him or herself from black culture.  \"Today's cultural mulattoes echo those 'tragic mulattoes' critic Sterling Brown wrote about in the Thirties only when they too forget they are wholly black.\"<ref name=\"Ellis, Trey 2003\">Ellis, Trey (2003). Platitudes and 'The New Black Aesthetic'. Boston: Northeastern University Press.</ref> While prevalent as a stereotypical figure in 19th- and 20th-century American literature, the tragic mulattoes need not exist in postmodern society. The NBA, as characterized by Ellis, allows space for the cultural mulatto to perform a self-defined, authentic form of identity that does not rely on the self-deluding practice of negating his or her blackness. Relatedly, the cultural mulatto need not perform a \"superblackness\" to overcompensate for \"[[acting white]]\" or to gain cultural credibility from the black community. On the converse Ellis also defines the \"neutered mutation,\" a cultural mulatto who tries hard to please both worlds and ends up pleasing neither.<ref name=\"Ellis, Trey 2003\"/> Cultural mulattoes exist in great numbers and, fueled by the ideology of the NBA, space for hybridity is opened and, subsequently, feelings of dislocation in a strictly dichotomous society are collectively obliterated.\n\nThrough their skills that allow successful navigation in both the white and black social spheres, the cultural mulattoes that typify the NBA are using their access to higher education and various breeds of dominant cultural capital to make \"atypically black\" art and earn respect devoid of essentialist racial categorizations.\n\n===Contemporary Examples===\nAs B.D. Ashe points out, we are still currently in this era of the New Black Aesthetic, or what he calls the \u201cPost-soul Aesthetic\u201d. According to him, \u201cThere has been no fundamental, sociocultural paradigm shift akin to the Civil Rights movement to alter the post-soul aesthetic focus\u201d or to thrust black Americans into a new way of being and existing.<ref>Ashe, B. D. (2007). Theorizing the Post-Soul Aesthetic: An Introduction. African American Review, 41(4), 609-623.</ref> As it is, there are a number of modern examples that emphasize the NBA's persistence through the contemporary moment. \nSome current examples of this would be television shows like [[Donald Glover]]\u2019s [[Atlanta (TV series)]] or [[Issa Rae]]\u2019s [[Insecure (TV series)]]. As characters Issa and \u201cEarn\u201d also ([[Donald Glover]]) display their ability to navigate white spaces to varying degrees and embody the idea of the \u201ccultural mulatto\u201d. For Issa, this is a common occurrence at her workplace with her boss and white coworkers. For Earn, this is best established in the episode Juneteenth in which, while at a Juneteenth celebration attended by mostly white people, he and his girlfriend play along with the expectations of the attendees to an almost ludicrous degree. Throughout most of the party, the white people that Earn and his girlfriend interact with are oblivious to their game.\n\nEven further than television, there are examples of artists who exemplify the New Black Aesthetic through mediums such as music. One vocal artist who embodies this idea that blackness can and does exist in a multi-faceted way is [[Janelle Monae]]. Specifically, in her album [[Dirty Computer]], Monae gives a voice to the kind of blackness that she embodies as a queer black woman. Janelle Monae doesn't cater to a specific black or white audience, but an audience that can relate to the experiences she speaks of in her music. While many of the songs on Dirty Computer speak of the challenges black people face in America, Monae focuses on these issues in a way that empowers people like herself. She uses her music to empower black queer women when these voices have been historically ignored. Dirty Computer truly is a work that encapsulates Eliss's image of the New Black Aesthetic by being a compilation of intersecting black identities that reflect Janelle Monae's existence as a thriving hybrid. Monae expresses this identity clearly in her album, as well as through her personal style and her refusal to conform to anyone\u2019s idea of what she should and shouldn\u2019t be. This solidifies her place as a trendsetter, rule breaker, and cultural mulatto.\n\n==''Platitudes''==\n''Platitudes'' is a 1988 [[metafiction]]. It tells the tale of competing African-American fictional characters, Dewayne and Isshee, as they struggle to define blackness using two cultural mulatto characters. This novel provides examples of what Ellis describes as New Black Aesthetic in his 1989 essay of the same title.\n\n===Plot summary===\nTrey Ellis is most famous for his first work of metafiction called ''Platitudes''. The metafictional component of ''Platitudes'' helps the reader explore the New Black Aesthetic by portraying one story in which the two fictional authors, Dewayne and Isshee, embody two different ideas and perspectives on how black should be expressed and another story of two characters\u2019 struggle to fit into the white world as a \u201ccultural mulatto\u201d. In ''Platitudes'', the story begins with an experimental Black writer by the name of Dewayne Wellington. He is trying to figure out how to write his novel. He scoffs at the mainstream image of \"authentic blackness\" by creating the character Earle, a chubby teenage New Yorker who only thinks about sex (that he is not having) and academics. This is a departure from the stereotypical young black male who is assumed to only care about girls/sex, basketball, and hip hop music. He is in all sense what Ellis calls the [[cultural mulatto]].  Earle is a black 16-year-old who lives and attends school in the wealthy neighborhoods of the Upper West Side, Manhattan. While Earle is phenotypically black, he is quite assimilated into white culture. While most of his surroundings and relationships are with white people, Earle is also portrayed as a nerd which is often regarded as having \u201cwhite\u201d attributes as well as being someone who is intelligent, lacks social skills, and has a hyper-focus on a particular field, in Earle's case that is computer programming. However, Earle tries to explore his black roots when he visits the diner in Harlem where he meets Dorothy for the first time.  Dorothy is the attractive female character Dewayne creates.  She attends the private St. Rita's School for Girls in Manhattan. Although she lives in inner-city, Harlem, she socializes and attends school on the primarily white side of the city. Dorothy is a part of the popular crowd at school and wants to live the wealthy lifestyle despite her background. Dorothy is considered a \"cultural mulatto\" because she is someone who is able to thrive in the white world while still embracing her racial identity. She is comfortable among her white friends and even has some power and status among them, but she is also aware of her black identity and how she differs from her them. After asking for advice on how to write his novel, Dewayne encounters Isshee Ayam, an African American feminist writer. She ridicules his works and attempts to \"correct\" his mistakes by creating her own renditions of the story with more feminist elements. She changes the setting of the story to rural Lowndes County, Georgia as well as most of the characters' traits. As the story goes on, Wellington compromises some of his original ideas to accommodate some of Ayam's preferences. The two narratives of Dewayne and Isshee begin to align as the authors\u2019 writing styles and stories reflect each other's styles and beliefs. By altering the story in accordance to both of the authors\u2019 writing styles and beliefs of how the black characters should be portrayed, Ellis expresses the concept that there is no one black identity that can be defined. Instead, blackness should be defined separately in the case of each person's life through their interactions with the culture and his or her experiences. Along with the aligning of the two stories, a relationship buds between Dewayne Wellington and Isshee Ayam. All in all, a majority of the events that happen in the story of Earle and Dorothy are an indirect reflection of the dynamics of Dewayne Wellington's relationship with Isshee Ayam. In the end, as Earle and Dorothy reconnect and consummate their relationship, Isshee and Dewayne do as well when Isshee visits Dewayne in the last chapter of the novel. Ellis uses Isshee's and Dewayne's novel and of two characters who provide examples of the cultural mulatto to portray the \"new black aesthetic\" and the absence of a single black identity.\n\n=== Analysis ===\nIn ''Platitudes'', Ellis depicts the tension between two African-American authors, Isshee and Dewayne, as they debate on the proper portrayal of Black characters. Isshee objects to Dewayne's portrayal of Black women, claiming he presented them in an \u201catavistic\u201d sense, overtly sexualized by Earle, a protagonist in their stories (15).<ref name=\"Ellis\">Ellis, Trey (1988). Platitudes. Boston: Northeastern University Press, {{ISBN|978-1555535865}}</ref> In opposition to Dewayne's story, Isshee recreates his characters as strong, intelligent female characters reinforcing the stereotype of the \u201cStrong Black Woman\u201d. Isshee transforms Earle's doting, White mother into a Mammy figure that she calls \u201cSister Pride\u201d (41).<ref name=Ellis /> And she endows Dorothy, the other protagonist in their stories, the beautiful, hyper sexualized teen into a girl with \u201ckeen intellect\u201d(42).<ref name=Ellis /> Isshee develops Dorothy into \u201cthe first black female J.D.-M.D.-Ph.D. in the history of the land\u201d (42, 43).<ref name=Ellis /> Through this conflict, Ellis demonstrates the tension that exists in the literary sphere with the transformation of soul literature, Ishee's narrative to post-soul literature, Dewayne's narrative. Isshee recreates the narrative to an \u201cAfro-American glory-stor[y]\u201d while Dewayne gives a modern, sensual take on middle-class African-Americans (19).<ref name=Ellis /> Isshee's failure to represent other forms of blackness within her literature represents the theme of respectability that existed within the soul era that Dewayne does away with, resembling New Black Aesthetic and [[Mark Anthony Neal|Post-Soul Aesthetic]].\n\nIn Dewayne's narrative of Earle and Dorothy, both belong to the class of the Black post-bourgeoisie.  Earle is the son of a working-class white mother. His existence is the product of the Civil Rights Movement which sanctioned the ability for him to live unpunished within the white world of Downtown Harlem. While Dorothy, is a resident of urban Uptown Harlem and the daughter of a restaurateur. She comes from humble beginnings, but she shares the same privileges as Earle able to transverse both white and black worlds and still fit in. Their integration in both worlds indicates their ability to participate socially and culturally as members of both space. Earle and Dorothy are cultural mulattoes, a term coined by Ellis in his essay \u201cThe New Black Aesthetic\u201d (NBA).\nHowever, Earle and Dorothy are different types of cultural mulattoes. Earle is a neutered mutation, another neologism created by Ellis, mainly \u201cwhite-cultured\u201d he is able to fit into the white society, downtown Harlem, but he is unable to blend with ease in uptown Harlem, the black world.  His inability to blend with the black world is demonstrated by the double consciousness he experiences while in a restaurant in uptown Harlem. He perceives himself through the eyes of others thinking ''\u201cStop fooling around and just look mean so they won\u2019t know you\u2019re not from uptown\u201d'' (23).<ref name=Ellis /> His counterpart, Dorothy is a thriving hybrid, another neologism by Ellis, she is capable of blending into the landscapes of both worlds, yet she is still self-conscious of her presence in both spaces. She views Earle and herself as commuters between the two worlds and contemplates the loneliness they share that comes from being interlopers between the two worlds (147).<ref name=Ellis />\n\nAs a part of Ellis' NBA (also related to Mark Anthony Neal's concept of the post-soul aesthetic),<ref>Neal, Mark Anthony. \"You Remind Me of Something.\" Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic. New York: Routledge, 2002. 1-22. Print.</ref> Earle represents a sort of new black male whose narrative is free to explore his non-archetypically \"black\" conflicts. This NBA tenet is repeatedly evident in the presentation of Earle's relationship to masculinity and the stereotype of black hypermasculinity throughout the novel. Traditionally race and gender intersected in black men to create a hypermasculine archetype; however, Earle is an NBA black male who struggles with understanding and asserting such masculinity in key moments. For example, when Dorothy's boyfriend (hypermasculine LeVon) usurps him as her potential love interest, his response was not aggressive, or even particularly assertive: \"I can\u2019t believe it. She\u2019s not only got a boyfriend but he\u2019s Gigantor the Thunder Tyrant. I should\u2019ve known. She\u2019s too beautiful for you fatso, why can\u2019t you just settle for a tubby acnehead with halitosis who hates you.\" (141). The self-deprecation of his physical size and shape relative to LeVon's indicated Earle's internalization of his failure in hypermasculinity. Earle's problematized relationship to masculinity is an example of black literature speaking to the experiences of black people who don\u2019t resonate with hypermasculinity\u2014a prime illustration of Ellis\u2019 NBA democratization of the black authenticity. This process serves to create a discourse in which black people with non-standard black experiences represented in the NBA and PSA are allowed and encouraged to explore their discomfort with blackness as Earle does.\n\n=== Genre ===\n''Platitudes'' is a realistic [[metafiction]], a [[story within a story]]. The story of Isshee and Dewayne's correspondence frames the [[bildungsroman]], coming-of-age, narratives about Earle and Dorothy. The novel falls under the genre of New Black Aesthetic, art produced by the post-bourgeoisie Black that portrays cultural hybridity and escapes the boundaries of civil rights literature and their themes of respectability.\n\n=== Structure ===\nLike most postmodern literature, the structure of this novel is discontinuous. Ellis maintains the aleatory disconnection by constantly changing the style of the novel; he shifts from dialogue to stream of consciousness to a third-person omniscient point of view. Ellis breaks the normal flow of extended prose not by default of this being a metafiction but because he writes the novel in an [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] format. The novel is a bricolage of letters, menus, exams, songs and other documents.\n\n=== Themes ===\nOne theme of the novel is the question of how to represent blackness. This theme is portrayed in the novel through the conflict between Dewayne and Ishee. The two characters argue on how they think black people should be represented in their works. While Dewayne's style is postmodern and depicts atypical forms of blackness, Ishee's style is more traditional and characters are like those found in many works of African American literature. An example of this is found in a comparison of Earle's mother in Dewayne's version of the story vs. in Ishee's. The disparity in how the two authors choose to represent the black matriarch echoes the differences in style between different schools of black thinkers present in the time the book was written. Even in what they serve to their children, these two mothers depict the differences in representation that the two authors espouse. Through the conclusion reached between the two characters, Ellis seems to suggest that a synthesis of these two styles should be worked toward. It is only when Dewayne and Ishee reconcile their differences and give in to their feelings for one another that the conclusion of the story they are writing can be reached. Far from the postmodern beating out the traditional, or the experimental taking a back seat to the realist, the honest black experience of the time can only be told through a combination of the two approaches. In the narratives of Dewayne and Ishee several stereotypes of Black literature are explored, both common and unexpected. Here are a few:\n* The Black geek, Earle in Dewayne's narrative. He is technologically skilled and has ambitions of an undergraduate education at Caltech or M.I.T..\n* The Black masculine figure, Levon, Dorothy's athletic boyfriend in Dewayne's narrative. He is described as the \u201chumongous black\u201d football player \u201cwho looks like he could rip out a door\u201d (140).<ref name=\"Ellis\" />\n* The Jezebel figure, the portrayal of Black females as lascivious, promiscuous, and hypersexual. Dewayne's Dorothy and Isshee's Darcelle are portrayed as Jezebels.\n* The mammy figure in Isshee's story, Earle's Black mother, \u201cSister Pride\u201d. She is a desexualized, self-sacrificing, religious, strong Black woman.\n* The absent Black fathers appear in both Isshee's and Dewayne's stories, Earle and Dorothy are always fatherless.\nThe theme of representation is shown in the ways Earle chooses to align himself within the different communities of Uptown and Downtown. In Downtown Harlem, Earle is friends with other geeks and nerds and this nerdom, is a marker of whiteness. In Uptown Harlem, Earle aligns himself with Black Politics by assisting with the campaign of a Black politician.\n\n==Additional work==\nHe was also the subject of a half-hour documentary aired nationally on PBS, part of a series called, \"A Moveable Feast\" (television documentary).

The position of [[President of the Swiss Confederation]] rotates among the seven councillors on a yearly basis, with one year's Vice President of the Federal Council becoming the next year's Confederation President. [[Simonetta Sommaruga]] has been the incumbent officeholder since 1 January 2020.\n\n==Members==\nThe current (2020) members of the Federal Council are, in order of seniority:\n\n{{Swiss Federal Council composition}}\n\n== Origins and history of the Federal Council ==\n\n=== Origins of the institution ===\nThe Federal Council was instituted by the 1848 [[Swiss Federal Constitution|Federal Constitution]] as the \"supreme executive and directorial authority of the Confederation\".<ref>[http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/101/a174.html dCst. art. 174]</ref>\n\nWhen the Constitution was written, [[constitutional democracy]] was still in its infancy, and the [[Founding Fathers|founding fathers]] of Switzerland had little in the way of examples. While they drew heavily on the [[United States Constitution]] for the organisation of the federal state as a whole, they opted for the [[Collegiality|collegial]] rather than the presidential system for the executive branch of government ([[directorial system]]). This accommodated the long tradition of the rule of collective bodies in Switzerland. Under the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime of Switzerland|Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] had been governed by councils of pre-eminent citizens since time immemorial, and the later [[Helvetic Republic]] (with its equivalent Directorate)<ref>See: {{HDS|26424|Directorate}}</ref> as well as the cantons that had given themselves liberal constitutions since the 1830s had also had good experiences with that mode of governance.<ref>{{HDS|10347<!--Section 1-2-->|Departments: Development on the Federal Level}} {{HDS|10093|Collegial System}}</ref>\n\nToday, only three other states, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Andorra]] and [[San Marino]], have collective rather than unitary heads of state. However the collegial system of government has found widespread adoption in modern [[democracy|democracies]] in the form of [[cabinet government]] with collective responsibility.\n\n=== Changes in composition ===\n[[File:Sitzverteilung Bundesrat.png|thumb|500px|Compostition of the Federal Council by political party, 1919 to 2017]]\nThe 1848 constitutional provision providing for the Federal Council{{spaced ndash}}and indeed the institution of the Council itself{{spaced ndash}}has remained unchanged to this day, even though Swiss society has changed profoundly since.\n\n==== Party representation ====\n\n===== Free Democratic hegemony, 1848\u201391 =====\n{{See also|Switzerland as a federal state}}\nThe 1848 Constitution was one of the few successes of the Europe-wide democratic [[revolutions of 1848]]. In Switzerland, the democratic movement was led{{spaced ndash}}and the new federal state decisively shaped{{spaced ndash}}by the ''Radicals'' (presently the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Free Democratic Party]], FDP). After winning the ''[[Sonderbund War]]'' (the Swiss civil war) against the Catholic cantons, the Radicals at first used their majority in the [[Swiss Federal Assembly|Federal Assembly]] to fill all the seats on the Federal Council. This made their former war opponents, the ''Catholic-Conservatives'' (presently the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]], CVP), the [[opposition party]]. Only after [[Emil Welti]]'s resignation in 1891 after a failed referendum on [[Swiss Federal Railways|railway]] [[nationalisation]] did the Radicals decide to [[co-optation|co-opt]] the Conservatives by supporting the election of [[Josef Zemp]].\n\n===== Emerging coalition government, 1891\u20131959 =====\nThe process of involving all major political movements of Switzerland into the responsibility of government continued during the first half of the 20th century. It was hastened by the FDP's and CVP's gradually diminishing voter shares, complemented by the rise of new parties of lesser power at the ends of the [[political spectrum]]. These were the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] (SP) on the [[Left-wing|Left]] and the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB; presently the [[Swiss People's Party|People's Party]], SVP) on the [[Right-wing|Right]]. In due course, the CVP received its second seat in 1919 with [[Jean-Marie Musy]], while the BGB joined the Council in 1929 with [[Rudolf Minger]]. In 1943, during World War II, the Social Democrats were also temporarily included with [[Ernst Nobs]].\n\n=====Grand coalition, 1959\u20132003=====\n{{Main|Magic formula}}\nThe 1959 elections, following the resignation of four Councillors, finally established the ''[[Zauberformel]]'', the \"magical formula\" that determined the Council's composition during the rest of the 20th century and established the long-standing nature of the Council as a permanent, voluntary [[grand coalition]].<ref name=\"zaubeformel\">{{HDS|10097|Zauberformel}}</ref> In approximate relation to the parties' respective strength in the Federal Assembly, the seats were distributed as follows:\n* [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP): 2 members,\n* [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (CVP): 2 members,\n* [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] (SP): 2 members, and\n* [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP): 1 member.\nDuring that time, the FDP and CVP very slowly but steadily kept losing voter share to the SVP and SP, respectively, which overtook the older parties in popularity during the 1990s.\n\n=====End of the grand coalition, 2008=====\n:{{Main|Swiss Federal Council election, 2007}}\nThe governmental balance was changed after the 2003 elections, when the SVP was granted a Council seat for their leader [[Christoph Blocher]] that had formerly belonged to the CVP's [[Ruth Metzler]]. Due to controversies surrounding his conduct in office, a narrow Assembly majority did not reelect Blocher in 2007 and chose instead [[Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf]], a more moderate SVP politician, against party policy. This led to a split of the SVP in 2008. After liberal regional SVP groups including Federal Councillors Widmer-Schlumpf and [[Samuel Schmid]] founded a new [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland|Conservative Democratic Party]], the SVP was left in opposition for the first time since 1929, but returned into the Council with the election of [[Ueli Maurer]] on 10 December 2008, who regained the seat previously held by Schmid, who had resigned. The SVP regained its second seat on the Council [[2015 Swiss Federal Council election|in 2015]], when Widmer-Schlumpf decided to resign after the SVP's large election gains [[2015 Swiss federal election|in the 2015 election]], being replaced by [[Guy Parmelin]].<ref>{{cite web | last1=Jaberg | first1=Samuel | last2=Stephens | first2=Thomas | title=Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf to Stand Down | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/exit-of-eveline-widmer-schlumpf_a-minister-who-symbolised-the-end-of-banking-secrecy/41745150 | date=28 October 2015 | website=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Gains\">{{cite web | last1=Mombelli | first1=Armando | title=People\u2019s Party Gains Second Seat in Cabinet | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/cabinet-elections_how-will-new-ingredients-change--magic-formula--/41825058 | date=10 December 2015 | website=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Women on the council ====\nWomen gained [[Women's suffrage|suffrage]] on the federal level in 1971. They remained unrepresented in the Federal Council for three further legislatures, until the 1984 election of [[Elisabeth Kopp]].\nIn 1983, the failed election of the first official female candidate, [[Lilian Uchtenhagen]] and again in 1993 the failed election of [[Christiane Brunner]] (both SP/PS), was controversial and the Social Democrats each time considered withdrawing from the Council altogether.<ref name=\"zaubeformel\"/>\n\nThere were two female Councillors serving simultaneously for the first time in 2006, and three out of seven Councillors were women from 2007 till 2010, when [[Simonetta Sommaruga]] was elected as the fourth woman in government in place of [[Moritz Leuenberger]], putting men in minority for the first time in history. Also remarkable is the fact that the eighth non-voting member of government, the Chancellor, who sets the government agenda, was also a woman.\n\nIn total, there have been nine female Councillors in the period 1989 to present:\n\n*The first woman Councillor, [[Elisabeth Kopp]] (FDP/PRD), elected 1984, resigned in 1989.\n*[[Ruth Dreifuss]] (SP/PS), served from 1993 to 2002, was the first woman to become President of the Confederation in 1999.\n*[[Ruth Metzler]] (Metzler-Arnold at the time) (CVP/PDC), served from 1999 to 2003 and was not re-elected to a 2nd term (see above).\n*[[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] (SP/PS), elected in 2003 and [[Doris Leuthard]] (CVP/PDC), elected in 2006, were the first two women serving simultaneously. Both were reelected in December 2007 for a four-year term.\n*[[Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf]] was elected in December 2007 and served until December 2015.\n*[[Simonetta Sommaruga]] was elected in September 2010. Together with Micheline Calmy-Rey, Doris Leuthard and Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, women had the majority in the Federal Council for the first time, until January 2012, when [[Alain Berset]] replaced Micheline Calmy-Rey.<ref name= \"Swissinfo 2010\">{{cite web|title=Elections produce female majority in cabinet|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/election_cabinet/Elections_produce_female_majority_in_cabinet.html?cid=28376382|work=Swissinfo.ch|publisher=SRG SSR Id\u00e9e Suisse|accessdate=22 September 2010|date=22 September 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Karin Keller-Sutter]] and [[Viola Amherd]] were elected on 5 December 2018.\n\n==== Regional balancing acts ====\nUntil 1999, the Constitution mandated that no canton could have more than one representative on the Federal Council. Until 1987, the place of origin was used to determine which canton a Federal Councilor was from. After 1987, the place of residence (or, for councilors who were previously members of the Federal Assembly or of a Canton's legislative or executive body, the canton from which they were elected) became the determinant factor.<ref>See {{HDS|10085|Federal Council}}</ref> Nothing prevented candidates from moving to politically expedient cantons, though, and the rule was abandoned in 1999. Since then, the Constitution has mandated an equitable distribution of seats among the cantons and language regions of the country, without setting concrete quotas. Whenever a member resigns, he/she is generally replaced by someone who is not only from the same party, but also the same language region. In 2006, however, [[Joseph Deiss]], a French Swiss, resigned and was succeeded by [[Doris Leuthard]], a German-speaking Swiss, and in 2016, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, German-speaking, was succeeded by Guy Parmelin, a French Swiss.\n\nHistorically, at least two Council seats have always been held by French- or Italian-speaking Swiss. As of 2016 two members of the Federal Council are from the Canton of Berne; previously, there had never been more than one Federal Councillor per Canton in the Federal Council. From 2003 to 2007, however, two of the members of the Federal Council, [[Moritz Leuenberger]] and [[Christoph Blocher]], have resided in the [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich]]. In the 2010 election, the two new Councillors [[Simonetta Sommaruga]] and [[Johann Schneider-Ammann]] were both from the [[Canton of Bern]].<ref name=\"Swissinfo 2010\" />\n\nThe language makeup of the Council as of 2017 is four German speakers, two French speakers, and one Italian speaker. In November 2017, Ignazio Cassis became the first Italian speaker to serve on the Council since 1999.\n\n== Operation of the Federal Council ==\n[[File:Bundeshaus West Vestib\u00fcl und Vorzimmer.jpg|thumb|The interior of the west wing of the [[Federal Palace]] in Berne, where the Council meetings are held.]]\n[[File:Bundesratszimmer.jpg|thumb|]]\n\n=== Presidency ===\nEach year, one of the seven Councillors is elected by the [[United Federal Assembly]] as ''[[President of the Swiss Confederation|President of the Confederation]]''.<ref name=\"guide 42\">{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |page= 42 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> The Federal Assembly also elects a Vice President. By convention, the positions of President and Vice President rotate annually, each Councillor thus becoming Vice President and then President every seven years while in office.\n\nAccording to the [[Swiss order of precedence]], the President of the Confederation is the highest-ranking Swiss official. He/She presides over Council meetings and carries out certain representative functions that, in other countries, are the business of a head of state.<ref name=\"guide 43\"/> In urgent situations where a Council decision cannot be made in time, he is empowered to act on behalf of the whole Council. Apart from that, though, he is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', having no power above and beyond the other six Councillors.<ref name=\"guide 42\"/>\n\nThe President is not the Swiss head of state; this function is carried out by the Council ''in corpore'', that is, in its entirety. However, it has recently become usual that the President acts and is recognized as head of state while conducting official visits abroad, as the Council (also by convention) does not leave the country ''in corpore''. More often, though, official visits abroad are carried out by the Councillor who is head of the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]. Visiting heads of state are received by the Federal Council ''in corpore''.\n\n=== Council meetings ===\n[[File:Bundesrat (Schweiz) im Sitzungszimmer.jpg|thumb|Before a meeting 1987]]\nThe Federal Council operates mainly through weekly meetings, which are held each Wednesday at the [[Federal Palace]] in [[Bern]].,<ref name=\"guide 43\">{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |page= 43 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> the seat of the Swiss [[Politics of Switzerland|federal government]].\n\nApart from the seven Councillors, the following officials also attend the meetings:\n*[[Swiss Federal Chancellor|Federal Chancellor]] [[Walter Thurnherr]]. As government chief of staff and head of the [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland|Federal Chancellery]], he participates in the discussion but has no vote in the Council's decisions.<ref name=\"guide 43\"/> Nonetheless, his influential position is often referred to as that of an \"eighth Federal Councillor\".\n* the Vice-Chancellor: [[Andr\u00e9 Simonazzi]]. Simonazzi is the [[spokesman]] of the Federal Council and conducts the weekly press briefing after the meeting.\n* the Vice-Chancellor: [[Viktor Rossi]] who is in charge of the Federal Council sector within the Swiss Federal Chancellery.\n\nAfter the meetings, the Councillors take lunch together. The Council also meets regularly in [[wiktionary:conclave|conclave]] to discuss important topics at length, and annually conducts what is colloquially referred to as its \"[[field trip]]\", a day trip to some attractions in the President's home canton. In that and other respects, the Council operates not unlike a board of directors of a major corporation.\n\n=== Decisions and responsibilities ===\nEach Federal Councillor heads a government department, much like the ministers in the governments of other countries.<ref name=\"guide 44\">{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |pages= 44\u201345 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Colloquially and by the press, they are often referred to as ministers, e.g. the head of the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports|DDPS]] as \"minister of defence\", even though no such post officially exists. However, as Council members, they are not only responsible for their own department, but also for the business of their colleagues' departments as well, and for the conduct of the government and the federal administration as a whole.\n\nDecisions to be taken by the Council are always prepared by the responsible department.<ref name=\"guide 43\"/> For example, a change in the salaries of federal employees would be proposed to the council by the head of the [[Federal Department of Finance]], to whose department the Federal Office of Personnel belongs. Before a vote is taken at a Council meeting, though, all proposals are circulated in writing to the heads of departments, who commission the senior career officials of their department \u2013 the heads of the Federal Offices \u2013 to prepare a written response to offer criticism and suggestions. This is called the ''co-report procedure'' (''Mitberichtsverfahren''/''proc\u00e9dure de co-rapport''), designed to build a wide consensus ahead of a Council meeting.<ref name=\"guide 46\">{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |page= 46 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for important decisions, an additional public consultation is sometimes conducted, to which the cantons, the [[Political parties of Switzerland|political parties]] and major interest groups are invited, and in which all members of the public can participate. If a change in a federal [[statute]] is to be proposed to the Federal Assembly, this step is mandated by law. In such cases, the consultation procedure also serves to identify political concerns that could later be the focus of a [[Referendums by country#Switzerland|popular referendum]] to stop passage of the bill at issue.\n\nThe decisions themselves are formally taken by [[voice vote]] by a majority of the Councillors present at a meeting. However, the great majority of decisions are arrived at by [[consensus]]; even though lately there is said to be a trend towards more contentious discussions and close votes.{{By whom|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== Secrecy ===\nThe meetings of the Federal Council and the result of the votes taken are not open to the public, and the records remain sealed for 50 years. This has lately been the subject of some criticism. In particular, the parties at the ends of the [[political spectrum]] argue that this secrecy is contrary to the principle of [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]]. However, the Council has always maintained that secrecy is necessary to arrive at consensus and to preserve the [[collegiality]] and political independence of the individual Councillors.\n\n=== Constitutional conventions ===\nDue to the Federal Council's unique nature as a voluntary [[grand coalition]] of political opponents, its operation is subject to numerous [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]]. Most notable is the principle of [[collegiality]]; that is, the Councillors are not supposed to publicly criticise one another, even though they are often political opponents. In effect, they are expected to publicly support all decisions of the Council, even against their own personal opinion or that of their political party.<ref name=\"guide 43\"/> In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained after the 2003 elections (see below).\n\n== Election and composition ==\n{{Main|Swiss Federal Council election}}\n\n11 December 2019, 11:33:\n\n* Simonatta Somaruga (SP) became President of the Federal Republic for the second time in 2020 with 186 votes out of 200.\n* Guy Parmelin (SVP) by 191 votes - becomes vice-president by 168 votes - Minister for Economic Affairs\n* Ignazio Cassis (FDP) with 145 votes - Foreign Minister\n* Viola Amherd (CVP) with 218 votes - Minister of Defence\n* Alain Berset (SP) with 214 votes - Minister of the Interior\n* Ueli Maurer (SVP) with 213 votes - Finance Minister\n* Karin Keller-Sutter (FDP) with only 169 votes - Minister of Justice\n* Federal Chancellor Walter Thurnherr (CDP). 219 votes\n\n=== Election mode ===\n[[File:Bundesratswahl 2009 - Applaus.jpg|thumb|[[2006 Swiss Federal Council election|2006 election]] of the Federal Council in the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]]]]\nThe members of the Federal Council are elected for a term of four years by both chambers of the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]] sitting together as the United Federal Assembly. Each officeholder is elected individually by [[secret ballot]] by an [[absolute majority]] of votes. Every adult Swiss citizen is eligible, but in practice, only Members of Parliament or more rarely, members of cantonal governments are nominated by the political parties and receive a substantial number of votes. The voting is conducted in several rounds, under a form of [[exhaustive ballot]]: in the first two rounds, anyone can enter their name; in subsequent rounds, the person receiving the fewest votes is removed from the race until one candidate gains an absolute majority.\n\nUsually, the party which has a seat to fill presents two candidates with mainstream viewpoints to the United Federal Assembly, which then chooses one. This was not so, however, during the 2003 election, which was the most controversial in recent memory (see also above).\n\nOnce elected, Councillors remain members of their political parties, but hold no leading office with them. In fact, they usually maintain a certain political distance from the party leadership, because under the rules of [[collegiality]], they will often have to publicly promote a Council decision which does not match the political conviction of their party (or of themselves).\n\n=== Resignation ===\nOnce elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors can neither be voted out of office by a [[motion of no confidence]] nor can they be [[Impeachment|impeached]]. Re-election is possible for an indefinite number of terms, and it has historically been extremely rare for Parliament not to re-elect a sitting Councillor. This has only happened four times \u2013 to [[Ulrich Ochsenbein]] in 1854, to [[Jean-Jacques Challet-Venel]] in 1872, to [[Ruth Metzler-Arnold]] in 2003 and to [[Christoph Blocher]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |page= 13 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.\n\n== Status of Federal Councillors ==\n[[File:Bundesrat der Schweiz 2008 Teil 1.JPG|thumb|Faces in the Crowd: In keeping with the spirit of Swiss [[direct democracy]], the 2008 official photograph of the Federal Council depicted them as [[Everyman|everymen]].]]\n\n=== Councillors' lives ===\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Holds Press Availability with Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis (47991315853).jpg|thumb|Federal Councillor [[Ignazio Cassis]] speaks in 2019 accompanied by a ''Bundesweibel'']]\nUnlike most senior members of government in other countries, the Federal Councillors are not entitled to an [[official residence]] (however, the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland|Federal Palace]] houses living apartments for both the [[Federal Chancellor of Switzerland|Federal Chancellor]] and [[President of the Swiss Confederation|President of the Confederation]]).

The position of [[President of the Swiss Confederation]] rotates among the seven councillors on a yearly basis, with one year's Vice President of the Federal Council becoming the next year's Confederation President. [[Simonetta Sommaruga]] has been the incumbent officeholder since 1 January 2020.\n\n==Members==\nThe current (2020) members of the Federal Council are, in order of seniority:\n\n{{Swiss Federal Council composition}}\n\n== Origins and history of the Federal Council ==\n\n=== Origins of the institution ===\nThe Federal Council was instituted by the 1848 [[Swiss Federal Constitution|Federal Constitution]] as the \"supreme executive and directorial authority of the Confederation\".<ref>[http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/101/a174.html dCst. art. 174]</ref>\n\nWhen the Constitution was written, [[constitutional democracy]] was still in its infancy, and the [[Founding Fathers|founding fathers]] of Switzerland had little in the way of examples. While they drew heavily on the [[United States Constitution]] for the organisation of the federal state as a whole, they opted for the [[Collegiality|collegial]] rather than the presidential system for the executive branch of government ([[directorial system]]). This accommodated the long tradition of the rule of collective bodies in Switzerland. Under the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime of Switzerland|Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] had been governed by councils of pre-eminent citizens since time immemorial, and the later [[Helvetic Republic]] (with its equivalent Directorate)<ref>See: {{HDS|26424|Directorate}}</ref> as well as the cantons that had given themselves liberal constitutions since the 1830s had also had good experiences with that mode of governance.<ref>{{HDS|10347<!--Section 1-2-->|Departments: Development on the Federal Level}} {{HDS|10093|Collegial System}}</ref>\n\nToday, only three other states, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Andorra]] and [[San Marino]], have collective rather than unitary heads of state. However the collegial system of government has found widespread adoption in modern [[democracy|democracies]] in the form of [[cabinet government]] with collective responsibility.\n\n=== Changes in composition ===\n[[File:Sitzverteilung Bundesrat.png|thumb|500px|Compostition of the Federal Council by political party, 1919 to 2017]]\nThe 1848 constitutional provision providing for the Federal Council{{spaced ndash}}and indeed the institution of the Council itself{{spaced ndash}}has remained unchanged to this day, even though Swiss society has changed profoundly since.\n\n==== Party representation ====\n\n===== Free Democratic hegemony, 1848\u201391 =====\n{{See also|Switzerland as a federal state}}\nThe 1848 Constitution was one of the few successes of the Europe-wide democratic [[revolutions of 1848]]. In Switzerland, the democratic movement was led{{spaced ndash}}and the new federal state decisively shaped{{spaced ndash}}by the ''Radicals'' (presently the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Free Democratic Party]], FDP). After winning the ''[[Sonderbund War]]'' (the Swiss civil war) against the Catholic cantons, the Radicals at first used their majority in the [[Swiss Federal Assembly|Federal Assembly]] to fill all the seats on the Federal Council. This made their former war opponents, the ''Catholic-Conservatives'' (presently the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]], CVP), the [[opposition party]]. Only after [[Emil Welti]]'s resignation in 1891 after a failed referendum on [[Swiss Federal Railways|railway]] [[nationalisation]] did the Radicals decide to [[co-optation|co-opt]] the Conservatives by supporting the election of [[Josef Zemp]].\n\n===== Emerging coalition government, 1891\u20131959 =====\nThe process of involving all major political movements of Switzerland into the responsibility of government continued during the first half of the 20th century. It was hastened by the FDP's and CVP's gradually diminishing voter shares, complemented by the rise of new parties of lesser power at the ends of the [[political spectrum]]. These were the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] (SP) on the [[Left-wing|Left]] and the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB; presently the [[Swiss People's Party|People's Party]], SVP) on the [[Right-wing|Right]]. In due course, the CVP received its second seat in 1919 with [[Jean-Marie Musy]], while the BGB joined the Council in 1929 with [[Rudolf Minger]]. In 1943, during World War II, the Social Democrats were also temporarily included with [[Ernst Nobs]].\n\n=====Grand coalition, 1959\u20132003=====\n{{Main|Magic formula}}\nThe 1959 elections, following the resignation of four Councillors, finally established the ''[[Zauberformel]]'', the \"magical formula\" that determined the Council's composition during the rest of the 20th century and established the long-standing nature of the Council as a permanent, voluntary [[grand coalition]].<ref name=\"zaubeformel\">{{HDS|10097|Zauberformel}}</ref> In approximate relation to the parties' respective strength in the Federal Assembly, the seats were distributed as follows:\n* [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP): 2 members,\n* [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (CVP): 2 members,\n* [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] (SP): 2 members, and\n* [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP): 1 member.\nDuring that time, the FDP and CVP very slowly but steadily kept losing voter share to the SVP and SP, respectively, which overtook the older parties in popularity during the 1990s.\n\n=====End of the grand coalition, 2008=====\n:{{Main|Swiss Federal Council election, 2007}}\nThe governmental balance was changed after the 2003 elections, when the SVP was granted a Council seat for their leader [[Christoph Blocher]] that had formerly belonged to the CVP's [[Ruth Metzler]]. Due to controversies surrounding his conduct in office, a narrow Assembly majority did not reelect Blocher in 2007 and chose instead [[Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf]], a more moderate SVP politician, against party policy. This led to a split of the SVP in 2008. After liberal regional SVP groups including Federal Councillors Widmer-Schlumpf and [[Samuel Schmid]] founded a new [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland|Conservative Democratic Party]], the SVP was left in opposition for the first time since 1929, but returned into the Council with the election of [[Ueli Maurer]] on 10 December 2008, who regained the seat previously held by Schmid, who had resigned. The SVP regained its second seat on the Council [[2015 Swiss Federal Council election|in 2015]], when Widmer-Schlumpf decided to resign after the SVP's large election gains [[2015 Swiss federal election|in the 2015 election]], being replaced by [[Guy Parmelin]].<ref>{{cite web | last1=Jaberg | first1=Samuel | last2=Stephens | first2=Thomas | title=Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf to Stand Down | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/exit-of-eveline-widmer-schlumpf_a-minister-who-symbolised-the-end-of-banking-secrecy/41745150 | date=28 October 2015 | website=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Gains\">{{cite web | last1=Mombelli | first1=Armando | title=People\u2019s Party Gains Second Seat in Cabinet | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/cabinet-elections_how-will-new-ingredients-change--magic-formula--/41825058 | date=10 December 2015 | website=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Women on the council ====\nWomen gained [[Women's suffrage|suffrage]] on the federal level in 1971. They remained unrepresented in the Federal Council for three further legislatures, until the 1984 election of [[Elisabeth Kopp]].\nIn 1983, the failed election of the first official female candidate, [[Lilian Uchtenhagen]] and again in 1993 the failed election of [[Christiane Brunner]] (both SP/PS), was controversial and the Social Democrats each time considered withdrawing from the Council altogether.<ref name=\"zaubeformel\"/>\n\nThere were two female Councillors serving simultaneously for the first time in 2006, and three out of seven Councillors were women from 2007 till 2010, when [[Simonetta Sommaruga]] was elected as the fourth woman in government in place of [[Moritz Leuenberger]], putting men in minority for the first time in history. Also remarkable is the fact that the eighth non-voting member of government, the Chancellor, who sets the government agenda, was also a woman.\n\nIn total, there have been nine female Councillors in the period 1989 to present:\n\n*The first woman Councillor, [[Elisabeth Kopp]] (FDP/PRD), elected 1984, resigned in 1989.\n*[[Ruth Dreifuss]] (SP/PS), served from 1993 to 2002, was the first woman to become President of the Confederation in 1999.\n*[[Ruth Metzler]] (Metzler-Arnold at the time) (CVP/PDC), served from 1999 to 2003 and was not re-elected to a 2nd term (see above).\n*[[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] (SP/PS), elected in 2003 and [[Doris Leuthard]] (CVP/PDC), elected in 2006, were the first two women serving simultaneously. Both were reelected in December 2007 for a four-year term.\n*[[Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf]] was elected in December 2007 and served until December 2015.\n*[[Simonetta Sommaruga]] was elected in September 2010. Together with Micheline Calmy-Rey, Doris Leuthard and Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, women had the majority in the Federal Council for the first time, until January 2012, when [[Alain Berset]] replaced Micheline Calmy-Rey.<ref name= \"Swissinfo 2010\">{{cite web|title=Elections produce female majority in cabinet|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/election_cabinet/Elections_produce_female_majority_in_cabinet.html?cid=28376382|work=Swissinfo.ch|publisher=SRG SSR Id\u00e9e Suisse|accessdate=22 September 2010|date=22 September 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Karin Keller-Sutter]] and [[Viola Amherd]] were elected on 5 December 2018.\n\n==== Regional balancing acts ====\nUntil 1999, the Constitution mandated that no canton could have more than one representative on the Federal Council. Until 1987, the place of origin was used to determine which canton a Federal Councilor was from. After 1987, the place of residence (or, for councilors who were previously members of the Federal Assembly or of a Canton's legislative or executive body, the canton from which they were elected) became the determinant factor.<ref>See {{HDS|10085|Federal Council}}</ref> Nothing prevented candidates from moving to politically expedient cantons, though, and the rule was abandoned in 1999. Since then, the Constitution has mandated an equitable distribution of seats among the cantons and language regions of the country, without setting concrete quotas. Whenever a member resigns, he/she is generally replaced by someone who is not only from the same party, but also the same language region. In 2006, however, [[Joseph Deiss]], a French Swiss, resigned and was succeeded by [[Doris Leuthard]], a German-speaking Swiss, and in 2016, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, German-speaking, was succeeded by Guy Parmelin, a French Swiss.\n\nHistorically, at least two Council seats have always been held by French- or Italian-speaking Swiss. As of 2016 two members of the Federal Council are from the Canton of Berne; previously, there had never been more than one Federal Councillor per Canton in the Federal Council. From 2003 to 2007, however, two of the members of the Federal Council, [[Moritz Leuenberger]] and [[Christoph Blocher]], have resided in the [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich]]. In the 2010 election, the two new Councillors [[Simonetta Sommaruga]] and [[Johann Schneider-Ammann]] were both from the [[Canton of Bern]].<ref name=\"Swissinfo 2010\" />\n\nThe language makeup of the Council as of 2017 is four German speakers, two French speakers, and one Italian speaker. In November 2017, Ignazio Cassis became the first Italian speaker to serve on the Council since 1999.\n\n== Operation of the Federal Council ==\n[[File:Bundeshaus West Vestib\u00fcl und Vorzimmer.jpg|thumb|The interior of the west wing of the [[Federal Palace]] in Berne, where the Council meetings are held.]]\n[[File:Bundesratszimmer.jpg|thumb|]]\n\n=== Presidency ===\nEach year, one of the seven Councillors is elected by the [[United Federal Assembly]] as ''[[President of the Swiss Confederation|President of the Confederation]]''.<ref name=\"guide 42\">{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |page= 42 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> The Federal Assembly also elects a Vice President. By convention, the positions of President and Vice President rotate annually, each Councillor thus becoming Vice President and then President every seven years while in office.\n\nAccording to the [[Swiss order of precedence]], the President of the Confederation is the highest-ranking Swiss official. He/She presides over Council meetings and carries out certain representative functions that, in other countries, are the business of a head of state.<ref name=\"guide 43\"/> In urgent situations where a Council decision cannot be made in time, he is empowered to act on behalf of the whole Council. Apart from that, though, he is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', having no power above and beyond the other six Councillors.<ref name=\"guide 42\"/>\n\nThe President is not the Swiss head of state; this function is carried out by the Council ''in corpore'', that is, in its entirety. However, it has recently become usual that the President acts and is recognized as head of state while conducting official visits abroad, as the Council (also by convention) does not leave the country ''in corpore''. More often, though, official visits abroad are carried out by the Councillor who is head of the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]. Visiting heads of state are received by the Federal Council ''in corpore''.\n\n=== Council meetings ===\n[[File:Bundesrat (Schweiz) im Sitzungszimmer.jpg|thumb|Before a meeting 1987]]\nThe Federal Council operates mainly through weekly meetings, which are held each Wednesday at the [[Federal Palace]] in [[Bern]].,<ref name=\"guide 43\">{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |page= 43 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> the seat of the Swiss [[Politics of Switzerland|federal government]].\n\nApart from the seven Councillors, the following officials also attend the meetings:\n*[[Swiss Federal Chancellor|Federal Chancellor]] [[Walter Thurnherr]]. As government chief of staff and head of the [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland|Federal Chancellery]], he participates in the discussion but has no vote in the Council's decisions.<ref name=\"guide 43\"/> Nonetheless, his influential position is often referred to as that of an \"eighth Federal Councillor\".\n* the Vice-Chancellor: [[Andr\u00e9 Simonazzi]]. Simonazzi is the [[spokesman]] of the Federal Council and conducts the weekly press briefing after the meeting.\n* the Vice-Chancellor: [[Viktor Rossi]] who is in charge of the Federal Council sector within the Swiss Federal Chancellery.\n\nAfter the meetings, the Councillors take lunch together. The Council also meets regularly in [[wiktionary:conclave|conclave]] to discuss important topics at length, and annually conducts what is colloquially referred to as its \"[[field trip]]\", a day trip to some attractions in the President's home canton. In that and other respects, the Council operates not unlike a board of directors of a major corporation.\n\n=== Decisions and responsibilities ===\nEach Federal Councillor heads a government department, much like the ministers in the governments of other countries.<ref name=\"guide 44\">{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |pages= 44\u201345 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Colloquially and by the press, they are often referred to as ministers, e.g. the head of the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports|DDPS]] as \"minister of defence\", even though no such post officially exists. However, as Council members, they are not only responsible for their own department, but also for the business of their colleagues' departments as well, and for the conduct of the government and the federal administration as a whole.\n\nDecisions to be taken by the Council are always prepared by the responsible department.<ref name=\"guide 43\"/> For example, a change in the salaries of federal employees would be proposed to the council by the head of the [[Federal Department of Finance]], to whose department the Federal Office of Personnel belongs. Before a vote is taken at a Council meeting, though, all proposals are circulated in writing to the heads of departments, who commission the senior career officials of their department \u2013 the heads of the Federal Offices \u2013 to prepare a written response to offer criticism and suggestions. This is called the ''co-report procedure'' (''Mitberichtsverfahren''/''proc\u00e9dure de co-rapport''), designed to build a wide consensus ahead of a Council meeting.<ref name=\"guide 46\">{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |page= 46 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for important decisions, an additional public consultation is sometimes conducted, to which the cantons, the [[Political parties of Switzerland|political parties]] and major interest groups are invited, and in which all members of the public can participate. If a change in a federal [[statute]] is to be proposed to the Federal Assembly, this step is mandated by law. In such cases, the consultation procedure also serves to identify political concerns that could later be the focus of a [[Referendums by country#Switzerland|popular referendum]] to stop passage of the bill at issue.\n\nThe decisions themselves are formally taken by [[voice vote]] by a majority of the Councillors present at a meeting. However, the great majority of decisions are arrived at by [[consensus]]; even though lately there is said to be a trend towards more contentious discussions and close votes.{{By whom|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== Secrecy ===\nThe meetings of the Federal Council and the result of the votes taken are not open to the public, and the records remain sealed for 50 years. This has lately been the subject of some criticism. In particular, the parties at the ends of the [[political spectrum]] argue that this secrecy is contrary to the principle of [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]]. However, the Council has always maintained that secrecy is necessary to arrive at consensus and to preserve the [[collegiality]] and political independence of the individual Councillors.\n\n=== Constitutional conventions ===\nDue to the Federal Council's unique nature as a voluntary [[grand coalition]] of political opponents, its operation is subject to numerous [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]]. Most notable is the principle of [[collegiality]]; that is, the Councillors are not supposed to publicly criticise one another, even though they are often political opponents. In effect, they are expected to publicly support all decisions of the Council, even against their own personal opinion or that of their political party.<ref name=\"guide 43\"/> In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained after the 2003 elections (see below).\n\n== Election and composition ==\n{{Main|Swiss Federal Council election}}\n\n11 December 2019, 11:33:\n\n* Simonatta Somaruga (SP) became President of the Federal Republic for the second time in 2020 with 186 votes out of 200.\n* Guy Parmelin (SVP) by 191 votes - becomes vice-president by 168 votes - Minister for Economic Affairs\n* Ignazio Cassis (FDP) with 145 votes - Foreign Minister\n* Viola Amherd (CVP) with 218 votes - Minister of Defence\n* Alain Berset (SP) with 214 votes - Minister of the Interior\n* Ueli Maurer (SVP) with 213 votes - Finance Minister\n* Karin Keller-Sutter (FDP) with only 169 votes - Minister of Justice\n* Federal Chancellor Walter Thurnherr (CDP). 219 votes\n\n=== Election mode ===\n[[File:Bundesratswahl 2009 - Applaus.jpg|thumb|[[2006 Swiss Federal Council election|2006 election]] of the Federal Council in the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]]]]\nThe members of the Federal Council are elected for a term of four years by both chambers of the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]] sitting together as the United Federal Assembly. Each officeholder is elected individually by [[secret ballot]] by an [[absolute majority]] of votes. Every adult Swiss citizen is eligible, but in practice, only Members of Parliament or more rarely, members of cantonal governments are nominated by the political parties and receive a substantial number of votes. The voting is conducted in several rounds, under a form of [[exhaustive ballot]]: in the first two rounds, anyone can enter their name; in subsequent rounds, the person receiving the fewest votes is removed from the race until one candidate gains an absolute majority.\n\nUsually, the party which has a seat to fill presents two candidates with mainstream viewpoints to the United Federal Assembly, which then chooses one. This was not so, however, during the 2003 election, which was the most controversial in recent memory (see also above).\n\nOnce elected, Councillors remain members of their political parties, but hold no leading office with them. In fact, they usually maintain a certain political distance from the party leadership, because under the rules of [[collegiality]], they will often have to publicly promote a Council decision which does not match the political conviction of their party (or of themselves).\n\n=== Resignation ===\nOnce elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors can neither be voted out of office by a [[motion of no confidence]] nor can they be [[Impeachment|impeached]]. Re-election is possible for an indefinite number of terms, and it has historically been extremely rare for Parliament not to re-elect a sitting Councillor. This has only happened four times \u2013 to [[Ulrich Ochsenbein]] in 1854, to [[Jean-Jacques Challet-Venel]] in 1872, to [[Ruth Metzler-Arnold]] in 2003 and to [[Christoph Blocher]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Swiss Confederation a brief guide 2008 |last= Information services of the Federal Chancellery |year= 2008 |page= 13 |url= http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |access-date= 10 March 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311133035/http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/02480/04712/index.html?lang=en |archive-date= 11 March 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.\n\n== Status of Federal Councillors ==\n[[File:Bundesrat der Schweiz 2008 Teil 1.JPG|thumb|Faces in the Crowd: In keeping with the spirit of Swiss [[direct democracy]], the 2008 official photograph of the Federal Council depicted them as [[Everyman|everymen]].]]\n\n=== Councillors' lives ===\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Holds Press Availability with Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis (47991315853).jpg|thumb|Federal Councillor [[Ignazio Cassis]] speaks in 2019 accompanied by a ''Bundesweibel'']]\nUnlike most senior members of government in other countries, the Federal Councillors are not entitled to an [[official residence]] (however, the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland|Federal Palace]] houses living apartments for both the [[Federal Chancellor of Switzerland|Federal Chancellor]] and [[President of the Swiss Confederation|President of the Confederation]]).

The Sand Springs Fire Department was founded in 1913. Town Marshal Robert Fleenor was elected fire chief of the Sand Springs Volunteer Fire Department. In March 1913, the bucket brigade was replaced with 500 feet of fire hose purchased by the city. [[Charles Page]] donated another 500 feet of hose. Chief Fleenor had a team of horses to pull a fire wagon.<ref>https://www.sandspringsok.org/137/History</ref><ref>https://www.tulsaworld.com/communities/sandsprings/news/history-of-the-sand-springs-fire-department/article_adb4fe06-ad93-508c-a3a8-1b7887259741.html</ref> The horses were used to pull the fire wagon until their stable caught fire in 1915. There are currently 32 full-time, unionized Sand Springs firefighters that are at the stations. They are always reportedly \"on the line\".<ref>http://wearesandsprings.com/sandites-service-fire-department/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandspringsok.org/137/History|title=History - Then and Now &#124; Sand Springs, OK - Official Website|website=www.sandspringsok.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firedepartment.net/directory/oklahoma/tulsa-county/sand-springs/sand-springs-fire-department|title=Sand Springs Fire Department - Sand Springs, OK|website=FireDepartment.net}}</ref>\n\n==Early Fire Fighters==\nIn 1921, the Sand Springs Fire Department had one paid firefighter [[Chief C.G. Stricklen]] and 9 volunteer firefighters who were paid for a response. In 1928, the fire department had 3 paid firefighters. This firefighter was lost in 1936 when staffing was cut to 2 firefighters. In 1950 they had 5 full-time firefighters, and in 1957 they added 2 more bringing the number up to 7 full-time and 15 volunteers. The Sand Springs Fire Department employees climbed to 28 paid firefighters.

Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute (DSHMRI) Archives</ref>\n \nIn accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as \"Class Battalions\" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers.

There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1004\u103a\u1038)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1001\u103d\u1032)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1005\u102f)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.\n \nWith its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1019\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a(\u1000\u103c\u100a\u103a\u1038)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html# |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n \n===Expansion===\nThe first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>\n \nThe most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.\n \n===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===\n[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]\n[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]\nBureau of Special Operations ({{my|\u1000\u102c\u1000\u103d\u101a\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038\u100c\u102c\u1014 \u1005\u1005\u103a\u1006\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1021\u1016\u103d\u1032\u1037}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.\n \nThe units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.\n \nOriginally, the bureau was for \"special operations\", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.\n \nInitially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.\n \nCurrently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until 1961, there were only two regional commands, they were supported by 13 Infantry brigades and an infantry division. In October 1961, new regional military commands were opened and leaving only two independent infantry brigades. In June 1963, the Naypyidaw Command was temporarily formed in [[Yangon]] with the deputy commander and some staff officers drawn from Central Command.  It was reorganised and renamed as Yangon Command on 1 June 1965.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nA total of 337 infantry and light infantry battalions organised in Tactical Operations Commands, 37 independent field artillery regiments supported by affiliated support units including armoured [[reconnaissance]] and [[tank]] battalions.

MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nIn 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command has completed installation of optical fibre communication network throughout the country. Those network are to be used for Air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital & several air bases, early warning radar stations & mobile anti air craft missile & artillery units. After completion of fibre optic project & radar stations, MIADS (Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System) becomes the most advance AD system in the region.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nEach Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.\n \nEach Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.\n \nEach fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguardi]]Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It consisted HQ Burma Signals, Burma Signal Training Squadron (BSTS) and Burma Signals Squadron.  HQ Burma Signals was located within War Office.  BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.\n \nIn 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).\n \nBy 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.\n \nIn 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system. [[Satellite communication|Satellite communication links]] are also provided to forward-deployed infantry battalions. However, battle field communication systems are still poor. Infantry units are still using TRA 906 and PRM 4051 which were acquired from UK in the 1980s. Myanmar Army also uses the locally built TRA 906 Thura and Chinese XD-D6M radio sets. Frequency hopping handsets are fitted to all front line units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/|title=Burmanet \" Jane's Intelligence Review: Radio active \u2013 Desmond Ball and Samuel Blythe|accessdate=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206031853/http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/#|archive-date=6 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \nBetween 2000 and 2005, Myanmar army bought 50 units of Brett 2050 Advanced Tech radio set from Aussie through third party from Singapore.

Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute (DSHMRI) Archives</ref>\n \nIn accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as \"Class Battalions\" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers. All services including military engineers, supply and transport, ordnance and medical services, Navy and Air Force were all commanded by former Officers from ABRO and British Burma Army.<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\"/>\n \n \n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Ethnic and Army Composition of Tatmadaw in 1948\n|-\n!

There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1004\u103a\u1038)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1001\u103d\u1032)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1005\u102f)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.\n \nWith its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1019\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a(\u1000\u103c\u100a\u103a\u1038)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html# |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n \n===Expansion===\nThe first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>\n \nThe most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.\n \n===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===\n[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]\n[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]\nBureau of Special Operations ({{my|\u1000\u102c\u1000\u103d\u101a\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038\u100c\u102c\u1014 \u1005\u1005\u103a\u1006\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1021\u1016\u103d\u1032\u1037}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.\n \nThe units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.\n \nOriginally, the bureau was for \"special operations\", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.\n \nInitially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.\n \nCurrently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until 1961, there were only two regional commands, they were supported by 13 Infantry brigades and an infantry division. In October 1961, new regional military commands were opened and leaving only two independent infantry brigades. In June 1963, the Naypyidaw Command was temporarily formed in [[Yangon]] with the deputy commander and some staff officers drawn from Central Command.  It was reorganised and renamed as Yangon Command on 1 June 1965.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nA total of 337 infantry and light infantry battalions organised in Tactical Operations Commands, 37 independent field artillery regiments supported by affiliated support units including armoured [[reconnaissance]] and [[tank]] battalions.

It was renamed Bureau of Air Defence in the early 2000s (decade). In early 2000, Tatmadaw established Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System (MIADS) with help from Russia, [[Ukraine]] and China. It is a tri-service bureau with units from all three branches of Myanmar Armed Forces. All Air Defence assets except [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] within Tatmadaw arsenal are integrated into MIADS. AAA guns are mostly unguided and deploy to use in barrage-style firing against attacking aircraft. MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nIn 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command has completed installation of optical fibre communication network throughout the country. Those network are to be used for Air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital & several air bases, early warning radar stations & mobile anti air craft missile & artillery units. After completion of fibre optic project & radar stations, MIADS (Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System) becomes the most advance AD system in the region.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nEach Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.\n \nEach Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.\n \nEach fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguardi]]Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It consisted HQ Burma Signals, Burma Signal Training Squadron (BSTS) and Burma Signals Squadron.  HQ Burma Signals was located within War Office.  BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.\n \nIn 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).\n \nBy 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.\n \nIn 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system. [[Satellite communication|Satellite communication links]] are also provided to forward-deployed infantry battalions. However, battle field communication systems are still poor. Infantry units are still using TRA 906 and PRM 4051 which were acquired from UK in the 1980s. Myanmar Army also uses the locally built TRA 906 Thura and Chinese XD-D6M radio sets. Frequency hopping handsets are fitted to all front line units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/|title=Burmanet \" Jane's Intelligence Review: Radio active \u2013 Desmond Ball and Samuel Blythe|accessdate=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206031853/http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/#|archive-date=6 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \nBetween 2000 and 2005, Myanmar army bought 50 units of Brett 2050 Advanced Tech radio set from Aussie through third party from Singapore.
