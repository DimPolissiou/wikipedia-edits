The name of \"Hatsune Miku\" was conceived soon after the Vocaloid 2 announcements, when an English and Japanese vocal were developed for the character. The intended design was delayed and later used for [[Megurine Luka]] instead.

The pitch of the samples was to be altered by the synthesizer engine and constructed into a keyboard-style instrument within the Vocaloid software.\n\nCrypton released Hatsune Miku on August 31, 2007.

Miku is the protagonist of a manga series named ''[[Maker Hik\u014dshiki Hatsune Mix]]'', written by Kei Gar\u014d. The manga explores the many possibilities of story-telling and has featured numerous adventures, ranging from giant-sized battles with Hatsune Miku to home exploits. There is therefore no single storyline, and the entire setting within the manga is unofficial. During an episode of ''[[Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei|Zoku Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei]]'', Miku is seen auditioning for the voice of Meru Otonashi ([[Kagamine Rin/Len|Kagamine Rin and Len]] are referenced in the same episode). Miku's voice is used in one of the ending themes for the anime series ''[[Akikan!]]'' (episode 12). Moreover, she also sings the ending theme for the anime ''[[Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories]]'', called {{Nihongo|\"Kaikai Emaki\"|\u602a\u3005\u7d75\u5dfb}}. During an episode in the ''[[Lucky Star (manga)|Lucky Star]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]], Kagami Hiiragi gets magically transformed into Miku [[cosplay]]. A character in the anime ''[[K\u00e4mpfer]]'' appears dressed as Miku in episode seven. She also appeared in the large plasma screen in ''[[Chrome Shelled Regios]]'' as an endorser. She also appears in episode 11 of ''[[Baka and Test]]'' as a member of class B. Miku also appears in ''[[Maria Holic]]'' episode 12, when the class is told they have a swim meet. Miku also appears in episode 1 of ''[[Him\u014dto! Umaru-chan]]'', in an imagination of what the main character wants to buy. A parody of Miku is also seen in ''[[Gintama]]'' (episode 237) in the second editor of Gintaman, Daito's anime fantasies. A character based on her likeness also appeared in the anime ''[[Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion|Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion the Animation]]'' as a recurring character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/12/27/hatsune-miku-breaks-into-voice-acting-on-shinkansen-henkei-robo-shinkalion|title=Hatsune Miku Breaks Into Voice Acting on \"Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion\"|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=December 27, 2017|accessdate=June 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA series of [[rhythm game]]s starting from ''[[Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA (video game)|Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA]]'' were produced by [[Sega]] under license using Hatsune Miku and other Crypton Vocaloids, as well as \"fan-made\" Vocaloids like Akita Neru.

The name of \"Hatsune Miku\" was conceived soon after the Vocaloid 2 announcements, when an English and Japanese vocal were developed for the character. The intended design was delayed and later used for [[Megurine Luka]] instead.

The pitch of the samples was to be altered by the synthesizer engine and constructed into a keyboard-style instrument within the Vocaloid software.\n\nCrypton released Hatsune Miku on August 31, 2007.

Miku is the protagonist of a manga series named ''[[Maker Hik\u014dshiki Hatsune Mix]]'', written by Kei Gar\u014d. The manga explores the many possibilities of story-telling and has featured numerous adventures, ranging from giant-sized battles with Hatsune Miku to home exploits. There is therefore no single storyline, and the entire setting within the manga is unofficial. During an episode of ''[[Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei|Zoku Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei]]'', Miku is seen auditioning for the voice of Meru Otonashi ([[Kagamine Rin/Len|Kagamine Rin and Len]] are referenced in the same episode). Miku's voice is used in one of the ending themes for the anime series ''[[Akikan!]]'' (episode 12). Moreover, she also sings the ending theme for the anime ''[[Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories]]'', called {{Nihongo|\"Kaikai Emaki\"|\u602a\u3005\u7d75\u5dfb}}. During an episode in the ''[[Lucky Star (manga)|Lucky Star]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]], Kagami Hiiragi gets magically transformed into Miku [[cosplay]].

A parody of Miku is also seen in ''[[Gintama]]'' (episode 237) in the second editor of Gintaman, Daito's anime fantasies.
