This makes it unsuitable for [[chemical engineering]] calculations, e.g. in [[drying]], where temperature can vary considerably.  As a result, absolute humidity in chemical engineering may refer to mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also known as the ''humidity ratio'' or ''mass mixing ratio'' (see \"specific humidity\" below), which is better suited for heat and mass balance calculations.  Mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above is also defined as ''volumetric humidity''.  Because of the potential confusion, [[British Standard]] BS 1339 <ref name=\"BS1339\">British Standard BS 1339 (revised), Humidity and Dewpoint, Parts 1-3 (2002-2007)</ref>  suggests avoiding the term \"absolute humidity\".  Units should always be carefully checked.

As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass.\n\n==Measurement==\n[[File:Umidaderelativa.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[hygrometer]]]]\nA device used to measure humidity is called a psychrometer or [[hygrometer]]. A [[humidistat]] is a humidity-triggered switch, often used to control a [[dehumidifier]].\n\nThere are various devices used to measure and regulate humidity. Calibration standards for the most accurate measurement include the [[gravimetric hygrometer]], [[chilled mirror hygrometer]], and [[electrolytic hygrometer]].  The gravimetric method, while the most accurate, is very cumbersome. For fast and very accurate measurement the chilled mirror method is effective.<ref>Pieter R. Wiederhold. 1997. Water Vapor Measurement, Methods and Instrumentation. Marcel Dekker, New York, NY {{ISBN|9780824793197}}</ref>  For process on-line measurements, the most commonly used sensors nowadays are based on [[capacitance]] measurements to measure relative humidity<ref>\"BS1339\" Part 3</ref>, frequently with internal conversions to display absolute humidity as well. These are cheap, simple, generally accurate and relatively robust.  All humidity sensors face problems in measuring dust-laden gas, such as exhaust streams from [[Clothes dryer|dryer]]s.\n\nHumidity is also measured on a global scale using remotely placed [[satellite]]s. These satellites are able to detect the [[concentration]] of water in the [[troposphere]] at altitudes between 4 and 12 kilometres. Satellites that can measure water vapor have sensors that are sensitive to [[infrared|infrared radiation]]. Water vapor specifically absorbs and re-radiates radiation in this spectral band. Satellite water vapor imagery plays an important role in monitoring climate conditions (like the formation of thunderstorms) and in the development of [[weather forecasts]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{tone|date=September 2016}}\n{{See also|Precipitation (meteorology)|Humid subtropical climate}}\nWhile humidity itself is a climate variable, it also overpowers other climate variables. The humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall.\n\nThe most humid cities on earth are generally located closer to the equator, near coastal regions. Cities in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] are among the most humid. [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Metro Manila|Manila]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Singapore]] have very high humidity all year round because of their proximity to water bodies and the [[equator]] and often overcast weather. Some places experience extreme humidity during their rainy seasons combined with warmth giving the feel of a lukewarm sauna, such as [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]] and [[Cochin]] in [[India]], and [[Lahore]] in [[Pakistan]]. [[Sukkur]] city located on the [[Indus River]] in Pakistan has some of the highest and most uncomfortable [[dew point]]s in the country, frequently exceeding {{convert|30|C|F|}} in the [[Monsoon]] season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPSK/2013/7/6/DailyHistory.html|title=Weather History for Sukkur, Pakistan \u2013 Weather Underground|publisher=}}</ref> High temperatures combine with the high dew point to create heat index in excess of {{convert|65|C|F|}}. [[Darwin, Australia]] experiences an extremely humid wet season from December to April. [[Shanghai]] and [[Hong Kong]] also have an extreme humid period in their summer months. During the South-west and North-east Monsoon seasons (respectively, late May to September and November to March), expect heavy rains and a relatively high humidity post-rainfall. Outside the monsoon seasons, humidity is high (in comparison to countries further from the Equator), but completely sunny days abound. In cooler places such as Northern Tasmania, Australia, high humidity is experienced all year due to the ocean between mainland Australia and Tasmania. In the summer the hot dry air is absorbed by this ocean and the temperature rarely climbs above {{convert|35|C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Global climate ===\n{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}\nHumidity affects the [[energy budget]] and thereby influences temperatures in two major ways. First, water vapor in the atmosphere contains \"latent\" energy. During transpiration or evaporation, this [[latent heat]] is removed from surface liquid, cooling the earth's surface. This is the biggest non-radiative cooling effect at the surface. It compensates for roughly 70% of the average net radiative warming at the surface.\n\nSecond, water vapor is the most abundant of all [[greenhouse gases]]. Water vapor, like a green lens that allows green light to pass through it but absorbs red light, is a \"selective absorber\". Along with other greenhouse gases, water vapor is transparent to most solar energy, as one can literally see. But it absorbs the infrared energy emitted (radiated) upward by the earth's surface, which is the reason that humid areas experience very little nocturnal cooling but dry desert regions cool considerably at night. This selective absorption causes the greenhouse effect. It raises the surface temperature substantially above its theoretical radiative equilibrium temperature with the sun, and water vapor is the cause of more of this warming than any other greenhouse gas.\n\nUnlike most other greenhouse gases, however, water is not merely below its boiling point in all regions of the Earth, but below its freezing point at many altitudes.  As a condensible greenhouse gas, it [[Precipitation|precipitates]], with a much lower [[scale height]] and shorter atmospheric lifetime- weeks instead of decades.  Without other greenhouse gases, Earth's [[blackbody temperature]], below the freezing point of water, would cause water vapor to be removed from the atmosphere.<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.saga.iao.ru/glossary/?catalog=9&sowa=All&term=@1621 |title=Blackbody Radiation}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~abragg/109/L14.html |title=Lecture notes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://storm.colorado.edu//~toohey/lecture8.html |title=Radiative Balance, Earth's Temperature, and Greenhouse Gases (lecture notes)}}</ref>  Water vapor is thus a \"slave\" to the non-condensible greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geosc10/l12_p7.html | title=GEOSC 10 Optional Enrichment Article 1 | author=Alley, R. | date=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/businger/courses/notes101/28ModelingClimate.pdf |title=Lecture 28: Future Global Warming Modeling Climate Change |author=Businger, S. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130212102/http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/businger/courses/notes101/28ModelingClimate.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/eschwiet/essays/greenhouse_ASTR555.pdf | title=Comparing the Greenhouse Effect on Earth, Mars, Venus, and Titan: Present Day and through Time | author=Schwieterman, E.}}</ref>\n\n==Air density and volume==\n{{Main article|Volume (thermodynamics)|Density of air}}\n\nHumidity depends on water vaporization and condensation, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the [[ideal gas law]]. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviate from predicted by the ideal gas law. Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed as the dry volume, excluding the humidity content. This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary the saturated volume is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% relative humidity).\n\nHumid air is less dense than dry air because a molecule of water ([[molecular mass|M]] \u2248 18 [[atomic mass unit|u]]) is less massive than either a molecule of [[nitrogen]] (M \u2248 28) or a molecule of [[oxygen]] (M \u2248 32). About 78% of  the molecules in dry air are nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). Another 21% of the molecules in dry air are oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The final 1% of dry air is a mixture of other gases.\n\nFor any gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules present in a particular volume is constant \u2013 see [[ideal gas law]]. So when water molecules (vapor) are introduced into that volume of dry air, the number of air molecules in the volume must decrease by the same number, if the temperature and pressure remain constant.  (The addition of water molecules, or any other molecules, to a gas, without removal of an equal number of other molecules, will necessarily require a change in temperature, pressure, or total volume; that is, a change in ''at least'' one of these three parameters.  If temperature and pressure remain constant, the volume increases, and the dry air molecules that were displaced will initially move out into the additional volume, after which the mixture will eventually become uniform through diffusion.)  Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas\u2014its density\u2014decreases. [[Isaac Newton]] discovered this phenomenon and wrote about it in his book ''[[Opticks]]''.<ref name=\"optics\">\n{{cite book\n|author=Isaac Newton\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTpXLrPR2TQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isaac+newton+optics\n|publisher=Dover\n|title=Opticks\n|year=1704\n|isbn=978-0-486-60205-9\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n\n===Animal and plant life===\nHumidity is one of the fundamental [[abiotic factor]]s that defines any habitat (the tundra, wetlands, and the desert are a few examples), and is a determinant of which animals and plants can thrive in a given environment.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 ''Abiotic factor''. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland.

Washington DC</ref>\n\nThe human body dissipates heat through perspiration and its evaporation. [[Heat convection]], to the surrounding air, and [[thermal radiation]] are the primary modes of heat transport from the body. Under conditions of high humidity, the rate of evaporation of sweat from the skin decreases. Also, if the atmosphere is as warm as or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, [[blood]] brought to the body surface cannot dissipate heat by conduction to the air. With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, less goes to the active [[muscle]]s, the [[Human brain|brain]], and other internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. [[Physical strength]] declines, and [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] occurs sooner than it would otherwise. Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected, resulting in ''heat stroke'' or [[hyperthermia]].\n\n===Human comfort===\nHumans are sensitive to humid air because the human body uses evaporative cooling as the primary mechanism to regulate temperature. Under humid conditions, the ''rate'' at which perspiration evaporates on the skin is lower than it would be under arid conditions. Because humans perceive the rate of heat transfer from the body rather than temperature itself, we feel warmer when the relative humidity is high than when it is low.\n\nSome people experience difficulty breathing in humid environments. Some cases may possibly be related to respiratory conditions such as [[asthma]], while others may be the product of [[anxiety]]. Sufferers will often [[hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] in response, causing sensations of [[numbness]], [[faintness]], and loss of [[Attentional control|concentration]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lung.ca/news/expert-opinions/pollution/heat-and-humidity|title=Heat and humidity - the lung association|author=|date=|website=www.lung.ca|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Air conditioning]] reduces discomfort by reducing not just temperature but humidity as well. Heating cold outdoor air can decrease relative humidity levels indoors to below 30%,<ref>{{cite web|title=Optimum Humidity Levels for Home|url=http://www.airbetter.org/optimum-humidity-levels-home/|website=AirBetter.org|date=3 August 2014}}</ref> leading to ailments such as dry skin, cracked lips, dry eyes and excessive thirst.\n\n===Human health===\nHigher humidity reduces the infectivity of aerosolized influenza virus.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Noti |first1=John D. |last2=Blachere |first2=Francoise M. |last3=McMillen |first3=Cynthia M. |last4=Lindsley |first4=William G. |last5=Kashon |first5=Michael L. |last6=Slaughter |first6=Denzil R. |last7=Beezhold|first7=Donald H. |year=2013 |title=High Humidity Leads to Loss of Infectious Influenza Virus from Simulated Coughs |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=e57485 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...857485N |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0057485 |pmid=23460865}}</ref>\n\n===Electronics===\nElectronic devices are often rated to operate only under specific humidity conditions (e.g., 5% to 95%). At the top end of the range, moisture may increase the conductivity of permeable [[Insulator (electrical)|insulators]] leading to malfunction. Too low humidity may make materials brittle. A particular danger to electronic items, regardless of the stated operating humidity range, is [[condensation]]. When an electronic item is moved from a cold place (e.g. garage, car, shed, an air conditioned space in the tropics) to a warm humid place (house, outside tropics), condensation may coat circuit boards and other insulators, leading to [[short circuit]] inside the equipment. Such short circuits may cause substantial permanent damage if the equipment is powered on before the condensation has [[evaporated]]. A similar condensation effect can often be observed when a person wearing glasses comes in from the cold (i.e. the glasses become foggy).<ref>{{cite web|title=Fogging Glasses|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen01/gen01333.htm}}</ref> It is advisable to allow electronic equipment to acclimatise for several hours, after being brought in from the cold, before powering on. Some electronic devices can detect such a change and indicate, when plugged in and usually with a small droplet symbol, that they cannot be used until the risk from condensation has passed. In situations where time is critical, increasing air flow through the device's internals, such as removing the side panel from a PC case and directing a fan to blow into the case, will reduce significantly the time needed to acclimatise to the new environment.\n\nIn contrast, a very low humidity level favors the build-up of [[static electricity]], which may result in spontaneous shutdown of computers when discharges occur. Apart from spurious erratic function, electrostatic discharges can cause dielectric breakdown in solid state devices, resulting in irreversible damage. [[Data center]]s often monitor relative humidity levels for these reasons.\n\n===Building construction===\nCommon construction methods often produce building enclosures with a poor thermal boundary, requiring an [[Building insulation|insulation]] and air barrier system designed to retain indoor environmental conditions while resisting external environmental conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/name,45205,en.html|title=Free publications|publisher=}}</ref>  The energy-efficient, heavily sealed architecture introduced in the 20th century also sealed off the movement of moisture, and this has resulted in a secondary problem of [[condensation]] forming in and around walls, which encourages the development of mold and mildew. Additionally, buildings with foundations not properly sealed will allow water to flow through the walls due to [[capillary action]] of pores found in masonry products. Solutions for energy-efficient buildings that avoid condensation are a current topic of architecture.\n\n===Industry===\nHigh humidity can often have a negative effect on the capacity of chemical plants and refineries that use furnaces as part of a certain processes (e.g., steam reforming, wet sulfuric acid processes). For example, because humidity reduces ambient oxygen concentrations (dry air is typically 20.9% oxygen, but at 100% relative humidity the air is 20.4% oxygen), flue gas fans must intake air at a higher rate than would otherwise be required to maintain the same firing rate .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.industrialcontrolsonline.com/training/online/everything-you-need-know-about-combustion-chemistry-analysis|title=Everything You Need to Know About Combustion Chemistry & Analysis \u2013 Industrial Controls|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Baking===\nHigh humidity in the oven, represented by an elevated [[wet-bulb temperature]], increases the [[thermal conductivity]] of the air around the baked item, leading to a quicker baking process or even burning. Conversely, low humidity slows the baking process down.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.scienceofcooking.com/why_is_humidity_important_in_cooking.htm | title=Why is humidity important in cooking?}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dew point depression]]\n*[[Humidity indicator]]\n*[[Savory brittleness scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* United States Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/iaq/largebldgs/i-beam_html/ch2-hvac.htm#F2.6 \"IAQ in Large Buildings\"].

As a result, absolute humidity in chemical engineering may refer to mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also known as the ''humidity ratio'' or ''mass mixing ratio'' (see \"specific humidity\" below), which is better suited for heat and mass balance calculations.  Mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above is also defined as ''volumetric humidity''.  Because of the potential confusion, [[British Standard]] BS 1339 <ref name=\"BS1339\">British Standard BS 1339 (revised), Humidity and Dewpoint, Parts 1-3 (2002-2007)</ref>  suggests avoiding the term \"absolute humidity\".  Units should always be carefully checked.  Many humidity charts are given in g/kg or kg/kg, but any mass units may be used.\n\nThe field concerned with the study of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas\u2013vapor mixtures is named [[psychrometrics]].\n\n===Relative humidity===\n{{Main article|Relative humidity}}\n\nThe relative humidity <math>(RH</math> or <math>\\phi)</math>  of an air-water mixture is defined as the ratio of the [[partial pressure]] of water vapor <math> (p_{H_2O}) </math> in the mixture to the [[equilibrium vapor pressure]] of water <math>(p^*_{H_2O})</math> over a flat surface of pure water<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~stevenb/vapor/|title=Water Vapor Myths: A Brief Tutorial|publisher=}}</ref> at a given temperature:<ref name=\"Perry\">Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W, ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'' (7th Edition), [[McGraw-Hill]], {{ISBN|0-07-049841-5}}, Eqn 12-7</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lide |first=David |date=2005 |title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition=85 |url=https://archive.org/details/crchandbookofche81lide/page/15 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/crchandbookofche81lide/page/15 15\u201325] |isbn=0-8493-0485-7 }}</ref>\n\n::<math> \\phi = {p_{H_2O} \\over p^*_{H_2O}}</math>\n\nRelative humidity is normally expressed as a percentage; a higher percentage means that the air-water mixture is more humid.\n\nRelative humidity is an important [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] used in [[weather forecasting|weather forecasts]] and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], dew, or fog.  In hot summer [[weather]], a rise in relative humidity increases the [[heat index|apparent temperature]] to [[human]]s (and other [[animal]]s) by hindering the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin.

As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass.\n\n==Measurement==\n[[File:Umidaderelativa.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[hygrometer]]]]\nA device used to measure humidity is called a psychrometer or [[hygrometer]]. A [[humidistat]] is a humidity-triggered switch, often used to control a [[dehumidifier]].\n\nThere are various devices used to measure and regulate humidity. Calibration standards for the most accurate measurement include the [[gravimetric hygrometer]], [[chilled mirror hygrometer]], and [[electrolytic hygrometer]].  The gravimetric method, while the most accurate, is very cumbersome. For fast and very accurate measurement the chilled mirror method is effective.<ref>Pieter R. Wiederhold. 1997. Water Vapor Measurement, Methods and Instrumentation. Marcel Dekker, New York, NY {{ISBN|9780824793197}}</ref>  For process on-line measurements, the most commonly used sensors nowadays are based on [[capacitance]] measurements to measure relative humidity<ref>\"BS1339\" Part 3</ref>, frequently with internal conversions to display absolute humidity as well. These are cheap, simple, generally accurate and relatively robust.  All humidity sensors face problems in measuring dust-laden gas, such as exhaust streams from [[Clothes dryer|dryer]]s.\n\nHumidity is also measured on a global scale using remotely placed [[satellite]]s. These satellites are able to detect the [[concentration]] of water in the [[troposphere]] at altitudes between 4 and 12 kilometres. Satellites that can measure water vapor have sensors that are sensitive to [[infrared|infrared radiation]]. Water vapor specifically absorbs and re-radiates radiation in this spectral band. Satellite water vapor imagery plays an important role in monitoring climate conditions (like the formation of thunderstorms) and in the development of [[weather forecasts]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{tone|date=September 2016}}\n{{See also|Precipitation (meteorology)|Humid subtropical climate}}\nWhile humidity itself is a climate variable, it also overpowers other climate variables. The humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall.\n\nThe most humid cities on earth are generally located closer to the equator, near coastal regions. Cities in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] are among the most humid. [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Metro Manila|Manila]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Singapore]] have very high humidity all year round because of their proximity to water bodies and the [[equator]] and often overcast weather. Some places experience extreme humidity during their rainy seasons combined with warmth giving the feel of a lukewarm sauna, such as [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]] and [[Cochin]] in [[India]], and [[Lahore]] in [[Pakistan]]. [[Sukkur]] city located on the [[Indus River]] in Pakistan has some of the highest and most uncomfortable [[dew point]]s in the country, frequently exceeding {{convert|30|C|F|}} in the [[Monsoon]] season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPSK/2013/7/6/DailyHistory.html|title=Weather History for Sukkur, Pakistan \u2013 Weather Underground|publisher=}}</ref> High temperatures combine with the high dew point to create heat index in excess of {{convert|65|C|F|}}. [[Darwin, Australia]] experiences an extremely humid wet season from December to April. [[Shanghai]] and [[Hong Kong]] also have an extreme humid period in their summer months. During the South-west and North-east Monsoon seasons (respectively, late May to September and November to March), expect heavy rains and a relatively high humidity post-rainfall. Outside the monsoon seasons, humidity is high (in comparison to countries further from the Equator), but completely sunny days abound. In cooler places such as Northern Tasmania, Australia, high humidity is experienced all year due to the ocean between mainland Australia and Tasmania. In the summer the hot dry air is absorbed by this ocean and the temperature rarely climbs above {{convert|35|C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Global climate ===\n{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}\nHumidity affects the [[energy budget]] and thereby influences temperatures in two major ways. First, water vapor in the atmosphere contains \"latent\" energy. During transpiration or evaporation, this [[latent heat]] is removed from surface liquid, cooling the earth's surface. This is the biggest non-radiative cooling effect at the surface. It compensates for roughly 70% of the average net radiative warming at the surface.\n\nSecond, water vapor is the most abundant of all [[greenhouse gases]]. Water vapor, like a green lens that allows green light to pass through it but absorbs red light, is a \"selective absorber\". Along with other greenhouse gases, water vapor is transparent to most solar energy, as one can literally see. But it absorbs the infrared energy emitted (radiated) upward by the earth's surface, which is the reason that humid areas experience very little nocturnal cooling but dry desert regions cool considerably at night. This selective absorption causes the greenhouse effect. It raises the surface temperature substantially above its theoretical radiative equilibrium temperature with the sun, and water vapor is the cause of more of this warming than any other greenhouse gas.\n\nUnlike most other greenhouse gases, however, water is not merely below its boiling point in all regions of the Earth, but below its freezing point at many altitudes.  As a condensible greenhouse gas, it [[Precipitation|precipitates]], with a much lower [[scale height]] and shorter atmospheric lifetime- weeks instead of decades.  Without other greenhouse gases, Earth's [[blackbody temperature]], below the freezing point of water, would cause water vapor to be removed from the atmosphere.<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.saga.iao.ru/glossary/?catalog=9&sowa=All&term=@1621 |title=Blackbody Radiation}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~abragg/109/L14.html |title=Lecture notes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://storm.colorado.edu//~toohey/lecture8.html |title=Radiative Balance, Earth's Temperature, and Greenhouse Gases (lecture notes)}}</ref>  Water vapor is thus a \"slave\" to the non-condensible greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geosc10/l12_p7.html | title=GEOSC 10 Optional Enrichment Article 1 | author=Alley, R. | date=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/businger/courses/notes101/28ModelingClimate.pdf |title=Lecture 28: Future Global Warming Modeling Climate Change |author=Businger, S. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130212102/http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/businger/courses/notes101/28ModelingClimate.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/eschwiet/essays/greenhouse_ASTR555.pdf | title=Comparing the Greenhouse Effect on Earth, Mars, Venus, and Titan: Present Day and through Time | author=Schwieterman, E.}}</ref>\n\n==Air density and volume==\n{{Main article|Volume (thermodynamics)|Density of air}}\n\nHumidity depends on water vaporization and condensation, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the [[ideal gas law]]. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviate from predicted by the ideal gas law. Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed as the dry volume, excluding the humidity content. This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary the saturated volume is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% relative humidity).\n\nHumid air is less dense than dry air because a molecule of water ([[molecular mass|M]] \u2248 18 [[atomic mass unit|u]]) is less massive than either a molecule of [[nitrogen]] (M \u2248 28) or a molecule of [[oxygen]] (M \u2248 32). About 78% of  the molecules in dry air are nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). Another 21% of the molecules in dry air are oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The final 1% of dry air is a mixture of other gases.\n\nFor any gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules present in a particular volume is constant \u2013 see [[ideal gas law]]. So when water molecules (vapor) are introduced into that volume of dry air, the number of air molecules in the volume must decrease by the same number, if the temperature and pressure remain constant.  (The addition of water molecules, or any other molecules, to a gas, without removal of an equal number of other molecules, will necessarily require a change in temperature, pressure, or total volume; that is, a change in ''at least'' one of these three parameters.  If temperature and pressure remain constant, the volume increases, and the dry air molecules that were displaced will initially move out into the additional volume, after which the mixture will eventually become uniform through diffusion.)  Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas\u2014its density\u2014decreases. [[Isaac Newton]] discovered this phenomenon and wrote about it in his book ''[[Opticks]]''.<ref name=\"optics\">\n{{cite book\n|author=Isaac Newton\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTpXLrPR2TQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isaac+newton+optics\n|publisher=Dover\n|title=Opticks\n|year=1704\n|isbn=978-0-486-60205-9\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n\n===Animal and plant life===\nHumidity is one of the fundamental [[abiotic factor]]s that defines any habitat (the tundra, wetlands, and the desert are a few examples), and is a determinant of which animals and plants can thrive in a given environment.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 ''Abiotic factor''. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland.

Washington DC</ref>\n\nThe human body dissipates heat through perspiration and its evaporation. [[Heat convection]], to the surrounding air, and [[thermal radiation]] are the primary modes of heat transport from the body. Under conditions of high humidity, the rate of evaporation of sweat from the skin decreases. Also, if the atmosphere is as warm as or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, [[blood]] brought to the body surface cannot dissipate heat by conduction to the air. With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, less goes to the active [[muscle]]s, the [[Human brain|brain]], and other internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. [[Physical strength]] declines, and [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] occurs sooner than it would otherwise. Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected, resulting in ''heat stroke'' or [[hyperthermia]].\n\n===Human comfort===\nHumans are sensitive to humid air because the human body uses evaporative cooling as the primary mechanism to regulate temperature. Under humid conditions, the ''rate'' at which perspiration evaporates on the skin is lower than it would be under arid conditions. Because humans perceive the rate of heat transfer from the body rather than temperature itself, we feel warmer when the relative humidity is high than when it is low.\n\nSome people experience difficulty breathing in humid environments. Some cases may possibly be related to respiratory conditions such as [[asthma]], while others may be the product of [[anxiety]]. Sufferers will often [[hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] in response, causing sensations of [[numbness]], [[faintness]], and loss of [[Attentional control|concentration]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lung.ca/news/expert-opinions/pollution/heat-and-humidity|title=Heat and humidity - the lung association|author=|date=|website=www.lung.ca|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Air conditioning]] reduces discomfort by reducing not just temperature but humidity as well. Heating cold outdoor air can decrease relative humidity levels indoors to below 30%,<ref>{{cite web|title=Optimum Humidity Levels for Home|url=http://www.airbetter.org/optimum-humidity-levels-home/|website=AirBetter.org|date=3 August 2014}}</ref> leading to ailments such as dry skin, cracked lips, dry eyes and excessive thirst.\n\n===Human health===\nHigher humidity reduces the infectivity of aerosolized influenza virus.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Noti |first1=John D. |last2=Blachere |first2=Francoise M. |last3=McMillen |first3=Cynthia M. |last4=Lindsley |first4=William G. |last5=Kashon |first5=Michael L. |last6=Slaughter |first6=Denzil R. |last7=Beezhold|first7=Donald H. |year=2013 |title=High Humidity Leads to Loss of Infectious Influenza Virus from Simulated Coughs |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=e57485 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...857485N |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0057485 |pmid=23460865}}</ref>\n\n===Electronics===\nElectronic devices are often rated to operate only under specific humidity conditions (e.g., 5% to 95%). At the top end of the range, moisture may increase the conductivity of permeable [[Insulator (electrical)|insulators]] leading to malfunction. Too low humidity may make materials brittle. A particular danger to electronic items, regardless of the stated operating humidity range, is [[condensation]]. When an electronic item is moved from a cold place (e.g. garage, car, shed, an air conditioned space in the tropics) to a warm humid place (house, outside tropics), condensation may coat circuit boards and other insulators, leading to [[short circuit]] inside the equipment. Such short circuits may cause substantial permanent damage if the equipment is powered on before the condensation has [[evaporated]]. A similar condensation effect can often be observed when a person wearing glasses comes in from the cold (i.e. the glasses become foggy).<ref>{{cite web|title=Fogging Glasses|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen01/gen01333.htm}}</ref> It is advisable to allow electronic equipment to acclimatise for several hours, after being brought in from the cold, before powering on. Some electronic devices can detect such a change and indicate, when plugged in and usually with a small droplet symbol, that they cannot be used until the risk from condensation has passed. In situations where time is critical, increasing air flow through the device's internals, such as removing the side panel from a PC case and directing a fan to blow into the case, will reduce significantly the time needed to acclimatise to the new environment.\n\nIn contrast, a very low humidity level favors the build-up of [[static electricity]], which may result in spontaneous shutdown of computers when discharges occur. Apart from spurious erratic function, electrostatic discharges can cause dielectric breakdown in solid state devices, resulting in irreversible damage. [[Data center]]s often monitor relative humidity levels for these reasons.\n\n===Building construction===\nCommon construction methods often produce building enclosures with a poor thermal boundary, requiring an [[Building insulation|insulation]] and air barrier system designed to retain indoor environmental conditions while resisting external environmental conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/name,45205,en.html|title=Free publications|publisher=}}</ref>  The energy-efficient, heavily sealed architecture introduced in the 20th century also sealed off the movement of moisture, and this has resulted in a secondary problem of [[condensation]] forming in and around walls, which encourages the development of mold and mildew. Additionally, buildings with foundations not properly sealed will allow water to flow through the walls due to [[capillary action]] of pores found in masonry products. Solutions for energy-efficient buildings that avoid condensation are a current topic of architecture.\n\n===Industry===\nHigh humidity can often have a negative effect on the capacity of chemical plants and refineries that use furnaces as part of a certain processes (e.g., steam reforming, wet sulfuric acid processes). For example, because humidity reduces ambient oxygen concentrations (dry air is typically 20.9% oxygen, but at 100% relative humidity the air is 20.4% oxygen), flue gas fans must intake air at a higher rate than would otherwise be required to maintain the same firing rate .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.industrialcontrolsonline.com/training/online/everything-you-need-know-about-combustion-chemistry-analysis|title=Everything You Need to Know About Combustion Chemistry & Analysis \u2013 Industrial Controls|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Baking===\nHigh humidity in the oven, represented by an elevated [[wet-bulb temperature]], increases the [[thermal conductivity]] of the air around the baked item, leading to a quicker baking process or even burning. Conversely, low humidity slows the baking process down.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.scienceofcooking.com/why_is_humidity_important_in_cooking.htm | title=Why is humidity important in cooking?}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dew point depression]]\n*[[Humidity indicator]]\n*[[Savory brittleness scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* United States Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/iaq/largebldgs/i-beam_html/ch2-hvac.htm#F2.6 \"IAQ in Large Buildings\"].

Sources of mechanical energy include [[steam turbine]]s, [[gas turbine]]s, [[water turbine]]s, [[internal combustion engine]]s, [[wind turbine]]''''''Bold text'''''']]s.\n\nThe reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an [[electric motor]], and motors and generators have many similarities. Many motors can be mechanically driven to generate electricity and frequently make acceptable manual generators.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Generator-20071117.jpg|thumb|right|Early [[Ganz]] Generator in [[Zwevegem]], [[West Flanders]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\nElectromagnetic generators fall into one of two broad categories, dynamos and alternators.\n* [[Dynamo]]s generate pulsing [[direct current]] through the use of a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]].\n* [[Alternator]]s generate [[alternating current]].\n\nMechanically a generator consists of a rotating part and a stationary part:\n; [[Rotor (electric)|Rotor]]: The rotating part of an [[electrical machine]]. \n; [[Stator]]: The stationary part of an electrical machine, which surrounds the rotor.'''\n\nOne of these parts generates a magnetic field, the other has a wire winding in which the changing field induces an electric current:\n; [[Field coil|Field winding]] or field (permanent) magnets: The [[magnetic field]] producing component of an electrical machine. The magnetic field of the dynamo or alternator can be provided by either wire windings called [[field coil]]s or [[permanent magnet]]s. Electrically-excited generators include an [[excitation (magnetic)|excitation system]] to produce the field flux. A generator using [[magnet|permanent magnets]] (PMs) is sometimes called a [[magneto]], or [[permanent magnet synchronous generator]]s (PMSMs).\n; [[Armature (electrical engineering)|Armature]]: The power-producing component of an electrical machine.  In a generator, alternator, or dynamo, the armature windings generate the electric current, which provides power to an external circuit. The armature can be on either the rotor or the stator, depending on the design, with the field coil or magnet on the other part.\n\n==History==\nBefore the connection between [[magnetism]''''''Bold text'''] and [[electricity]] was discovered, [[electrostatic generator]]s were invented. They operated on [[electrostatic]] principles, by using moving [[Electric charge|electrically charged]] belts, plates, and disks that carried charge to a high potential electrode. The charge was generated using either of two mechanisms: [[electrostatic induction]] or the [[triboelectric effect]]. Such generators generated very high [[voltage]] and low [[Electric current|current]]. Because of their inefficiency and the difficulty of [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] machines that produced very high voltages, electrostatic generators had low power ratings, and were never used for generation of commercially significant quantities of electric power. Their only practical applications were to power early [[X-ray tube]]s, and later in some atomic [[particle accelerator]]s.\n\n===Faraday disk generator===\n[[File:Faraday disk generator.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Faraday disk]] was the first electric generator. The horseshoe-shaped magnet ''(A)'' created a magnetic field through the disk ''(D)''. When the disk was turned, this induced an electric current radially outward from the center toward the rim. The current flowed out through the sliding spring contact ''m'', through the external circuit, and back into the center of the disk through the axle.]]\n{{Main|Homopolar generator}}\n\nThe operating principle of electromagnetic generators was discovered in the years of 1831\u20131832 by [[Michael Faraday]]. The principle, later called [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], is that an [[electromotive force]] is generated in an electrical conductor which encircles a varying [[magnetic flux]].\n\nHe also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the [[Faraday disk]]; a type of [[homopolar generator]], using a [[copper]] disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe [[magnet]]. It produced a small [[direct current|DC voltage]].\n\nThis design was inefficient, due to self-cancelling counterflows of [[electric current|current]] in regions of the disk that were not under the influence of the magnetic field. While current was induced directly underneath the magnet, the current would circulate backwards in regions that were outside the influence of the magnetic field. This counterflow limited the power output to the pickup wires, and induced waste heating of the copper disc. Later homopolar generators would solve this problem by using an array of magnets arranged around the disc perimeter to maintain a steady field effect in one current-flow direction.\n\nAnother disadvantage was that the output [[voltage]] was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux. Experimenters found that using multiple turns of wire in a coil could produce higher, more useful voltages. Since the output voltage is proportional to the number of turns, generators could be easily designed to produce any desired voltage by varying the number of turns. Wire windings became a basic feature of all subsequent generator designs.\n\n===Jedlik and the self-excitation phenomenon===\nIndependently of Faraday, [[\u00c1nyos Jedlik]] started experimenting in 1827 with the electromagnetic rotating devices which he called [[Jedlik's dynamo|electromagnetic self-rotors]]. In the prototype of the single-pole electric starter (finished between 1852 and 1854) both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic. It was also the discovery of the principle of dynamo [[self-excitation]],<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nature|title=Anianus Jedlik|author=Augustus Heller|publisher=Norman Lockyer|date=April 2, 1896|volume=53|issue=1379|page=516|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nWojdmTmch0C&pg=PA516&dq=jedlik+dynamo+1827#v=onepage&q=jedlik%20dynamo%201827&f=false|bibcode=1896Natur..53..516H|doi=10.1038/053516a0}}</ref> which replaced permanent magnet designs.

However many early uses of electricity required [[direct current]] (DC). In the first practical electric generators, called ''[[dynamo]]s'', the AC was converted into DC with a ''[[commutator (electric)|commutator]]'', a set of rotating switch contacts on the armature shaft. The commutator reversed the connection of the armature winding to the circuit every 180\u00b0 rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by [[Hippolyte Pixii]] in 1832.\n\nThe [[dynamo]] was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. \nThe [[Woolrich Electrical Generator]] of 1844, now in [[Thinktank, Birmingham|Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]], is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process.<ref>Birmingham Museums trust catalogue, accession number: 1889S00044</ref> It was used by the firm of [[Elkington Silver Electroplating Works|Elkingtons]] for commercial [[electroplating]].<ref name=\"thomas\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=John Meurig|title=Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place|date=1991|publisher=Hilger|location=Bristol|isbn=978-0750301459|page=51}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=K G|title=Exhibiting Electricity|date=1997|publisher=IET|isbn=9780852968956|page=90}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=L.

Varley took out a patent on 24 December 1866, while Siemens and Wheatstone both announced their discoveries on 17 January 1867, the latter delivering a paper on his discovery to the [[Royal Society]].\n\nThe \"dynamo-electric machine\" employed self-powering electromagnetic field coils rather than permanent magnets to create the stator field.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Berliner Berichte|date=January 1867}}</ref> Wheatstone's design was similar to Siemens', with the difference that in the Siemens design the stator electromagnets were in series with the rotor, but in Wheatstone's design they were in parallel.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]|date=February 14, 1867}}</ref> The use of electromagnets rather than permanent magnets greatly increased the power output of a dynamo and enabled high power generation for the first time. This invention led directly to the first major industrial uses of electricity. For example, in the 1870s Siemens used electromagnetic dynamos to power [[electric arc furnace]]s for the production of metals and other materials.\n\nThe dynamo machine that was developed consisted of a stationary structure, which provides the magnetic field, and a set of rotating windings which turn within that field. On larger machines the constant magnetic field is provided by one or more electromagnets, which are usually called field coils.\n\nLarge power generation dynamos are now rarely seen due to the now nearly universal use of [[alternating current]] for power distribution. Before the adoption of AC, very large direct-current dynamos were the only means of power generation and distribution. AC has come to dominate due to the ability of AC to be easily [[transformer|transformed]] to and from very high voltages to permit low losses over large distances.\n\n=== Synchronous generators (alternating current generators) ===\n{{Main|Alternator}}\n[[File:Ferranti two-phase generator set (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpg|thumb|[[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti|Ferranti]] [[alternator|alternating current generator]], c. 1900.]]\nThrough a series of discoveries, the dynamo was succeeded by many later inventions, especially the AC [[alternator]], which was capable of generating [[alternating current]].

Gordon]], in 1882. The first public demonstration of an \"alternator system\" was given by [[William Stanley, Jr.]], an employee of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1886.<ref>Blalock, Thomas J., \"''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040825140907/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/stanley.html Alternating Current Electrification, 1886]''\".

Ferranti went on to design the [[Deptford Power Station]] for the London Electric Supply Corporation in 1887 using an alternating current system. On its completion in 1891, it was the first truly modern power station, supplying high-voltage AC power that was then \"stepped down\" for consumer use on each street. This basic system remains in use today around the world.\n\n[[File:Murray Alternator with Belt-Driven Exciter.jpg|thumb|200px|A small early 1900s 75 [[kilovolt-ampere|kVA]] direct-driven power station AC alternator, with a separate belt-driven exciter generator.]]\nAfter 1891, [[Polyphase system|polyphase]] alternators were introduced to supply currents of multiple differing phases.<ref>Thompson, Sylvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery''. pp. 17</ref> Later alternators were designed for varying alternating-current frequencies between sixteen and about one hundred hertz, for use with arc lighting, incandescent lighting and electric motors.<ref>Thompson, Sylvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery''. pp. 16</ref>\n\n===Self-excitation===\n{{main|Excitation (magnetic)}}\nAs the requirements for larger scale power generation increased, a new limitation rose: the magnetic fields available from permanent magnets. Diverting a small amount of the power generated by the generator to an electromagnetic [[field coil]] allowed the generator to produce substantially more power. This concept was dubbed [[self-excitation]].\n\nThe field coils are connected in series or parallel with the armature winding. When the generator first starts to turn, the small amount of [[remanent magnetism]] present in the iron core provides a magnetic field to get it started, generating a small current in the armature. This flows through the field coils, creating a larger magnetic field which generates a larger armature current. This \"bootstrap\" process continues until the magnetic field in the core levels off due to [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]] and the generator reaches a steady state power output.\n\nVery large power station generators often utilize a separate smaller generator to excite the field coils of the larger. In the event of a severe widespread [[power outage]] where [[islanding]] of power stations has occurred, the stations may need to perform a [[black start]] to excite the fields of their largest generators, in order to restore customer power service.<\n\n==Specialized types of generator==\n\n===Direct current (DC)===\nA [[dynamo]] uses commutators to produce direct current. It is self-[[Excitation (magnetic)|excited]], i.e its field electromagnets are powered by the machine's own output. Other types of DC generators use a separate source of direct current to energize their field magnets.\n\n====Homopolar generator====\n{{main|Homopolar generator}}\nA homopolar generator is a [[Direct current|DC]] [[electrical generator]] comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field. A potential difference is created between the center of the disc and the rim (or ends of the cylinder), the [[electrical polarity]] depending on the direction of rotation and the orientation of the field.\n\nIt is also known as a '''unipolar generator''', '''acyclic generator''', '''disk dynamo''', or '''Faraday disc'''. The voltage is typically low, on the order of a few volts in the case of small demonstration models, but large research generators can produce hundreds of volts, and some systems have multiple generators in series to produce an even larger voltage.<ref>Losty, H.H.W & Lewis, D.L. (1973) Homopolar Machines. Philosophical Transactions for the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences. 275 (1248), 69-75</ref> They are unusual in that they can produce tremendous electric current, some more than a million [[amperes]], because the homopolar generator can be made to have very low internal resistance.\n\n====Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator====\n{{main|Magnetohydrodynamic generator}}\nA magnetohydrodynamic generator directly extracts electric power from moving hot gases through a magnetic field, without the use of rotating electromagnetic machinery. MHD generators were originally developed because the output of a plasma MHD generator is a flame, well able to heat the boilers of a [[Rankine cycle|steam]] [[power plant]]. The first practical design was the AVCO Mk. 25, developed in 1965. The U.S. government funded substantial development, culminating in a 25 MW demonstration plant in 1987. In the [[Soviet Union]] from 1972 until the late 1980s, the MHD plant U 25 was in regular commercial operation on the Moscow power system with a rating of 25 MW, the largest MHD plant rating in the world at that time.<ref>Langdon Crane, ''Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Power Generator: More Energy from Less Fuel, Issue Brief Number IB74057'', Library of Congress Congressional Research Service, 1981, retrieved from [https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/permalink/meta-crs-8402:1 Digital.library.unt.edu] 18 July 2008</ref> MHD generators operated as a [[topping cycle]] are currently (2007) less efficient than [[combined cycle]] [[gas turbines]].\n\n===Alternating current (AC)===\n\n====Induction generator====\n{{main|Induction generator}}\n[[Induction motor|Induction AC motors]] may be used as generators, turning mechanical energy into electric current. Induction generators operate by mechanically turning their rotor faster than the synchronous speed, giving negative slip. A regular AC asynchronous motor usually can be used as a generator, without any internal modifications. Induction generators are useful in applications such as minihydro power plants, wind turbines, or in reducing high-pressure gas streams to lower pressure, because they can recover energy with relatively simple controls. They do not require an exciter circuit because the rotating magnetic field is provided by induction from the stator circuit. They also do not require speed governor equipment as they inherently operate at the connected grid frequency.\n\nTo operate, an induction generator must be excited with a leading voltage; this is usually done by connection to an electrical grid, or sometimes they are self-excited by using phase correcting capacitors.\n\n====Linear electric generator====\n{{main|Linear alternator}}\nIn the simplest form of linear electric generator, a sliding [[magnet]] moves back and forth through a [[solenoid]] - a spool of copper wire. An [[alternating current]] is induced in the loops of wire by [[Faraday's law of induction]] each time the magnet slides through. This type of generator is used in the [[Faraday flashlight]]. Larger linear electricity generators are used in [[wave power]] schemes.\n\n====Variable-speed constant-frequency generators====\nMany [[renewable energy]] efforts attempt to harvest natural sources of mechanical energy (wind, tides, etc.) to produce electricity. Because these sources fluctuate in power applied, standard generators using permanent magnets and fixed windings would deliver unregulated voltage and frequency. The overhead of regulation (whether before the generator via gear reduction or after generation by electrical means) is high in proportion to the naturally-derived energy available.\n\nNew generator designs such as the [[singly-fed electric machine|asynchronous or induction singly-fed generator]], the [[doubly fed electric machine|doubly-fed generator]], or the [[brushless wound-rotor doubly fed electric machine|brushless wound-rotor doubly-fed generator]] are seeing success in variable speed constant frequency applications, such as [[wind turbine]]s or other [[renewable energy|renewable energy technologies]]. These systems thus offer cost, reliability and efficiency benefits in certain use cases.\n\n==Common use cases==\n\n===Power station===\n{{main|power station}}\n[[File:Greater Cape Town 12.02.2007 16-41-31.2007 16-41-33.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Athlone Power Station]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]]]\n[[File:DSCN1028.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Hydroelectric power station at [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo Dam]], [[Slovakia]]]][[File:Glen_Canyon_Dam_and_Bridge.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Hydroelectric power station at [[Glen Canyon Dam]], [[Page, Arizona]]]]\n\nA ''power station'', also referred to as a ''power plant'' or ''powerhouse'' and sometimes ''generating station'' or ''generating plant'', is an industrial facility for the [[Electricity generation|generation]] of [[electric power]]. Most power stations contain one or more [[Electric generator|generators]], a rotating machine that converts [[mechanical power]] into [[three-phase electric power]]. The [[relative motion]] between a [[magnetic field]] and a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] creates an [[electrical current]]. The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[petroleum|oil]], and [[natural gas]] to generate electricity. Cleaner sources include [[nuclear power]], and an increasing use of [[renewable energy|renewables]] such as [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], [[Wave power|wave]] and [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]].\n\n===Vehicular generators ===\n\n====Roadway vehicles====\n{{Main|Alternator (automotive)}}\nMotor vehicles require electrical energy to power their instrumentation, keep the engine itself operating, and recharge their batteries. Until about the 1960s motor vehicles tended to use [[dynamo|DC generators]] with electromechanical regulators. Following the historical trend above and for many of the same reasons, these have now been replaced by [[alternator (automotive)|alternator]]s with built-in [[rectifier]] circuits.\n\n====Bicycles====\nBicycles require energy to power running lights and other equipment. There are two common kinds of generator in use on bicycles: [[bottle dynamo]]s which engage the bicycle's tire on an as-needed basis, and [[hub dynamo]]s which are directly attached to the bicycle's drive train. The name is conventional as these they are small permanent-magnet alternators, not self-excited DC machines as are [[dynamo]]s. Some [[electric bicycles]] are capable of [[regenerative braking]], where the drive motor is used as a generator to recover some energy during braking.\n\n====Sailboats====\nSailing boats may use a water- or wind-powered generator to trickle-charge the batteries. A small [[propeller]], [[wind turbine]] or [[impeller]] is connected to a low-power generator to supply currents at typical wind or cruising speeds.\n\n====Electric scooters====\n[[Electric scooters]] with regenerative braking have become popular all over the world. Engineers use [[kinetic energy]] recovery systems on the scooter to reduce energy consumption and increase its range up to 40-60% by simply recovering energy using the magnetic brake, which generates [[electric energy]] for further use. Modern vehicles reach speed up to 25-30 km/h and can run up to 35-40 km.\n\n===Genset===\n{{main|Engine-generator}}\nAn ''engine-generator'' is the combination of an electrical generator and an [[engine]] ([[wikt:prime mover|prime mover]]) mounted together to form a single piece of self-contained equipment. The engines used are usually piston engines, but gas turbines can also be used. And there are even hybrid diesel-gas units, called dual-fuel units. Many different versions of engine-generators are available - ranging from very small portable [[petrol]] powered sets to large turbine installations. The primary advantage of engine-generators is the ability to independently supply electricity, allowing the units to serve as backup power solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpowerproducts.com/blog/hurricane-preparedness-protection-provided-by-power-generators |title=Hurricane Preparedness: Protection Provided by Power Generators &#124; Power On with Mark Lum |publisher=Wpowerproducts.com |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Human powered electrical generators===\n{{main|Self-powered equipment}}\nA generator can also be driven by human muscle power (for instance, in field radio station equipment).\n\n[[File:Day 47 Occupy Wall Street November 2 2011 Shankbone 15.JPG|thumb|Protesters at [[Occupy Wall Street]] using bicycles connected to a motor and one-way diode to charge batteries for their electronics<ref>[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/with-generators-gone-wall-street-protesters-try-bicycle-power/ With Generators Gone, Wall Street Protesters Try Bicycle Power], Colin Moynihan, ''New York Times'', 30 October 2011; accessed 2 November 2011</ref>]]\nHuman powered direct current generators are commercially available, and have been the project of some [[DIY]] enthusiasts. Typically operated by means of pedal power, a converted bicycle trainer, or a foot pump, such generators can be practically used to charge batteries, and in some cases are designed with an integral inverter. An average \"healthy human\" can produce a steady 75 Watts (0.1 horsepower) for a full eight hour period, while a \"first class athlete\" can produce approximately 298 Watts (0.4 horsepower) for a similar period. At the end of which an undetermined period of rest and recovery will be required. At 298 Watts the average \"healthy human\" becomes exhausted within 10 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/programming/hpv/hpv.html |title=Program: hpv (updated 6/22/11) |publisher=Ohio.edu |accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref> The net electrical power that can be produced will be less, due to the efficiency of the generator. Portable radio receivers with a crank are made to reduce battery purchase requirements, see [[clockwork radio]]. During the mid 20th century, pedal powered radios were used throughout the [[Australian outback]], to provide schooling ([[School of the Air]]), medical and other needs in remote stations and towns.\n\n===Mechanical measurement===\nA tachogenerator is an electromechanical device which produces an output voltage proportional to its shaft speed. It may be used for a speed indicator or in a feedback speed control system. Tachogenerators are frequently used to power [[tachometer]]s to measure the speeds of electric motors, engines, and the equipment they power. Generators generate voltage roughly proportional to shaft speed. With precise construction and design, generators can be built to produce very precise voltages for certain ranges of shaft speeds.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Equivalent circuit==\n[[File:Generator-model.svg|thumb|right|Equivalent circuit of generator and load. {{ubl\n | G, generator\n | V<sub>G</sub>, generator open-circuit voltage\n | R<sub>G</sub>, generator internal resistance\n | V<sub>L</sub>, generator on-load voltage\n | R<sub>L</sub>, load resistance\n}}]]\n\nAn [[equivalent circuit]] of a generator and load is shown in the adjacent diagram.

Sources of mechanical energy include [[steam turbine]]s, [[gas turbine]]s, [[water turbine]]s, [[internal combustion engine]]s, [[wind turbine]]s and even hand [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]s. The first electromagnetic generator, the Faraday disk, was invented in 1831 by British scientist [[Michael Faraday]]. Generators provide nearly all of the power for [[electric power grid]]s.\n\nThe reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an [[electric motor]], and motors and generators have many similarities. Many motors can be mechanically driven to generate electricity and frequently make acceptable manual generators.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Generator-20071117.jpg|thumb|right|Early [[Ganz]] Generator in [[Zwevegem]], [[West Flanders]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\nElectromagnetic generators fall into one of two broad categories, dynamos and alternators.\n* [[Dynamo]]s generate pulsing [[direct current]] through the use of a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]].\n* [[Alternator]]s generate [[alternating current]].\n\nMechanically a generator consists of a rotating part and a stationary part:\n; [[Rotor (electric)|Rotor]]: The rotating part of an [[electrical machine]]. \n; [[Stator]]: The stationary part of an electrical machine, which surrounds the rotor.\n\nOne of these parts generates a magnetic field, the other has a wire winding in which the changing field induces an electric current:\n; [[Field coil|Field winding]] or field (permanent) magnets: The [[magnetic field]] producing component of an electrical machine. The magnetic field of the dynamo or alternator can be provided by either wire windings called [[field coil]]s or [[permanent magnet]]s. Electrically-excited generators include an [[excitation (magnetic)|excitation system]] to produce the field flux. A generator using [[magnet|permanent magnets]] (PMs) is sometimes called a [[magneto]], or [[permanent magnet synchronous generator]]s (PMSMs).\n; [[Armature (electrical engineering)|Armature]]: The power-producing component of an electrical machine.  In a generator, alternator, or dynamo, the armature windings generate the electric current, which provides power to an external circuit. The armature can be on either the rotor or the stator, depending on the design, with the field coil or magnet on the other part.\n\n==History==\nBefore the connection between [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]] was discovered, [[electrostatic generator]]s were invented. They operated on [[electrostatic]] principles, by using moving [[Electric charge|electrically charged]] belts, plates, and disks that carried charge to a high potential electrode. The charge was generated using either of two mechanisms: [[electrostatic induction]] or the [[triboelectric effect]]. Such generators generated very high [[voltage]] and low [[Electric current|current]]. Because of their inefficiency and the difficulty of [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] machines that produced very high voltages, electrostatic generators had low power ratings, and were never used for generation of commercially significant quantities of electric power. Their only practical applications were to power early [[X-ray tube]]s, and later in some atomic [[particle accelerator]]s.\n\n===Faraday disk generator===\n[[File:Faraday disk generator.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Faraday disk]] was the first electric generator. The horseshoe-shaped magnet ''(A)'' created a magnetic field through the disk ''(D)''. When the disk was turned, this induced an electric current radially outward from the center toward the rim. The current flowed out through the sliding spring contact ''m'', through the external circuit, and back into the center of the disk through the axle.]]\n{{Main|Homopolar generator}}\n\nThe operating principle of electromagnetic generators was discovered in the years of 1831\u20131832 by [[Michael Faraday]]. The principle, later called [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], is that an [[electromotive force]] is generated in an electrical conductor which encircles a varying [[magnetic flux]].\n\nHe also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the [[Faraday disk]]; a type of [[homopolar generator]], using a [[copper]] disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe [[magnet]]. It produced a small [[direct current|DC voltage]].\n\nThis design was inefficient, due to self-cancelling counterflows of [[electric current|current]] in regions of the disk that were not under the influence of the magnetic field. While current was induced directly underneath the magnet, the current would circulate backwards in regions that were outside the influence of the magnetic field. This counterflow limited the power output to the pickup wires, and induced waste heating of the copper disc. Later homopolar generators would solve this problem by using an array of magnets arranged around the disc perimeter to maintain a steady field effect in one current-flow direction.\n\nAnother disadvantage was that the output [[voltage]] was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux. Experimenters found that using multiple turns of wire in a coil could produce higher, more useful voltages. Since the output voltage is proportional to the number of turns, generators could be easily designed to produce any desired voltage by varying the number of turns. Wire windings became a basic feature of all subsequent generator designs.\n\n===Jedlik and the self-excitation phenomenon===\nIndependently of Faraday, [[\u00c1nyos Jedlik]] started experimenting in 1827 with the electromagnetic rotating devices which he called [[Jedlik's dynamo|electromagnetic self-rotors]]. In the prototype of the single-pole electric starter (finished between 1852 and 1854) both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic.

In the first practical electric generators, called ''[[dynamo]]s'', the AC was converted into DC with a ''[[commutator (electric)|commutator]]'', a set of rotating switch contacts on the armature shaft. The commutator reversed the connection of the armature winding to the circuit every 180\u00b0 rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by [[Hippolyte Pixii]] in 1832.\n\nThe [[dynamo]] was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. \nThe [[Woolrich Electrical Generator]] of 1844, now in [[Thinktank, Birmingham|Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]], is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process.<ref>Birmingham Museums trust catalogue, accession number: 1889S00044</ref> It was used by the firm of [[Elkington Silver Electroplating Works|Elkingtons]] for commercial [[electroplating]].<ref name=\"thomas\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=John Meurig|title=Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place|date=1991|publisher=Hilger|location=Bristol|isbn=978-0750301459|page=51}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=K G|title=Exhibiting Electricity|date=1997|publisher=IET|isbn=9780852968956|page=90}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=L.

Varley took out a patent on 24 December 1866, while Siemens and Wheatstone both announced their discoveries on 17 January 1867, the latter delivering a paper on his discovery to the [[Royal Society]].\n\nThe \"dynamo-electric machine\" employed self-powering electromagnetic field coils rather than permanent magnets to create the stator field.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Berliner Berichte|date=January 1867}}</ref> Wheatstone's design was similar to Siemens', with the difference that in the Siemens design the stator electromagnets were in series with the rotor, but in Wheatstone's design they were in parallel.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]|date=February 14, 1867}}</ref> The use of electromagnets rather than permanent magnets greatly increased the power output of a dynamo and enabled high power generation for the first time. This invention led directly to the first major industrial uses of electricity. For example, in the 1870s Siemens used electromagnetic dynamos to power [[electric arc furnace]]s for the production of metals and other materials.\n\nThe dynamo machine that was developed consisted of a stationary structure, which provides the magnetic field, and a set of rotating windings which turn within that field. On larger machines the constant magnetic field is provided by one or more electromagnets, which are usually called field coils.\n\nLarge power generation dynamos are now rarely seen due to the now nearly universal use of [[alternating current]] for power distribution. Before the adoption of AC, very large direct-current dynamos were the only means of power generation and distribution. AC has come to dominate due to the ability of AC to be easily [[transformer|transformed]] to and from very high voltages to permit low losses over large distances.\n\n=== Synchronous generators (alternating current generators) ===\n{{Main|Alternator}}\n[[File:Ferranti two-phase generator set (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpg|thumb|[[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti|Ferranti]] [[alternator|alternating current generator]], c. 1900.]]\nThrough a series of discoveries, the dynamo was succeeded by many later inventions, especially the AC [[alternator]], which was capable of generating [[alternating current]]. It is commonly known to be the Synchronous Generators (SGs). The synchronous machines are directly connected to the grid and need to be properly synchronized during startup.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schaefer|first=Richard C.|date=Jan-Feb 2017|title=Art of Generator Synchronizing|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications|language=en-US|volume=53|issue=1|pages=751\u2013757|doi=10.1109/tia.2016.2602215|issn=0093-9994}}</ref> Moreover, they are excited with special control to enhance the stability of the power system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Basler|first=Michael J.|last2=Schaefer|first2=Richard C.|date=2008|title=Understanding Power-System Stability|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications|language=en-US|volume=44|issue=2|pages=463\u2013474|doi=10.1109/tia.2008.916726|issn=0093-9994}}</ref>\n\nAlternating current generating systems were known in simple forms from [[Michael Faraday]]'s original discovery of the [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction of electric current]]. Faraday himself built an early alternator. His machine was a \"rotating rectangle\", whose operation was ''heteropolar'' - each active conductor passed successively through regions where the magnetic field was in opposite directions.<ref>Thompson, Sylvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery''. pp. 7</ref>\n\nLarge two-phase alternating current generators were built by a British electrician, [[James Edward Henry Gordon|J.E.H. Gordon]], in 1882. The first public demonstration of an \"alternator system\" was given by [[William Stanley, Jr.]], an employee of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1886.<ref>Blalock, Thomas J., \"''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040825140907/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/stanley.html Alternating Current Electrification, 1886]''\".

Ferranti went on to design the [[Deptford Power Station]] for the London Electric Supply Corporation in 1887 using an alternating current system. On its completion in 1891, it was the first truly modern power station, supplying high-voltage AC power that was then \"stepped down\" for consumer use on each street. This basic system remains in use today around the world.\n\n[[File:Murray Alternator with Belt-Driven Exciter.jpg|thumb|200px|A small early 1900s 75 [[kilovolt-ampere|kVA]] direct-driven power station AC alternator, with a separate belt-driven exciter generator.]]\nAfter 1891, [[Polyphase system|polyphase]] alternators were introduced to supply currents of multiple differing phases.<ref>Thompson, Sylvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery''. pp. 17</ref> Later alternators were designed for varying alternating-current frequencies between sixteen and about one hundred hertz, for use with arc lighting, incandescent lighting and electric motors.<ref>Thompson, Sylvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery''. pp. 16</ref>\n\n===Self-excitation===\n{{main|Excitation (magnetic)}}\nAs the requirements for larger scale power generation increased, a new limitation rose: the magnetic fields available from permanent magnets. Diverting a small amount of the power generated by the generator to an electromagnetic [[field coil]] allowed the generator to produce substantially more power. This concept was dubbed [[self-excitation]].\n\nThe field coils are connected in series or parallel with the armature winding. When the generator first starts to turn, the small amount of [[remanent magnetism]] present in the iron core provides a magnetic field to get it started, generating a small current in the armature. This flows through the field coils, creating a larger magnetic field which generates a larger armature current. This \"bootstrap\" process continues until the magnetic field in the core levels off due to [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]] and the generator reaches a steady state power output.\n\nVery large power station generators often utilize a separate smaller generator to excite the field coils of the larger. In the event of a severe widespread [[power outage]] where [[islanding]] of power stations has occurred, the stations may need to perform a [[black start]] to excite the fields of their largest generators, in order to restore customer power service.<\n\n==Specialized types of generator==\n\n===Direct current (DC)===\nA [[dynamo]] uses commutators to produce direct current. It is self-[[Excitation (magnetic)|excited]], i.e its field electromagnets are powered by the machine's own output. Other types of DC generators use a separate source of direct current to energize their field magnets.\n\n====Homopolar generator====\n{{main|Homopolar generator}}\nA homopolar generator is a [[Direct current|DC]] [[electrical generator]] comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field. A potential difference is created between the center of the disc and the rim (or ends of the cylinder), the [[electrical polarity]] depending on the direction of rotation and the orientation of the field.\n\nIt is also known as a '''unipolar generator''', '''acyclic generator''', '''disk dynamo''', or '''Faraday disc'''. The voltage is typically low, on the order of a few volts in the case of small demonstration models, but large research generators can produce hundreds of volts, and some systems have multiple generators in series to produce an even larger voltage.<ref>Losty, H.H.W & Lewis, D.L. (1973) Homopolar Machines. Philosophical Transactions for the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences. 275 (1248), 69-75</ref> They are unusual in that they can produce tremendous electric current, some more than a million [[amperes]], because the homopolar generator can be made to have very low internal resistance.\n\n====Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator====\n{{main|Magnetohydrodynamic generator}}\nA magnetohydrodynamic generator directly extracts electric power from moving hot gases through a magnetic field, without the use of rotating electromagnetic machinery. MHD generators were originally developed because the output of a plasma MHD generator is a flame, well able to heat the boilers of a [[Rankine cycle|steam]] [[power plant]]. The first practical design was the AVCO Mk. 25, developed in 1965. The U.S. government funded substantial development, culminating in a 25 MW demonstration plant in 1987. In the [[Soviet Union]] from 1972 until the late 1980s, the MHD plant U 25 was in regular commercial operation on the Moscow power system with a rating of 25 MW, the largest MHD plant rating in the world at that time.<ref>Langdon Crane, ''Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Power Generator: More Energy from Less Fuel, Issue Brief Number IB74057'', Library of Congress Congressional Research Service, 1981, retrieved from [https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/permalink/meta-crs-8402:1 Digital.library.unt.edu] 18 July 2008</ref> MHD generators operated as a [[topping cycle]] are currently (2007) less efficient than [[combined cycle]] [[gas turbines]].\n\n===Alternating current (AC)===\n\n====Induction generator====\n{{main|Induction generator}}\n[[Induction motor|Induction AC motors]] may be used as generators, turning mechanical energy into electric current. Induction generators operate by mechanically turning their rotor faster than the synchronous speed, giving negative slip. A regular AC asynchronous motor usually can be used as a generator, without any internal modifications. Induction generators are useful in applications such as minihydro power plants, wind turbines, or in reducing high-pressure gas streams to lower pressure, because they can recover energy with relatively simple controls. They do not require an exciter circuit because the rotating magnetic field is provided by induction from the stator circuit. They also do not require speed governor equipment as they inherently operate at the connected grid frequency.\n\nTo operate, an induction generator must be excited with a leading voltage; this is usually done by connection to an electrical grid, or sometimes they are self-excited by using phase correcting capacitors.\n\n====Linear electric generator====\n{{main|Linear alternator}}\nIn the simplest form of linear electric generator, a sliding [[magnet]] moves back and forth through a [[solenoid]] - a spool of copper wire. An [[alternating current]] is induced in the loops of wire by [[Faraday's law of induction]] each time the magnet slides through. This type of generator is used in the [[Faraday flashlight]]. Larger linear electricity generators are used in [[wave power]] schemes.\n\n====Variable-speed constant-frequency generators====\nMany [[renewable energy]] efforts attempt to harvest natural sources of mechanical energy (wind, tides, etc.) to produce electricity. Because these sources fluctuate in power applied, standard generators using permanent magnets and fixed windings would deliver unregulated voltage and frequency. The overhead of regulation (whether before the generator via gear reduction or after generation by electrical means) is high in proportion to the naturally-derived energy available.\n\nNew generator designs such as the [[singly-fed electric machine|asynchronous or induction singly-fed generator]], the [[doubly fed electric machine|doubly-fed generator]], or the [[brushless wound-rotor doubly fed electric machine|brushless wound-rotor doubly-fed generator]] are seeing success in variable speed constant frequency applications, such as [[wind turbine]]s or other [[renewable energy|renewable energy technologies]]. These systems thus offer cost, reliability and efficiency benefits in certain use cases.\n\n==Common use cases==\n\n===Power station===\n{{main|power station}}\n[[File:Greater Cape Town 12.02.2007 16-41-31.2007 16-41-33.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Athlone Power Station]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]]]\n[[File:DSCN1028.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Hydroelectric power station at [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo Dam]], [[Slovakia]]]][[File:Glen_Canyon_Dam_and_Bridge.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Hydroelectric power station at [[Glen Canyon Dam]], [[Page, Arizona]]]]\n\nA ''power station'', also referred to as a ''power plant'' or ''powerhouse'' and sometimes ''generating station'' or ''generating plant'', is an industrial facility for the [[Electricity generation|generation]] of [[electric power]]. Most power stations contain one or more [[Electric generator|generators]], a rotating machine that converts [[mechanical power]] into [[three-phase electric power]]. The [[relative motion]] between a [[magnetic field]] and a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] creates an [[electrical current]]. The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[petroleum|oil]], and [[natural gas]] to generate electricity. Cleaner sources include [[nuclear power]], and an increasing use of [[renewable energy|renewables]] such as [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], [[Wave power|wave]] and [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]].\n\n===Vehicular generators ===\n\n====Roadway vehicles====\n{{Main|Alternator (automotive)}}\nMotor vehicles require electrical energy to power their instrumentation, keep the engine itself operating, and recharge their batteries. Until about the 1960s motor vehicles tended to use [[dynamo|DC generators]] with electromechanical regulators. Following the historical trend above and for many of the same reasons, these have now been replaced by [[alternator (automotive)|alternator]]s with built-in [[rectifier]] circuits.\n\n====Bicycles====\nBicycles require energy to power running lights and other equipment. There are two common kinds of generator in use on bicycles: [[bottle dynamo]]s which engage the bicycle's tire on an as-needed basis, and [[hub dynamo]]s which are directly attached to the bicycle's drive train. The name is conventional as these they are small permanent-magnet alternators, not self-excited DC machines as are [[dynamo]]s. Some [[electric bicycles]] are capable of [[regenerative braking]], where the drive motor is used as a generator to recover some energy during braking.\n\n====Sailboats====\nSailing boats may use a water- or wind-powered generator to trickle-charge the batteries. A small [[propeller]], [[wind turbine]] or [[impeller]] is connected to a low-power generator to supply currents at typical wind or cruising speeds.\n\n====Electric scooters====\n[[Electric scooters]] with regenerative braking have become popular all over the world. Engineers use [[kinetic energy]] recovery systems on the scooter to reduce energy consumption and increase its range up to 40-60% by simply recovering energy using the magnetic brake, which generates [[electric energy]] for further use. Modern vehicles reach speed up to 25-30 km/h and can run up to 35-40 km.\n\n===Genset===\n{{main|Engine-generator}}\nAn ''engine-generator'' is the combination of an electrical generator and an [[engine]] ([[wikt:prime mover|prime mover]]) mounted together to form a single piece of self-contained equipment. The engines used are usually piston engines, but gas turbines can also be used. And there are even hybrid diesel-gas units, called dual-fuel units. Many different versions of engine-generators are available - ranging from very small portable [[petrol]] powered sets to large turbine installations. The primary advantage of engine-generators is the ability to independently supply electricity, allowing the units to serve as backup power solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpowerproducts.com/blog/hurricane-preparedness-protection-provided-by-power-generators |title=Hurricane Preparedness: Protection Provided by Power Generators &#124; Power On with Mark Lum |publisher=Wpowerproducts.com |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Human powered electrical generators===\n{{main|Self-powered equipment}}\nA generator can also be driven by human muscle power (for instance, in field radio station equipment).\n\n[[File:Day 47 Occupy Wall Street November 2 2011 Shankbone 15.JPG|thumb|Protesters at [[Occupy Wall Street]] using bicycles connected to a motor and one-way diode to charge batteries for their electronics<ref>[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/with-generators-gone-wall-street-protesters-try-bicycle-power/ With Generators Gone, Wall Street Protesters Try Bicycle Power], Colin Moynihan, ''New York Times'', 30 October 2011; accessed 2 November 2011</ref>]]\nHuman powered direct current generators are commercially available, and have been the project of some [[DIY]] enthusiasts. Typically operated by means of pedal power, a converted bicycle trainer, or a foot pump, such generators can be practically used to charge batteries, and in some cases are designed with an integral inverter. An average \"healthy human\" can produce a steady 75 Watts (0.1 horsepower) for a full eight hour period, while a \"first class athlete\" can produce approximately 298 Watts (0.4 horsepower) for a similar period. At the end of which an undetermined period of rest and recovery will be required. At 298 Watts the average \"healthy human\" becomes exhausted within 10 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/programming/hpv/hpv.html |title=Program: hpv (updated 6/22/11) |publisher=Ohio.edu |accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref> The net electrical power that can be produced will be less, due to the efficiency of the generator. Portable radio receivers with a crank are made to reduce battery purchase requirements, see [[clockwork radio]]. During the mid 20th century, pedal powered radios were used throughout the [[Australian outback]], to provide schooling ([[School of the Air]]), medical and other needs in remote stations and towns.\n\n===Mechanical measurement===\nA tachogenerator is an electromechanical device which produces an output voltage proportional to its shaft speed. It may be used for a speed indicator or in a feedback speed control system. Tachogenerators are frequently used to power [[tachometer]]s to measure the speeds of electric motors, engines, and the equipment they power. Generators generate voltage roughly proportional to shaft speed. With precise construction and design, generators can be built to produce very precise voltages for certain ranges of shaft speeds.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Equivalent circuit==\n[[File:Generator-model.svg|thumb|right|Equivalent circuit of generator and load. {{ubl\n | G, generator\n | V<sub>G</sub>, generator open-circuit voltage\n | R<sub>G</sub>, generator internal resistance\n | V<sub>L</sub>, generator on-load voltage\n | R<sub>L</sub>, load resistance\n}}]]\n\nAn [[equivalent circuit]] of a generator and load is shown in the adjacent diagram.
