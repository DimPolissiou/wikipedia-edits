The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum. The direction of rotation of the flagella in bacteria comes from the occupancy of the proton channels along the perimeter of the flagellar motor.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Brady, Richard M. |title= Torque and switching in the bacterial flagellar motor.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

They \"breathe\" [[electron donor]]s such as nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide.\n\nThere is very little energy at greater depths, and metabolism can be up to a million times slower than at the surface. Cells may live for thousands of years before dividing and there is no known limit to their age. The subsurface accounts for about 90% of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in bacteria and archaea, and 15% of the total biomass for the biosphere. Eukaryotes are also found, mostly microscopic, but including some multicellular life.

The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

When conditions are right, [[Algal bloom|blooms]] of phytoplankton algae can occur in surface waters. Phytoplankton are [[r-strategist]]s which grow rapidly and can double their population every day. The blooms can become toxic and deplete the water of oxygen.

They are [[heterotrophic]] (other-feeding), meaning they cannot produce their own food and must consume instead other plants or animals as food. In particular, this means they eat phytoplankton.\n\nZooplankton are generally larger than phytoplankton, mostly still microscopic but some can be seen with the naked eye. Many [[protozoan]]s (single-celled [[#Marine protists|protists]] that prey on other microscopic life) are zooplankton, including [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, [[radiolarian]]s, some [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[#Marine microanimals|marine microanimals]]. Macroscopic zooplankton (not covered further here) include pelagic [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s and [[tunicate]]s, as well as planktonic [[chaetognatha|arrow worms]] and [[Polychaete|bristle worms]].\n\n'''Microzooplankton: major grazers of the plankton...'''\n<gallery mode=packed heights=144px style=float:left;>\nFile:Copepod 2 with eggs.jpg|[[Copepod]]s eat phytoplankton.

Marine microorganisms also recycle nutrients for use in the [[marine food web]] and in the process release CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Microbial biomass and other organic matter (remnants of plants and animals) are converted to fossil fuels over millions of years. By contrast, burning of [[fossil fuel]]s liberates greenhouse gases in a small fraction of that time. As a result, the [[carbon cycle]] is out of balance, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels will continue to rise as long as fossil fuels continue to be burnt.<ref name=Cavicchioli2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Cavicchioli | first1 = R. | last2 = Ripple | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Timmis | first3 = K.N. | last4 = Azam | first4 = F. | last5 = Bakken | first5 = L.R. | last6 = Baylis | first6 = M. | last7 = Behrenfeld | first7 = M.J. | last8 = Boetius | first8 = A. | last9 = Boyd | first9 = P.W. | last10 = Classen | first10 = A.T. | last11 = Crowther | first11 = T.W. | year = 2019 | title = Scientists' warning to humanity: microorganisms and climate change | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 17 | issue = 9| pages = 569\u2013586 | doi = 10.1038/s41579-019-0222-5 | pmid = 31213707 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Marine life]]\n* [[Deep chlorophyll maximum]]\n* [[Hawaii Ocean Time-series]]\n* [[International Census of Marine Microbes]]\n* [[Marine microbial symbiosis]]\n* [[Microbial biogeography]]\n* [[Microbial communities]]\n* [[Microbial ecology]]\n* [[Microbial food web]]\n* [[Microbial loop]]\n* [[Microbial oxidation of sulfur]]\n** [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms]]\n* [[Microbially induced sedimentary structure]]\n* [[Microbiology of oxygen minimum zones]]\n* [[Oceanic carbon cycle]]\n* [[Ooid]]\n* [[Picoeukaryote]]\n* [[Roseobacter]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==General references==\n* Haq B.U. and Boersma A.

Nigeria's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of much of [[Africa]] as a whole, and the country contains languages from the three major [[Languages of Africa|African languages families]]: [[Afroasiatic]], [[Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Niger\u2013Congo]]. Nigeria also has several as-yet [[List of unclassified languages according to the Ethnologue#Africa|unclassified languages]], such as [[Cent\u00fa\u00fam]], which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families.\n\n==Niger\u2013Congo languages==\n[[File:Niger-Congo speakers.png|thumb|right|Systematic graphic of the Niger\u2013Congo languages with numbers of speakers]]\n[[Niger\u2013Congo]] predominates in the Central, East and Southern areas of Nigeria; the main branches represented in Nigeria are [[Mande languages|Mande]], [[Atlantic languages|Atlantic]], [[Gur languages|Gur]], [[Kwa languages|Kwa]], [[Benue\u2013Congo]] and [[Adamawa\u2013Ubangi]]. Mande is represented by the [[Busa language (Mande)|Busa]] cluster and [[Kyenga language|Kyenga]] in the northwest. [[Fulfulde]] is the single Atlantic language, of [[Senegambia]]n origin but now spoken by cattle [[pastoralists]] across the [[Sahel]] and largely in the northeastern states of Nigeria, especially [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]].\n\nThe [[Ijoid languages]] are spoken across the [[Niger Delta]] and include [[Ijoid languages|\u1ecaj\u1ecd]] (Ijaw), Kalabari, and the intriguing remnant language [[Defaka language|Defaka]]. The [[Efik language]] is spoken across the coastal southeastern part of Nigeria and includes the dialects [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], [[Annang language|Annang]], and [[Efik language|Efik]] proper. The single [[Gur language]] spoken is Baat\u1ecdnun, in the extreme Northwest.\n\nThe Adamawa\u2013Ubangian languages are spoken between central Nigeria and the Central African Republic. Their westernmost representatives in Nigeria are the Tula-Waja languages. The Kwa languages are represented by the Gun group in the extreme southwest, which is affiliated to the Gbe languages in Benin and Togo.\n\nThe classification of the remaining languages is controversial; [[Joseph Greenberg]] classified those without noun-classes, such as Yoruba, Igbo, and Ibibio (Efik, Ibibio, and Annang), as 'Eastern [[Volta\u2013Niger languages|Kwa]]' and those with classes as '[[Benue\u2013Congo]]'. This was reversed in an influential 1989 publication and reflected on the 1992 map of languages, where all these were considered [[Benue\u2013Congo]]. Recent opinion, however, has been to revert to Greenberg's distinction. The literature must thus be read with care and due regard for the date. There are several small language groupings in the Niger Confluence area, notably Ukaan, Akpes, Ayere-Ahan and \u1ecck\u1ecd, whose inclusion in these groupings has never been satisfactorily argued.\n\nFormer Eastern [[Volta\u2013Niger languages|Kwa]], i.e. West [[Benue\u2013Congo]] would then include [[Igboid languages|Igboid]], i.e. [[Igbo language]] proper, [[Ukwuani]], [[Ikwerre language|Ikwerre]], [[Ekpeye]] etc., Yoruboid, i.e. [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Itsekiri]] and [[Igala language|Igala]], [[Akokoid languages|Akokoid]] (eight small languages in Ondo, Edo and Kogi state), [[Edoid]] including [[Edo language|Edo]] (sometimes referred to as) Bini in [[Edo State]], [[Ibibio language|Ibibio-Efik]], [[Idomoid languages|Idomoid]] ([[Idoma language|Idoma]]) and [[Nupoid languages|Nupoid]] ([[Nupe language|Nupe]]) and perhaps include the other languages mentioned above. The [[Idoma language]] is classified in the Akweya subgroup of the Idomoid languages of the Volta\u2013Niger family, which include Alago, Agatu, Etulo and Yala languages of Benue, Nasarawa and Northern Cross River states.\n\nEast [[Benue\u2013Congo]] includes [[Kainji languages|Kainji]], [[Plateau languages|Plateau]] (46 languages, notably [[Gamai language]]), [[Jukunoid]], [[Dakoid]] and [[Cross River languages|Cross River]]. Apart from these, there are numerous [[Bantoid languages]], which are the languages immediately ancestral to Bantu. These include [[Mambiloid]], [[Ekoid]], [[Bendi languages|Bendi]], [[Beboid]], [[Grassfields Bantu languages|Grassfields]] and [[Tivoid languages]].\n\nThe geographic distribution of Nigeria's Niger-Congo languages is not limited to the middle east and south-central Nigeria, as migration allows their spread to the linguistically Afro-Asiatic northern regions of Nigeria, as well as throughout [[West Africa]] and abroad. Igbo words such as 'unu' for 'you people', 'sooso' for 'only', 'obia' for 'native doctoring', etc. are used in patois of Jamaica and many Central American nations, Yoruba is spoken as a ritual language in cults such as the Santeria in the Caribbean and South-Central America, and the Berbice Dutch language in Surinam is based on an Ijoid language.\n\nEven the above listed linguistic diversity of the Niger\u2013Congo in Nigeria is deceptively limiting, as these languages may further consist of regional dialects that may not be mutually intelligible. As such some languages, particularly those with a large number of speakers, have been standardized and received a [[romanization|romanized orthography]]. Nearly all languages appear in a Latin alphabet when written.\n\nThe Efik, Igbo, and Yoruba languages are notable examples of this process. The more historically recent standardization and romanization of Igbo have provoked even more controversy due to its dialectical diversity, but the Central Igbo dialect has gained the widest acceptance as the standard-bearer. Many such as [[Chinua Achebe]] have dismissed standardization as colonial and conservative attempts to simplify a complex mosaic of languages.\n\nSuch controversies typify inter- and intra-ethnic conflict endemic to post-colonial Nigeria. Also worthy of note is the Enuani dialect, a variation of the Igbo that is spoken among parts of Anioma. The Anioma are the Aniocha, Ndokwa/Ukwuani, Ika and Oshimilli of Delta state.\n[[Standard Yoruba]] came into being due to the work [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Samuel Crowther]], the first African bishop of the [[Anglican Church]] and owes most of its lexicon to the dialects spoken in [[Oyo State|\u1eccy\u1ecd]] and [[Ibadan]].\n\nSince Standard Yoruba's constitution was determined by a single author rather than by a consensual linguistic policy by all speakers, the Standard has been attacked regarding for failing to include other dialects and spurred debate as to what demarcates \"genuine Yoruba\".\nLinguistically speaking, all demonstrate the varying [[phonological]] features of the Niger\u2013Congo family to which they belong, these include the use of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[nasalization|nasality]], and particular [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] systems; more information is available [[Niger\u2013Congo#Common features|here]].\n\n===Branches and locations===\nBelow is a list of major Niger\u2013Congo branches and their primary locations based on Blench (2019).<ref name=\"BlenchAtlas4\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Distributions of [[Volta\u2013Niger languages#Branches and locations|Volta\u2013Niger]] branches'''\n!

Of these, [[Chadic]] languages predominate, with 700+ languages. Semitic is represented by various dialects of [[Arabic]] spoken in the Northeast and Berber by the Tuareg-speaking communities in the extreme Northwest.[[Image:Afro asiatic peoples nigeria.png|thumb|450px|A map showing [[Afroasiatic]] speaking peoples in Nigeria|left]]The [[Hausa language]] is the most well-known [[Chadic]] language in Nigeria mampoza; though there is a paucity of statistics on native speakers in Nigeria, the language is spoken by 24 million people in West Africa and is the second language of 15 million more. Hausa has therefore emerged as ''[[lingua franca]]'' throughout much of West Africa and the Sahel in particular. The language is spoken primarily amongst Northern Nigerian[[Muslims]], and the language is often associated with Islamic culture in Nigeria and West Africa on the whole.\n\nHausa is classified as a [[West Chadic languages|West Chadic language]] of the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] grouping, a major subfamily of Afroasiatic. Culturally, the [[Hausa people]] have become closely integrated with the Fulani following the establishment of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] by the Fulani [[Uthman dan Fodio]] in the 19th century. Hausa is the [[official language]] of a number states in Northern Nigeria and the most important dialect is generally regarded as that spoken in [[Kano]], an Eastern Hausa dialect, which is the standard variety used for official purposes.\n\nEastern dialects also include some dialects spoken in [[Zaria]], and [[Bauchi]]; Western Hausa dialects include Sakkwatanchi spoken in [[Sokoto State|Sokoto]], Katsinanchi in Katsina Arewanchi in both [[Gobir]] and [[Adar]], [[Kebbi]], and [[Zamfara]]. [[Katsina]] is transitional between Eastern and Western dialects. Northern Hausa dialects include [[Arewa]] and [[Arawa language|Arawa]], while [[Zaria]] is a prominent Southern tongue version; [[Barikanchi]] is a [[pidgin]] formerly used in the military.\n\n[[Hausa language|Hausa]] is a highly atypical [[Chadic]] language, with a reduced tonal system and a phonology influenced by [[Arabic]]. Other well-known Chadic languages include Mupun, Ngas, Goemai, Mwaghavul, [[Bole language|Bole]], [[Ngizim language|Ngizim]], [[Bade language|Bade]] and Bachama. In the East of Nigeria and on into Cameroun are the Central Chadic languages, such as Bura, Kamwe and Marghi. These are highly diverse and remain very poorly described. Many Chadic languages are severely threatened; recent searches by Bernard Caron for Southern Bauchi languages show that even some of those recorded in the 1970s have disappeared. However, unknown Chadic languages are still being reported, witness the recent description of Dyarim.\n\nHausa, as well as other Afroasiatic languages like [[Bade language|Bade]] (another West Chadic language spoken in Yobe State), have historically been written in a modified [[Arabic script]] known as ''[[Ajami script|ajami]]'', however, the modern official orthography is now a romanization known as ''boko'' first introduced by the British regime in the 1930s.\n\n===Branches and locations===\nBelow is a list of major [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] branches and their primary locations based on Blench (2019).<ref name=\"BlenchAtlas4\">{{Cite book|title=An Atlas of Nigerian Languages|last=Blench|first=Roger|publisher=Kay Williamson Educational Foundation|year=2019|edition=4th|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref> Like the [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages, Chadic branches are also referred to by lettered codes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Nigeria's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of much of [[Africa]] as a whole, and the country contains languages from the three major [[Languages of Africa|African languages families]]: [[Afroasiatic]], [[Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Niger\u2013Congo]]. Nigeria also has several as-yet [[List of unclassified languages according to the Ethnologue#Africa|unclassified languages]], such as [[Cent\u00fa\u00fam]], which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families.\n\n==Niger\u2013Congo languages==\n[[File:Niger-Congo speakers.png|thumb|right|Systematic graphic of the Niger\u2013Congo languages with numbers of speakers]]\n[[Niger\u2013Congo]] predominates in the Central, East and Southern areas of Nigeria; the main branches represented in Nigeria are [[Mande languages|Mande]], [[Atlantic languages|Atlantic]], [[Gur languages|Gur]], [[Kwa languages|Kwa]], [[Benue\u2013Congo]] and [[Adamawa\u2013Ubangi]]. Mande is represented by the [[Busa language (Mande)|Busa]] cluster and [[Kyenga language|Kyenga]] in the northwest. [[Fulfulde]] is the single Atlantic language, of [[Senegambia]]n origin but now spoken by cattle [[pastoralists]] across the [[Sahel]] and largely in the northeastern states of Nigeria, especially [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]].\n\nThe [[Ijoid languages]] are spoken across the [[Niger Delta]] and include [[Ijoid languages|\u1ecaj\u1ecd]] (Ijaw), Kalabari, and the intriguing remnant language [[Defaka language|Defaka]]. The [[Efik language]] is spoken across the coastal southeastern part of Nigeria and includes the dialects [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], [[Annang language|Annang]], and [[Efik language|Efik]] proper. The single [[Gur language]] spoken is Baat\u1ecdnun, in the extreme Northwest.\n\nThe Adamawa\u2013Ubangian languages are spoken between central Nigeria and the Central African Republic. Their westernmost representatives in Nigeria are the Tula-Waja languages. The Kwa languages are represented by the Gun group in the extreme southwest, which is affiliated to the Gbe languages in Benin and Togo.\n\nThe classification of the remaining languages is controversial; [[Joseph Greenberg]] classified those without noun-classes, such as Yoruba, Igbo, and Ibibio (Efik, Ibibio, and Annang), as 'Eastern [[Volta\u2013Niger languages|Kwa]]' and those with classes as '[[Benue\u2013Congo]]'. This was reversed in an influential 1989 publication and reflected on the 1992 map of languages, where all these were considered [[Benue\u2013Congo]]. Recent opinion, however, has been to revert to Greenberg's distinction. The literature must thus be read with care and due regard for the date. There are several small language groupings in the Niger Confluence area, notably Ukaan, Akpes, Ayere-Ahan and \u1ecck\u1ecd, whose inclusion in these groupings has never been satisfactorily argued.\n\nFormer Eastern [[Volta\u2013Niger languages|Kwa]], i.e. West [[Benue\u2013Congo]] would then include [[Igboid languages|Igboid]], i.e. [[Igbo language]] proper, [[Ukwuani]], [[Ikwerre language|Ikwerre]], [[Ekpeye]] etc., Yoruboid, i.e. [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Itsekiri]] and [[Igala language|Igala]], [[Akokoid languages|Akokoid]] (eight small languages in Ondo, Edo and Kogi state), [[Edoid]] including [[Edo language|Edo]] (sometimes referred to as) Bini in [[Edo State]], [[Ibibio language|Ibibio-Efik]], [[Idomoid languages|Idomoid]] ([[Idoma language|Idoma]]) and [[Nupoid languages|Nupoid]] ([[Nupe language|Nupe]]) and perhaps include the other languages mentioned above. The [[Idoma language]] is classified in the Akweya subgroup of the Idomoid languages of the Volta\u2013Niger family, which include Alago, Agatu, Etulo and Yala languages of Benue, Nasarawa and Northern Cross River states.\n\nEast [[Benue\u2013Congo]] includes [[Kainji languages|Kainji]], [[Plateau languages|Plateau]] (46 languages, notably [[Gamai language]]), [[Jukunoid]], [[Dakoid]] and [[Cross River languages|Cross River]]. Apart from these, there are numerous [[Bantoid languages]], which are the languages immediately ancestral to Bantu. These include [[Mambiloid]], [[Ekoid]], [[Bendi languages|Bendi]], [[Beboid]], [[Grassfields Bantu languages|Grassfields]] and [[Tivoid languages]].\n\nThe geographic distribution of Nigeria's Niger-Congo languages is not limited to the middle east and south-central Nigeria, as migration allows their spread to the linguistically Afro-Asiatic northern regions of Nigeria, as well as throughout [[West Africa]] and abroad. Igbo words such as 'unu' for 'you people', 'sooso' for 'only', 'obia' for 'native doctoring', etc. are used in patois of Jamaica and many Central American nations, Yoruba is spoken as a ritual language in cults such as the Santeria in the Caribbean and South-Central America, and the Berbice Dutch language in Surinam is based on an Ijoid language.\n\nEven the above listed linguistic diversity of the Niger\u2013Congo in Nigeria is deceptively limiting, as these languages may further consist of regional dialects that may not be mutually intelligible. As such some languages, particularly those with a large number of speakers, have been standardized and received a [[romanization|romanized orthography]]. Nearly all languages appear in a Latin alphabet when written.\n\nThe Efik, Igbo, and Yoruba languages are notable examples of this process. The more historically recent standardization and romanization of Igbo have provoked even more controversy due to its dialectical diversity, but the Central Igbo dialect has gained the widest acceptance as the standard-bearer. Many such as [[Chinua Achebe]] have dismissed standardization as colonial and conservative attempts to simplify a complex mosaic of languages.\n\nSuch controversies typify inter- and intra-ethnic conflict endemic to post-colonial Nigeria. Also worthy of note is the Enuani dialect, a variation of the Igbo that is spoken among parts of Anioma. The Anioma are the Aniocha, Ndokwa/Ukwuani, Ika and Oshimilli of Delta state.\n[[Standard Yoruba]] came into being due to the work [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Samuel Crowther]], the first African bishop of the [[Anglican Church]] and owes most of its lexicon to the dialects spoken in [[Oyo State|\u1eccy\u1ecd]] and [[Ibadan]].\n\nSince Standard Yoruba's constitution was determined by a single author rather than by a consensual linguistic policy by all speakers, the Standard has been attacked regarding for failing to include other dialects and spurred debate as to what demarcates \"genuine Yoruba\".\nLinguistically speaking, all demonstrate the varying [[phonological]] features of the Niger\u2013Congo family to which they belong, these include the use of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[nasalization|nasality]], and particular [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] systems; more information is available [[Niger\u2013Congo#Common features|here]].\n\n===Branches and locations===\nBelow is a list of major Niger\u2013Congo branches and their primary locations based on Blench (2019).<ref name=\"BlenchAtlas4\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Distributions of [[Volta\u2013Niger languages#Branches and locations|Volta\u2013Niger]] branches'''\n!

Of these, [[Chadic]] languages predominate, with 700+ languages. Semitic is represented by various dialects of [[Arabic]] spoken in the Northeast and Berber by the Tuareg-speaking communities in the extreme Northwest.[[Image:Afro asiatic peoples nigeria.png|thumb|450px|A map showing [[Afroasiatic]] speaking peoples in Nigeria|left]]The [[Hausa language]] is the most well-known [[Chadic]] language in Nigeria mampoza; though there is a paucity of statistics on native speakers in Nigeria, the language is spoken by 24 million people in West Africa and is the second language of 15 million more. Hausa has therefore emerged as ''[[lingua franca]]'' throughout much of West Africa and the Sahel in particular. The language is spoken primarily amongst Northern Nigerian[[Muslims]], and the language is often associated with Islamic culture in Nigeria and West Africa on the whole.\n\nHausa is classified as a [[West Chadic languages|West Chadic language]] of the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] grouping, a major subfamily of Afroasiatic. Culturally, the [[Hausa people]] have become closely integrated with the Fulani following the establishment of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] by the Fulani [[Uthman dan Fodio]] in the 19th century. Hausa is the [[official language]] of a number states in Northern Nigeria and the most important dialect is generally regarded as that spoken in [[Kano]], an Eastern Hausa dialect, which is the standard variety used for official purposes.\n\nEastern dialects also include some dialects spoken in [[Zaria]], and [[Bauchi]]; Western Hausa dialects include Sakkwatanchi spoken in [[Sokoto State|Sokoto]], Katsinanchi in Katsina Arewanchi in both [[Gobir]] and [[Adar]], [[Kebbi]], and [[Zamfara]]. [[Katsina]] is transitional between Eastern and Western dialects. Northern Hausa dialects include [[Arewa]] and [[Arawa language|Arawa]], while [[Zaria]] is a prominent Southern tongue version; [[Barikanchi]] is a [[pidgin]] formerly used in the military.\n\n[[Hausa language|Hausa]] is a highly atypical [[Chadic]] language, with a reduced tonal system and a phonology influenced by [[Arabic]]. Other well-known Chadic languages include Mupun, Ngas, Goemai, Mwaghavul, [[Bole language|Bole]], [[Ngizim language|Ngizim]], [[Bade language|Bade]] and Bachama. In the East of Nigeria and on into Cameroun are the Central Chadic languages, such as Bura, Kamwe and Marghi. These are highly diverse and remain very poorly described. Many Chadic languages are severely threatened; recent searches by Bernard Caron for Southern Bauchi languages show that even some of those recorded in the 1970s have disappeared. However, unknown Chadic languages are still being reported, witness the recent description of Dyarim.\n\nHausa, as well as other Afroasiatic languages like [[Bade language|Bade]] (another West Chadic language spoken in Yobe State), have historically been written in a modified [[Arabic script]] known as ''[[Ajami script|ajami]]'', however, the modern official orthography is now a romanization known as ''boko'' first introduced by the British regime in the 1930s.\n\n===Branches and locations===\nBelow is a list of major [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] branches and their primary locations based on Blench (2019).<ref name=\"BlenchAtlas4\">{{Cite book|title=An Atlas of Nigerian Languages|last=Blench|first=Roger|publisher=Kay Williamson Educational Foundation|year=2019|edition=4th|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref> Like the [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages, Chadic branches are also referred to by lettered codes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
