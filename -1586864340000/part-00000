{"title_page": "Einstein Papers Project", "text_new": "[[File:Einstein Papers Project center 2007.JPG|thumb|Einstein Papers Project in [[Pasadena, California]], United States]]\n\nThe '''Einstein Papers Project''' (EPP) produces the historical edition of the writings and correspondence of [[Albert Einstein]]. The EPP collects, transcribes, translates, annotates, and publishes materials from Einstein's [[literary estate]] and a multitude of other repositories, which hold Einstein-related historical sources. The staff of the project is an international collaborative group of scholars, editors, researchers, and administrators working on the ongoing authoritative edition, ''[http://www.einstein.caltech.edu/what/published.html The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein]'' (''CPAE'').\n\nThe EPP was established by [[Princeton University Press]] (PUP) in 1977 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. The founding editor of the project was professor of physics [[John Stachel]]. In 1984, the project moved from Princeton to Stachel's home institution, [[Boston University]]. The first volume of the ''CPAE'' was published by PUP in 1987. The following year, historian of science [[Martin J. Klein]] of Yale University was appointed senior editor of the project. Volumes 1-6 and 8 of the series were completed during the project's time in Boston.\n\nIn 2000, professor of history [[Diana L. Kormos-Buchwald|Diana Kormos-Buchwald]] was appointed general editor and director of the EPP and established offices for the project at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) In [[Pasadena, California]]. Volumes 7 and 9-15 of the ''CPAE'' have been completed since the project's move to Caltech. (Volume 11 in the series is a comprehensive index and bibliography to Volumes 1-10).\n\nThe ''CPAE'' volumes include Einstein's books, his published and unpublished scientific and non-scientific articles, his lecture and research notebooks, travel diaries, book reviews, appeals, and reliable records of his lectures, speeches, interviews with the press, and other oral statements. The volumes also include his professional, personal, and political correspondence. Each annotated volume, referred to as the documentary edition, presents full text documents in their original language, primarily German. Introductions, endnotes, texts selected for inclusion as abstracts, etc. are in English. ''Volume 15'' of the ''CPAE'' is the most recent publication in the series; the first fifteen volumes cover Einstein's life up to his 48th birthday in 1927. PUP publishes the series. With each documentary edition, the EPP simultaneously publishes a companion English translation volume.\n\nThe EPP collaborates with the [[Albert Einstein Archives]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In his last will and testament, Einstein bequeathed his literary estate and his personal papers to the Hebrew University. The project and the archives maintain and update a shared [http://www.alberteinstein.info/database.html archival database] of 90,000+ records, freely accessible online. Support for the project comes from PUP, endowments from individuals and universities, the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].\n\nIn late 2014, the EPP and PUP launched [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/ The Digital Einstein Papers].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/ | title=The Digital Einstein Papers | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | accessdate=3 January 2016 }}</ref> The website presents the complete contents of ''[http://www.einstein.caltech.edu/what/published.html The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein]'', Volumes 1-14. The project volumes are reproduced online as fully searchable [[PDF]]<nowiki/>s. All documents and endnotes are linked to provide seamless transitions between the original language documentary edition and English translations. Subsequent volumes will be added to the website approximately eighteen months after their release in print. It is projected that there will be thirty volumes in the series. Eventually, the Digital Einstein Papers website will provide access to all of Einstein's writings and correspondence accompanied by scholarly annotation and apparatus.[[File:Albert Einstein in later years.jpg|thumb|upright|Albert Einstein.]]\n\n* <u>''The Early Years: 1879-1902''</u>&nbsp; is the first volume in the series.\n* <u>''The Swiss Years: 1900-1914''</u>&nbsp;  and <u>''The Berlin Years: 1914-1927''</u>&nbsp;  followed through volume 15 in two [[wikt:parallel|parallel]] and extensively [[cross-reference]]d branches:\n**<u>''Writings:''</u>&nbsp;  published and previously unpublished articles, lecture notes, research notes, accounts of his lectures, speeches, interviews, book reviews, etc.\n** <u>''Correspondence:''</u>&nbsp;  letters, travel diaries, calendars, documents about Einstein by third parties, etc.\n\n==The early years: 1879-1902==\n\n===Volume 1 - Collected Papers 1879-1902===\nIncludes many previously unpublished documents, ''e.g.'' class notes for [[Heinrich Friedrich Weber]]'s lectures on [[thermodynamics]] and [[electromagnetism]] during Einstein's second year at [[ETH Zurich]],  etc.\n* ''The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Volume 1, The Early Years: 1879-1902.'' <ref name=\"Vol1\"/>\n:Editors:  [[John Stachel]] ''et al.'' &nbsp;  {{ISBN|0-691-08407-6}}, 1987.\n\n==The Swiss years: 1900-1914==\n\n===Volume 2 - Writings 1900-1909===\nIncludes Einstein's first (1900) published paper after his graduation from [[ETH Zurich]],  the [[Annus Mirabilis Papers]],  text of his invited lecture after his first academic appointment to the [[University of Zurich]], etc.\n* ''The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Volume 2, The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900-1909.'' <ref name=\"Vol2\"/>\n: Editors: [[John Stachel]] ''et al.'' &nbsp;  {{ISBN|0-691-08526-9}}, 1989.\n\n===Volume 3 - Writings 1909-1911===\nIncludes Einstein's report to the first [[Solvay Conference]],  his appointment to the [[Charles University in Prague]],  his paper calculating [[Gravitational lens|gravitational bending]] of light,  previously unpublished lecture notes,  etc.\n* ''The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Volume 3, The Swiss Years: Writings, 1909-1911.'' <ref name=\"Vol3\"/>\n: Editors: [[Martin J.

''Volume 15'' of the ''CPAE'' is the most recent publication in the series; the first fifteen volumes cover Einstein's life up to his 48th birthday in 1927. PUP publishes the series. With each documentary edition, the EPP simultaneously publishes a companion English translation volume.\n\nThe EPP collaborates with the [[Albert Einstein Archives]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In his last will and testament, Einstein bequeathed his literary estate and his personal papers to the Hebrew University. The project and the archives maintain and update a shared [http://www.alberteinstein.info/database.html archival database] of 90,000+ records, freely accessible online. Support for the project comes from PUP, endowments from individuals and universities, the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].\n\nIn late 2014, the EPP and PUP launched [https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/ The Digital Einstein Papers].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/ | title=The Digital Einstein Papers | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | accessdate=3 January 2016 }}</ref> The website presents the complete contents of ''[http://www.einstein.caltech.edu/what/published.html The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein]'', Volumes 1-14. The project volumes are reproduced online as fully searchable [[PDF]]<nowiki/>s. All documents and endnotes are linked to provide seamless transitions between the original language documentary edition and English translations. Subsequent volumes will be added to the website approximately eighteen months after their release in print. It is projected that there will be thirty volumes in the series. Eventually, the Digital Einstein Papers website will provide access to all of Einstein's writings and correspondence accompanied by scholarly annotation and apparatus.[[File:Albert Einstein in later years.jpg|thumb|upright|Albert Einstein.]]\n\n* <u>''The Early Years: 1879-1902''</u>&nbsp; is the first volume in the series.\n* <u>''The Swiss Years: 1900-1914''</u>&nbsp;  and <u>''The Berlin Years: 1914-1927''</u>&nbsp;  followed through volume 15 in two [[wikt:parallel|parallel]] and extensively [[cross-reference]]d branches:\n**<u>''Writings:''</u>&nbsp;  published and previously unpublished articles, lecture notes, research notes, accounts of his lectures, speeches, interviews, book reviews, etc.\n** <u>''Correspondence:''</u>&nbsp;  letters, travel diaries, calendars, documents about Einstein by third parties, etc.\n\n==The early years: 1879-1902==\n\n===Volume 1 - Collected Papers 1879-1902===\nIncludes many previously unpublished documents, ''e.g.'' class notes for [[Heinrich Friedrich Weber]]'s lectures on [[thermodynamics]] and [[electromagnetism]] during Einstein's second year at [[ETH Zurich]],  etc.\n* ''The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Volume 1, The Early Years: 1879-1902.'' <ref name=\"Vol1\"/>\n:Editors:  [[John Stachel]] ''et al.'' &nbsp;  {{ISBN|0-691-08407-6}}, 1987.\n\n==The Swiss years: 1900-1914==\n\n===Volume 2 - Writings 1900-1909===\nIncludes Einstein's first (1900) published paper after his graduation from [[ETH Zurich]],  the [[Annus Mirabilis Papers]],  text of his invited lecture after his first academic appointment to the [[University of Zurich]], etc.\n* ''The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Volume 2, The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900-1909.'' <ref name=\"Vol2\"/>\n: Editors: [[John Stachel]] ''et al.'' &nbsp;  {{ISBN|0-691-08526-9}}, 1989.\n\n===Volume 3 - Writings 1909-1911===\nIncludes Einstein's report to the first [[Solvay Conference]],  his appointment to the [[Charles University in Prague]],  his paper calculating [[Gravitational lens|gravitational bending]] of light,  previously unpublished lecture notes,  etc.\n* ''The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Volume 3, The Swiss Years: Writings, 1909-1911.'' <ref name=\"Vol3\"/>\n: Editors: [[Martin J.

It has been brought back to life by business management expert Ken Helps. \n\nFamous British electrical consumer appliance trademark brand, Rediffusion has \u00a0completed its first licencing deal with a consortium of Chinese companies.\n\nRediffusion, based in Bristol has completed it\u2019s a 5-year licencing deal with a consortium of Chinese companies, led by East-Innovation Brand Management Co. Ltd.\n\n''The  Rediffusion's brand\u2019s distinct British heritage is very well received in emerging global markets, especially in China and South East Asia. Brands like Nokia, Nintendo, Polaroid, Kodak and Harley Davidson, that have successfully launched new product lines to capitalise on nostalgic consumers, to see that there is a promising future for retro branding.''{{Refimprove|date=July 2013}}\n'''Rediffusion''' was a business that distributed radio and TV signals through wired relay networks.  The business gave rise to a number of other companies, including [[Associated-Rediffusion]], later known as Rediffusion London, one of the first companies to win a terrestrial [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] ([[commercial television]]) franchise in the [[UK]]. Rediffusion also spawned a record label, Rediffusion International Music, in 1968. Redifon was the name used until 1981 for companies in the capital goods businesses of Rediffusion, viz. Redifon Computers, Redifon Flight Simulation and Redifon Telecommunications.\n\n==Early history==\nRediffusion was the trading name of '''Broadcast Relay Service''' Ltd, formed in 1928.  In 1929 the company introduced its first cable radio service in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] to customers frustrated with the difficulties of tuning in weak radio broadcasts. In the customer premises, nothing more than a selector switch and loudspeaker were needed.  Initially, the service consisted primarily of rebroadcasts of the [[BBC Radio]] service, which was reflected in the trading name: Rediffusion simply means \"broadcasting again\".\n\nRediffusion quickly branched out into making, renting, and selling radios, both receivers for its cable services and conventional models. With the arrival of the first experimental [[television]] broadcasts in the 1930s, Rediffusion began manufacturing TV sets and supplying \"Piped TV\", an early form of [[cable TV]], service to its customers, until the cessation of television broadcasts during the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe first British colony to have the Rediffusion service was [[Barbados]] in 1934, when Radio Distribution (Barbados) Limited was formed.\n\nA year later, Rediffusion started operating in [[Malta]]. Transmissions in Malta started from [[Hamrun]] on 11 November 1935 under the name of \"Broadcast Relay Service Malta Ltd.\" Charles Whotcroft and George Powler were the first manager and chief engineer respectively.<ref>Ix-Xandir F'Malta, Remig Sacco, Malta 1985, 24.</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nIn 1947 [[British Electric Traction]] acquired a substantial minority interest in Rediffusion.  BET acquired a controlling interest in 1967, and the remaining 36% of equity in 1983.<ref>[http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1985/fulltext/184c03.pdf Competition Commission report, 1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025074653/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk//rep_pub/reports/1985/fulltext/184c03.pdf |date=25 October 2007 }}  The assertion on some websites that BET controlled Rediffusion from its inception does not appear to be right.</ref>\n\nIn 1948 Rediffusion established '''Redifon Ltd''' as a manufacturer of naval (and later flight) telecommunications equipment.\n\nAfter the war, Rediffusion began operations in several of the then British colonies. These included holding the concessions for wired and over-the-air radio and television stations. A subsidiary company, '''Overseas Rediffusion''', operated these stations and also sold advertising time and programming for them. Stations included the radio station Rediffusion [[Starcom Network|Barbados]],<ref>http://www.onecaribbeanmedia.net/media_group.php?mid=26</ref> [[Rediffusion Television|Hong Kong]], [[Rediffusion Singapore|Singapore]], [[Red FM (Malaysia)|Malaysia]], Thailand and the wired television service Rediffusion Television in [[Hong Kong]], the latter later known as [[Asia Television]]. It also opened a company in Jersey in 1949, Rediffusion (Channel Islands) Limited, which obtained a licence to relay radio broadcasts from the [[States of Jersey]] in 1950. It also opened a manufacturing division in Jersey, Television Research Limited (TVR) which also provided research facilities for the wired network. This was established in 1952 and was renamed Reditronics Limited in 1976.\n\nBET's financial resources enabled Rediffusion to capitalise on the growth in post war television, which restarted in 1946. Initially, the company installed cable TV systems in blocks of flats in London, and over the next few years expanded outside London.  The company was also involved in the sale and rental of television sets.\n\n==Expansion into broadcasting==\nWith the passage of the [[Television Act 1954]], Rediffusion joined forces with [[Associated Newspapers]], a subsidiary of [[Daily Mail and General Trust]], to form [[Associated-Rediffusion]], and won the coveted London weekday [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast franchise. They began broadcasting on 22 September 1955.\n\nDuring the partnership's first year, Associated-Rediffusion was losing money so fast that \nby the end of 1956, Associated Newspapers sold 80% of its stake back to BET and Rediffusion at a severe loss. Around this time, Associated-Rediffusion struck a very  lucrative deal with [[Granada Television]], the franchise holder for weekday broadcasts in the North of England. Granada was also losing money, and lacked the financial resources of BET; the deal guaranteed Granada a certain level of financial security, at the cost of Associated-Rediffusion receiving the vast majority of future profits from their arrangement.\n\nOn 29 September 1962 Rediffusion (Malta) Ltd. inaugurated a television service covering the [[Malta|Maltese]] islands.<ref name=\"PSB\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8bwlvxicNw0C&lpg=PA245&ots=npMqQD1-qu&dq=rediffusion%20malta%20television&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Public Service Broadcasting in the Age of Globalization''], Indrajit Banerjee, Kalinga Seneviratne, AMIC, 2006, page 245</ref> \n\nBy 1964, when Associated-Rediffusion changed its name to Rediffusion London, the efforts of the owners had left them sitting on a substantial cash pile, and it is arguable that this success may have led to the 1967 decision by the [[Independent Television Authority]] to effectively break up the company. Rediffusion London was ordered to merge with [[Associated British Corporation]], the holder of the weekend [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and North of England franchises, to form [[Thames Television]], with ABC given the controlling interest (despite its generally weaker financial position) and Rediffusion holding 49%. Thames Television was given the new weekday London franchise, with ABC's existing franchises awarded to other companies.\n\n==Other ventures==\n===Rediffusion Cable===\n[[File:Antique Barbados Rediffusion stereo-001.jpg|thumb|Long deactivated speaker for the Rediffusion located at the police station in Hastings, [[Christ Church, Barbados]].]]\nRediffusion also offered a low-bandwidth cable TV and radio distribution system. This was based on connecting homes with multiple twisted-pair cables. Each pair carried a single TV or radio channel. The system was provided in most UK towns.  Selection of TV or radio station was by means of a rotary switch, usually mounted on a wall or window frame close to the point of entry of the cable into the home. From this a two-wire cable led to the TV or radio. The TVs used on this system were stripped-down TV sets with no tuner or RF front-end and the radios were little more than a loudspeaker with built in amplifier. Rediffusion abandoned this system of TV and radio distribution by the end of the 1980s.  The wall mounted switches, external junction boxes and street cable ducts are still visible in places that have not been redeveloped since the late 1980s.\n\n===Overseas Rediffusion===\n[[File:Piet\u00e0 Malta Buildings 19.jpg|thumb| Ex-[[Rediffusion House]] [[Malta]] now known as P.B.S Creativity Hub in [[Gwardaman\u0121a]], built for Rediffusion (Malta) Ltd in 1958]]\n\nBET and Rediffusion Limited had strong links with the former British colonies.

Redifon, established in 1948, had become a manufacturer of flight simulators and in 1981 BET changed Redifon's name to [[Thales Training & Simulation|Rediffusion Simulation]] to capitalise on the name.  The company was sold in 1988 to [[Hughes Aircraft]], which kept the Rediffusion name until it sold the company in 1994.\n\nRedifon (later Rediffusion) Computers was also part of the group and was based in [[Crawley]], [[West Sussex]]. It initially started in the production of analogue computers to control [[flight simulator]]s, then moved to produce minicomputers (\"R range\"), departmental Unix Servers and microcomputers (\"teleputers\"), specialising in data capture, enterprise accounting for local government and [[videotex]] systems. [[Michael Aldrich]] joined the company as Marketing Director in 1977 and became Managing Director and CEO in 1980. In 1979 Aldrich invented [[online shopping]] a form of [[electronic commerce]].<ref>Pioneers of Online Shopping, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton http://www.aldricharchive.com</ref>\n\nFrom 1980 the company designed, manufactured, sold, installed and maintained online shopping systems mainly in the UK and achieved a significant number of world firsts. The company\u2019s name was changed to Rediffusion Computers in 1981. During the 1980s a large part of the company's revenue came from its sales in Eastern Europe and Russia. Equipment that met the CoCom directive for the sales of high performance technology to the Soviet Block was supplied to a number of customers the largest of which was [[Gazprom]] who used the systems on the Siberian Gas Pipeline project.<ref>USSR, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton http://www.aldricharchive.com</ref> In addition there was a steady stream of Polish engineers attending the Crawley training facility to enable them to support and maintain this equipment mainly in Russia but also in other countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]].\n\nThe company was highly innovative and amongst other things developed a signature recognition system for detecting [[cheque fraud]].  It was one of the first companies to sell a turnkey solution that utilised the newly available Post Office database (PAF) for postcode recognition. In 1984 Aldrich led a [[management buyout]] and the company became ''ROCC Computers'' (Rediffusion's Old Computer Company). Aldrich was the largest shareholder and he subsequently bought-out the other shareholders.\n\nIn the 1980s, Rediffusion's cable operations were left behind by the new generation of [[cable TV]] networks.  BET (from 1983 the sole owners of Rediffusion) began divesting and sold off its overseas interests, and at the end of the 1980s the company was broken up,  The rentals business went to [[Granada Ltd.|Granada]], and the cable network systems were sold to the [[Robert Maxwell|Maxwell Communications]].\n\nReditronics Jersey was sold to SCK Holdings Limited in 1986 and following BET's retreat from cable and the consequent loss of associated contracts, it ceased trading in 1987. The Rediffusion Jersey cable network was sold to Jersey Cable Limited (now [[Newtel Solutions]]) in 1988.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Associated-Rediffusion]]\n* [[Rediffusion Singapore]]\n* [[Rediffusion Television]] (Hong Kong)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.rediffusion.info The history of Rediffusion by Gerald K Clode]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120218231748/http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/tvh/history/history.php A history of Rediffusion by Russ J Graham]\n*[http://www.petford.net/kaleidoscope/itv-history.html Shuffling the pack by Simon Coward (1993-94)]\n*[http://www.prx205.org/docs/Rediffusion%20Jersey.pdf History of Radio and Television Relay Services in Jersey]\n*[http://www.7tt77.co.uk/REDIFFUSION.html Rediffusion International Music]\n*[http://www.rediffusion.info/Barbados/ Rediffusion Barbados] (unofficial history site)\n\n[[Category:Defunct media companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies of Malta]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Radio and television company}}\n{{about|the original radio and television wired relay company|the related TV stations and other businesses|Rediffusion (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2013}}\n'''Rediffusion''' was a business that distributed radio and TV signals through wired relay networks.

In 1979 Aldrich invented [[online shopping]] a form of [[electronic commerce]].<ref>Pioneers of Online Shopping, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton http://www.aldricharchive.com</ref>\n\nFrom 1980 the company designed, manufactured, sold, installed and maintained online shopping systems mainly in the UK and achieved a significant number of world firsts. The company\u2019s name was changed to Rediffusion Computers in 1981. During the 1980s a large part of the company's revenue came from its sales in Eastern Europe and Russia. Equipment that met the CoCom directive for the sales of high performance technology to the Soviet Block was supplied to a number of customers the largest of which was [[Gazprom]] who used the systems on the Siberian Gas Pipeline project.<ref>USSR, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton http://www.aldricharchive.com</ref> In addition there was a steady stream of Polish engineers attending the Crawley training facility to enable them to support and maintain this equipment mainly in Russia but also in other countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]].\n\nThe company was highly innovative and amongst other things developed a signature recognition system for detecting [[cheque fraud]].  It was one of the first companies to sell a turnkey solution that utilised the newly available Post Office database (PAF) for postcode recognition. In 1984 Aldrich led a [[management buyout]] and the company became ''ROCC Computers'' (Rediffusion's Old Computer Company). Aldrich was the largest shareholder and he subsequently bought-out the other shareholders.\n\nIn the 1980s, Rediffusion's cable operations were left behind by the new generation of [[cable TV]] networks.  BET (from 1983 the sole owners of Rediffusion) began divesting and sold off its overseas interests, and at the end of the 1980s the company was broken up,  The rentals business went to [[Granada Ltd.|Granada]], and the cable network systems were sold to the [[Robert Maxwell|Maxwell Communications]].\n\nReditronics Jersey was sold to SCK Holdings Limited in 1986 and following BET's retreat from cable and the consequent loss of associated contracts, it ceased trading in 1987. The Rediffusion Jersey cable network was sold to Jersey Cable Limited (now [[Newtel Solutions]]) in 1988.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Associated-Rediffusion]]\n* [[Rediffusion Singapore]]\n* [[Rediffusion Television]] (Hong Kong)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.rediffusion.info The history of Rediffusion by Gerald K Clode]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120218231748/http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/tvh/history/history.php A history of Rediffusion by Russ J Graham]\n*[http://www.petford.net/kaleidoscope/itv-history.html Shuffling the pack by Simon Coward (1993-94)]\n*[http://www.prx205.org/docs/Rediffusion%20Jersey.pdf History of Radio and Television Relay Services in Jersey]\n*[http://www.7tt77.co.uk/REDIFFUSION.html Rediffusion International Music]\n*[http://www.rediffusion.info/Barbados/ Rediffusion Barbados] (unofficial history site)\n\n[[Category:Defunct media companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies of Malta]]\n", "name_user": "KHelpsy", "label": "safe", "comment": "New update on Rediffusion", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rediffusion"}

This was the first [[Volkswagen Group]] model to use the \"PQ34\" or \"A4\" [[Automobile platform|platform]], bearing a close resemblance to the contemporary [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]], which arrived a year later. Within three years, this platform was used for total of seven cars.\n\nThe A3 was initially available only with a three-door [[hatchback]] body, to present a more sporty image than the Golf, in both [[front-wheel drive|front]] and [[four-wheel drive]]. The [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] engines were [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]]. The Audi A3 was the eighth model in the Audi lineup to use five valves per cylinder.\n\nThe United Kingdom market first received the Audi A3 in November 1996.\n\nIn 1999, Audi expanded the range with the introduction of more powerful versions: a 1.8 turbo rated {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 1.9 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] [[diesel engine]] with [[unit injector]] \"Pumpe D\u00fcse\" (PD) technology and [[variable geometry turbocharger]]. The four-wheel-drive A3 1.8T [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] used either the {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine, and the same [[Haldex Traction]]-based four-wheel-drive system as the [[Audi S3]] and the [[Audi TT]]. Also in 1999, Audi also introduced a five-door body.\n\nIn late 2000, the A3 range was revised with new headlights and rear lamps, other minor cosmetic changes, an improved interior, and the introduction of a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, on the {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.8 Turbo and the new {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.9 TDI.\n\nAudi's [[electronic stability control]], traction-control, and brake force distribution computer became standard equipment in some countries.\n\nAlthough the first-generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, the first generation model continued to be sold in some markets. Production of the first generation model stopped in Brazil in 2006.\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 160\n| height = 100\n|File:1997 Audi A3 1.6 Front.jpg|Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:1997 Audi A3 1.6 Rear.jpg|Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:1999-2000 Audi A3 (8L) 1.8 5-door hatchback 01.jpg|Audi A3 5-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:Audi A3 1.8 T (8L, Facelift) \u2013 Heckansicht, 29.

Originally launched only as a three-door [[hatchback]] with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new [[automobile platform]] (the [[Volkswagen A platform#PQ35|PQ35]] platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new [[petrol engine]]s with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6).\n\nIn mid-2003, the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 3.2&nbsp;L [[VR6 engine]] (for the first time) with {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. [[Haldex Traction]]-based [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] on-demand four-wheel drive, and the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-auto gearbox]] were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over {{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2005, the \"S line\" trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the North American market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 [[inline-four engine|inline-four]] FSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 quattro following.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The A3 Sportback is {{convert|80|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370&nbsp;litres). It also received the new \"single frame\" front grille originally introduced in the [[Audi A8|A8 W12]], which was later adopted across the whole A3 range.\n\n====S3 (2006\u20132013)====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Audi s3 front.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S3 3 door hatchback]]\n[[File:Audi s3 back white.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S3 3-door hatchback]]\n\nIn August 2006, Audi announced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation\u2014''Typ'' 8P\u2014S3 is powered by a modified and uprated [[Volkswagen Group]]-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged [[gasoline direct injection|FSI]] [[petrol engine]], with a maximum output of {{convert|195|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. As with all [[Audi S and RS models|Audi S models]], the design was done in-house by [[quattro GmbH]]. The engine features uprated high-performance pistons, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size ([[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] K04) and larger [[intercooler]]. The most powerful form of this engine, and [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive, makes for a {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} time of 5.5&nbsp;seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] automatic transmissions with the S3.\n\nThe spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a \"quattro\" model, the S3 does not employ a [[Torsen]] centre differential (as in other common quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish [[Haldex Traction]] system in its on-demand [[four-wheel drive]] transmission, due to the [[transverse engine]] layout.\n\n====Safety====\n{{Euro NCAP |year=2003 |description=Audi A3, RHD 3-dr hatchback |reference=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/audi_a3_2003/176.aspx |reference_name=Euro NCAP test 2 |adult_stars=4 |adult_score=29 |child_stars=3 |child_score=35 |pedestrian_stars=1 |pedestrian_score=8 |align=left}}\nEuro NCAP tested a second generation Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, [[seatbelt pretensioner]]s and load limiters as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. \"A poor result for a new car\" was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test.{{clear}}\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 160\n| height = 100\n| File:Audi A3 silver vl.jpg|2003\u20132005 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:Audi A3 II front.JPG|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:Audi A3 II rear.JPG|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:2008 Audi A3 Sport TDi 1.9 Rear.jpg|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 Sportback\n}}\n\n===2008 facelift===\nAudi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008.

The new A3 sedan was given significant cosmetic updates, which were in-line with the automaker's new design philosophy.

This was the first [[Volkswagen Group]] model to use the \"PQ34\" or \"A4\" [[Automobile platform|platform]], bearing a close resemblance to the contemporary [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]], which arrived a year later. Within three years, this platform was used for total of seven cars.\n\nThe A3 was initially available only with a three-door [[hatchback]] body, to present a more sporty image than the Golf, in both [[front-wheel drive|front]] and [[four-wheel drive]]. The [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] engines were [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]]. The Audi A3 was the eighth model in the Audi lineup to use five valves per cylinder.\n\nThe United Kingdom market first received the Audi A3 in November 1996.\n\nIn 1999, Audi expanded the range with the introduction of more powerful versions: a 1.8 turbo rated {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 1.9 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] [[diesel engine]] with [[unit injector]] \"Pumpe D\u00fcse\" (PD) technology and [[variable geometry turbocharger]]. The four-wheel-drive A3 1.8T [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] used either the {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine, and the same [[Haldex Traction]]-based four-wheel-drive system as the [[Audi S3]] and the [[Audi TT]]. Also in 1999, Audi also introduced a five-door body.\n\nIn late 2000, the A3 range was revised with new headlights and rear lamps, other minor cosmetic changes, an improved interior, and the introduction of a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, on the {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.8 Turbo and the new {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.9 TDI.\n\nAudi's [[electronic stability control]], traction-control, and brake force distribution computer became standard equipment in some countries.\n\nAlthough the first-generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, the first generation model continued to be sold in some markets. Production of the first generation model stopped in Brazil in 2006.\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 160\n| height = 100\n|File:1997 Audi A3 1.6 Front.jpg|Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:1997 Audi A3 1.6 Rear.jpg|Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:1999-2000 Audi A3 (8L) 1.8 5-door hatchback 01.jpg|Audi A3 5-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:Audi A3 1.8 T (8L, Facelift) \u2013 Heckansicht, 29.

Originally launched only as a three-door [[hatchback]] with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new [[automobile platform]] (the [[Volkswagen A platform#PQ35|PQ35]] platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new [[petrol engine]]s with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6).\n\nIn mid-2003, the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 3.2&nbsp;L [[VR6 engine]] (for the first time) with {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. [[Haldex Traction]]-based [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] on-demand four-wheel drive, and the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-auto gearbox]] were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over {{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2005, the \"S line\" trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the North American market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 [[inline-four engine|inline-four]] FSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 quattro following.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The A3 Sportback is {{convert|80|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370&nbsp;litres). It also received the new \"single frame\" front grille originally introduced in the [[Audi A8|A8 W12]], which was later adopted across the whole A3 range.\n\n====S3 (2006\u20132013)====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Audi s3 front.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S3 3 door hatchback]]\n[[File:Audi s3 back white.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S3 3-door hatchback]]\n\nIn August 2006, Audi announced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation\u2014''Typ'' 8P\u2014S3 is powered by a modified and uprated [[Volkswagen Group]]-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged [[gasoline direct injection|FSI]] [[petrol engine]], with a maximum output of {{convert|195|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. As with all [[Audi S and RS models|Audi S models]], the design was done in-house by [[quattro GmbH]]. The engine features uprated high-performance pistons, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size ([[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] K04) and larger [[intercooler]]. The most powerful form of this engine, and [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive, makes for a {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} time of 5.5&nbsp;seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] automatic transmissions with the S3.\n\nThe spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a \"quattro\" model, the S3 does not employ a [[Torsen]] centre differential (as in other common quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish [[Haldex Traction]] system in its on-demand [[four-wheel drive]] transmission, due to the [[transverse engine]] layout.\n\n====Safety====\n{{Euro NCAP |year=2003 |description=Audi A3, RHD 3-dr hatchback |reference=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/audi_a3_2003/176.aspx |reference_name=Euro NCAP test 2 |adult_stars=4 |adult_score=29 |child_stars=3 |child_score=35 |pedestrian_stars=1 |pedestrian_score=8 |align=left}}\nEuro NCAP tested a second generation Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, [[seatbelt pretensioner]]s and load limiters as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. \"A poor result for a new car\" was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test.{{clear}}\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 160\n| height = 100\n| File:Audi A3 silver vl.jpg|2003\u20132005 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:Audi A3 II front.JPG|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:Audi A3 II rear.JPG|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:2008 Audi A3 Sport TDi 1.9 Rear.jpg|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 Sportback\n}}\n\n===2008 facelift===\nAudi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008.

The facelifted model was first unveiled through a set of official images in April 2016. The new A3 sedan was given significant cosmetic updates, which were in-line with the automaker's new design philosophy. As a result, the 2017 Audi A3 sedan featured the Matrix LED headlamps that were earlier seen in the A8 flagship sedan and the R8 supercar. The front grille was also given a refreshed treatment that made the new A3 look like its elder siblings. Changes on the sides and rear were minimal, with only the taillights getting new LED treatment. There were multiple updates on the interiors as well, with a fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster screen placed behind the steering wheel available as an optional upgrade.

On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of [[World War II]], piloted by Tibbets and [[Robert A. Lewis]] it became the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb]]. The bomb, code-named \"[[Little Boy]]\", was targeted at the city of [[Hiroshima]], Japan, and caused the near-complete destruction of the city. ''Enola Gay'' participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of [[Kokura]]. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target, [[Nagasaki]], being bombed instead.\n\nAfter the war, the ''Enola Gay'' returned to the United States, where it was operated from [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], [[New Mexico]]. In May 1946, it was flown to [[Kwajalein]] for the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear test]]s in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]]. Later that year it was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]], in 1961.\n\nIn the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. The last survivor of its crew, [[Theodore Van Kirk]], died on 28 July 2014 at the age of 93.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Early history===\nThe ''Enola Gay'' (Model number B-29-45-MO,{{refn|The ''block number'' was a one- to three-digit number, followed by a two-letter code that represented the aircraft built to the same engineering specification. The two-letter code represented the plant at which the aircraft was built, in this case, Martin in Omaha. This was combined with the aircraft model designation (B-29) to form the ''model number'' {{sfn|Mann|2004|p=100}}|group=N}} Serial number 44-86292, [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|Victor number]] 82) was built by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] (later part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) at its [[Bellevue, Nebraska]], plant, located at what is now known as [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. The bomber was one of the 15 initial examples of [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]]s built to the \"[[Silverplate]]\" specification\u201465 of these eventually being completed during and after World War II\u2014giving them the primary ability to function as nuclear \"weapon delivery\" aircraft. These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and British bomb attachment and release systems, reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing, improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14\u201315}}<ref name=\"AirIll\">March, Peter R. \"Enola Gay Restored\".

Tibbets Jr.]], the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], on 9 May 1945, while still on the [[assembly line]]. The aircraft was accepted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy]], 509th Composite Group. Crew B-9, commanded by [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Robert A. Lewis]], took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509th's base at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], [[Utah]], on 14 June 1945.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nThirteen days later, the aircraft left Wendover for [[Guam]], where it received a bomb-bay modification, and flew to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], [[Tinian]], on 6 July. It was initially given the Victor (squadron-assigned identification) number 12, but on 1 August, was given the [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|circle R tail markings]] of the [[6th Operations Group|6th Bombardment Group]] as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}  During July, the bomber made eight practice or training flights, and flew two missions, on 24 and 26 July, to drop [[pumpkin bomb]]s on industrial targets at [[Kobe]] and [[Nagoya]]. ''Enola Gay'' was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=117}}\n\nThe partially assembled [[Little Boy]] [[gun-type fission weapon]] L-11, weighing {{convert|10000|lb}}, was contained inside a {{convert|41|in|cm|adj=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|47|in|cm|adj=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|138|in|cm|adj=on}} wooden crate that was secured to the deck of the {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}.

At a time when Dad had thought I had lost my marbles, she had taken my side and said, \"I know you will be all right, son.\"{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=203}} }}\n\nThe name was painted on the aircraft on 5 August by Allan L. Karl, an enlisted man in the 509th.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}} Regularly-assigned aircraft commander Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now-famous nose art.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n[[Hiroshima]] was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. ''Enola Gay'', piloted by Tibbets, took off from [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]'', commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned out the window to direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|pp=31\u201332}}\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hiroshima explosion]]\n\nAfter leaving Tinian, the aircraft made their way separately to [[Iwo Jima]], where they rendezvoused at {{convert|2440|m|ft|sp=us}} and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at {{convert|9855|m|ft|sp=us}}. Captain [[William Sterling Parsons|William S. \"Deak\" Parsons]] of [[Project Alberta]], who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff.

On 29 April 1946, ''Enola Gay'' left Roswell as part of the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear weapons tests]] in the Pacific. It flew to [[Kwajalein Atoll]] on 1 May. It was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]] and left Kwajalein on 1 July, the date of the test, reaching [[Travis Air Force Base|Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field]], California, the next day.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=193}}\n\nThe decision was made to preserve the ''Enola Gay'', and on 24 July 1946, the aircraft was flown to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Tucson, Arizona]], in preparation for storage. On 30 August 1946, the title to the aircraft was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the ''Enola Gay'' was removed from the USAAF inventory.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=193}} From 1946 to 1961, the ''Enola Gay'' was put into temporary storage at a number of locations. It was at Davis-Monthan from 1 September 1946 until 3 July 1949, when it was flown to [[O'Hare International Airport|Orchard Place Air Field]], [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], by Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian. It was moved to [[Pyote Air Force Base]], Texas, on 12 January 1952, and then to [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Maryland, on 2 December 1953,{{sfn|Polmar|2004|p=66}} because the Smithsonian had no storage space for the aircraft.<ref name=\"An Exhibit Denied\" />\n\nIt was hoped that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left outdoors on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements.

By the early 1980s, two veterans of the 509th, Don Rehl and his former navigator in the 509th, Frank B. Stewart, began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display. They enlisted Tibbets and Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in their campaign. In 1983, [[Walter J. Boyne]], a former [[B-52]] pilot with the [[Strategic Air Command]], became director of the National Air and Space Museum, and he made the ''Enola Gay''{{'}}s restoration a priority.<ref name=\"An Exhibit Denied\" /> Looking at the aircraft, Tibbets recalled, was a \"sad meeting.

Rather, the dispute was sometimes a symbolic issue in a \"culture war\" in which many Americans lumped together the seeming decline of American power, the difficulties of the domestic economy, the threats in world trade and especially Japan's successes, the loss of domestic jobs, and even changes in American gender roles and shifts in the American family. To a number of Americans, the very people responsible for the script were the people who were changing America. The bomb, representing the end of World War II and suggesting the height of American power was to be celebrated. It was, in this judgment, a crucial symbol of America's \"good war\", one fought justly for noble purposes at a time when America was united.

On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of [[World War II]], piloted by Tibbets and [[Robert A. Lewis]] it became the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb]]. The bomb, code-named \"[[Little Boy]]\", was targeted at the city of [[Hiroshima]], Japan, and caused the near-complete destruction of the city. ''Enola Gay'' participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of [[Kokura]]. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target, [[Nagasaki]], being bombed instead.\n\nAfter the war, the ''Enola Gay'' returned to the United States, where it was operated from [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], [[New Mexico]]. In May 1946, it was flown to [[Kwajalein]] for the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear test]]s in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]]. Later that year it was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]], in 1961.\n\nIn the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. The last survivor of its crew, [[Theodore Van Kirk]], died on 28 July 2014 at the age of 93.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Early history===\nThe ''Enola Gay'' (Model number B-29-45-MO,{{refn|The ''block number'' was a one- to three-digit number, followed by a two-letter code that represented the aircraft built to the same engineering specification. The two-letter code represented the plant at which the aircraft was built, in this case, Martin in Omaha.

Martin Company]] (later part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) at its [[Bellevue, Nebraska]], plant, located at what is now known as [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. The bomber was one of the 15 initial examples of [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]]s built to the \"[[Silverplate]]\" specification\u201465 of these eventually being completed during and after World War II\u2014giving them the primary ability to function as nuclear \"weapon delivery\" aircraft. These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and British bomb attachment and release systems, reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing, improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14\u201315}}<ref name=\"AirIll\">March, Peter R. \"Enola Gay Restored\".

Tibbets Jr.]], the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], on 9 May 1945, while still on the [[assembly line]]. The aircraft was accepted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy]], 509th Composite Group. Crew B-9, commanded by [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Robert A. Lewis]], took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509th's base at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], [[Utah]], on 14 June 1945.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nThirteen days later, the aircraft left Wendover for [[Guam]], where it received a bomb-bay modification, and flew to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], [[Tinian]], on 6 July. It was initially given the Victor (squadron-assigned identification) number 12, but on 1 August, was given the [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|circle R tail markings]] of the [[6th Operations Group|6th Bombardment Group]] as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}  During July, the bomber made eight practice or training flights, and flew two missions, on 24 and 26 July, to drop [[pumpkin bomb]]s on industrial targets at [[Kobe]] and [[Nagoya]]. ''Enola Gay'' was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=117}}\n\nThe partially assembled [[Little Boy]] [[gun-type fission weapon]] L-11, weighing {{convert|10000|lb}}, was contained inside a {{convert|41|in|cm|adj=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|47|in|cm|adj=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|138|in|cm|adj=on}} wooden crate that was secured to the deck of the {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}.

At a time when Dad had thought I had lost my marbles, she had taken my side and said, \"I know you will be all right, son.\"{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=203}} }}\n\nThe name was painted on the aircraft on 5 August by Allan L. Karl, an enlisted man in the 509th.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}} Regularly-assigned aircraft commander Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now-famous nose art.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n[[Hiroshima]] was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. ''Enola Gay'', piloted by Tibbets, took off from [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]'', commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned out the window to direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|pp=31\u201332}}\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hiroshima explosion]]\n\nAfter leaving Tinian, the aircraft made their way separately to [[Iwo Jima]], where they rendezvoused at {{convert|2440|m|ft|sp=us}} and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at {{convert|9855|m|ft|sp=us}}. Captain [[William Sterling Parsons|William S. \"Deak\" Parsons]] of [[Project Alberta]], who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff.

On 30 August 1946, the title to the aircraft was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the ''Enola Gay'' was removed from the USAAF inventory.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=193}} From 1946 to 1961, the ''Enola Gay'' was put into temporary storage at a number of locations. It was at Davis-Monthan from 1 September 1946 until 3 July 1949, when it was flown to [[O'Hare International Airport|Orchard Place Air Field]], [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], by Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian. It was moved to [[Pyote Air Force Base]], Texas, on 12 January 1952, and then to [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Maryland, on 2 December 1953,{{sfn|Polmar|2004|p=66}} because the Smithsonian had no storage space for the aircraft.<ref name=\"An Exhibit Denied\" />\n\nIt was hoped that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left outdoors on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. [[Paul E.

The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]], on 21 July 1961.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|p=66}}\n\n''Enola Gay'' remained at Suitland for many years. By the early 1980s, two veterans of the 509th, Don Rehl and his former navigator in the 509th, Frank B. Stewart, began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display. They enlisted Tibbets and Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in their campaign. In 1983, [[Walter J. Boyne]], a former [[B-52]] pilot with the [[Strategic Air Command]], became director of the National Air and Space Museum, and he made the ''Enola Gay''{{'}}s restoration a priority.<ref name=\"An Exhibit Denied\" /> Looking at the aircraft, Tibbets recalled, was a \"sad meeting.

Rather, the dispute was sometimes a symbolic issue in a \"culture war\" in which many Americans lumped together the seeming decline of American power, the difficulties of the domestic economy, the threats in world trade and especially Japan's successes, the loss of domestic jobs, and even changes in American gender roles and shifts in the American family. To a number of Americans, the very people responsible for the script were the people who were changing America. The bomb, representing the end of World War II and suggesting the height of American power was to be celebrated. It was, in this judgment, a crucial symbol of America's \"good war\", one fought justly for noble purposes at a time when America was united. Those who in any way questioned the bomb's use were, in this emotional framework, the enemies of America.{{sfn|Bernstein|1995|p=238}} }}\n\nThe forward fuselage went on display on 28 June 1995.

Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples.  Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department.   Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the (Public Works) idea that the Twelfth Regiment<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/seabee/explore/civil-engineer-corps-history/the-twelfth-regiment-.html |title=The Twelfth Regiment (Public Works) and the Origin of the Seabees |website=U.S. Navy Seabee Museum |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>  pioneered in 1917 was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.  Planners at the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) began providing for \"Navy Construction Battalions\" in contingency war plans and in 1934 Capt. Carl Carlson's version of the CB idea was tentatively approved by [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Adm. [[William Harrison Standley|Standley]].  The next year [[Rear admiral (United States)|RADM.]] Norman Smith, head of BuDocks, selected Captain Walter Allen, War Plans Officer, to represent BuDocks on the War Plans Board. Capt. Allen presented the bureau's \"Naval Construction Battalions concept\" and the Board included it in the [[United States color-coded war plans#Rainbow plans|Rainbow]] war plans.{{sfn|Introduction|2017}}  The Seabees would name their first training center for Capt. Allen.\n\nOne flaw to the proposal was that CBs would have a dual command; military control would be exercised by fleet [[line Officer]]s while construction operations would be controlled by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] officers. Another issue was no provision for the military organization or military training necessary to provide unit structure, discipline, and esprit de corps. The plans only allowed for battalions to be formed to build training stations throughout [[CONUS]]. Only afterwards could they be forward deployed.{{sfn|Introduction|2017}}\nRADM. [[Ben Moreell]] became BuDocks Chief in December 1937 and would become the lead proponent of the CB proposal. {{sfn|Introduction|2017}}\n\nBy summer of 1941 civilian contractors were working on [[Naval Base Guam|Guam]], [[Naval Air Facility Midway Island|Midway]], [[Wake Island Airfield|Wake]], [[Naval Base Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Iceland]], [[Naval Station Argentia|Newfoundland]], and [[Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex|Bermuda]]. BuDocks decided there was a need to improve Navy project supervision through the creation of \"Headquarters Construction Companies\".  These companies would have 2 officers and 99 enlisted, but would do no actual construction work. The companies would be primarily draftsmen and surveyors to aid the officers in charge of construction as well as the construction inspectors. RADM. [[Chester Nimitz]], Chief of the [[Bureau of Navigation (United States Navy)|Bureau of Navigation]], authorized the formation of the 1st Headquarters Construction Company, on October 31, 1941. Recruitment began in November.  Company formation<ref name=\"Naval History Blog\"/> and [[boot training]] began December 7 at [[Naval Station Newport]], Rhode Island. By Dec. 16th  four additional companies had been authorized but, Pearl Harbor had happened changing all plans.\n\n==World War II==\n{{main|Seabees in World War II}}\n[[File:Flag of the United States Navy (1864\u20131959).svg|thumb|right|The Naval Infantry Battalion Flag was mandated by Naval Regulation as the [[military colors]] for the Construction Battalions.<ref name=\"NTP-13\">Flags, Pennants & Customs, NTP 13 (B), Naval Computer And Telecommunications Command, Washington, DC, section 17.11, p. 17-5 [http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/images/ntp13b.pdf]</ref>]]\n[[File:Peary1943BayonetCrpd6996985447 054ffcd41d k.jpg|thumb|USMC directed fixed bayonet drill at [[Camp Peary]] NTC, VA in 1943]]\nOn December 28, 1941, RADM Moreell requested authority to commission three Naval Construction Battalions.

Carolina.  They were deployed as the 2nd & 3rd Construction Detachments.  HQ Companies 4 & 5 were used for the 2nd NCB and were deployed as the 4th & 5th Construction Detachments.{{sfn|Introduction|2017}}  CBs 3, 4, & 5 were all deployed the same way.<ref name=\"Seabee Unit Histories\">{{cite web |url=http://nmcb62alumni.org/pdf/SeabeeUnitsHistory.pdf |title=Seabee Unit Histories |website=The NMCB 62 \"Minutemen\" |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> CB 6 was the first battalion to deploy full complement to the same deployment site.<ref name=\"Seabee Unit Histories\"/>\n\nBefore all this could happen BuDocks had to address the dual command issue.

CBs that followed were sent to Advance Base Depots (ABDs) or Naval Training Centers (NTCs) at Davisville, RI, Gulfport, MS. or Port Hueneme, CA.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two regular CBs that were \"[[colored]]\" units, the 34th<ref>Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.  Authorization for the formation of cargo handling CBs or \"Special CBs\" happened mid-September 1942.<ref name=\"CBHistory\">This week in Seabee History, Sept 17\u201323, Seabee Online Magazine, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC [http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dod live.mil/326-2/]</ref>  By wars end 41 Special CBs had been commissioned of which 15 were \"colored\".

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. [[Adjusted-for-inflation]], today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53.\n\n'''Seabee Teams''' also called ''' Civic Action Teams or CAT<ref name=\"seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil\">{{Cite web|url=https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/01/04/civic-action-team-building-friendships/|title=Civic Action Team: Building Friendships}}</ref><ref>\"Civil Engineers, Seabees & Bases in Vietnam\", Captain Charles J.

From \"A\" School, trainees most often report to a NMCB or ACB. At those commands new Seabees will go through four-weeks of Expeditionary Combat Skills. ECS is also required for those who report to a unit in the [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]]. ECS is basic combat-training in: map reading, combat first aid, conducting recon, and other combat-related skills. Half of each course is spent learning basic marksmanship and qualifying with a [[M16 rifle#M16A2|M16A2]] or [[M16 rifle#M16A3|M16A3]] rifle and the [[Beretta M9|M9 service pistol]]. Those posted to Alfa Company of a NMCB may be assigned to a crew-served weapon: [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|MK 19]] 40mm grenade launcher, the [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] .50-caliber machine gun, or the [[M240 machine gun]]. Many reserve units still field the [[M60 machine gun]]. Until 2012, Seabees wore the [[U.S. Woodland]] camouflage uniform or the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]], the last U.S. military to do so, but have transitioned to the Navy Working Uniform NWU Type III.

They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF.  So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.\n\n==Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award==\n[[File:Navy Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Insignia.png|350px|right|thumb|SCW insignia: officer and enlisted]]\nThe military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW).

For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per [[OPNAV Instruction]] 1414.4B.\n\nThe Peltier Award is given to the \"best of type\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions.

The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges .  Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel.   Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.

The use of USMC organization allowed for smooth co-ordination, integration or interface between NCF and Marine Corps elements.  Additionally, CBs could be deployed individually or in multiples as the project scope and scale dictated. What distinguishes Seabees from [[Combat Engineers]] are the skill sets.

Seabees believe that anything they are tasked with, they \"Can Do\" (the CB motto). They were unique at conception and remain so today. In the October 1944 issue of ''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]'' magazine, the Seabees are described as \"a phenomenon of World War II\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n29lcdffPWgC&pg=PA261|title=The Seabees |magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |volume=35 |number=4 |date=October 1944 |page=261 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |quote=All in all, the Seabees look like a phenomenon of World War II and will probably die with it.}}</ref> The Seabees now have over 75 years of service without having changed from Adm. Moreell's model.\n\nSince creation Seabees have received all their advanced military training from the Marine Corps.  As  such, it is strictly standard conventional warfare.  Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples.  Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department.   Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the (Public Works) idea that the Twelfth Regiment<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/seabee/explore/civil-engineer-corps-history/the-twelfth-regiment-.html |title=The Twelfth Regiment (Public Works) and the Origin of the Seabees |website=U.S. Navy Seabee Museum |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>  pioneered in 1917 was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.  Planners at the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) began providing for \"Navy Construction Battalions\" in contingency war plans and in 1934 Capt. Carl Carlson's version of the CB idea was tentatively approved by [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Adm. [[William Harrison Standley|Standley]].  The next year [[Rear admiral (United States)|RADM.]] Norman Smith, head of BuDocks, selected Captain Walter Allen, War Plans Officer, to represent BuDocks on the War Plans Board. Capt. Allen presented the bureau's \"Naval Construction Battalions concept\" and the Board included it in the [[United States color-coded war plans#Rainbow plans|Rainbow]] war plans.{{sfn|Introduction|2017}}  The Seabees would name their first training center for Capt. Allen.\n\nOne flaw to the proposal was that CBs would have a dual command; military control would be exercised by fleet [[line Officer]]s while construction operations would be controlled by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] officers. Another issue was no provision for the military organization or military training necessary to provide unit structure, discipline, and esprit de corps. The plans only allowed for battalions to be formed to build training stations throughout [[CONUS]]. Only afterwards could they be forward deployed.{{sfn|Introduction|2017}}\nRADM. [[Ben Moreell]] became BuDocks Chief in December 1937 and would become the lead proponent of the CB proposal. {{sfn|Introduction|2017}}\n\nBy summer of 1941 civilian contractors were working on [[Naval Base Guam|Guam]], [[Naval Air Facility Midway Island|Midway]], [[Wake Island Airfield|Wake]], [[Naval Base Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Iceland]], [[Naval Station Argentia|Newfoundland]], and [[Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex|Bermuda]]. BuDocks decided there was a need to improve Navy project supervision through the creation of \"Headquarters Construction Companies\".  These companies would have 2 officers and 99 enlisted, but would do no actual construction work. The companies would be primarily draftsmen and surveyors to aid the officers in charge of construction as well as the construction inspectors. RADM. [[Chester Nimitz]], Chief of the [[Bureau of Navigation (United States Navy)|Bureau of Navigation]], authorized the formation of the 1st Headquarters Construction Company, on October 31, 1941. Recruitment began in November.  Company formation<ref name=\"Naval History Blog\"/> and [[boot training]] began December 7 at [[Naval Station Newport]], Rhode Island. By Dec. 16th  four additional companies had been authorized but, Pearl Harbor had happened changing all plans.\n\n==World War II==\n{{main|Seabees in World War II}}\n[[File:Flag of the United States Navy (1864\u20131959).svg|thumb|right|The Naval Infantry Battalion Flag was mandated by Naval Regulation as the [[military colors]] for the Construction Battalions.<ref name=\"NTP-13\">Flags, Pennants & Customs, NTP 13 (B), Naval Computer And Telecommunications Command, Washington, DC, section 17.11, p. 17-5 [http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/images/ntp13b.pdf]</ref>]]\n[[File:Peary1943BayonetCrpd6996985447 054ffcd41d k.jpg|thumb|USMC directed fixed bayonet drill at [[Camp Peary]] NTC, VA in 1943]]\nOn December 28, 1941, RADM Moreell requested authority to commission three Naval Construction Battalions.

Concurrently, the other four requested HQ Construction Companies had been approved and authorized.  BuDocks took Companies 2 & 3 to form the 1st Naval Construction Battalion at Charleston So. Carolina.  They were deployed as the 2nd & 3rd Construction Detachments.  HQ Companies 4 & 5 were used for the 2nd NCB and were deployed as the 4th & 5th Construction Detachments.{{sfn|Introduction|2017}}  CBs 3, 4, & 5 were all deployed the same way.<ref name=\"Seabee Unit Histories\">{{cite web |url=http://nmcb62alumni.org/pdf/SeabeeUnitsHistory.pdf |title=Seabee Unit Histories |website=The NMCB 62 \"Minutemen\" |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> CB 6 was the first battalion to deploy full complement to the same deployment site.<ref name=\"Seabee Unit Histories\"/>\n\nBefore all this could happen BuDocks had to address the dual command issue. [[United States Navy Regulations|Naval regs]] stated unit command was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s.  BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by CEC officers trained in construction. The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers) strongly opposed this.<ref name= \"Formation\"/> \nAdm. Moreell took the issue directly to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]].  On March 19, 1942, the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] was given complete command of all Naval Construction units.

Finally, all training was moved to [[Camp Endicott]], Rhode Island. The first five battalions were sent directly overseas for urgent construction projects. CBs that followed were sent to Advance Base Depots (ABDs) or Naval Training Centers (NTCs) at Davisville, RI, Gulfport, MS. or Port Hueneme, CA.  Camp Rousseau at Port Hueneme became operational first and would serve to stage 175,000 Seabees forward.{{sfn|Formation|2017}} The Davisville ABD became operational in June 1942 with NTC [[Camp Endicott]], commissioned in August.  That camp would train over 100,000 Seabees. The NTCs had classes in over 60 trades.

VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  Lt. Thomas C. Crist (CB 10) was in Pearl Harbor from [[Canton Island]]<ref>Lt Crist, \"The MOCK-UP\", Fort Pierce ATB Newspaper, 20 July 1945 , p. 4, Fort Pierce SEAL Archives, Fort Pierce,  FL</ref><ref>UDTs 1 & 2, The Marshall Islands, Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Eniwetok, U.

His being in Pearl Harbor was pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  While there he learned of the Adm. Turner's interest in coral blasting and made contact.  The Admiral tasked Lt. Crist to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>  Lt. Crist started by getting men from CB 10.  By December 1, 1943 he had close to 30 officers and 150 enlisted at [[Waipio]] Amphibious Operating Base on Oahu.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>\n\nIn November the Navy had a hard lesson with underwater obstructions, coral, and tides at [[invasion of Tarawa|Tarawa]]. It prompted Adm. Turner to request the creation of nine [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] to address those issues.<ref>The Underwater Demolition Teams of the Pacific, Pearl Harbor Visitors Bureau, [https://visitpearlharbor.org/the-underwater-demolition-teams-of-the-pacific/]</ref> Six would be assigned to VAC in the Central Pacific while the other three would go to III Amphibious Corps in the South Pacific.  Adm. Turner chose the term \"underwater\" to distinguish from the Fort Pierce program.

Turner also requested formation of a \"Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base\" at [[Kihei, Hawaii]].  It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt. Crist was briefly the first training officer until when he was made Commander of UDT 3.  When UDT 3 returned from Leyte in November 1944 the team became the training instructors of the school and Lt. Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii. Team 3 would train teams 12\u201322.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/> Teams 12, 13 and 14 all had men from Team Able.  UDT 14 is called the first \"all fleet team\" even though Seabees from Team Able were attached and the Commander and XO were both CEC (Ltjg. A.B. Onderdonk and Ltjg. C.E. Emery).  UDT 15 was another team formed completely of NCDUs. Teams 12, 13, 14, and 15 were sent to Iwo Jima.  Teams 12, 13, and 14 would go back ashore on D-plus 2 to clear the waters edge for the next five days .   After July 1944 new UDTs were completely USN with no Army or USMC.

The Seabees provided over half of the men in those teams.  The Navy did not publicize the existence of the UDTs until post war and when they did they gave credit to Lt. Cmdr.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two regular CBs that were \"[[colored]]\" units, the 34th<ref>Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.  Authorization for the formation of cargo handling CBs or \"Special CBs\" happened mid-September 1942.<ref name=\"CBHistory\">This week in Seabee History, Sept 17\u201323, Seabee Online Magazine, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC [http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dod live.mil/326-2/]</ref>  By wars end 41 Special CBs had been commissioned of which 15 were \"colored\".

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].
