Adapted from [[Wajdi Mouawad]]'s play of the [[Incendies (play)|same name]], ''Incendies'' stars [[Lubna Azabal]], [[M\u00e9lissa D\u00e9sormeaux-Poulin]], [[Maxim Gaudette]], and [[R\u00e9my Girard]].\n\nThe story concerns Canadian twins who travel to their mother's native country in the [[Middle East]] to uncover her hidden past amidst a bloody civil war. While the country is unnamed, the events in the film are heavily influenced by the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and particularly the story of prisoner [[Souha Bechara]]. The film was shot mainly in Montreal, with a few days spent in Jordan.\n\nIt premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]] and [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto]] Film Festivals in September 2010 and was released in [[Quebec]] on 17 September 2010. It met with critical acclaim in Canada and abroad and won numerous awards.\n\nIn 2011, it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. ''Incendies'' also won eight [[31st Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nJeanne Marwan, a graduate student in mathematics, explains the [[Collatz conjecture]] to a class of undergraduates, where every [[positive integer]] leads to a sequence that ultimately ends in the number two reducing to the number one.\n\nFollowing the death of Jeanne's mother Nawal, an [[Arab Canadians|Arab]] [[Immigration to Canada|immigrant in Canada]], Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with [[French Canadian]] notary Jean Lebel, their mother's employer and family friend. Nawal's will makes reference to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, whom they believed was dead. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her apparently unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit.\n\nA series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] reveal Nawal came from a [[Arab Christians|Christian Arab]] family in an unnamed [[Middle East]]ern country, and that she fell in love with a [[refugee]] named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her as an [[honour killing]], but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage.\n\nWhile Nawal is at university in Daresh, a civil war and [[war crimes]] break out with Nawal opposing the war on [[human rights]] grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic [[child soldier]]. After barely escaping the massacre of a bus full of Muslim refugees by Christian Nationalists, Nawal narrowly manages to join the Muslim fighters, and eventually shoots a nationalist leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and raped by torturer Abou Tareq, consequently giving birth to the twins.\n\nAfter travelling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past, and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him personally, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tareq, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, the two people they were seeking reduce to one. Nihad had immigrated to Canada and Nawal only learned his true identity after recognizing the tattoo on the back of his heel at a Canadian swimming pool. The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke which led to her decline and untimely death at age sixty.\n\nThe twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him without speaking to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, and is filled with contempt, as Nihad is written to by Nawal as her rapist. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother, and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love.\n\nNawal gets her gravestone in the aftermath of the letters being sent, which Nihad visits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lubna Azabal]] as Nawal Marwan\n* [[M\u00e9lissa D\u00e9sormeaux-Poulin]] as Jeanne Marwan\n* [[Maxim Gaudette]] as Simon Marwan\n* [[R\u00e9my Girard]] as Jean Lebel\n* Abdelghafour Elaaziz as Abou Tarek/Nihad \"Nihad de Mai\" Harmanni\n* Allen Altman as Notary Maddad\n* Mohamed Majd as Chamseddine\n* Nabil Sawalha as Fahim\n* Baya Belal as Maika\n* Bader Alami as Nicolas\n* Karim Babin as Chamseddine's guard\n* Anthony Ecclissi as Lifeguard\n* Joyce Raie as Student Journalist\n* Yousef Shweihat as Sharif\n* Celine Soulier as French Journalist\n* Mher Karakashian as Chamseddine's assistant\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Denis Villeneuve Cannes 2015.jpg|upright|thumb|Director [[Denis Villeneuve]] adapted [[Wajdi Mouawad]]'s play ''[[Incendies (play)|Incendies]]'' after seeing it performed in Montreal in 2004.]]\nParts of the story were based on the life of [[Souha Bechara]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Film/Feb/02/Seeing-yourself-re-made-as-fiction.ashx#axzz1bmmQmXor |title=Seeing yourself re-made as fiction |last=Snaije |first=Olivia |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2016 |work=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916060318/http://dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Film/Feb/02/Seeing-yourself-re-made-as-fiction.ashx#axzz1bmmQmXor |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lapresse.ca/international/moyen-orient/200903/08/01-834313-lex-kamikaze-soha-bechara-denonce-le-sort-des-palestiniens.php |title=L'ex-kamikaze Soha B\u00e9chara d\u00e9nonce le sort des Palestiniens |last=Perreault |first=Laura-Julie |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2016 |work=[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006205652/http://www.lapresse.ca/international/moyen-orient/200903/08/01-834313-lex-kamikaze-soha-bechara-denonce-le-sort-des-palestiniens.php |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/antigone-becomes-jocasta |title=Antigone Becomes Jocasta: Soha Bechara, ''R\u00e9sistante'', and ''Incendies'' |last=Holstun |first=Jim |date=Fall 2015 |accessdate=19 July 2017 |work=[[Mediations (journal)|Mediations]] vol. 29, no. 1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303094320/http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/antigone-becomes-jocasta |archive-date=3 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The story is based on events that happened during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news| first = Glenn| last = Sum| title = Denis is on Fire| publisher = Now Toronto| url = http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=178802| date = 20 January 2011| accessdate = 19 September 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813163917/http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=178802| archive-date = 13 August 2011| url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"Nestruck\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/will-denis-villeneuves-incendies-light-a-fire-under-oscar/article1873366/page2/ | location=Toronto | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | first=J.

co-wrote the screenplay with Val\u00e9rie Beaugrand-Champagne. Adapted from [[Wajdi Mouawad]]'s play of the [[Incendies (play)|same name]], ''Incendies'' stars [[Lubna Azabal]], [[M\u00e9lissa D\u00e9sormeaux-Poulin]], [[Maxim Gaudette]], and [[R\u00e9my Girard]].\n\nThe story concerns Canadian twins who travel to their mother's native country in the [[Middle East]] to uncover her hidden past amidst a bloody civil war. While the country is unnamed, the events in the film are heavily influenced by the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and particularly the story of prisoner [[Souha Bechara]]. The film was shot mainly in Montreal, with a few days spent in Jordan.\n\nIt premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]] and [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto]] Film Festivals in September 2010 and was released in [[Quebec]] on 17 September 2010. It met with critical acclaim in Canada and abroad and won numerous awards.\n\nIn 2011, it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. ''Incendies'' also won eight [[31st Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nJeanne Marwan, a graduate student in mathematics, explains the [[Collatz conjecture]] to a class of undergraduates, where every [[positive integer]] leads to a sequence that ultimately ends in the number two reducing to the number one.\n\nFollowing the death of Jeanne's mother Nawal, an [[Arab Canadians|Arab]] [[Immigration to Canada|immigrant in Canada]], Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with [[French Canadian]] notary Jean Lebel, their mother\u2019s employer and family friend. Nawal's will makes reference to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, whom they believed was dead. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her apparently unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit.\n\nA series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] reveal Nawal came from a [[Arab Christians|Christian Arab]] family in an unnamed [[Middle East]]ern country, and that she fell in love with a [[refugee]] named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her as an [[honour killing]], but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage.\n\nWhile Nawal is at university in Daresh, a civil war and [[war crimes]] break out with Nawal opposing the war on [[human rights]] grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic [[child soldier]]. After barely escaping the massacre of a bus full of Muslim refugees by Christian Nationalists, Nawal narrowly manages to join the Muslim fighters, and eventually shoots a nationalist leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and raped by torturer Abou Tareq, consequently giving birth to the twins.\n\nAfter travelling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past, and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him personally, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tareq, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, the two people they were seeking reduce to one. Nihad had immigrated to Canada and Nawal only learned his true identity after recognizing the tattoo on the back of his heel at a Canadian swimming pool. The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke which led to her decline and untimely death at age sixty.\n\nThe twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him without speaking to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, and is filled with contempt, as Nihad is written to by Nawal as her rapist. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother, and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love.\n\nNawal gets her gravestone in the aftermath of the letters being sent, which Nihad visits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lubna Azabal]] as Nawal Marwan\n* [[M\u00e9lissa D\u00e9sormeaux-Poulin]] as Jeanne Marwan\n* [[Maxim Gaudette]] as Simon Marwan\n* [[R\u00e9my Girard]] as Jean Lebel\n* Abdelghafour Elaaziz as Abou Tarek/Nihad \"Nihad de Mai\" Harmanni\n* Allen Altman as Notary Maddad\n* Mohamed Majd as Chamseddine\n* Nabil Sawalha as Fahim\n* Baya Belal as Maika\n* Bader Alami as Nicolas\n* Karim Babin as Chamseddine's guard\n* Anthony Ecclissi as Lifeguard\n* Joyce Raie as Student Journalist\n* Yousef Shweihat as Sharif\n* Celine Soulier as French Journalist\n* Mher Karakashian as Chamseddine's assistant\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Denis Villeneuve Cannes 2015.jpg|upright|thumb|Director [[Denis Villeneuve]] adapted [[Wajdi Mouawad]]'s play ''[[Incendies (play)|Incendies]]'' after seeing it performed in Montreal in 2004.]]\nParts of the story were based on the life of [[Souha Bechara]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Film/Feb/02/Seeing-yourself-re-made-as-fiction.ashx#axzz1bmmQmXor |title=Seeing yourself re-made as fiction |last=Snaije |first=Olivia |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2016 |work=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916060318/http://dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Film/Feb/02/Seeing-yourself-re-made-as-fiction.ashx#axzz1bmmQmXor |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lapresse.ca/international/moyen-orient/200903/08/01-834313-lex-kamikaze-soha-bechara-denonce-le-sort-des-palestiniens.php |title=L'ex-kamikaze Soha B\u00e9chara d\u00e9nonce le sort des Palestiniens |last=Perreault |first=Laura-Julie |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2016 |work=[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006205652/http://www.lapresse.ca/international/moyen-orient/200903/08/01-834313-lex-kamikaze-soha-bechara-denonce-le-sort-des-palestiniens.php |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/antigone-becomes-jocasta |title=Antigone Becomes Jocasta: Soha Bechara, ''R\u00e9sistante'', and ''Incendies'' |last=Holstun |first=Jim |date=Fall 2015 |accessdate=19 July 2017 |work=[[Mediations (journal)|Mediations]] vol. 29, no. 1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303094320/http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/antigone-becomes-jocasta |archive-date=3 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The story is based on events that happened during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news| first = Glenn| last = Sum| title = Denis is on Fire| publisher = Now Toronto| url = http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=178802| date = 20 January 2011| accessdate = 19 September 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813163917/http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=178802| archive-date = 13 August 2011| url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"Nestruck\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/will-denis-villeneuves-incendies-light-a-fire-under-oscar/article1873366/page2/ | location=Toronto | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | first=J.

Her father is a successful literary agent, who is overbearing, and her mother is overpowered by him. Alice first met Milan when she was 13, at one of her parents' parties. Soon after, Alice got stuck on a paper/potential novel she was writing and called Milan for guidance. Later, Alice's father was happy to find out Milan was mentoring her. He began to come over while she was home alone, and they lay on her bed. Milan asked Alice for a kiss and they started to make out.\n\nIn the present, she is forced by her boss, Jack, to interact with Milan again, and she has repeated flashbacks to their interactions. Her best friend, Sadie, throws Alice a surprise party for her 29th birthday where she meets Emmett Grant, a political activist whom she begins dating.\n\nAlice finds herself feeling jarred and out of control as she works on the promotion for the re-release of Milan's book. She becomes distracted from her writing class and drops out when the teacher suggests she try again at another time. At work, Alice has been trying to get Jack to read a manuscript she really likes by author Karen Malone, but he continues to blow her off. Alice mentions the manuscript to her meddlesome father, and he offers to \u201cfix it\u201d by calling Jack. Alice makes him promise not to but, soon after, she's surprised when Karen comes in for a meeting with Jack. Alice is stunned to see her father bounding in, knowing he highjacked the find from her. Her father, Jack, and Karen go into a closed-door meeting, excluding Alice. Seeing them through a large picture window enrages her and, feeling betrayed, she storms out of the office.\n\nAlice goes to Sadie's apartment, but she's at yoga. Her babysitter, Keith, is there and he notices she has a copy of \u201cWaking Eyes\u201d with her. He comments about disliking the book after being assigned to it read in a class. In the heat of the moment, Alice has sex with Keith, but Sadie comes home early and catches them and throws Alice out of her home. Feeling guilty, Alice ignores Emmett's phone calls. Alice watches an interview Milan is doing on TV, and the interviewer points out that none of his other books had been as successful as ''Waking Eyes''. When asked why he thinks that is, Milan says that anyone can relate to being a teenager. Further, the interviewer asks how a man in his forties can perfectly capture the essence of a teenage girl. Milan appears caught off guard by the question. In a flashback with Alice, it becomes clear that he sexually exploited her and ripped off her writing for the book, but he lies and says it was complete fiction.\n\nAlice ends up telling a suspicious Emmett the truth about her hookup with Keith, and he walks out on her. Dejected, with Emmett and Sadie not talking her, Alice goes to a bar and hooks up with a stranger. In a flashback, Alice tells Milan about a boy her own age that she had been seeing, and he [[Lascivious behavior|lasciviously]] presses her for details about their hookup. Milan talks Alice into letting him be the first to make her have an orgasm. In the present, Alice wakes up crying in bed with her one-night stand and quickly leaves.\n\nAlice goes to see Emmett and tries to explain her insecurities, saying that she enjoys the feeling of being wanted, but then begins to wonder why the guy can't do better than her. Emmett says that he does want her, but agrees that he could probably do better. Eventually, Alice and Sadie talk. Alice says she is going to work on her issues so they begin to mend their friendship. Previously, Emmett called out Alice for not trying to further her interest in writing. Desperate to win him back, she writes a blog post with a list of 100 reasons why he should give her another chance.\n\nBack at work, when the re-release of ''Waking Eyes'' is hot off the presses, Alice sees that there is a new dedication written about her. In the past, at a book signing, Milan began to read aloud, and Alice finally realized he had blatantly stolen her work, in some cases verbatim, and incorporates details from the sexual relationship he manipulated her into. Alice finally gets the courage to tell her mother what happened. On the car ride home with her parents after the book signing, Alice is mortified when her father mentions that her mother told him her secret. He says that he asked Milan about it, who denied it. They tell her she may have misinterpreted her interaction with Milan, or she may just have a crush on him. In the present day, Alice goes to confront Milan but he still denies any wrongdoing.\n\nElsewhere, Emmett finds the blog post. He's touched and they get back together. At the re-release party of the book, Alice does not show up, staying with Emmett instead. He asks her if she's the girl in the book, to which she replies, \"not anymore.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Emily VanCamp]] as Alice Harvey\n** [[Ana Mulvoy-Ten]] as Young

Her father is a successful literary agent, who is overbearing, and her mother is overpowered by him. Alice first met Milan when she was 13, at one of her parents' parties. Soon after, Alice got stuck on a paper/potential novel she was writing and called Milan for guidance. Later, Alice's father was happy to find out Milan was mentoring her. He began to come over while she was home alone, and they lay on her bed. Milan asked Alice for a kiss and they started to make out.\n\nIn the present, she is forced by her boss, Jack, to interact with Milan again, and she has repeated flashbacks to their interactions. Her best friend, Sadie, throws Alice a surprise party for her 29th birthday where she meets Emmett Grant, a political activist whom she begins dating.\n\nAlice finds herself feeling jarred and out of control as she works on the promotion for the re-release of Milan's book. She becomes distracted from her writing class and drops out when the teacher suggests she try again at another time. At work, Alice has been trying to get Jack to read a manuscript she really likes by author Karen Malone, but he continues to blow her off. Alice mentions the manuscript to her meddlesome father, and he offers to \u201cfix it\u201d by calling Jack. Alice makes him promise not to but, soon after, she's surprised when Karen comes in for a meeting with Jack. Alice is stunned to see her father bounding in, knowing he highjacked the find from her. Her father, Jack, and Karen go into a closed-door meeting, excluding Alice. Seeing them through a large picture window enrages her and, feeling betrayed, she storms out of the office.\n\nAlice goes to Sadie's apartment, but she's at yoga. Her babysitter, Keith, is there and he notices she has a copy of \u201cWaking Eyes\u201d with her. He comments about disliking the book after being assigned to it read in a class. In the heat of the moment, Alice has sex with Keith, but Sadie comes home early and catches them and throws Alice out of her home. Feeling guilty, Alice ignores Emmett's phone calls. Alice watches an interview Milan is doing on TV, and the interviewer points out that none of his other books had been as successful as ''Waking Eyes''. When asked why he thinks that is, Milan says that anyone can relate to being a teenager. Further, the interviewer asks how a man in his forties can perfectly capture the essence of a teenage girl. Milan appears caught off guard by the question. In a flashback with Alice, it becomes clear that he sexually exploited her and ripped off her writing for the book, but he lies and says it was complete fiction.\n\nAlice ends up telling a suspicious Emmett the truth about her hookup with Keith, and he walks out on her. Dejected, with Emmett and Sadie not talking her, Alice goes to a bar and hooks up with a stranger. In a flashback, Alice tells Milan about a boy her own age that she had been seeing, and he [[Lascivious behavior|lasciviously]] presses her for details about their hookup. Milan talks Alice into letting him be the first to make her have an orgasm. In the present, Alice wakes up crying in bed with her one-night stand and quickly leaves.\n\nAlice goes to see Emmett and tries to explain her insecurities, saying that she enjoys the feeling of being wanted, but then begins to wonder why the guy can't do better than her. Emmett says that he does want her, but agrees that he could probably do better. Eventually, Alice and Sadie talk. Alice says she is going to work on her issues so they begin to mend their friendship. Previously, Emmett called out Alice for not trying to further her interest in writing. Desperate to win him back, she writes a blog post with a list of 100 reasons why he should give her another chance.\n\nBack at work, when the re-release of ''Waking Eyes'' is hot off the presses, Alice sees that there is a new dedication written about her. In the past, at a book signing, Milan began to read aloud, and Alice finally realized he had blatantly stolen her work, in some cases verbatim, and incorporates details from the sexual relationship he manipulated her into. Alice finally gets the courage to tell her mother what happened. On the car ride home with her parents after the book signing, Alice is mortified when her father mentions that her mother told him her secret. He says that he asked Milan about it, who denied it. They tell her she may have misinterpreted her interaction with Milan, or she may just have a crush on him. In the present day, Alice goes to confront Milan but he still denies any wrongdoing.\n\nElsewhere, Emmett finds the blog post. He's touched and they get back together. At the re-release party of the book, Alice does not show up, staying with Emmett instead. He asks her if she's the girl in the book, to which she replies, \"not anymore.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Emily VanCamp]] as Alice Harvey\n** [[Ana Mulvoy-Ten]] as Young

This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the current Bengali calendar owes its origin in Bengal to the rule of Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] who adopted it to time the tax year to the harvest. The Bangla year was therewith called ''Bangabda''. Akbar asked the royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fasholi shan'' (harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the Bengali calendar.<ref name= Chakrabarti114>{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114\u2013115}}</ref><ref name=banglapedia>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}</ref> According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, it could be Nawab [[Murshid Quli Khan]], a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of ''Punyaho'' as \"a day for ceremonial land tax collection\", and used Akbar's fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar.<ref name=meghna>{{Cite book |title=The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics |last=Guhathakurta |first=Meghna  |last2=Schendel |first2=Willem van  |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780822353188 |pages=17\u201318}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4739604/google-doodle-pohela-boishakh-bangladesh/|title=Google Doodle Celebrates Pohela Boishakh in Bangladesh|website=Time|access-date=2017-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIt is unclear whether it was adopted by Hussain Shah or Akbar.

This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the current Bengali calendar owes its origin in Bengal to the rule of Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] who adopted it to time the tax year to the harvest. The Bangla year was therewith called ''Bangabda''. Akbar asked the royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fasholi shan'' (harvest calendar).

After the change Dec 16 will fall on Poush 1, not on the second day of the month.\n\nBengali New Year will also fall on Apr 14, Rabindra Joyanti of Baishakh 25 on May 8 and Nazrul Joyanti of Jaishthha 11 on May 25.\n\nThe Bengali calendar had been revised twice earlier. Astrophysicist Dr Meghnad Saha led the first revision in the 1950s and Dr Muhammad Shahidullah in 1963.\n\n===Days===\nThe Bengali Calendar incorporates the seven-day [[week]] as used by many other calendars. The names of the days of the week in the Bengali Calendar are based on the [[Navagraha]] ({{lang-bn|\u09a8\u09ac\u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09b9}} ''n\u00f4b\u00f4gr\u00f4h\u00f4''). The day begins and ends at sunrise in the Bengali calendar, unlike in the Gregorian calendar, where the day starts at midnight.\n\nAccording to some scholars, in the calendar originally introduced by [[Akbar]] in the year 1584 [[AD]], each day of the month had a different name, but this was cumbersome, and his grandson [[Shah Jahan]] changed this to a 7-day week as in the [[Gregorian calendar]], with the week also starting on a Sunday.<ref name=Banglapedia/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:30%;\"\n|-\n!

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery. Archaeological findings from the 1800s suggest his relics may have been redistributed across the Indian subcontinent by subsequent kings.  \n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is regarded as an important and wise disciple of the Buddha, particularly in [[Theravada]] Buddhism where he is given a status close to a second Buddha. In [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha, usually to his right. \u015a\u0101riputra was known for his strict adherence to the Buddhist [[Vinaya|monastic rules]], as well as for his wisdom and teaching ability, giving him the title \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmasenapati''; Pali: ''Dhammasen\u0101pati''). \u015a\u0101riputra is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]].

At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, [[Anomadassi Buddha|Anomadass\u012b,]] and were given a sermon given by Anomadass\u012b Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadass\u012b Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na|resolved]] to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadass\u012b Buddha, who declared that his aspiration will come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadass\u012b Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}} The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds.{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}} According to Buddhist legend, the wish came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as \u015a\u0101riputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgaly\u0101yana.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBuddhist texts describe that \u015a\u0101riputra was born with the birth name Upati\u1e63ya ([[Pali]]: ''Upatissa'') to a  wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] family in a village near [[R\u0101jagaha]] in the ancient Indian kingdom of [[Magadha]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{sfn|Sayadaw|1990}} He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=458}}{{sfn|Shaw|2006|p=36}}\n\nTexts from the [[Mulasarvastivada]] tradition state he was named after his father, while the [[Pali]] commentaries of the [[Theravada]] tradition state he was named after his birth village.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{refn|Some Pali texts contradict this however and state his birth village as N\u0101laka,{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} although this may be an alternative name for Upatissa.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}|group=note}} Upati\u1e63ya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named C\u0101la, Upac\u0101l\u0101 and S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101.

According to Buddhist academic [[Reginald Ray]], \u015a\u0101riputra was the greatest [[arhat]] in the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmaraja'') a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=412, 500-501}} In the Pali Canon, \u015a\u0101riputra is credited as the main expounder of several [[suttas]], due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}} Indologist [[Alex Wayman]] describes \u015a\u0101riputra as being exemplary of the four [[Brahmavihara|brahma-vih\u0101r\u0101s]], and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgaly\u0101yana, with \u015a\u0101riputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgaly\u0101yana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with \u015a\u0101riputra being the Buddha's right hand monk.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=47}} In Burma, \u015a\u0101riputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight arhats commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=750}}\n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's [[Ten Principal Disciples|principal disciples]] are associated with.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} Migot, however, identifies texts that exclude \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, Migot goes on to argue that the historic \u015a\u0101riputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=398}} According to Ray it is possible \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=134-136}}\n==See also==\n* [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]]\n*[[Khema]]\n*[[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]\n* ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta]]'' \u2013 a Pali Canon discourse attributed to S\u0101riputta\n* [[Sariputra in the Jatakas]]\n* [[Sanchi]]\n* [[Bhadda Kundalakesa]], a former Jain ascetic converted to Buddhism by S\u0101riputta\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive=\"1\"></references>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Berger |first1=Patricia Ann |title=Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850 - 1850 ; [exhibition, August 27 - October 9 1994 ...] |date=1994 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1662-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ffYIPn--wC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |last2=Dhamma |first2=Rewata |title=A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma : the Abhidhammattha sangaha of \u0100cariya Anuruddha |date=1993 |publisher=BPS Pariyatti Edition |isbn=978-1-928706-02-1 |edition=1st BPS Pariyatti}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery.
