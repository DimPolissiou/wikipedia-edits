West was consistently productive in his 4-year college career with an avg. of 15PPG and .400 3PT%, becoming one of the most prolific scorers in Wildcats history putting up 2,037 points from 1986-1989. He still ranks fifth on the team\u2019s all-time scoring list.\n\nHe made the BIG EAST All-FRESHMAN team in 1986 and was second in scoring to Harold Jensen as a sophomore at 15.2 PPG. He led the Wildcats in scoring as a Jr. with 16PPG in 1988 and along with Sr. Mark Plansky, led the Wildcats to an exciting run in the NCAA Tournament where Villanova upset both #3 Illinois then #2 Kentucky in the SWEET 16 before falling in the ELITE 8 to #1 ranked Oklahoma who would eventually lose to Kanas in the final.\u00a0 West made the NCAA ALL-SOUTHEAST REGION team and the ALL-BIG EAST team that season.\u00a0 As a senior in 1989 he would lead Villanova in scoring again with an 18PPG avg. and make ALL-BIG EAST again.\n\n\nNBA CAREER:\n\nWest was selected by the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in the second round of the [[1989 NBA Draft]]. An athletic, well-rounded player who could score as well as defend, West was an \"original\" Timberwolf, being drafted by the team in its first year of existence. He was the last of the original roster to remain on the team.\n\nWest became a regular starter for the Timberwolves during the [[1991-92 NBA season]], in which he averaged 14.0 points per game, appeared in the [[Gatorade]] [[Slam Dunk Contest|Slam Dunk Championship]], and earned Timberwolves' Defensive Player of the Year Honors. The following season, he averaged a career high 19.3 points per game.\n\nDuring the 1993 offseason, the Timberwolves made shooting guard [[Isaiah Rider]] their first round draft pick and made him the starter at the position. West was moved to small forward, where his numbers declined significantly. In 1995, he broke [[Tony Campbell]]'s team-record 4,888 points to become the Timberwolves' all-time leading scorer (a distinction now held by [[Kevin Garnett]]). The following offseason, the team drafted Garnett, and West was moved to the bench, starting just 16 games. He returned to the starting lineup for the 1996-97 season when Rider was traded to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], which would be his last season as a starter.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, injuries had begun to take their toll on West, and he was traded to the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] in exchange for [[Anthony Peeler]] after the [[1997-98 NBA season]]. West provided a veteran presence for the struggling young Grizzlies, but he saw very limited playing time, and he finally retired from the [[NBA]] in 2001. He had tallied career totals of 6,477 points, 1,670 rebounds, and 1,292 assists.  \n\n\nCOACHING CAREER:\n\nAfter the NBA, West spent two years coaching at a high school in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]], and two years as an athletic director at a high school in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. West was an assistant coach for the [[Duquesne University]] women's basketball team for one season.  West was named an assistant coach for the [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova Wildcats]], replacing [[Ed Pinckney]] on October 5, 2007.<ref>http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/colleges/villanova/20071002_Source__Former_Wildcat_West_to_assist_Wright_at_Nova.html Former Wildcat West to assist Wright at 'Nova, Dana Pennett O'Neil, philly.com, October 2, 2007, retrieved October 2, 2007</ref> In 2012, West joined the coaching staff of the [[Rio Grande Valley Vipers]] of the [[NBA D-League]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/dleague/riograndevalley/WestBrase2012.html West & Brase added to Vipers Coaching Staff]</ref>\n\nOn July 9, 2015, West was announced as the men's basketball head coach at Penn State Altoona. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.altoona.psu.edu/sports/fullstory.php?id=3050 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925224520/http://www.altoona.psu.edu/sports/fullstory.php?id=3050 |archive-date=2015-09-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn May 20, 2016, West was announced as the boys basketball coach at his alma mater, [[Altoona Area High School]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wearecentralpa.com/sports/west-introduced-as-altoona-boys-hoops-coach|title=West introduced as Altoona Boys Hoops Coach|last=Cawley|first=Alex|date=2016-05-21|website=WEARECENTRALPA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westdo01.html Career Stats] at basketball-reference.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050830054228/http://www.nba.com/timberwolves/wolves/doug_west.html Player Profile] at Minnesota Timberwolves' Official Web Site\n*[http://www.villanova.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/west_doug00.html Coach's Profile] at Villanova\n\n{{1989 NBA Draft}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:West, Doug}}\n[[Category:1967 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:African-American basketball players]]\n[[Category:American expatriate basketball people in Canada]]\n[[Category:American men's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:American men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:American women's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:Basketball coaches from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Basketball players from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Duquesne Dukes women's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Timberwolves draft picks]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Timberwolves players]]\n[[Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball)]]\n[[Category:Shooting guards]]\n[[Category:Small forwards]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Altoona, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Vancouver Grizzlies players]]\n[[Category:Villanova Wildcats men's basketball players]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the basketball player|mathematician|Douglas West (mathematician)}}\n[[File:Doug West Villanova.jpg|thumb|Doug West of Villanova University, before NBA Minn.

Paper birch is named for the tree's thin white bark, which often peels in [[paper]] like layers from the trunk. Paper birch is often one of the first species to colonize a burned area within the northern latitudes, and is an important species for [[moose]] browsing. The wood is often used for [[pulpwood]] and firewood.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Betula papyrifera 8853.JPG|thumb|left|Leaves are doubly serrate with sharp teeth]]\nIt is a medium-sized [[deciduous]] [[tree]] typically reaching {{convert|66|ft|m}} tall,<ref name=\"FNA\" /> and exceptionally to {{convert|130|ft|m}} with a trunk up to {{convert|30|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Within forests, it often grows with a single trunk but when grown as a landscape tree it may develop multiple trunks or branch close to the ground.<ref name=\"dirr\" />\n\nPaper birch is a typically short-lived species. It handles heat and humidity poorly and may live only 30 years in [[Hardiness zone|zones six]] and up, while trees in colder-climate regions can grow for more than 100 years.<ref name=\"fs\" /> ''B. papyrifera'' will grow in many soil types, from steep rocky outcrops to flat [[muskeg]]s of the boreal forest. Best growth occurs in deeper, well drained to dry soils, depending on the location.<ref name=\"fed\">{{cite book|first1=Russell M|last1=Burns|first2=Barbara H.|last2=Honkala|title=Sylvics of North America: Hardwoods.|date=1990|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service u.a.|location=Washington|isbn=0-16-029260-3|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/betula/papyrifera.htm|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n* In older trees, the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is white, commonly brightly so, flaking in fine horizontal strips to reveal a pinkish or salmon-colored inner bark.<ref name=dirr /> It often has small black marks and scars. In individuals younger than five years, the bark appears a brown red color<ref name=\"FNA\" /> with white [[lenticel]]s, making the tree much harder to distinguish from other birches. The bark is highly weather-resistant. It has a high oil content and this gives it its waterproof and weather-resistant characteristics.<ref name=\"FNA\" /> Often, the wood of a downed paper birch will rot away, leaving the hollow bark intact.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\">{{cite book|last = Ewing|first = Susan|title = The Great Alaska Nature Factbook|location = [[Portland, Oregon]]|publisher = [[Graphic Arts Center Publishing|Alaska Northwest Books]]|date = April 1, 1996|isbn = 978-0-88240-454-7}}</ref>\n* The [[leaf|leaves]] are dark green and smooth on the upper surface; the lower surface is often [[Trichome|pubescent]] on the veins. They are alternately arranged on the stem, oval to triangular in shape, 5\u201310&nbsp;cm (2\u20134&nbsp;in) long and about {{frac|2|3}} as wide. The leaf is rounded at the base and tapering to an acutely pointed tip.

The mature fruit is composed of numerous tiny winged [[seed]]s packed between the catkin bracts. They drop between September and spring. At 15 years of age, the tree will start producing seeds but will be in peak seed production between 40 and 70 years.<ref name=\"fed\" /> The seed production is irregular, with a heavy seed crop produced typically every other year and with at least some seeds being produced every year.<ref name=\"fed\" /> In average seed years, 1 million seeds per acre are produced, but in bumper years 35 million per acre may be produced. The seeds are light and blow in the wind to new areas; they also may blow along the surface of snow.\n* The roots are generally shallow and occupy the upper {{convert|24|in|cm|-1}} of the soil and do not form taproots. High winds are more likely to break the trunk than to uproot the tree.<ref name=\"fed\" />\n\n== Genetics and taxonomy ==\n''B. papyrifera'' hybridizes with other species within the genus ''Betula''.\n\nSeveral varieties are recognized:<ref name=\"fed\" />\n* ''B. p.'' var ''papyrifera'' the typical paper birch\n* ''B. p.'' var ''cordifolia'' the western paper birch (now a separate species); see [[Betula cordifolia]]\n* ''B. p.'' var ''kenaica'' Alaskan paper birch (also treated as a separate species by some authors); see [[Betula kenaica]]\n* ''B. p.'' var ''subcordata'' Northwestern paper birch\n* ''B. p''. var. ''neoalaskana'' Alaska paper birch (although this is often treated as a separate species); see [[Betula neoalaskana]]\n\n== Distribution ==\n''Betula papyrifera'' is mostly confined to Canada and the far northern United States. It is found in interior (var. ''humilus'') and south-central (var. ''kenaica'') [[Alaska]] and in all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of [[Canada]], except [[Nunavut]], as well as the far northern continental [[United States]]. Isolated patches are found as far south as the Hudson Valley of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]], as well as [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], D.C. High elevation stands are also in [[mountain]]s to [[North Carolina]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Colorado]]. The most southerly stand in the Western United States is located in Long Canyon in the [[Boulder, Colorado|City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks]]. This is an isolated Pleistocene [[relict]] that most likely reflects the southern reach of boreal vegetation into the area during the last Ice Age.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/openspace/pdf_gis/IndependentResearchReports/249_Cooper_David_Ecological.pdf|title = Ecological Survey of the City of Boulder, Colorado Mountain Parks|last = Cooper|first = David J.|publisher = City of [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] Parks and Recreation Department|format = PDF|page = 16|date = Spring 1984|accessdate = 2011-09-16|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110905065535/http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/openspace/pdf_gis/IndependentResearchReports/249_Cooper_David_Ecological.pdf|archivedate = 2011-09-05}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Alaska, paper birch often naturally grows in pure stands by itself or with [[black spruce|black]] or [[white spruce]]. In the eastern and central regions of its range, it is often associated with [[red spruce]] and [[balsam fir]].<ref name=\"fed\" /> It may also be associated with [[Big-Toothed Aspen|big-toothed aspen]], [[yellow birch]], ''[[Betula populifolia]]'', and [[Acer (plant)|maples]].\n\nShrubs often associated with paper birch in the eastern part of its range include beaked hazel (''[[Corylus cornuta]]''), common bearberry (''[[Arctostaphylos uva-ursi]]''), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (''[[Diervilla lonicera]]''), wintergreen (''[[Gaultheria procumbens]]''), wild sarsaparilla (''[[Aralia nudicaulis]]''), blueberries (''[[Vaccinium]] spp.''), raspberries and blackberries (''[[Rubus]] spp.''), elderberry (''[[Sambucus]] spp.''), and hobblebush (''[[Viburnum alnifolium]]'').\n\n=== Successional relationships ===\n[[File:Boreal forestfire.jpg|thumb|left|Prescribed fire in a black spruce-paper birch-quaking aspen community in boreal Alaska]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' is a [[pioneer species]], meaning it is often one of the first trees to grow in an area after other trees are removed by some sort of disturbance. Typical disturbances colonized by paper birch are [[wildfire]], [[avalanche]], or [[windthrow]] areas where the wind has blown down all trees. When it grows in these pioneer, or early [[secondary succession|successional]], woodlands, it often forms stands of trees where it is the only species.<ref name=\"fs\">{{FEIS |genus=Betula |species=papyrifera |type=tree |last=Uchytil |first=Ronald J. |date=1991|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaper birch is considered well adapted to fires because it recovers quickly by means of reseeding the area or regrowth from the burned tree. The lightweight seeds are easily carried by the wind to burned areas, where they quickly germinate and grow into new trees. Paper birch is adapted to ecosystems where fires occur every 50 to 150 years<ref name=\"fs\" /> For example, it is frequently an early invader after fire in [[black spruce]] [[boreal forest]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title=Black Spruce (Picea mariana) |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |publisher=GlobalTwitcher |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005174426/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |archivedate=2011-10-05 }}</ref> As paper birch is a pioneer species, finding it within mature or climax forests is rare because it will be overcome by trees that are more shade-tolerant as secondary succession progresses.\n\nFor example, in Alaskan boreal forests, a paper birch [[stand level modelling|stand]] 20 years after a fire may have {{convert|3000|-|6000|/acre||adj=pre|trees}}, but after 60 to 90 years, the number of trees will decrease to {{convert|500|-|800|/acre||adj=pre|trees}} as spruce replaces the birch.<ref name=\"fs\" /> After approximately 75 years, the birch will start dying and by 125 years, most paper birch will have disappeared unless another fire burns the area.\n\nPaper birch trees themselves have varied reactions to wildfire. A group, or stand, of paper birch is not particularly flammable. The canopy often has a high moisture content and the understory is often lush green.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As such, conifer crown fires often stop once they reach a stand of paper birch or become slower-moving ground fires. Since these stands are fire-resistant, they may become seed trees to reseed the area around them that was burned. However, in dry periods, paper birch is flammable and will burn rapidly.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As the bark is flammable, it often will burn and may [[Girdling|girdle]] the tree.\n\n=== Wildlife ===\nBirch bark is a winter staple food for [[moose]]. The nutritional quality is poor because of the large quantities of [[lignin]], which make digestion difficult, but is important to wintering moose because of its sheer abundance.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Moose prefer paper birch over [[aspen]], [[alder]], and [[balsam poplar]], but they prefer willow (''[[Salix]]'' spp.) over birch and the other species listed.

Paper birch is named for the tree's thin white bark, which often peels in [[paper]]<nowiki/> like layers from the trunk.  Paper birch is often one of the first species to colonize a burned area within the northern latitudes, and is an important species for [[moose]] browsing. The wood is often used for [[pulpwood]] and firewood.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Betula papyrifera 8853.JPG|thumb|left|Leaves are doubly serrate with sharp teeth]]\nIt is a medium-sized [[deciduous]] [[tree]] typically reaching {{convert|66|ft|m}} tall,<ref name=\"FNA\" /> and exceptionally to {{convert|130|ft|m}} with a trunk up to {{convert|30|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Within forests, it often grows with a single trunk but when grown as a landscape tree it may develop multiple trunks or branch close to the ground.<ref name=\"dirr\" />\n\nPaper birch is a typically short-lived species. It handles heat and humidity poorly and may live only 30 years in [[Hardiness zone|zones six]] and up, while trees in colder-climate regions can grow for more than 100 years.<ref name=\"fs\" /> ''B. papyrifera'' will grow in many soil types, from steep rocky outcrops to flat [[muskeg]]s of the boreal forest.

In individuals younger than five years, the bark appears a brown red color<ref name=\"FNA\" /> with white [[lenticel]]s, making the tree much harder to distinguish from other birches. The bark is highly weather-resistant.

''neoalaskana'' Alaska paper birch (although this is often treated as a separate species); see [[Betula neoalaskana]]\n\n== Distribution ==\n''Betula papyrifera'' is mostly confined to Canada and the far northern United States. It is found in interior (var. ''humilus'') and south-central (var.

Isolated patches are found as far south as the Hudson Valley of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]], as well as [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], D.C. High elevation stands are also in [[mountain]]s to [[North Carolina]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Colorado]]. The most southerly stand in the Western United States is located in Long Canyon in the [[Boulder, Colorado|City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks]]. This is an isolated Pleistocene [[relict]] that most likely reflects the southern reach of boreal vegetation into the area during the last Ice Age.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/openspace/pdf_gis/IndependentResearchReports/249_Cooper_David_Ecological.pdf|title = Ecological Survey of the City of Boulder, Colorado Mountain Parks|last = Cooper|first = David J.|publisher = City of [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] Parks and Recreation Department|format = PDF|page = 16|date = Spring 1984|accessdate = 2011-09-16|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110905065535/http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/openspace/pdf_gis/IndependentResearchReports/249_Cooper_David_Ecological.pdf|archivedate = 2011-09-05}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Alaska, paper birch often naturally grows in pure stands by itself or with [[black spruce|black]] or [[white spruce]]. In the eastern and central regions of its range, it is often associated with [[red spruce]] and [[balsam fir]].<ref name=\"fed\" /> It may also be associated with [[Big-Toothed Aspen|big-toothed aspen]], [[yellow birch]], ''[[Betula populifolia]]'', and [[Acer (plant)|maples]].\n\nShrubs often associated with paper birch in the eastern part of its range include beaked hazel (''[[Corylus cornuta]]''), common bearberry (''[[Arctostaphylos uva-ursi]]''), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (''[[Diervilla lonicera]]''), wintergreen (''[[Gaultheria procumbens]]''), wild sarsaparilla (''[[Aralia nudicaulis]]''), blueberries (''[[Vaccinium]] spp.''), raspberries and blackberries (''[[Rubus]] spp.''), elderberry (''[[Sambucus]] spp.''), and hobblebush (''[[Viburnum alnifolium]]'').\n\n=== Successional relationships ===\n[[File:Boreal forestfire.jpg|thumb|left|Prescribed fire in a black spruce-paper birch-quaking aspen community in boreal Alaska]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' is a [[pioneer species]], meaning it is often one of the first trees to grow in an area after other trees are removed by some sort of disturbance. Typical disturbances colonized by paper birch are [[wildfire]], [[avalanche]], or [[windthrow]] areas where the wind has blown down all trees. When it grows in these pioneer, or early [[secondary succession|successional]], woodlands, it often forms stands of trees where it is the only species.<ref name=\"fs\">{{FEIS |genus=Betula |species=papyrifera |type=tree |last=Uchytil |first=Ronald J. |date=1991|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaper birch is considered well adapted to fires because it recovers quickly by means of reseeding the area or regrowth from the burned tree. The lightweight seeds are easily carried by the wind to burned areas, where they quickly germinate and grow into new trees. Paper birch is adapted to ecosystems where fires occur every 50 to 150 years<ref name=\"fs\" /> For example, it is frequently an early invader after fire in [[black spruce]] [[boreal forest]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title=Black Spruce (Picea mariana) |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |publisher=GlobalTwitcher |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005174426/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |archivedate=2011-10-05 }}</ref> As paper birch is a pioneer species, finding it within mature or climax forests is rare because it will be overcome by trees that are more shade-tolerant as secondary succession progresses.\n\nFor example, in Alaskan boreal forests, a paper birch [[stand level modelling|stand]] 20 years after a fire may have {{convert|3000|-|6000|/acre||adj=pre|trees}}, but after 60 to 90 years, the number of trees will decrease to {{convert|500|-|800|/acre||adj=pre|trees}} as spruce replaces the birch.<ref name=\"fs\" /> After approximately 75 years, the birch will start dying and by 125 years, most paper birch will have disappeared unless another fire burns the area.\n\nPaper birch trees themselves have varied reactions to wildfire. A group, or stand, of paper birch is not particularly flammable. The canopy often has a high moisture content and the understory is often lush green.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As such, conifer crown fires often stop once they reach a stand of paper birch or become slower-moving ground fires. Since these stands are fire-resistant, they may become seed trees to reseed the area around them that was burned. However, in dry periods, paper birch is flammable and will burn rapidly.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As the bark is flammable, it often will burn and may [[Girdling|girdle]] the tree.\n\n=== Wildlife ===\nBirch bark is a winter staple food for [[moose]]. The nutritional quality is poor because of the large quantities of [[lignin]], which make digestion difficult, but is important to wintering moose because of its sheer abundance.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Moose prefer paper birch over [[aspen]], [[alder]], and [[balsam poplar]], but they prefer willow (''[[Salix]]'' spp.) over birch and the other species listed. Although moose consume large amounts of paper birch in the winter, if they were to eat only paper birch, they may die.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\nAlthough [[white-tailed deer]] consider birch a \"secondary-choice food,\" it is an important dietary component. In Minnesota, white-tailed deer eat considerable amounts of paper birch leaves in the fall. [[Snowshoe hare]]s browse paper birch seedlings,<ref name=\"fs\" /> and grouse eat the buds.

She is one of the [[Mahavidya]]s or [[Parvati|Shivasakthi]] or [[Parvati]], ten goddesses from the esoteric tradition of [[Tantra]], and a ferocious aspect of [[Devi]], the Hindu Mother goddess. The [[semi nude]] goddess, usually wears tiger skin skirt and standing or seated on a divine, holds her own severed head in one hand, a [[scimitar]] in another. Three [[blood squirt|jets of blood spurt]] out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two attendants.\n\nChhinnamasta is a goddess of contradictions. She symbolises both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She represents death, temporality, and destruction as well as life, immortality, and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]&nbsp;\u2013 spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her [[self-sacrifice]]&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes coupled with a maternal element&nbsp;\u2013 sexual essence, and self-destructive fury.\n\nChhinnamasta is worshipped in the [[Shakta#Kalikula: family of Kali|Kalikula]] sect of [[Shaktism]], the Goddess-centric tradition of Hinduism. Though Chhinnamasta enjoys patronage as one of the Mahavidyas, temples devoted to her (found mostly in Nepal and eastern India) and her public worship are rare. However, she is a significant Tantric deity, well known and worshipped among esoteric Tantric practitioners. Chhinnamasta is closely related to [[Chinnamunda]]&nbsp;\u2013 the severed-headed form of the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] goddess [[Vajrayogini]].Those who worship Chinnamasta will be free from the effects of [[Rahu]] as per Shaktism.\n\n== Origins ==\n\n[[File:Chinnamunda.jpg|thumb|left|The Buddhist Chinnamunda is believed to be the antecedent of the Hindu Chhinnamasta, 14th-century painting, Nepal.|alt=A decapitated, nude, red-complexioned woman stands, raising her left arm, which holds her severed head.

Chinnamunda is the severed-head form of goddess Vajrayogini (or [[Vajravarahi]], a ferocious form of Vajrayogini), who is depicted similar to Chhinnamasta.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=172}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|p=94}}</ref>\n\nBuddhist texts recount the birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of [[Kanhapa|Krishnacharya]]'s disciples<!-- Mahasiddha Kanhapa -->, two ''[[Mahasiddha]]'' (\"great perfected ones\") sisters, [[Mekhala and Kanakhala]], who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also appeared in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the ''Mahasiddha'' princess [[Lakshminkara]]<!-- a Mahasiddha -->, cut off her head as a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=9\u201311}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|pp=101\u20132}}</ref>\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, [[Benoytosh Bhattacharyya|Benoytosh Bhattacharya]] \u2013 an expert on Tantra and the then director of the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda#Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute of Baroda]]<!-- http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/bot/pdf/bot_01_02_obituary.pdf--> \u2013 studied various texts such as the Buddhist ''Sadhanamala'' (1156{{nbsp}}CE), the Hindu ''Chhinnamastakalpa'' (uncertain date), and the ''Tantrasara'' by [[Krishnananda Agamavagisha]] (late 16th century). He determined that the Hindu Chhinnamasta and the Buddhist Chinnamunda were the same goddess, in spite of the fact that the former wears a serpent as a [[sacred thread]] and has an added copulating couple in the icon. In the ''Sadhanamala'', the goddess is called Sarvabuddha (\"all-awakened\"), and is attended by Vajravaironi and Vajravarnini; in the Hindu ''Tantrasara'', she is called ''Sarvasiddhi'' (\"all-accomplished\"), and is accompanied by attendants Dakini, Vaironi, and Varnini. In the ''Chhinnamastakalpa'', she is called Sarvabuddhi (\"all-enlightened\"); her attendants retain their Buddhist names. Bhattacharyya concluded that the Hindu Chhinnamasta originated from the Buddhist Chinnamunda, who was worshipped by at least the 7th century.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=12\u20135}}</ref> \n[[File:Bundi painting Chinnamasta.jpg|thumb|Chhinnamasta depicted enthroned appears in a benign form contrary to her traditional description, [[Rajput painting|Bundi painting]], c. 1775.|alt=Depicted enthroned, a decapitated, dark-complexioned woman wearing a red/orange sari holds a sword in her left hand and her own severed head  (with a lotus crown) on a platter in her right hand.

Shankaranarayanan \u2013 the author of ''The Ten Great Cosmic Powers'' \u2013 attribute Chhinnamasta to [[Vedic]] (ancient Hindu) antecedents. Sukumari Bhattacharji, the author of ''The Indian Theogony'', says that the Vedic goddess [[Nirrti]]'s functions were inherited by later Hindu goddesses [[Kali]], [[Chamunda]], Karali, and Chhinnamasta. Hindu literature first mentions Chhinnamasta in the ''[[upapurana]]'' ''Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana'' (c.{{nbsp}}950{{nbsp}}CE) and the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'' (9th\u201312th century).

Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are depicted semi nude and wear tiger skin skirt and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless .<ref name = \"K175\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=175}}</ref><ref name = \"K176\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=176}}</ref>\n\nOther nude Hindu goddesses who might have inspired Chhinnamasta are the malevolent war goddess [[Kotavi]] and the South-Indian hunting goddess [[Korravai]]. Kotavi, sometimes described as a [[Matrika]] (\"mother goddess\"), is nude, dishevelled, wild, and awful in appearance. She is mentioned in the scriptures ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', often as a foe of the god [[Vishnu]]. The ferocious, wild Korravai is the goddess of war and victory. Both goddesses are linked to battlefields; Chhinnamasta is not.<ref name = \"K176\"/> Kinsley points out that while there are several bloodthirsty, nude, and wild goddesses and demonesses in Hindu mythology, Chhinnamasta is the only goddess who displays the shocking self-decapitation motif.<ref name = \"K177\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=144\u20137}}</ref>\n\nThe beheading and rejoining motif also appears in the tale of the goddess [[Renuka]]; however the self-decapitation is missing in the legend.<ref name=\"Mishra315\">{{harvtxt|Mishra|Mohanty|Mohanty|2002|p=315}}</ref><ref name=\"Storm296\">{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|p=296}}</ref> In the context of her legend, Renuka is given the epithet \"Chhinnamasta\" (\"She whose head is severed\").<ref name = \"Mahalakshmi204\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|pp=204}}</ref><ref name = \"B6ff\">{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=6\u20137}}</ref> The mahavidya Chhinnamasta is also associated with Renuka's son [[Parashurama]], who decapitated his mother in the legend.<ref name=\"shasthi\"/>{{efn\n| name = Renuka\n| Renuka is the wife of the sage [[Jamadagni]].

On the order of his father, Renuka's youngest son Parashurama beheads her after his four elder brothers refuse. Jamadagni burns his four elder sons by his fiery glance for their non-compliance.

Legends from the ''[[Singhasan Battisi|Simhasana Dvatrimsika]]'' and the ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' speak of how the hero offers blood from his throat as an offering to a goddess. [[Rajasthan]]i folk tales and songs tell about of warrior-heroes (''[[Headless Horseman#In Indian folklore|jhumjharji]]'' or ''bhomiya'') who cuts off his head before the war or is decapitated in action, but battles on \u2013 without his head \u2013 slaying foes until he avenges his beheading and dies.<ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|pp =101, 428\u20139}}</ref> The decapitated body and head motif is not unique to Hinduism and Buddhism and appears across the world, including the [[Cephalophore]] saints of Christianity and in [[Celts|Celtic culture]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Buturovic|2016|p=81}}</ref>\n\n==Legends and textual references==\nChhinnamasta is often named as the fifth<ref name = \"K165\"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Foulston|Abbott|2009|p=120}}</ref><ref name=\"Storm287\">{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|p=287}}</ref> or sixth<ref name=\"McDaniel270\">{{harvtxt|McDaniel|2004|p=259}}</ref><ref name=\"Frawley112\"/><ref name=\"shasthi\"/> [[Mahavidya]] (Mahavidyas are a group of ten fearsome goddesses from the Hindu esoteric tradition of [[Tantra]]), with hymns identifying her as a fierce aspect of [[Devi]], the Hindu Mother goddess.

The story is as follows: [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], the daughter of [[Daksha]], is the first wife of the god [[Shiva]]. When she and Shiva are not invited to the [[Daksha yajna|fire sacrifice organized by her father]], she is insulted and insists on attending, despite Shiva's protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent for her to attend, the enraged Sati assumes a fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the ''Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana'', Chhinnamasta stands to the right of Shiva, interpreted as the east or the west; the ''Brihaddharma Purana'' describes her as appearing to the rear of Shiva in the west.<ref name=\"K162\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=162}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=1\u20133}}</ref><ref name=\"mahalakshmi201\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=201}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|2000|p=470}}</ref>{{efn| name = Daksha yajna}}\n\nSimilar legends exist. In these legends, the Mahavidyas arise from the wrath of other goddesses, specifically, [[Parvati]] (the second wife of Shiva and the [[reincarnation]] of Sati) and Kali (the principal Mahavidya). In one legend, Shiva and Parvati are living in the house of [[Himavat|\nParvati's father]]. Shiva wants to leave, but Parvati creates the ten fierce Mahavidyas who appear from ten directions and prevent him from leaving. In another legend, Shiva is living with Kali, identified as Shiva's consort in this context, but becomes tired of her and wants to leave. Kali creates the Mahavidyas who also obstruct his path from ten directions. Kali enlightens him and he ceases trying to leave.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Devi Bhagavata Purana'' also mentions the Mahavidyas as war-companions and forms of the goddess [[Shakambhari]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=31}}</ref> An oral tradition similarly replaces Shakambhari with the goddess [[Durga]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=30}}</ref>\n\n=== Chhinnamasta as an individual goddess ===\n\nThe ''Pranatoshini Tantra'' (18th century) narrates two tales of Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, attributed to the ''Narada-pancharatra'', tells how once, while bathing in [[Mandakini River|Mandakini]] river, Parvati becomes excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.<ref name=\"D412\">{{harvtxt|Donaldson|2001|p=412}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=147\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe other version, from the ''Pranatoshini Tantra'' and attributed to ''Svatantra Tantra'', is narrated by Shiva. He recounts that his consort [[Chandi]]ka (identified with Parvati) was engrossed in coitus with him in [[woman on top|reverse posture]], but became enraged at his seminal emission. Her attendants Dakini and Varnini rose from her body. The rest of the tale is similar to the earlier version, although the river is called Pushpabhadra, the day of Chhinnamasta's birth is called ''Viraratri'', and upon seeing the pale Parvati, Shiva becomes infuriated and assumes the form of Krodha [[Bhairava]].<ref name=\"K148\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=148}}</ref><ref name=\"mahalakshmi202\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=202}}</ref> This version is retold in the ''Shaktisamgama Tantra'' (c. 16th century),<ref name=\"K148\" /> in which Chhinnamasta forms a triad with Kali and Tara.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|2000|p=464}}</ref>\n\nAn oral legend tells how the goddess Prachanda Chandika appeared to aid the gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess [[Mahadevi|Mahashakti]].

The name Prachanda Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the ''Shakta Pramoda'' (19th century).<ref name=\"K148\"/> Another oral legend relates her to the [[Samudra manthan]] (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the [[Kshir Sagar|milk ocean]] to acquire the ''[[amrita]]'' (the elixir of immortality).

Chhinnamasta is the violent interaction between the Light and the Sound enabling Creation. Chhinnamasta severing her own head is interpreted symbolic of the disconnecting of the Source and the manifest Creation, similar to cutting the umbilical cord between the mother and the new-born. Further, Chhinnamasta is associated with thunder and lightning, interacting light and sound forces. Her epithet, Vajra Vairochani (\"radiant like the vajra\"), is linked to the ''[[vajra]]'' (thunderbolt) and its divine master - [[Indra]], the king of heaven and the god of rain, thunder and lightning.<ref>{{harvtxt|S Shankaranarayanan|2002|pp=69\u201372}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Frawley|1994|p=116}}</ref>\n\nThe head offering and subsequent restoration of the head signify immortality.

The image of Chhinnamasta standing on a copulating couple of Kamadeva (literally, \"sexual desire\") and Rati (\"sexual intercourse\") is interpreted by some scholars as a symbol of a person's ''control'' over sexual desire, while others interpret the goddess as being the ''embodiment'' of sexual energy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|pp=294\u20135}}</ref>\n\nHer names, such as ''[[Yogini]]'' and ''Madanatura'' (\"one who has affects [[Kama]]\"), convey her [[yogic]] control over sexual energy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=154}}</ref> Her triumphant stance trampling the love-deity couple denotes victory over desire and ''[[samsara]]'' (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth).<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=105\u20136}}</ref> Her subjugation of the amorous couple suggests that her worship will grant control over sexual urge and other impulses of the ''[[indriya]]''s (\"senses\"), whose governing god Indra - she is associated with.<ref>{{harvtxt|S Shankaranarayanan|2002|pp=71-2}}</ref> \n\nImages in which Chhinnamasta is depicted sitting on Kamadeva-Rati in a non-suppressive fashion suggest that sexual energy is a manifestation of the goddess herself, and therefore should be embraced, and not suppressed. Images where Shiva is depicted in coitus with Chhinnamasta are associated with this interpretation. Chhinnamasta's names like ''Kameshwari'' (\"goddess of desire\") and ''Ratiragavivriddhini'' (\"one who is engrossed in the realm of Rati&nbsp;\u2013 [copulation or sexual desire]\") and the appearance of ''klim''&nbsp;\u2013 the common seed syllable of Kamadeva and Krishna&nbsp;\u2013 in her mantra support this interpretation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=155\u20137}}</ref> Her lolling tongue also denotes sexual hunger.<ref name=\"mahalakshmi204\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=204}}</ref>\n\nThe inverted triangle, found in Chhinnamasta's iconography as well as in her yantra, signifies the ''[[yoni]]'' (womb) and the feminine. The goddess is often prescribed to be visualised in the centre of the inverted triangle in the navel. It also signifies the three ''[[Gu\u1e47a|guna]]''s (qualities) and three ''[[shakti]]''s (powers)&nbsp;\u2013''[[Iccha-shakti|iccha]]'' (\"will-power\"), ''[[Kriy\u0101|kriya]]'' (\"action\"), and ''jnana'' (\"wisdom\").<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=34, 90\u20131}}</ref> The goddess is called ''Yoni-mudra'' or ''Yoni-gamya'', accessible through the yoni.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bhattacharya Saxena|2011|p=69}}</ref>\n\n=== Other symbolism and associations ===\nChhinnamasta's nudity and headlessness symbolise her integrity and \"heedlessness\".

After forcibly extracting Shiva's consent by threatening him by the Mahavidyas, Sati arrives uninvited to Daksha's yagna, along with a retinue of Shiva's followers. Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati sacrificed herself in the fire. The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with her half-burnt corpse. Finally, Vishnu dismembered her body into 51 parts, each of which fell on different places on the earth, each creating a Shakti Peetha shrine.\n\n}}\n\n{{efn\n| name = nadi\n| In [[Yoga]], nadis are invisible channels through his life-force is said to flow.

She is one of the [[Mahavidya]]s or [[Parvati|Shivasakthi]] or [[Parvati]], ten goddesses from the esoteric tradition of [[Tantra]], and a ferocious aspect of [[Devi]], the Hindu Mother goddess. The [[semi nude]] goddess, usually wears tiger skin skirt and standing or seated on a divine, holds her own severed head in one hand, a [[scimitar]] in another. Three [[blood squirt|jets of blood spurt]] out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two attendants.\n\nChhinnamasta is a goddess of contradictions. She symbolises both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She represents death, temporality, and destruction as well as life, immortality, and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]&nbsp;\u2013 spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her [[self-sacrifice]]&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes coupled with a maternal element&nbsp;\u2013 sexual essence, and self-destructive fury.\n\nChhinnamasta is worshipped in the [[Shakta#Kalikula: family of Kali|Kalikula]] sect of [[Shaktism]], the Goddess-centric tradition of Hinduism. Though Chhinnamasta enjoys patronage as one of the Mahavidyas, temples devoted to her (found mostly in Nepal and eastern India) and her public worship are rare. However, she is a significant Tantric deity, well known and worshipped among esoteric Tantric practitioners. Chhinnamasta is closely related to [[Chinnamunda]]&nbsp;\u2013 the severed-headed form of the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] goddess [[Vajrayogini]].Those who worship Chinnamasta will be free from the effects of [[Rahu]] as per Shaktism.\n\n== Origins ==\n\n[[File:Chinnamunda.jpg|thumb|left|The Buddhist Chinnamunda is believed to be the antecedent of the Hindu Chhinnamasta, 14th-century painting, Nepal.|alt=A decapitated, nude, red-complexioned woman stands, raising her left arm, which holds her severed head. She is flanked by two smaller, nude women: a white-coloured one (left) and a blue-coloured one (right).]]\n\nThe Hindu Chhinnamasta appears as a significant deity in [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], where she is called [[Chinnamunda]] (\"she with the severed head\") or Trikaya-vajrayogini (\"triple-bodied [[Vajrayogini]]\"). Chinnamunda is the severed-head form of goddess Vajrayogini (or [[Vajravarahi]], a ferocious form of Vajrayogini), who is depicted similar to Chhinnamasta.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=172}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|p=94}}</ref>\n\nBuddhist texts recount the birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of [[Kanhapa|Krishnacharya]]'s disciples<!-- Mahasiddha Kanhapa -->, two ''[[Mahasiddha]]'' (\"great perfected ones\") sisters, [[Mekhala and Kanakhala]], who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also appeared in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the ''Mahasiddha'' princess [[Lakshminkara]]<!-- a Mahasiddha -->, cut off her head as a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=9\u201311}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|English|2002|pp=101\u20132}}</ref>\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, [[Benoytosh Bhattacharyya|Benoytosh Bhattacharya]] \u2013 an expert on Tantra and the then director of the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda#Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute of Baroda]]<!-- http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/bot/pdf/bot_01_02_obituary.pdf--> \u2013 studied various texts such as the Buddhist ''Sadhanamala'' (1156{{nbsp}}CE), the Hindu ''Chhinnamastakalpa'' (uncertain date), and the ''Tantrasara'' by [[Krishnananda Agamavagisha]] (late 16th century). He determined that the Hindu Chhinnamasta and the Buddhist Chinnamunda were the same goddess, in spite of the fact that the former wears a serpent as a [[sacred thread]] and has an added copulating couple in the icon. In the ''Sadhanamala'', the goddess is called Sarvabuddha (\"all-awakened\"), and is attended by Vajravaironi and Vajravarnini; in the Hindu ''Tantrasara'', she is called ''Sarvasiddhi'' (\"all-accomplished\"), and is accompanied by attendants Dakini, Vaironi, and Varnini. In the ''Chhinnamastakalpa'', she is called Sarvabuddhi (\"all-enlightened\"); her attendants retain their Buddhist names. Bhattacharyya concluded that the Hindu Chhinnamasta originated from the Buddhist Chinnamunda, who was worshipped by at least the 7th century.<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=12\u20135}}</ref> \n[[File:Bundi painting Chinnamasta.jpg|thumb|Chhinnamasta depicted enthroned appears in a benign form contrary to her traditional description, [[Rajput painting|Bundi painting]], c. 1775.|alt=Depicted enthroned, a decapitated, dark-complexioned woman wearing a red/orange sari holds a sword in her left hand and her own severed head  (with a lotus crown) on a platter in her right hand.

Shankaranarayanan \u2013 the author of ''The Ten Great Cosmic Powers'' \u2013 attribute Chhinnamasta to [[Vedic]] (ancient Hindu) antecedents. Sukumari Bhattacharji, the author of ''The Indian Theogony'', says that the Vedic goddess [[Nirrti]]'s functions were inherited by later Hindu goddesses [[Kali]], [[Chamunda]], Karali, and Chhinnamasta. Hindu literature first mentions Chhinnamasta in the ''[[upapurana]]'' ''Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana'' (c.{{nbsp}}950{{nbsp}}CE) and the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'' (9th\u201312th century). Elisabeth{{nbsp}}A. Benard, the author of ''Chinnamast\u0101: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu Tantric Goddess'',{{efn\n| name = Benard\n| The book is referred to as \"the first monograph to examine the rituals, symbolisms, and iconographic conventions\" of Chhinnamasta.<ref>{{harvtxt|McDermott|1996|pp=357\u20138}}</ref>\n}} says that whatever her origins may be, it is clear that Chhinnamasta/Chinnamunda was known in the 9th century and worshipped by ''Mahasiddha''s.<ref name = \"B16\">{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=16\u20137}}</ref> Though essentially agreeing with Bhattacharyya's view, Karel R. van{{nbsp}}Kooij, former Professor of South Asian art history at [[Leiden University]], goes further and associates the iconography of Chhinnamasta with the Tantric goddesses [[Varahi]] and Chamunda.<ref>{{harvtxt|van Kooij|1999|p=266}}</ref>\n\nDavid Kinsley, an expert on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at [[McMaster University]], agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are depicted semi nude and wear tiger skin skirt and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless .<ref name = \"K175\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=175}}</ref><ref name = \"K176\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=176}}</ref>\n\nOther nude Hindu goddesses who might have inspired Chhinnamasta are the malevolent war goddess [[Kotavi]] and the South-Indian hunting goddess [[Korravai]]. Kotavi, sometimes described as a [[Matrika]] (\"mother goddess\"), is nude, dishevelled, wild, and awful in appearance. She is mentioned in the scriptures ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', often as a foe of the god [[Vishnu]]. The ferocious, wild Korravai is the goddess of war and victory. Both goddesses are linked to battlefields; Chhinnamasta is not.<ref name = \"K176\"/> Kinsley points out that while there are several bloodthirsty, nude, and wild goddesses and demonesses in Hindu mythology, Chhinnamasta is the only goddess who displays the shocking self-decapitation motif.<ref name = \"K177\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=144\u20137}}</ref>\n\nThe beheading and rejoining motif also appears in the tale of the goddess [[Renuka]]; however the self-decapitation is missing in the legend.<ref name=\"Mishra315\">{{harvtxt|Mishra|Mohanty|Mohanty|2002|p=315}}</ref><ref name=\"Storm296\">{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|p=296}}</ref> In the context of her legend, Renuka is given the epithet \"Chhinnamasta\" (\"She whose head is severed\").<ref name = \"Mahalakshmi204\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|pp=204}}</ref><ref name = \"B6ff\">{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=6\u20137}}</ref> The mahavidya Chhinnamasta is also associated with Renuka's son [[Parashurama]], who decapitated his mother in the legend.<ref name=\"shasthi\"/>{{efn\n| name = Renuka\n| Renuka is the wife of the sage [[Jamadagni]].

The story is as follows: [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], the daughter of [[Daksha]], is the first wife of the god [[Shiva]]. When she and Shiva are not invited to the [[Daksha yajna|fire sacrifice organized by her father]], she is insulted and insists on attending, despite Shiva's protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent for her to attend, the enraged Sati assumes a fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the ''Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana'', Chhinnamasta stands to the right of Shiva, interpreted as the east or the west; the ''Brihaddharma Purana'' describes her as appearing to the rear of Shiva in the west.<ref name=\"K162\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1988|p=162}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=1\u20133}}</ref><ref name=\"mahalakshmi201\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=201}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|2000|p=470}}</ref>{{efn| name = Daksha yajna}}\n\nSimilar legends exist. In these legends, the Mahavidyas arise from the wrath of other goddesses, specifically, [[Parvati]] (the second wife of Shiva and the [[reincarnation]] of Sati) and Kali (the principal Mahavidya). In one legend, Shiva and Parvati are living in the house of [[Himavat|\nParvati's father]]. Shiva wants to leave, but Parvati creates the ten fierce Mahavidyas who appear from ten directions and prevent him from leaving. In another legend, Shiva is living with Kali, identified as Shiva's consort in this context, but becomes tired of her and wants to leave. Kali creates the Mahavidyas who also obstruct his path from ten directions. Kali enlightens him and he ceases trying to leave.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Devi Bhagavata Purana'' also mentions the Mahavidyas as war-companions and forms of the goddess [[Shakambhari]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=31}}</ref> An oral tradition similarly replaces Shakambhari with the goddess [[Durga]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=30}}</ref>\n\n=== Chhinnamasta as an individual goddess ===\n\nThe ''Pranatoshini Tantra'' (18th century) narrates two tales of Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, attributed to the ''Narada-pancharatra'', tells how once, while bathing in [[Mandakini River|Mandakini]] river, Parvati becomes excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.<ref name=\"D412\">{{harvtxt|Donaldson|2001|p=412}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=147\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe other version, from the ''Pranatoshini Tantra'' and attributed to ''Svatantra Tantra'', is narrated by Shiva. He recounts that his consort [[Chandi]]ka (identified with Parvati) was engrossed in coitus with him in [[woman on top|reverse posture]], but became enraged at his seminal emission. Her attendants Dakini and Varnini rose from her body. The rest of the tale is similar to the earlier version, although the river is called Pushpabhadra, the day of Chhinnamasta's birth is called ''Viraratri'', and upon seeing the pale Parvati, Shiva becomes infuriated and assumes the form of Krodha [[Bhairava]].<ref name=\"K148\">{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=148}}</ref><ref name=\"mahalakshmi202\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=202}}</ref> This version is retold in the ''Shaktisamgama Tantra'' (c. 16th century),<ref name=\"K148\" /> in which Chhinnamasta forms a triad with Kali and Tara.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gupta|2000|p=464}}</ref>\n\nAn oral legend tells how the goddess Prachanda Chandika appeared to aid the gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess [[Mahadevi|Mahashakti]].

The name Prachanda Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the ''Shakta Pramoda'' (19th century).<ref name=\"K148\"/> Another oral legend relates her to the [[Samudra manthan]] (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the [[Kshir Sagar|milk ocean]] to acquire the ''[[amrita]]'' (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself to prevent them from acquiring it.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe central themes of the mythology of Chhinnamasta are her [[Self sacrifice|self-sacrifice]]&nbsp;\u2013 with a maternal aspect (in the ''Pranatoshini'' ''Tantra'' versions) or for the welfare of the world (in the Samudra manthan oral version described above)&nbsp;\u2013 her sexual dominance and embrace (second ''Pranatoshini'' ''Tantra'' version), and her self-destructive fury (in the first oral legend).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=149\u201350}}</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Chhinnamasta.JPG|thumb|Chhinnamasta, at a [[Kali Puja]] Pandal, [[Kolkata]]|alt=A decapitated, nude, red-complexioned goddess stands on a copulating couple inside a lotus.

The image of Chhinnamasta standing on a copulating couple of Kamadeva (literally, \"sexual desire\") and Rati (\"sexual intercourse\") is interpreted by some scholars as a symbol of a person's ''control'' over sexual desire, while others interpret the goddess as being the ''embodiment'' of sexual energy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Storm|2013|pp=294\u20135}}</ref>\n\nHer names, such as ''[[Yogini]]'' and ''Madanatura'' (\"one who has affects [[Kama]]\"), convey her [[yogic]] control over sexual energy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|p=154}}</ref> Her triumphant stance trampling the love-deity couple denotes victory over desire and ''[[samsara]]'' (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth).<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=105\u20136}}</ref> Her subjugation of the amorous couple suggests that her worship will grant control over sexual urge and other impulses of the ''[[indriya]]''s (\"senses\"), whose governing god Indra - she is associated with.<ref>{{harvtxt|S Shankaranarayanan|2002|pp=71-2}}</ref> \n\nImages in which Chhinnamasta is depicted sitting on Kamadeva-Rati in a non-suppressive fashion suggest that sexual energy is a manifestation of the goddess herself, and therefore should be embraced, and not suppressed. Images where Shiva is depicted in coitus with Chhinnamasta are associated with this interpretation. Chhinnamasta's names like ''Kameshwari'' (\"goddess of desire\") and ''Ratiragavivriddhini'' (\"one who is engrossed in the realm of Rati&nbsp;\u2013 [copulation or sexual desire]\") and the appearance of ''klim''&nbsp;\u2013 the common seed syllable of Kamadeva and Krishna&nbsp;\u2013 in her mantra support this interpretation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kinsley|1997|pp=155\u20137}}</ref> Her lolling tongue also denotes sexual hunger.<ref name=\"mahalakshmi204\">{{harvtxt|R Mahalakshmi|2014|p=204}}</ref>\n\nThe inverted triangle, found in Chhinnamasta's iconography as well as in her yantra, signifies the ''[[yoni]]'' (womb) and the feminine. The goddess is often prescribed to be visualised in the centre of the inverted triangle in the navel. It also signifies the three ''[[Gu\u1e47a|guna]]''s (qualities) and three ''[[shakti]]''s (powers)&nbsp;\u2013''[[Iccha-shakti|iccha]]'' (\"will-power\"), ''[[Kriy\u0101|kriya]]'' (\"action\"), and ''jnana'' (\"wisdom\").<ref>{{harvtxt|Benard|2000|pp=34, 90\u20131}}</ref> The goddess is called ''Yoni-mudra'' or ''Yoni-gamya'', accessible through the yoni.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bhattacharya Saxena|2011|p=69}}</ref>\n\n=== Other symbolism and associations ===\nChhinnamasta's nudity and headlessness symbolise her integrity and \"heedlessness\".

{"title_page": "Rafael Palacios (artist)", "text_new": "'''Rafael D. Palacios''' (1905\u20131993) was a [[Puerto Rican-American]] freelance artist and illustrator specializing in book jackets and maps for major U.S. publishers in the mid- and late 20th century. Among the notable maps of his prolific and highly successful career are those in most of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s history books and in [[Bruce Catton]]'s [[American Civil War|Civil War]] books.\n\n==Biography==\nOf Spanish-Puerto Rican parentage, Palacios was born in [[Santo Domingo]], capital of the [[Dominican Republic]]. When he was five months old his family moved to [[Puerto Rico]]. He was educated in the Puerto Rican schools, but as an artist was largely self-taught. In 1928 he did his first fine arts sketches while in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. He made something of a specialty of Afro-Caribbean portraiture. He made a brief visit to the [[United States]] in 1931. In 1937 he was chosen, with two others, to represent Puerto Rico at the second annual Exhibition of American Art in [[New York City]]. In 1938 he also exhibited at the [[Delphic Studios]] in New York, where he presented his first display of [[Afro-Antillean art]] (a one-man show of his [[gouaches]]). That same year he also exhibited at the first [[Newspaper Artists' Exhibition]] in New York, and in several one-man shows at the [[Athenaeum (San Juan)|Athenaeum]] in San Juan and at the [[University of Puerto Rico]].\n\nBeginning in 1938 Palacios worked for American newspapers as an illustrator and translator of comic strips. In the mid-1940s, he shared a studio with several other freelance artists and did a number of covers and endpapers for [[Bantam Books]]. His endpapers had a strong cartographic quality and served a similar purpose with [[Dell Books]]' [[mapback]]s.\n\nIn 1948, Palacios was chosen to produce the maps for Gen. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[memoir]], ''[[Crusade in Europe]]''.\n\nPalacios took over as the cartographer from [[George Annand]] for the [[Rivers of America Series|''Rivers of America'' series]] in 1956.

The books revolve around the adventures of the skeleton detective, Skulduggery Pleasant, his proteg\u00e9, Valkyrie Cain, along with other friends. The central [[story arc]] concerns Valkyrie's struggle to stop evil forces threatening the world and her internal struggle to resist the darkness within.\n\nSince the release of the first novel in 2007, ''[[Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)|Skulduggery Pleasant]]'', the series has been praised by both readers and critics. The following novels were released each year afterward, with the exception of the fourth and fifth novels, ''Dark Days'' and ''Mortal Coil'', which were both released in 2010. Landy was initially contracted to write three books, with any further books depending on how well the first trilogy sold. The success of the first novels ensured that the deal was extended first to six books and in 2011, HarperCollins signed the deal for the final trilogy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/harpercollins-extends-landy-deal.html|title=HarperCollins extends Landy deal|publisher=The Bookseller|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Derek Landy announced via a video blog that although the ''Skulduggery Pleasant'' series was complete, the series as a whole was still set to continue with a sequel series, the first book of which was released on 1 June 2017, titled ''Resurrection''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dereklandy.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/new-book-announcement.html|title=Derek Landy Blogs Under Duress: New Book Announcement|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Untitled-Skulduggery-Pleasant-Book-10-Derek-Landy/0008169020/ref=as_li_ss_tl|title=Resurrection (Skulduggery Pleasant, Book 10)|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>  On 6 April 2020, ''Seasons of War'', the first book of the second (and final) trilogy in the second series, was released.<ref name=\"seasons-of-war-waterstones\"/>\n\n==Summary==\n{{Episode table |background=#93B8C4 |overall=5 |title=40 |airdate=20 |altdate=20 |aux4=15 |airdateT=Publication date |altdateT=Counts |aux4T=ISBN |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|c=#93B8C4|p=First series|nopart=y}}\n{{Book list\n | book_number   = 1\n | title         = [[Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)|Skulduggery Pleasant]]\n | publish_date  = 3 April 2007\n | aux1          = 67,393 words<ref name=\"PageCounts\">{{cite tweet |user=DerekLandy |author=Derek Landy |number=1007252922076422144 |title=I don't know the page counts, because to all depends on how big the font size is when the books are printed, but I do keep track of word counts.

Pleasant''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)}}\n\nTwelve-year-old Stephanie Edgley is tired of her boring and miserable life. But when a mysterious man breaks into her recently inherited uncle's house and tries to kill her, she is saved by a funny, arrogant, fireball-throwing, 400-year-old detective that goes by the name of Skulduggery Pleasant, who just so happens to be a walking, talking skeleton, and she is pulled with him to a secret world of danger, murder and magic. Later in the book, taking the new name of Valkyrie Cain, Stephanie partners up with Skulduggery to solve her uncle's murder, meeting all types of people along the way, to prevent the devious Nefarian Serpine from obtaining the Sceptre of Ancients, a mystical weapon that can slay gods. The Sceptre is a powerful weapon which can be used to defeat and overcome the world and bring back the Faceless Ones who are pretty dumb.\n\n===''Playing with Fire''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Playing with Fire}}\nBaron Vengeous, one of Mevolent's Three Generals, has escaped from prison, and he has big plans for the Grotesquery, a dark creature created from the remains of some of the most deadly creatures to ever walk the earth. Most worryingly of all, it had the torso of a Faceless One, one of the dark gods that ruled the earth eons ago, and Baron plans to use this to bring back the rest of the Faceless Ones, so they may resume their reign of tyranny and torture, and to help him with this endeavour he has an army of vampires at his disposal. This will be Skulduggery and Valkyrie's toughest battle yet.\n\n===''The Faceless Ones''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: The Faceless Ones}}\nAs a number of teleporters are mysteriously murdered Valkyrie and Skulduggery learn that it is quickly linked to a fanatical cult named the Diablerie, who worship horrific Dark gods known as the Faceless Ones, as they attempt to open a portal with the goal of returning the Faceless Ones to the world. With the assistance of a cocky young teleporter, Fletcher Renn, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have very little time to track down a mysterious man named Batu, stop the Diablerie, and prevent the Faceless ones from returning to earth, because if they don't, the world will burn. This one will have deadly consequences.\n\n===''Dark Days''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Dark Days}}\nFollowing the events of ''The Faceless Ones'', Valkyrie has tracked down Skulduggery's original skull, with which she can open another portal to the home dimension of the Faceless Ones and rescue Skulduggery. However, things do not go exactly as planned as Skulduggery has become unhinged thanks to his experiences with the Faceless Ones, but it is quickly revealed that they have much bigger problems to worry about: The Revengers Club, a group of criminals and murderers (and Scapegrace), who are out for revenge against those who wronged them in the way they know best: mass murder. And if that wasn't enough to deal with, sensitives all around the globe are having visions of a new threat, one that will bring the world to its knees: Darquesse.\n\n===''Mortal Coil''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Mortal Coil}}\nBetween the shocking revelation that her true name is Darquesse, a near deathly being that Sensitives have had terrifying apocalyptic visions of, in which she turns the world into a charred lifeless husk, an outbreak of at least 2000 vicious, soul possessing shadows known as Remnants who turn their hosts into murdering psychopaths with no remorse, and a prophecy which may make her the Death Bringer, a messiah to the necromancers who they believe will be their salvation, Valkyrie Cain has a lot to worry about. And this time, she doesn't come out completely victorious.\n\n===''Death Bringer''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Death Bringer}}\nThe Death Bringer has finally arrived, and she has brought with her an eagerness to end the world as we know it, and initiate the Passage, a secretive ritual which necromancers refuse to explain to the rest of the magical community, only that it will 'tear down the barriers between life and death'. But when the horrific truth behind the Passage is revealed, Valkyrie and Skulduggery are caught up in a hectic race against time to save half of the world's population from an untimely death, a race that will have both Skulduggery and Valkyrie facing their inner demons.\n\n===''Kingdom of the Wicked''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Kingdom of the Wicked}}\nMortals all throughout the world are inexplicably obtaining magical powers, and the trail seems to lead to Argeddion, a pacifistic, almost god like being, who, with the knowledge of his true name, hopes to bring magic to the masses, and lift the world into a new era of enlightenment and peace. The only problem with his seemingly idyllic plan: many of his test subjects are running wild, drunk on their newfound power, and are slaughtering innocent people and on the verge of exposing magic to the world. All of this poses a credible challenge to Skulduggery and Valkyrie. They also have the Supreme Council to deal with, an allied group of sanctuaries trying to convince the Irish to hand over control after the recent series of catastrophes. To make things worse, Valkyrie starts having uncontrollable trans-dimensional jaunts to a world controlled by sorcerers, where mortals live in terror and Mevolent still lives.\n\n===''Last Stand of Dead Men''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Last Stand of Dead Men}}\nThe war between sanctuaries of the magical world that everyone has been expecting has finally come, with the Supreme Council making a desperate grab for the complete control of the cradle of magic, sparking a brutal war that will turn friend into enemy, and ally to foe. But even as the Dead Men make their final stand for their country and their freedom, there is another war raging, inside Valkyrie Cain herself, and it is much more important. Because if she loses, Darquesse will rise, the world will burn, and everyone she knows and loves will perish.\n\n===''The Dying of the Light''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: The Dying of the Light}}\nThe final book of the first series. The War of the Sanctuaries has been won, but it was not without its casualties. Rogue supercharged sorcerers from the battle of Roarhaven are running loose. Following Valkyrie's becoming of Darquesse, Skulduggery Pleasant must use any and all means to track down and stop Darquesse and hopefully free Valkyrie before she turns the world into a charred, lifeless cinder. And so he draws together a team of soldiers, monster hunters, killers, criminals, and Valkyrie's own murderous and sentient reflection.\n\n==Second series novels==\n\n===''Resurrection''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Resurrection}}\nA lot has changed. Roarhaven is now a magical city, where sorcerers can live openly. Valkyrie Cain has been out of action for years, recovering from the war against her alter-ego Darquesse, which nearly destroyed her and everyone else. Some things never change, though: bad people still want to do bad things, and Skulduggery Pleasant is still there to stop them. When Skulduggery learns of a plot to resurrect a terrifying evil, he persuades Valkyrie to join him for just 24 hours. But they need someone else on their team, someone inconspicuous, someone who can go undercover: Omen Darkly, a student at the new Corrival Academy, a school for the magically gifted.\n\n===''Midnight''===\n\nValkyrie has struggled to keep her family safe ever since she became a sorcerer, while she battled alongside Skulduggery and returned victorious every time. However, a killer kidnaps Alice, her little sister, to force Valkyrie into a final battle. Valkyrie is joined by Skulduggery and Omen Darkly, to find Alice within twelve hours, before it's too late.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/l/derek-landy/midnight.htm|title=Synopsis of Midnight|work=FantasticFiction.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Bedlam''===\n\nReeling from the aftermath of Alice's kidnapping, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have their hands full with new violent visions of the future, while Valkyrie works tirelessly to find her sister's soul, conspiracies in the American government, and tracking down old enemies while facing newer, greater threats than ever. With the King of the Darklands on the rise, and the Anti-sanctuary moving into their endgame, it will take Valkyrie, Skulduggery, the Darkly brothers, and all the allies they can muster to face what lies in store. If new secrets and revelations don't tear them apart first.\n\n===''Seasons of War''===\nWar is coming. To avert catastrophe, Skulduggery and Valkyrie are sent on a secret mission that takes them away from everything they know, to a forsaken land of magic and grim, unrelenting terror. It is here that Valkyrie will have to fight the hardest \u2014 not only against the enemies who want her dead, but also against her own self-destructive impulses. It's only by crawling through darkness that she'll be able to once again stand in the light... Set from spring to summer, Seasons of War takes place over 7 months, and in another dimension. Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Tanith, Dexter, Saracen and Nefarian Serpine from Dimension X find that Mevolent's dimension is overrun by zombie like people who have been infected by a disease and are called Draugar.\n\n''Seasons of War'' released on 2 April 2020, and is be the first novel in the final trilogy of the second series.<ref name=\"seasons-of-war-waterstones\">{{cite web|url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/seasons-of-war/derek-landy/9780008386238|website=Waterstones|title=Seasons of War by Derek Landy}}</ref><ref name=\"Seasons of War\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DerekLandy/status/1189890476767371264|title=Derek Landy on Twitter: \"#Skulduggery13|first=Derek|last=Landy|date=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DerekLandy/status/1198171319952650241|title=Nope!

Many critics praised [[Derek Landy]]'s way of writing due to his large gallery of [[List of characters in Skulduggery Pleasant|characters]].\n* Phillip Ardagh ([[The Guardian]]):\n: ''It's exciting, pacy, nicely handled and it's fun. There's nothing worthy about it, and it's all the better for that. And, I might add, it's self-contained.

The books revolve around the adventures of the skeleton detective, Skulduggery Pleasant, his proteg\u00e9, Valkyrie Cain, along with other friends. The central [[story arc]] concerns Valkyrie's struggle to stop evil forces threatening the world and her internal struggle to resist the darkness within.\n\nSince the release of the first novel in 2007, ''[[Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)|Skulduggery Pleasant]]'', the series has been praised by both readers and critics. The following novels were released each year afterward, with the exception of the fourth and fifth novels, ''Dark Days'' and ''Mortal Coil'', which were both released in 2010. Landy was initially contracted to write three books, with any further books depending on how well the first trilogy sold. The success of the first novels ensured that the deal was extended first to six books and in 2011, HarperCollins signed the deal for the final trilogy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/harpercollins-extends-landy-deal.html|title=HarperCollins extends Landy deal|publisher=The Bookseller|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Derek Landy announced via a video blog that although the ''Skulduggery Pleasant'' series was complete, the series as a whole was still set to continue with a sequel series, the first book of which was released on 1 June 2017, titled ''Resurrection''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dereklandy.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/new-book-announcement.html|title=Derek Landy Blogs Under Duress: New Book Announcement|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Untitled-Skulduggery-Pleasant-Book-10-Derek-Landy/0008169020/ref=as_li_ss_tl|title=Resurrection (Skulduggery Pleasant, Book 10)|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>  On 6 April 2020, ''Seasons of War'', the first book of the second (and final) trilogy in the second series, was released.<ref name=\"seasons-of-war-waterstones\"/>\n\n==Summary==\n{{Episode table |background=#93B8C4 |overall=5 |title=40 |airdate=20 |altdate=20 |aux4=15 |airdateT=Publication date |altdateT=Counts |aux4T=ISBN |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|c=#93B8C4|p=First series|nopart=y}}\n{{Book list\n | book_number   = 1\n | title         = [[Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)|Skulduggery Pleasant]]\n | publish_date  = 3 April 2007\n | aux1          = 67,393 words<ref name=\"PageCounts\">{{cite tweet |user=DerekLandy |author=Derek Landy |number=1007252922076422144 |title=I don't know the page counts, because to all depends on how big the font size is when the books are printed, but I do keep track of word counts.

Pleasant''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant (novel)}}\n\nTwelve-year-old Stephanie Edgley is tired of her boring and miserable life. But when a mysterious man breaks into her recently inherited uncle's house and tries to kill her, she is saved by a funny, arrogant, fireball-throwing, 400-year-old detective that goes by the name of Skulduggery Pleasant, who just so happens to be a walking, talking skeleton, and she is pulled with him to a secret world of danger, murder and magic. Later in the book, taking the new name of Valkyrie Cain, Stephanie partners up with Skulduggery to solve her uncle's murder, meeting all types of people along the way, to prevent the devious Nefarian Serpine from obtaining the Sceptre of Ancients, a mystical weapon that can slay gods. The Sceptre is a powerful weapon which can be used to defeat and overcome the world and bring back the Faceless Ones.\n\n===''Playing with Fire''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Playing with Fire}}\nBaron Vengeous, one of Mevolent's Three Generals, has escaped from prison, and he has big plans for the Grotesquery, a dark creature created from the remains of some of the most deadly creatures to ever walk the earth. Most worryingly of all, it had the torso of a Faceless One, one of the dark gods that ruled the earth eons ago, and Baron plans to use this to bring back the rest of the Faceless Ones, so they may resume their reign of tyranny and torture, and to help him with this endeavour he has an army of vampires at his disposal. This will be Skulduggery and Valkyrie's toughest battle yet.\n\n===''The Faceless Ones''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: The Faceless Ones}}\nAs a number of teleporters are mysteriously murdered Valkyrie and Skulduggery learn that it is quickly linked to a fanatical cult named the Diablerie, who worship horrific Dark gods known as the Faceless Ones, as they attempt to open a portal with the goal of returning the Faceless Ones to the world. With the assistance of a cocky young teleporter, Fletcher Renn, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have very little time to track down a mysterious man named Batu, stop the Diablerie, and prevent the Faceless ones from returning to earth, because if they don't, the world will burn. This one will have deadly consequences.\n\n===''Dark Days''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Dark Days}}\nFollowing the events of ''The Faceless Ones'', Valkyrie has tracked down Skulduggery's original skull, with which she can open another portal to the home dimension of the Faceless Ones and rescue Skulduggery. However, things do not go exactly as planned as Skulduggery has become unhinged thanks to his experiences with the Faceless Ones, but it is quickly revealed that they have much bigger problems to worry about: The Revengers Club, a group of criminals and murderers (and Scapegrace), who are out for revenge against those who wronged them in the way they know best: mass murder. And if that wasn't enough to deal with, sensitives all around the globe are having visions of a new threat, one that will bring the world to its knees: Darquesse.\n\n===''Mortal Coil''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Mortal Coil}}\nBetween the shocking revelation that her true name is Darquesse, a near deathly being that Sensitives have had terrifying apocalyptic visions of, in which she turns the world into a charred lifeless husk, an outbreak of at least 2000 vicious, soul possessing shadows known as Remnants who turn their hosts into murdering psychopaths with no remorse, and a prophecy which may make her the Death Bringer, a messiah to the necromancers who they believe will be their salvation, Valkyrie Cain has a lot to worry about. And this time, she doesn't come out completely victorious.\n\n===''Death Bringer''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Death Bringer}}\nThe Death Bringer has finally arrived, and she has brought with her an eagerness to end the world as we know it, and initiate the Passage, a secretive ritual which necromancers refuse to explain to the rest of the magical community, only that it will 'tear down the barriers between life and death'. But when the horrific truth behind the Passage is revealed, Valkyrie and Skulduggery are caught up in a hectic race against time to save half of the world's population from an untimely death, a race that will have both Skulduggery and Valkyrie facing their inner demons.\n\n===''Kingdom of the Wicked''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Kingdom of the Wicked}}\nMortals all throughout the world are inexplicably obtaining magical powers, and the trail seems to lead to Argeddion, a pacifistic, almost god like being, who, with the knowledge of his true name, hopes to bring magic to the masses, and lift the world into a new era of enlightenment and peace. The only problem with his seemingly idyllic plan: many of his test subjects are running wild, drunk on their newfound power, and are slaughtering innocent people and on the verge of exposing magic to the world. All of this poses a credible challenge to Skulduggery and Valkyrie. They also have the Supreme Council to deal with, an allied group of sanctuaries trying to convince the Irish to hand over control after the recent series of catastrophes. To make things worse, Valkyrie starts having uncontrollable trans-dimensional jaunts to a world controlled by sorcerers, where mortals live in terror and Mevolent still lives.\n\n===''Last Stand of Dead Men''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Last Stand of Dead Men}}\nThe war between sanctuaries of the magical world that everyone has been expecting has finally come, with the Supreme Council making a desperate grab for the complete control of the cradle of magic, sparking a brutal war that will turn friend into enemy, and ally to foe. But even as the Dead Men make their final stand for their country and their freedom, there is another war raging, inside Valkyrie Cain herself, and it is much more important. Because if she loses, Darquesse will rise, the world will burn, and everyone she knows and loves will perish.\n\n===''The Dying of the Light''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: The Dying of the Light}}\nThe final book of the first series. The War of the Sanctuaries has been won, but it was not without its casualties. Rogue supercharged sorcerers from the battle of Roarhaven are running loose. Following Valkyrie's becoming of Darquesse, Skulduggery Pleasant must use any and all means to track down and stop Darquesse and hopefully free Valkyrie before she turns the world into a charred, lifeless cinder. And so he draws together a team of soldiers, monster hunters, killers, criminals, and Valkyrie's own murderous and sentient reflection.\n\n==Second series novels==\n\n===''Resurrection''===\n{{main|Skulduggery Pleasant: Resurrection}}\nA lot has changed. Roarhaven is now a magical city, where sorcerers can live openly. Valkyrie Cain has been out of action for years, recovering from the war against her alter-ego Darquesse, which nearly destroyed her and everyone else. Some things never change, though: bad people still want to do bad things, and Skulduggery Pleasant is still there to stop them. When Skulduggery learns of a plot to resurrect a terrifying evil, he persuades Valkyrie to join him for just 24 hours. But they need someone else on their team, someone inconspicuous, someone who can go undercover: Omen Darkly, a student at the new Corrival Academy, a school for the magically gifted.\n\n===''Midnight''===\n\nValkyrie has struggled to keep her family safe ever since she became a sorcerer, while she battled alongside Skulduggery and returned victorious every time. However, a killer kidnaps Alice, her little sister, to force Valkyrie into a final battle. Valkyrie is joined by Skulduggery and Omen Darkly, to find Alice within twelve hours, before it's too late.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/l/derek-landy/midnight.htm|title=Synopsis of Midnight|work=FantasticFiction.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Bedlam''===\n\nReeling from the aftermath of Alice's kidnapping, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have their hands full with new violent visions of the future, while Valkyrie works tirelessly to find her sister's soul, conspiracies in the American government, and tracking down old enemies while facing newer, greater threats than ever. With the King of the Darklands on the rise, and the Anti-sanctuary moving into their endgame, it will take Valkyrie, Skulduggery, the Darkly brothers, and all the allies they can muster to face what lies in store. If new secrets and revelations don't tear them apart first.\n\n===''Seasons of War''===\nWar is coming. To avert catastrophe, Skulduggery and Valkyrie are sent on a secret mission that takes them away from everything they know, to a forsaken land of magic and grim, unrelenting terror. It is here that Valkyrie will have to fight the hardest \u2014 not only against the enemies who want her dead, but also against her own self-destructive impulses. It's only by crawling through darkness that she'll be able to once again stand in the light... Set from spring to summer, Seasons of War takes place over 7 months, and in another dimension. Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Tanith, Dexter, Saracen and Nefarian Serpine from Dimension X find that Mevolent's dimension is overrun by zombie like people who have been infected by a disease and are called Draugar.\n\n''Seasons of War'' released on 2 April 2020, and is be the first novel in the final trilogy of the second series.<ref name=\"seasons-of-war-waterstones\">{{cite web|url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/seasons-of-war/derek-landy/9780008386238|website=Waterstones|title=Seasons of War by Derek Landy}}</ref><ref name=\"Seasons of War\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DerekLandy/status/1189890476767371264|title=Derek Landy on Twitter: \"#Skulduggery13|first=Derek|last=Landy|date=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DerekLandy/status/1198171319952650241|title=Nope!

It was released on 28 March 2013 in the U.K & Ireland and 1 April in some other countries.\nThe novella follows Tanith Low and Billy-Ray Sanguine as they form a team of villains, outcasts and monsters in order to collect the God-killer weapons, so that they may never be used against Darquesse, whilst Dexter Vex has recruited a team to collect the weapons with the exact opposite in mind: he wants to stockpile the weapons in order to be used against Darquesse.

Many critics praised [[Derek Landy]]'s way of writing due to his large gallery of [[List of characters in Skulduggery Pleasant|characters]].\n* Phillip Ardagh ([[The Guardian]]):\n: ''It's exciting, pacy, nicely handled and it's fun. There's nothing worthy about it, and it's all the better for that. And, I might add, it's self-contained. Landy may well revisit these characters \u2013 I sincerely hope he does \u2013 but it's a pleasingly rounded tale, which is refreshing in these days of endless open-ended books of never-ending series.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/childrenandteens/0,,2051807,00.html|title=Review at The Guardian | location=London | first=Philip|last=Ardagh|date=7 April 2007}}</ref>\n* Nathan Nicholls ([[Whitby Gazette]]):\n: ''There is no expense spared by Landy in this book and I would have to say that everyone who could be bothered to read it, would definitely be drawn into it and certainly enjoy it.

When Stephanie's uncle dies, she discovers his horror stories weren't fiction, and that evil forces are after her for a mysterious key.
