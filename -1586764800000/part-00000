Packaging also refers to the process of designing, evaluating, and producing packages. Packaging can be described as a coordinated system of preparing goods for transport, warehousing, [[logistics]], sale, and end use. Packaging contains, protects, preserves, transports, informs, and sells.<ref>Soroka (2002) ''Fundamentals of Packaging Technology'', Institute of Packaging Professionals {{ISBN|1-930268-25-4}}</ref> In many countries it is fully integrated into government, business, institutional, industrial, and personal use.\n\n'''Package labeling''' ([[American English]]) or '''labelling''' ([[British English]]) is any written, electronic, or [[graphic communication]] on the package or on a separate but associated [[label]].\n\n==History of packaging==\n\n===Ancient era===\n[[File:Ritual wine vessel - The Met.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Bronze wine container from the 9th century BCE.]]\nThe first packages used the natural materials available at the time: [[basket]]s of reeds, wineskins ([[bota bag]]s), [[wooden box]]es, pottery [[vase]]s, ceramic [[amphora]]e, wooden [[barrel]]s, woven bags, etc. Processed materials were used to form packages as they were developed: for example, early [[glass]] and [[bronze]] vessels.  The study of old packages is an important aspect of [[archaeology]].\n\nThe earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035, when a [[Persian people|Persian]] traveler visiting markets in [[Cairo]], [[History of Arab Egypt|Arab Egypt]], noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Origins of Paper Based Packaging|author=Diana Twede|journal=Conference on Historical Analysis & Research in Marketing Proceedings|volume=12|year=2005|pages=288\u2013300 [289]|url=http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2012%202005/288%20twede.pdf|accessdate=March 20, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716105826/http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2012%202005/288%20twede.pdf|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n\n====Tinning====\nThe use of [[tinning|tinplate]] for packaging dates back to the 18th century. The manufacturing of tinplate was the [[monopoly]] of [[Bohemia]] for a long time; in 1667 [[Andrew Yarranton]], an English [[engineer]], and [[Ambrose Crowley]] brought the method to England where it was improved by ironmasters including [[Philip Foley]].<ref>{{Citation|first=P.J.|last=Brown|title=Andrew Yarranton and the British tinplate industry|periodical=Historical Metallurgy|volume=22|year=1988|pages=42\u201348|issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|first=P.W.|last=King|title=Wolverley Lower Mill and the beginnings of the tinplate industry|periodical=Historical Metallurgy|volume=22|year=1988|pages=104\u2013113|issue=2}}</ref> By 1697, [[John Hanbury (1664\u20131734)|John Hanbury]]<ref>{{Harvnb|King|1988|p= 109}}</ref> had a rolling mill at [[Pontypool]] for making \"Pontypoole Plates\".<ref>H.R.

He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, [[Bryan Donkin]] and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned goods for the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAA5M2eIWqwC|title=People and Industries|author=William H.

The first [[corrugated box]] was produced commercially in 1817 in England. [[Corrugated paper|Corrugated (also called pleated) paper]] received a British patent in 1856 and was used as a liner for tall hats. Scottish-born [[Robert Gair]] invented the pre-cut [[paperboard]] box in 1890\u2014flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about as a result of an accident: as a [[Brooklyn]] printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, normally used to crease bags, shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cartons, crates and corrugated board: handbook of paper and wood packaging technology|author1=Diana Twede  |author2=Susan E.M.

These innovations increased processing efficiency and improved [[food safety]].  As additional materials such as [[aluminium|aluminum]] and several [[List of synthetic polymers|types of plastic]] were developed, they were incorporated into packages to improve performance and functionality.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brody|first=A.

Post-consumer recycling of aluminum and paper-based products has been economical for many years:  since the 1980s, post-consumer recycling has increased due to [[curbside recycling]], consumer awareness, and regulatory pressure.\n\n[[File:First polythene pillbox.JPG|thumb|right|170x170px|A pill box made from [[polyethylene]] in 1936.]]\nMany prominent innovations in the packaging industry were developed first for military use.  Some military supplies are packaged in the same commercial packaging used for general industry. Other military packaging must transport [[materiel]], supplies, foods, etc. under severe distribution and storage conditions. Packaging problems encountered in [[World War II]] led to [[United States Military Standard|Military Standard]] or \"mil spec\" regulations being applied to packaging, which was then designated \"military specification packaging\". As a prominent concept in the military, mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941, due to [[Iceland in World War II|operations in Iceland]] experiencing critical losses, ultimately attributed to bad packaging. In most cases, mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier materials, [[field ration]]s, [[antistatic bag]]s, and various [[shipping crate]]s) are similar to commercial grade packaging materials, but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maloney|first=J.C.|title=The History and Significance of Military Packaging|work=Defence Packaging Policy Group|publisher=Defence Logistics Agency|date=July 2003|url=http://www.dla.mil/Portals/104/Documents/LandAndMaritime/V/VS/Packaging/LM_pkghistory_151007.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2003}}, the packaging sector accounted for about two percent of the [[gross national product]] in [[developed countries]].

[[Permeation]] is a critical factor in design. Some packages contain [[desiccant]]s or [[oxygen absorber]]s to help extend shelf life. [[Modified atmosphere]]s<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first= Ki-Eun |author2=Kim |author3=An |author4=Lyu |author5=Lee |year=1998 |title=Effectiveness of modified atmosphere packaging in preserving a prepared ready-to-eat food|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=21 |issue=7 |page= 417|doi=10.1002/pts.821 }}</ref> or controlled atmospheres are also maintained in some food packages.

A barrier is also implemented in cases where segregation of two materials prior to end use is required, as in the case of special paints, glues, medical fluids, etc.\n* '''Containment or agglomeration''' \u2013 Small objects are typically grouped together in one package for reasons of storage and selling efficiency. For example, a single box of 1000 marbles requires less physical handling than 1000 single marbles. [[Liquid]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], and [[granular material]]s need containment.\n* '''Information transmission''' \u2013 Packages and [[label]]s communicate how to use, transport, [[recycling|recycle]], or dispose of the package or product. With [[Medication|pharmaceutical]]s, [[food]], [[medicine|medical]], and [[chemical substance|chemical]] products, some types of information are [[Mandatory labelling|required]] by government legislation. Some packages and labels also are used for [[track and trace]] purposes. Most items include their [[Serial number|serial]] and [[lot number]]s on the packaging, and in the case of food products, medicine, and some chemicals the packaging often contains an [[Shelf life|expiry/best-before date]], usually in a shorthand form. Packages may indicate their construction material with a symbol.\n* '''Marketing''' \u2013 Packaging and [[label]]s can be used by [[marketing|marketers]] to encourage potential buyers to purchase a product. Package [[graphic design]] and physical design have been important and constantly evolving phenomena for several decades. [[Marketing communications]] and [[graphic design]] are applied to the surface of the package and often to the [[point of sale display]]. Most packaging is designed to reflect the brand's message and identity on the one hand while highlighting the respective product concept on the other hand.\n[[File:Dual number tab on a tamper evident label.jpg|thumb|Permanent, tamper evident voiding label with a dual number tab to help keep packaging secure with the additional benefit of being able to track and trace parcels and packages]]\n[[File:Shampoo packet, single-serving.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A single-serving shampoo [[Sachet (package)|packet]]]]\n* '''Security''' \u2013 Packaging can play an important role in reducing the [[security]] risks of shipment.

Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of [[package pilferage]] or the theft and resale of products: Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. [[Counterfeit consumer goods]], unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include [[authentication]] seals and use [[security printing]] to help indicate that the package and contents are not [[counterfeit]]. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags, or [[electronic article surveillance]]<ref>[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/anti-shoplifting-device.htm How Anti-shoplifting Devices Work\u201d], HowStuffWorks.com</ref> tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. Using packaging in this way is a means of [[retail loss prevention]].\n* '''Convenience''' \u2013 Packages can have features that add [[convenience]] in distribution, handling, stacking, display, sale, opening, reclosing, using, dispensing, reusing, recycling, and ease of [[Waste disposal|disposal]]\n* '''Portion control''' \u2013 Single serving or single [[drug delivery|dosage]] packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage. Bulk commodities (such as salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households. It also aids the control of inventory: selling sealed one-liter bottles of milk, rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves.\n* '''Branding/Positioning''' \u2013 Packaging and labels are increasingly used to go beyond marketing to brand positioning, with the materials used and design chosen key to the storytelling element of brand development. Due to the increasingly fragmented media landscape in the digital age this aspect of packaging is of growing importance.\n\n==Packaging types==\n[[File:Food packages (1).jpg|right|thumb|Various types of household packaging for foods]]\nPackaging may be of several different types. For example, a ''transport package'' or ''distribution package'' can be the [[shipping container]] used to ship, store, and handle the product or inner packages.  Some identify a ''consumer package'' as one which is directed toward a consumer or household.\n\nPackaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged: [[medical device]] packaging, bulk [[chemical substance|chemical]] packaging, [[over-the-counter drug]] packaging, retail [[food]] packaging, military [[materiel]] packaging, [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] packaging, etc.\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function: ''primary'', ''secondary'', etc.\n*Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents.\n*Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging, and may be used to prevent pilferage or to group primary packages together.\n*Tertiary or transit packaging is used for [[logistics|bulk handling]], [[warehouse]] storage and [[transport]] shipping. The most common form is a [[pallet]]ized [[unit load]] that packs tightly into [[containerization|container]]s.\n\nThese broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary.  For example, depending on the use, a [[shrink wrap]] can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product, secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages, or tertiary packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution, such as to affix a number of cartons on a pallet.\n\nPackaging can also  have categories based on  the package form.  For example, ''thermoform packaging'' and ''flexible packaging'' describe broad usage areas.\n\n==Labels and symbols used on packages==\n{{main|List of food labeling regulations}}\n[[File:HK food drink Longevity brand Sweetened Milk Mar-2014 barcode a.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[bar code]] on a tin of condensed milk]]\nMany types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized.  For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications (such as the [[FCC Declaration of Conformity|FCC]] and [[T\u00dcV]] marks), [[trademark]]s, [[proof of purchase]], etc.  Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety, for example the [[CE marking]] or the [[estimated sign]] that notes conformance to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations. Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the [[recycling symbol]], the [[Recycling codes|recycling code]] (which could be a [[resin identification code]]), and the [[Green Dot (symbol)|\"Green Dot\"]]. Food packaging may show [[Food contact materials|food contact material]] symbols. In the [[European Union]], products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard, oval-shaped [[EC identification and health marks]] for food safety and quality insurance reasons.\n\n[[Barcode|Bar codes]], [[Universal Product Code]]s, and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels are common to allow automated information management in [[logistics]] and [[retailing]]. [[Country-of-origin]] labeling is often used. Some products might use [[QR code]]s or similar [[matrix barcode]]s. Packaging may have visible [[Printing registration|registration marks]] and other printing calibration and troubleshooting cues.\n\n===Consumer package contents===\nSeveral aspects of  consumer package labeling are subject to regulation.  One of the most important is to accurately state the quantity (weight, volume, count) of the package contents.  Consumers expect that the label accurately reflects the actual contents.  Manufacturers and packagers must have effective [[quality assurance]] procedures and accurate equipment; even so, there is inherent variability in all [[Process capability|processes]]. \n\nRegulations attempt to handle both sides of this.  In the USA, the [[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act]] provides requirements for many types of products.  Also, [[NIST]] has  Handbook 133, Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title = Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods, Handbook 133 - 2020\n  | publisher =US National Institute of Science and Technology\n| year =2020\n  | url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/handbook-133-2020-current-version\n  | accessdate = 8 April 2020\n}}</ref>  This is  a procedural guide for compliance testing of net contents and is referenced by several other regulatory agencies.<ref> {{cite journal\n | last =Hines\n | first =A\n | title = WEIGHING YOUR OPTIONS WITH NIST HANDBOOK 133\n | journal =Food Safety Net Services News\n | date = February 18, 2019\n | url = https://www.businesscompanion.info/en/quick-guides/weights-and-measures/packaged-goods-average-quantity\n | accessdate =8 April 2020\n}}</ref>\n\nOther regions and countries have their own regulatory requirements.  For example, the UK has its Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations<ref> {{citation\n | title = The Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations 2006\n | publisher =UK Statutory Instruments, 2006\u00a0No. 659\n | date =2006\n | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/659/contents/made\n | accessdate =8 April 2020\n}}</ref> as well as several [[United Kingdom food labelling regulations|other regulations]].\n\n===Shipping container labeling===\n[[File:Print n apply ucc.jpg|left|thumb|UCC Application|\"Print & Apply\" corner wrap UCC ([[GS1-128]]) label application to a pallet load]]\nTechnologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, [[bar codes]], and electronic data interchange ([[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]).  These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel.  Each has an essential function: identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.\n\nElements of these core technologies include [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] and [[GS1|EAN]] item identification codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated [[GS1-128]]) bar code [[Barcode symbology|symbologies]], and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.\n\nSmall parcel carriers often have their own formats.  For example, [[United Parcel Service]] has a [[MaxiCode]] 2-D code for parcel tracking.\n\n[[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used.  A [[Wal-Mart]] division, [[Sam's Club]], has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers to comply.<ref>{{cite news |first=Beth |last=Bacheldor |title=Sam's Club Tells Suppliers to Tag or Pay |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/3845/1/1/ |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nShipments of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] or [[dangerous goods]] have special information and symbols (labels, placards, etc.) as required by UN, country, and specific carrier requirements. On transport packages, standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs. Some are defined in the [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D5445 \"Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods\" and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 780 \"Pictorial marking for handling of goods\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Dangclass3.png|Flammable liquid\nFile:Dangclass1.svg|Explosives\nImage:Thiswayup.svg|This way up\nFile:Fragile symbol.gif|Fragile material\nImage:Keepdry.svg|Keep away from [[water]]\n</gallery>{{further|List of symbols#Consumer_symbols}}\n\n==Package development considerations==\nPackage design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the [[new product development]] process.  Alternatively, development of a package (or component) can be a separate process, but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged.\nPackage design starts with the identification of all the requirements: structural design, [[marketing]], [[shelf life]], [[quality assurance]], [[logistics]], legal, regulatory, [[graphic design]], end-use, environmental, etc. The design criteria, performance (specified by [[package testing]]),  completion time targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon.  Package design processes often employ [[rapid prototyping]], [[computer-aided design]], [[computer-aided manufacturing]]  and [[document automation]].\n\n[[File:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Transport packaging needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]\n\nAn example of how package design is affected by other factors is its relationship to [[logistics]].  When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized [[unit load]]s, the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs, such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame.  A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another.\n\nWith some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the packaging.  For example, any package components that may contact [[food]]s are designated [[food contact materials]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Sotomayor\n  | first = R.E.\n  | last2 = Arvidson, Kirk, Mayer, McDougal, Sheu\n  | title = Regulatory Report, Assessing the Safety of Food Contact Substances\n  | journal = Food Safety\n   | year =2007 \n  | url = https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodContactSubstancesFCS/ucm064166.htm#authors}}</ref>\n[[Toxicologist]]s and [[food scientist]]s need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations. [[Packaging engineer]]s need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended [[shelf life]] with normal usage.  Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be [[Verification and validation|validated]] to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being of the consumer in mind.\n\nSometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory.  For example, regulations for an [[over-the-counter drug]] might require the package to be [[tamper-evident]] and [[Child-resistant packaging|child resistant]]:<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Rodgers\n  | first = G.B.\n  | title = The safety effects of child-resistant packaging for oral prescription drugs.

Packaging should be used only where needed. Proper packaging can also help prevent waste. Packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged product (contents). Usually, the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package. A vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use: if the product is damaged or degraded, its entire energy and material content may be lost.\n*Minimization (also \"source reduction\") \u2013 The mass and volume of packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as criteria for minimizing the package in the design process. Usually \u201creduced\u201d packaging also helps minimize costs.

Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package: steel, aluminum, papers, plastics, etc. Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations. Packages can sometimes be designed to separate components to better facilitate recycling.\n*[[Energy recovery]] \u2013 [[Waste-to-energy]] and [[Refuse-derived fuel]] in approved facilities make use of the heat available from incinerating the packaging components.\n*Disposal \u2013 [[Incineration]], and placement in a sanitary [[landfill]] are undertaken for some materials.

Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags, or [[electronic article surveillance]]<ref>[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/anti-shoplifting-device.htm How Anti-shoplifting Devices Work\u201d], HowStuffWorks.com</ref> tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. Using packaging in this way is a means of [[retail loss prevention]].\n* '''Convenience''' \u2013 Packages can have features that add [[convenience]] in distribution, handling, stacking, display, sale, opening, reclosing, using, dispensing, reusing, recycling, and ease of [[Waste disposal|disposal]]\n* '''Portion control''' \u2013 Single serving or single [[drug delivery|dosage]] packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage. Bulk commodities (such as salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households. It also aids the control of inventory: selling sealed one-liter bottles of milk, rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves.\n* '''Branding/Positioning''' \u2013 Packaging and labels are increasingly used to go beyond marketing to brand positioning, with the materials used and design chosen key to the storytelling element of brand development. Due to the increasingly fragmented media landscape in the digital age this aspect of packaging is of growing importance.\n\n==Packaging types==\n[[File:Food packages (1).jpg|right|thumb|Various types of household packaging for foods]]\nPackaging may be of several different types. For example, a ''transport package'' or ''distribution package'' can be the [[shipping container]] used to ship, store, and handle the product or inner packages.  Some identify a ''consumer package'' as one which is directed toward a consumer or household.\n\nPackaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged: [[medical device]] packaging, bulk [[chemical substance|chemical]] packaging, [[over-the-counter drug]] packaging, retail [[food]] packaging, military [[materiel]] packaging, [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] packaging, etc.\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function: ''primary'', ''secondary'', etc.\n*Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents.\n*Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging, and may be used to prevent pilferage or to group primary packages together.\n*Tertiary or transit packaging is used for [[logistics|bulk handling]], [[warehouse]] storage and [[transport]] shipping. The most common form is a [[pallet]]ized [[unit load]] that packs tightly into [[containerization|container]]s.\n\nThese broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary.  For example, depending on the use, a [[shrink wrap]] can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product, secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages, or tertiary packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution, such as to affix a number of cartons on a pallet.\n\nPackaging can also  have categories based on  the package form.  For example, ''thermoform packaging'' and ''flexible packaging'' describe broad usage areas.\n\n==Labels and symbols used on packages==\n{{main|List of food labeling regulations}}\n[[File:HK food drink Longevity brand Sweetened Milk Mar-2014 barcode a.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[bar code]] on a tin of condensed milk]]\nMany types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized.  For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications (such as the [[FCC Declaration of Conformity|FCC]] and [[T\u00dcV]] marks), [[trademark]]s, [[proof of purchase]], etc.  Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety, for example the [[CE marking]] or the [[estimated sign]] that notes conformance to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations. Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the [[recycling symbol]], the [[Recycling codes|recycling code]] (which could be a [[resin identification code]]), and the [[Green Dot (symbol)|\"Green Dot\"]]. Food packaging may show [[Food contact materials|food contact material]] symbols. In the [[European Union]], products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard, oval-shaped [[EC identification and health marks]] for food safety and quality insurance reasons.\n\n[[Barcode|Bar codes]], [[Universal Product Code]]s, and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels are common to allow automated information management in [[logistics]] and [[retailing]]. [[Country-of-origin]] labeling is often used. Some products might use [[QR code]]s or similar [[matrix barcode]]s. Packaging may have visible [[Printing registration|registration marks]] and other printing calibration and troubleshooting cues.\n\n===Consumer package contents===\nSeveral aspects of  consumer package labeling are subject to regulation.  One of the most important is to accurately state the quantity (weight, volume, count) of the package contents.  Consumers expect that the label accurately reflects the actual contents.  Manufacturers and packagers must have effective [[quality assurance]] procedures and accurate equipment; even so, there is inherent variability in all [[Process capability|processes]]. \n\nRegulations attempt to handle both sides of this.  In the USA, the [[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act]] provides requirements for many types of products.  Also, [[NIST]] has  Handbook 133, Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title = Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods, Handbook 133 - 2020\n  | publisher =US National Institute of Science and Technology\n| year =2020\n  | url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/handbook-133-2020-current-version\n  | accessdate = 8 April 2020\n}}</ref>  This is  a procedural guide for compliance testing of net contents and is referenced by several other regulatory agencies.<ref> {{cite journal\n | last =Hines\n | first =A\n | title = WEIGHING YOUR OPTIONS WITH NIST HANDBOOK 133\n | journal =Food Safety Net Services News\n | date = February 18, 2019\n | url = https://www.businesscompanion.info/en/quick-guides/weights-and-measures/packaged-goods-average-quantity\n | accessdate =8 April 2020\n}}</ref>\n\nOther regions and countries have their own regulatory requirements.  For example, the UK has its Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations<ref> {{citation\n | title = The Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations 2006\n | publisher =UK Statutory Instruments, 2006\u00a0No. 659\n | date =2006\n | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/659/contents/made\n | accessdate =8 April 2020\n}}</ref> as well as several [[United Kingdom food labelling regulations|other regulations]].\n\n===Shipping container labeling===\n[[File:Print n apply ucc.jpg|left|thumb|UCC Application|\"Print & Apply\" corner wrap UCC ([[GS1-128]]) label application to a pallet load]]\nTechnologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, [[bar codes]], and electronic data interchange ([[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]).  These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel.  Each has an essential function: identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.\n\nElements of these core technologies include [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] and [[GS1|EAN]] item identification codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated [[GS1-128]]) bar code [[Barcode symbology|symbologies]], and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.\n\nSmall parcel carriers often have their own formats.  For example, [[United Parcel Service]] has a [[MaxiCode]] 2-D code for parcel tracking.\n\n[[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used.  A [[Wal-Mart]] division, [[Sam's Club]], has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers to comply.<ref>{{cite news |first=Beth |last=Bacheldor |title=Sam's Club Tells Suppliers to Tag or Pay |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/3845/1/1/ |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nShipments of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] or [[dangerous goods]] have special information and symbols (labels, placards, etc.) as required by UN, country, and specific carrier requirements. On transport packages, standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs. Some are defined in the [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D5445 \"Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods\" and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 780 \"Pictorial marking for handling of goods\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Dangclass3.png|Flammable liquid\nFile:Dangclass1.svg|Explosives\nImage:Thiswayup.svg|This way up\nFile:Fragile symbol.gif|Fragile material\nImage:Keepdry.svg|Keep away from [[water]]\n</gallery>{{further|List of symbols#Consumer_symbols}}\n\n==Package development considerations==\nPackage design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the [[new product development]] process.  Alternatively, development of a package (or component) can be a separate process, but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged.\nPackage design starts with the identification of all the requirements: structural design, [[marketing]], [[shelf life]], [[quality assurance]], [[logistics]], legal, regulatory, [[graphic design]], end-use, environmental, etc. The design criteria, performance (specified by [[package testing]]),  completion time targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon.  Package design processes often employ [[rapid prototyping]], [[computer-aided design]], [[computer-aided manufacturing]]  and [[document automation]].\n\n[[File:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Transport packaging needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]\n\nAn example of how package design is affected by other factors is its relationship to [[logistics]].  When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized [[unit load]]s, the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs, such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame.  A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another.\n\nWith some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the packaging.  For example, any package components that may contact [[food]]s are designated [[food contact materials]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Sotomayor\n  | first = R.E.\n  | last2 = Arvidson, Kirk, Mayer, McDougal, Sheu\n  | title = Regulatory Report, Assessing the Safety of Food Contact Substances\n  | journal = Food Safety\n   | year =2007 \n  | url = https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodContactSubstancesFCS/ucm064166.htm#authors}}</ref>\n[[Toxicologist]]s and [[food scientist]]s need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations. [[Packaging engineer]]s need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended [[shelf life]] with normal usage.  Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be [[Verification and validation|validated]] to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being of the consumer in mind.\n\nSometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory.  For example, regulations for an [[over-the-counter drug]] might require the package to be [[tamper-evident]] and [[Child-resistant packaging|child resistant]]:<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Rodgers\n  | first = G.B.\n  | title = The safety effects of child-resistant packaging for oral prescription drugs.

Meeting all goals is a challenge.\n\nPackage design may take place within a company or with various degrees of external [[packaging engineering]]: [[independent contractor]]s, [[consultant]]s, vendor evaluations, independent laboratories, contract packagers, total [[outsourcing]], etc.  Some sort of formal [[project planning]] and [[project management]] methodology is required for all but the simplest package design and development programs. An effective [[quality management]] system and [[Verification and Validation]] protocols are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all.\n\n===Environmental considerations===\n[[File:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|right|thumbnail|300px|The [[waste hierarchy]]]]\n{{main|Packaging waste|sustainable packaging}}\n\nPackage development involves considerations of [[sustainability]], environmental responsibility, and applicable [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[recycling]] regulations.

Packaging should be used only where needed. Proper packaging can also help prevent waste. Packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged product (contents). Usually, the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package. A vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use: if the product is damaged or degraded, its entire energy and material content may be lost.\n*Minimization (also \"source reduction\") \u2013 The mass and volume of packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as criteria for minimizing the package in the design process. Usually \u201creduced\u201d packaging also helps minimize costs. Packaging engineers continue to work toward reduced packaging.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_197233456.html |title=The Incredible Shrinking Package |accessdate=July 16, 2007 |last=DeRusha |first=Jason |date=July 16, 2007 |publisher=WCCO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717171902/http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_197233456.html |archivedate=July 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*Reuse \u2013 [[Reusable packaging]] is encouraged.<ref>{{Citation\n| title =Use Reusables: Fundamentals of Reusable Transport Packaging\n| publisher =US Environmental Protection Agency\n| year =2012\n| url =http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/smm/web-academy/2012/pdfs/smm812_Lehrer.pdf\n| accessdate =June 30, 2014\n| url-status =dead\n| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150114164418/http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/smm/web-academy/2012/pdfs/smm812_Lehrer.pdf\n| archivedate =January 14, 2015\n| df =mdy-all\n}}</ref>  Returnable packaging has long been useful (and economically viable) for closed loop logistics systems.

Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package: steel, aluminum, papers, plastics, etc. Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations. Packages can sometimes be designed to separate components to better facilitate recycling.\n*[[Energy recovery]] \u2013 [[Waste-to-energy]] and [[Refuse-derived fuel]] in approved facilities make use of the heat available from incinerating the packaging components.\n*Disposal \u2013 [[Incineration]], and placement in a sanitary [[landfill]] are undertaken for some materials.  Certain US states regulate packages for toxic contents, which have the potential to contaminate emissions and ash from incineration and [[leachate]] from landfill. Packages should not be [[litter]]ed.\n\nDevelopment of [[sustainable packaging]] is an area of considerable interest to [[standards organization]]s, governments, consumers, packagers, and retailers.\n\nSustainability is the fastest-growing driver for packaging development, particularly for packaging manufacturers that work with the world's leading brands, as their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) targets often exceed those of the EU Directive.\n\n==Packaging machinery==\n{{main|Packaging machinery}}\n[[File:Budweiser Plant.jpg|right|thumbnail|400px|Beer [[bottling line]]s]]\nChoosing packaging machinery includes an assessment of technical capabilities, labor requirements, worker safety, [[maintainability]], serviceability, [[reliability engineering|reliability]], ability to integrate into the packaging line, capital cost, floorspace, flexibility (change-over, materials, multiple products, etc.), energy requirements, [[Quality control|quality]] of outgoing packages, qualifications (for food, pharmaceuticals, etc.), throughput, efficiency, productivity, [[ergonomics]], [[return on investment]], etc.\n\nPackaging machinery can be:\n# purchased as standard, off-the-shelf equipment\n# purchased custom-made or custom-tailored to specific operations\n# manufactured or modified by in-house engineers and maintenance staff\n\nEfforts at packaging line [[automation]] increasingly use [[programmable logic controller]]s and [[robotics]].\n\nPackaging machines may be of the following general types:\n*Accumulating and collating machines\n* [[Blister pack]]s, [[skin pack]]s and vacuum packaging machines\n* [[Bottle cap]]s equipment, over-capping, lidding, closing, seaming and sealing machines\n* [[Box]], case, tray, and carrier forming, packing, unpacking, closing, and sealing machines\n* [[Cartoning machines]]\n* Cleaning, sterilizing, cooling and drying machines\n* Coding, printing, marking, stamping, and imprinting machines\n* [[Converting]] machines\n* [[Conveyor belt]]s, accumulating and related machines\n* Feeding, orienting, placing and related machines\n* [[Filler (packaging)|Filling machines]]: handling dry, powdered, solid, liquid, gas, or viscous products\n* [[Inspection|Inspecting]]: visual, sound, metal detecting, etc.\n* [[Label dispenser]]\n* Orienting, unscrambling machines\n* Package filling and closing machines\n* [[Pallet]]izing, depalletizing, [[unit load]] assembly\n* Product identification: [[label]]ing, marking, etc.\n* Sealing machines: [[heat sealer]] or glue units\n* [[Slitter|Slitting machines]]\n* Weighing machines: [[check weigher]], [[multihead weigher]]\n* Wrapping machines: stretch wrapping, [[shrink wrap]], banding\n* [[Vertical form fill sealing machine|Form, fill and seal machines]]\n* Other specialty machinery: [[slitter]]s, [[perforate|perforating]], [[laser]] cutters, parts attachment, etc.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nImage:SSF Costco bakery pastry packaging line.JPG|Bakery goods [[shrinkwrap]]ped by shrink film, [[heat sealer]] and [[heat tunnel]] on roller [[Lineshaft roller conveyor|conveyor]]\nImage:Auto Sorting Packages.jpg|High speed conveyor with stationary [[bar code scanner]] for sorting\nImage:4051 lpa.jpg|[[Label printer]] applicator applying a label to adjacent panels of a [[corrugated box]].\nImage:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|[[Robotics|Robots]] used to palletize bread\nImage:Stretch wrapping machine.jpg|Automatic stretch wrapping machine\nFile:Molding packaging from straw, k9837-1.jpg|Equipment used for making [[molded pulp]] components and molding packaging from [[straw]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Wood|first = Marcia|title = Leftover Straw Gets New Life|journal = Agricultural Research|date=April 2002|url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/apr02/straw0402.htm}}</ref>\nImage:Rotary Arm Freedom 6500.jpg|A semi-automatic [[rotary arm stretch wrapper]]\nFile:Jsc2008e038873 SFSL Lab Pack Room.jpg|Equipment for thermoforming packages at NASA\nFile:Pol Roger labelling line 2.jpg|Automated labeling line for wine bottles\nFile:Shrink-wrapping_machine_by_OCME_S.r.L.jpg|Shrink film wrap being applied on PET bottles\nFile:Laboratoires Arkopharma -

At that time only around 11% of adult males had the vote, very few of them in the industrial north which was worst hit, and reformers identified parliamentary reform as the solution. A mass campaign to petition parliament for manhood suffrage gained three-quarters of a million signatures in 1817 but was flatly rejected by the House of Commons.  When a second slump occurred in early 1819, radical reformers sought to mobilise huge crowds to force government to back down. The movement was particularly strong in the north-west of England, where the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a mass rally in August 1819 addressed by well-known radical orator [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]].\n\nShortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the [[Manchester and Salford Yeomanry]] to arrest Hunt and several others on the platform with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehended Hunt. Cheshire Magistrates chairman [[William Hulton]] then summoned the [[15th The King's Hussars|15th Hussars]] to disperse the crowd.

The fine weather almost certainly increased the size of the crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|p=119|ps=none}}\n\nThe Manchester magistrates met at 9:00&nbsp;am, to breakfast at the Star Inn on [[Deansgate]] and to consider what action they should take on Henry Hunt's arrival at the meeting. By 10:30&nbsp;am they had come to no conclusions, and moved to a house on the southeastern corner of St Peter's Field, from where they planned to observe the meeting.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=152\u2013153|ps=none}}\nThey were concerned that it would end in a riot, or even a rebellion, and had arranged for a substantial number of regular troops and militia [[yeomanry]] to be deployed. The military presence comprised 600&nbsp;men of the {{nowrap|[[15th Hussars]]}}; several hundred [[infantry]]men; a [[Royal Horse Artillery]] unit with two six-pounder guns; 400&nbsp;men of the [[Cheshire Yeomanry]]; 400&nbsp;[[special constable]]s; and 120&nbsp;cavalry of the [[Manchester and Salford Yeomanry]]. The Manchester & Salford Yeomanry were relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among local shopkeepers and tradesmen, the most numerous of which were [[publicans]].{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=88|ps=none}} Recently mocked by the ''Manchester Observer'' as \"generally speaking, the fawning dependents of the great, with a few fools and a greater proportion of coxcombs, who imagine they acquire considerable importance by wearing regimentals,{{sfnp|Bruton|1919|p=14|ps=none}} they were subsequently variously described as \"younger members of the Tory party in arms\",<ref name=\"Guardian 2007-08-13\"/> and as \"hot-headed young men, who had volunteered into that service from their intense hatred of Radicalism.\"{{sfnp|Prentice|1853|p=160|ps=none}} Socialist writer Mark Krantz has described them as \"the local business mafia on horseback\".{{sfnp|Krantz|2011|p=12|ps=none}} R J White described them as \"exclusively cheesemongers, ironmongers and newly enriched manufacturers, (who) the people of Manchester .. thought .. a joke.\"{{sfnp|White|1957|p=185|ps=none}}\n\nThe [[British Army]] in the north was under the overall command of [[John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford|General Sir John Byng]]. When he had initially learned that the meeting was scheduled for 2 August he wrote to the [[Home Office]] stating that he hoped the Manchester magistrates would show firmness on the day:\n\n{{quote|I will be prepared to go there, and will have in that neighbourhood, that is within an easy day's march, 8&nbsp;squadron of cavalry, 18&nbsp;companies of infantry and the guns.

I hope therefore the civil authorities will not be deterred from doing their duty.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=136|ps=none}}}}\n\nHe then excused himself from attendance, however, as the meeting on 9th clashed with the horse races at [[York]], a fashionable event at which Byng had entries in two races. He wrote to the Home Office, saying that although he would still be prepared to be in command in Manchester on the day of the meeting if it was thought really necessary, he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel [[Guy L'Estrange]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Riding|first=Jacqueline|title=Peterloo : the story of the Manchester massacre|publisher=Head of Zeus|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78669-583-3|location=[London]|pages=157-65, 203-5|oclc=1017592330}}</ref> The postponement to 16th August made it possible for Byng to attend after the races but he chose not to, having had enough of dealing with the Manchester magistrates.

Contingents were sent from all around the region, the largest and \"best dressed\" of which was a group of 10,000 who had travelled from Oldham Green, comprising people from [[Oldham]], [[Royton]] (which included a sizeable female section), [[Shaw and Crompton|Crompton]], [[Lees, Greater Manchester|Lees]], [[Saddleworth]] and [[Mossley]].{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|p=118|ps=none}} Other sizeable contingents marched from [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] and [[Rochdale]] (6,000 strong) and [[Stockport]] (1,500\u20135,000 strong).<ref name=\"MarlowP120-121\">Marlow (1969), pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref> [[Crowd size estimation|Reports of the size of the crowd]] at the meeting vary substantially.

A reasonably reliable count of the numbers on the various marches indicates a total of around 20,000 who came in from outside Manchester, but the number who attended informally from Manchester and Salford is much harder to estimate.

He beckoned me, and I went to him. He was one of my late employers. He took my hand, and rather concernedly, but kindly, said he hoped no harm was intended by all those people who were coming in. I said \"I would pledge my life for their entire peaceableness.\" I asked him to notice them, \"did they look like persons wishing to outrage the law? were they not, on the contrary, evidently heads of decent working families? or members of such families?\" \"No, no,\" I said, \"my dear sir, and old respected master, if any wrong or violence take place, they will be committed by men of a different stamp from these.\" He said he was very glad to hear me say so; he was happy he had seen me, and gratified by the manner in which I had expressed myself. I asked, did he think we should be interrupted at the meeting? he said he did not believe we should; \"then,\" I replied, \"all will be well\"; and shaking hands, with mutual good wishes, I left him, and took my station as before.{{sfnp|Bamford|1844|p=202|ps=none}}}}\n\nAlthough [[William Robert Hay]], chairman of the [[Salford Hundred]] [[Quarter Sessions]], claimed that \"The active part of the meeting may be said to have come in wholly from the country\",{{sfnp|Frangopulo|1977|p=33|ps=none}} others such as [[John Shuttleworth (industrialist)|John Shuttleworth]], a local cotton dealer, estimated that most were from Manchester, a view that would subsequently be supported by the casualty lists.

They formed two lines in the crowd a few yards apart, in an attempt to form a corridor through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two wagons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the wagons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=161|ps=none}}\n\nHunt's carriage arrived at the meeting shortly after 1:00&nbsp;pm, and he made his way to the hustings. Alongside Hunt on the speakers' stand were John Knight, a cotton manufacturer and reformer, Joseph Johnson, the organiser of the meeting, John Thacker Saxton, managing editor of the ''Manchester Observer'', the publisher [[Richard Carlile]], and George Swift, reformer and shoemaker. There were also a number of reporters, including John Tyas of ''The Times'', John Smith of the ''Liverpool Mercury'' and [[Edward Baines (1800\u20131890)|Edward Baines Jr]], the son of the editor of the ''Leeds Mercury.''{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=162\u2013163|ps=none}} By this time St Peter's Field, an area of {{convert|14000|sqyd|m2|-2}}, was packed with tens of thousands of men, women and children.

On being handed the warrant the Constable, Jonathan Andrews, offered his opinion that the press of the crowd surrounding the hustings would make military assistance necessary for its execution. Hulton then wrote two letters, one to Major [[Thomas de Trafford|Thomas Trafford]], the commanding officer of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry Cavalry, and the other to the overall military commander in Manchester, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange.

At that time only around 11% of adult males had the vote, very few of them in the industrial north which was worst hit, and reformers identified parliamentary reform as the solution. A mass campaign to petition parliament for manhood suffrage gained three-quarters of a million signatures in 1817 but was flatly rejected by the House of Commons.  When a second slump occurred in early 1819, radical reformers sought to mobilise huge crowds to force government to back down. The movement was particularly strong in the north-west of England, where the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a mass rally in August 1819 addressed by well-known radical orator [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]].\n\nShortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the [[Manchester and Salford Yeomanry]] to arrest Hunt and several others on the platform with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehended Hunt.

The ''Manchester Observer'' reported it was called \"to take into consideration the most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining Radical reform in the Common House of Parliament\" and \"to consider the propriety of the 'Unrepresented Inhabitants of Manchester' electing a person to represent them in Parliament\".

The fine weather almost certainly increased the size of the crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|p=119|ps=none}}\n\nThe Manchester magistrates met at 9:00&nbsp;am, to breakfast at the Star Inn on [[Deansgate]] and to consider what action they should take on Henry Hunt's arrival at the meeting. By 10:30&nbsp;am they had come to no conclusions, and moved to a house on the southeastern corner of St Peter's Field, from where they planned to observe the meeting.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=152\u2013153|ps=none}}\nThey were concerned that it would end in a riot, or even a rebellion, and had arranged for a substantial number of regular troops and militia [[yeomanry]] to be deployed. The military presence comprised 600&nbsp;men of the {{nowrap|[[15th Hussars]]}}; several hundred [[infantry]]men; a [[Royal Horse Artillery]] unit with two six-pounder guns; 400&nbsp;men of the [[Cheshire Yeomanry]]; 400&nbsp;[[special constable]]s; and 120&nbsp;cavalry of the [[Manchester and Salford Yeomanry]]. The Manchester & Salford Yeomanry were relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among local shopkeepers and tradesmen, the most numerous of which were [[publicans]].{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=88|ps=none}} Recently mocked by the ''Manchester Observer'' as \"generally speaking, the fawning dependents of the great, with a few fools and a greater proportion of coxcombs, who imagine they acquire considerable importance by wearing regimentals,{{sfnp|Bruton|1919|p=14|ps=none}} they were subsequently variously described as \"younger members of the Tory party in arms\",<ref name=\"Guardian 2007-08-13\"/> and as \"hot-headed young men, who had volunteered into that service from their intense hatred of Radicalism.\"{{sfnp|Prentice|1853|p=160|ps=none}} Socialist writer Mark Krantz has described them as \"the local business mafia on horseback\".{{sfnp|Krantz|2011|p=12|ps=none}} R J White described them as \"exclusively cheesemongers, ironmongers and newly enriched manufacturers, (who) the people of Manchester .. thought .. a joke.\"{{sfnp|White|1957|p=185|ps=none}}\n\nThe [[British Army]] in the north was under the overall command of [[John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford|General Sir John Byng]]. When he had initially learned that the meeting was scheduled for 2 August he wrote to the [[Home Office]] stating that he hoped the Manchester magistrates would show firmness on the day:\n\n{{quote|I will be prepared to go there, and will have in that neighbourhood, that is within an easy day's march, 8&nbsp;squadron of cavalry, 18&nbsp;companies of infantry and the guns.

I hope therefore the civil authorities will not be deterred from doing their duty.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=136|ps=none}}}}\n\nHe then excused himself from attendance, however, as the meeting on 9th clashed with the horse races at [[York]], a fashionable event at which Byng had entries in two races. He wrote to the Home Office, saying that although he would still be prepared to be in command in Manchester on the day of the meeting if it was thought really necessary, he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel [[Guy L'Estrange]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Riding|first=Jacqueline|title=Peterloo : the story of the Manchester massacre|publisher=Head of Zeus|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78669-583-3|location=[London]|pages=157-65, 203-5|oclc=1017592330}}</ref> The postponement to 16th August made it possible for Byng to attend after the races but he chose not to, having had enough of dealing with the Manchester magistrates.

Contingents were sent from all around the region, the largest and \"best dressed\" of which was a group of 10,000 who had travelled from Oldham Green, comprising people from [[Oldham]], [[Royton]] (which included a sizeable female section), [[Shaw and Crompton|Crompton]], [[Lees, Greater Manchester|Lees]], [[Saddleworth]] and [[Mossley]].{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|p=118|ps=none}} Other sizeable contingents marched from [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] and [[Rochdale]] (6,000 strong) and [[Stockport]] (1,500\u20135,000 strong).<ref name=\"MarlowP120-121\">Marlow (1969), pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref> [[Crowd size estimation|Reports of the size of the crowd]] at the meeting vary substantially.

A reasonably reliable count of the numbers on the various marches indicates a total of around 20,000 who came in from outside Manchester, but the number who attended informally from Manchester and Salford is much harder to estimate.

He beckoned me, and I went to him. He was one of my late employers. He took my hand, and rather concernedly, but kindly, said he hoped no harm was intended by all those people who were coming in. I said \"I would pledge my life for their entire peaceableness.\" I asked him to notice them, \"did they look like persons wishing to outrage the law? were they not, on the contrary, evidently heads of decent working families? or members of such families?\" \"No, no,\" I said, \"my dear sir, and old respected master, if any wrong or violence take place, they will be committed by men of a different stamp from these.\" He said he was very glad to hear me say so; he was happy he had seen me, and gratified by the manner in which I had expressed myself. I asked, did he think we should be interrupted at the meeting? he said he did not believe we should; \"then,\" I replied, \"all will be well\"; and shaking hands, with mutual good wishes, I left him, and took my station as before.{{sfnp|Bamford|1844|p=202|ps=none}}}}\n\nAlthough [[William Robert Hay]], chairman of the [[Salford Hundred]] [[Quarter Sessions]], claimed that \"The active part of the meeting may be said to have come in wholly from the country\",{{sfnp|Frangopulo|1977|p=33|ps=none}} others such as [[John Shuttleworth (industrialist)|John Shuttleworth]], a local cotton dealer, estimated that most were from Manchester, a view that would subsequently be supported by the casualty lists.

They formed two lines in the crowd a few yards apart, in an attempt to form a corridor through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two wagons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the wagons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=161|ps=none}}\n\nHunt's carriage arrived at the meeting shortly after 1:00&nbsp;pm, and he made his way to the hustings. Alongside Hunt on the speakers' stand were John Knight, a cotton manufacturer and reformer, Joseph Johnson, the organiser of the meeting, John Thacker Saxton, managing editor of the ''Manchester Observer'', the publisher [[Richard Carlile]], and George Swift, reformer and shoemaker. There were also a number of reporters, including John Tyas of ''The Times'', John Smith of the ''Liverpool Mercury'' and [[Edward Baines (1800\u20131890)|Edward Baines Jr]], the son of the editor of the ''Leeds Mercury.''{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=162\u2013163|ps=none}} By this time St Peter's Field, an area of {{convert|14000|sqyd|m2|-2}}, was packed with tens of thousands of men, women and children.

On being handed the warrant the Constable, Jonathan Andrews, offered his opinion that the press of the crowd surrounding the hustings would make military assistance necessary for its execution. Hulton then wrote two letters, one to Major [[Thomas de Trafford|Thomas Trafford]], the commanding officer of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry Cavalry, and the other to the overall military commander in Manchester, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange.

Those involved in the movement were called '''''patarini'''''  (singular ''patarino''), '''patarines''' or '''patarenes''', a word chosen by their opponents, the etymology of which is unclear. The movement, associated with urban unrest in the city of Milan, is generally considered to have begun in 1057 and ended in 1075.\n\n==History==\nEarly in the year 1057, a preacher named [[Arialdo|Ariald]] arrived in the city of Milan and began to preach against the Milanese clerics' custom of marrying.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Pataria : lotte religiose e sociali nella Milano dell'11. secolo|date=1998|publisher=Europia|others=Golinelli, Paolo.|isbn=88-16-77105-4|location=[Novara]|oclc=883745329}}, p. 13: \"Inizia, tra la fine del 1056 e i primi del 1057, la Pataria milanese</ref> It is possible that he took advantage of the absence at this time of the Archbishop of Milan, [[Guido da Velate|Guido]], who was in Germany in August at the Council of Tribur.\n\nThe Milanese clergy grew concerned by Ariald's attempt to whip up the city against them, and sent envoys to [[Pope Stephen IX]] in Rome. On hearing this, Ariald travelled to Rome himself. Pope Stephen IX was sympathetic to Ariald's position, and sent two envoys to Milan, [[Pope Gregory VII|Hildebrand]] (later Pope Gregory VII) and [[Pope Alexander II|Anselm of Baggio]] (later Pope Alexander II). Ariald also returned to Milan, and now began to criticise the Milanese clerics' practice of simony, resulting in urban unrest. Ariald's close associate Landulf Cotta was attacked, and later died from his injuries.\n\nIn 1059 Ariald travelled to Rome again to seek advice; Pope Stephen IX again sent envoys to Milan, this time [[Peter Damian]] and again Anselm of Baggio, but this did nothing to quell the unrest in the city. In 1063, Landulf Cotta's brother [[Erlembald]] went to Rome where he obtained a papal banner from the newly elected Pope Alexander II in support of the Pataria movement. In 1066, Pope Alexander II finally excommunicated Archbishop Guido. Guido used this excommunication however to whip up the citizens' anger against the Paterenes at a public meeting, and Ariald was first chased out of the city of Milan, and then assassinated, in June 1066.\n\nHowever, when Ariald's body was found in May 1067, it quickly became the object of a cult, and popular opinion in Milan swung back behind the Pataria.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Pataria : lotte religiose e sociali nella Milano dell'11. secolo|date=1998|publisher=Europia|others=Golinelli, Paolo.|isbn=88-16-77105-4|location=[Novara]|oclc=883745329}}, p. 18</ref> Archbishop Guido was forced out of the city, leaving it under the control of Erlembald, and Alexander II formally proclaimed Ariald to be a saint in 1068.\n\nArchbishop Guido resigned in 1068, in favour of his associate [[Gotofredo da Castiglione]], who was also supported by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV.]]  The papacy and the Pataria however supported a different candidate as archbishop, [[Atto (archbishop of Milan)|Attone]], and Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Gotofredo in 1074.\n\nRioting in Milan led to the murder of Erlembald in 1075, and after this point the Pataria movement lost much of its energy. The controversy over the appointment of the archbishop of Milan continued, however, and contributed to the political tensions between Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII.\n\n== Medieval historiography ==\nThere are several contemporary and nearly-contemporary sources for the Pataria, each of which offers different and sometimes contradictory perspectives.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Pataria : lotte religiose e sociali nella Milano dell'11. secolo|date=1998|publisher=Europia|others=Golinelli, Paolo.|isbn=88-16-77105-4|location=[Novara]|oclc=883745329}}, pp. 23-34</ref> These include:\n\n*Andrew of Strumi's ''Life of Saint Ariald''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dmgh.de/mgh_ss_30_2/index.htm#page/1047/mode/1up|title=Latin edition in the MGH|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n*[[Bonizo of Sutri]]'s ''Liber ad amicum''\n*[[Arnulf of Milan]]'s ''Deeds of the Archbishops of Milan''\n*[[Landulf of Milan|Landulf Senior]]'s ''History of Milan''\n\n== Modern historiography ==\nAs Paolo Golinelli has emphasised, modern debates about the Pataria have often centred on whether the Pataria was primarily a religious movement, or whether it was instead the religious expression of social tensions within the city and region of Milan.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Pataria : lotte religiose e sociali nella Milano dell'11. secolo|date=1998|publisher=Europia|others=Golinelli, Paolo.|isbn=88-16-77105-4|location=[Novara]|oclc=883745329}}, p. 59</ref> The Italian historian Gioacchino Volpe, for instance, argued in 1907 that the Pataria was a class conflict between the elites of Milan and the lower-status population. This interpretation was also supported by Ernst Werner in 1956.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Werner|first=Ernst|title=Pauperes Christi : Studien zu sozial-religi\u00f6sen Bewegungen im Zeitalter des Reformpapsttums|publisher=|year=1956|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> For Hagen Keller, the Pataria is best understood as part of the history of the emergence of the Italian commune.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Hagen|date=|title=Pataria und Stadtverfassung, Stadtgemeinde und Reform.

For William North, the Pataria was 'the longest... and most violent of the popular responses to the call for ecclesiastical reform in the eleventh century'.<ref>William North, 'The Pataria: Andrea da Strumi's Passion of Arialdo', in Katherine Jansen et al. (eds)., Medieval Italy, Texts in Translation (2009), p. 337</ref> In his article on religious change in the eleventh century, R.I. Moore discussed the Pataria extensively as a major part of the 'appearance of the crowd on the stage of public events', which he sees as being brought into being by religious reform (itself however a response to social change).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=R.

Ariald's close associate Landulf Cotta was attacked, and later died from his injuries.\n\nIn 1059 Ariald travelled to Rome again to seek advice; Pope Stephen IX again sent envoys to Milan, this time [[Peter Damian]] and again Anselm of Baggio, but this did nothing to quell the unrest in the city. In 1063, Landulf Cotta's brother [[Erlembald]] went to Rome where he obtained a papal banner from the newly elected Pope Alexander II in support of the Pataria movement. In 1066, Pope Alexander II finally excommunicated Archbishop Guido. Guido used this excommnication however to whip up the citizens' anger against the Paterenes at a public meeting, and Ariald was first chased out of the city of Milan, and then assassinated, in June 1066.\n\nHowever, when Ariald's body was found in May 1067, it quickly became the object of a cult, and popular opinion in Milan swung back behind the Pataria.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Pataria : lotte religiose e sociali nella Milano dell'11. secolo|date=1998|publisher=Europia|others=Golinelli, Paolo.|isbn=88-16-77105-4|location=[Novara]|oclc=883745329}}, p. 18</ref> Archbishop Guido was forced out of the city, leaving it under the control of Erlembald, and Alexander II formally proclaimed Ariald to be a saint in 1068.\n\nArchbishop Guido resigned in 1068, in favour of his associate [[Gotofredo da Castiglione]], who was also supported by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV.]]  The papacy and the Pataria however supported a different candidate as archbishop, [[Atto (archbishop of Milan)|Attone]], and Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Gotofredo in 1074.\n\nRioting in Milan led to the murder of Erlembald in 1075, and after this point the Pataria movement lost much of its energy. The controversy over the appointment of the archbishop of Milan continued, however, and contributed to the political tensions between Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII.\n\n== Medieval historiography ==\nThere are several contemporary and nearly-contemporary sources for the Pataria, each of which offers different and sometimes contradictory perspectives.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Pataria : lotte religiose e sociali nella Milano dell'11. secolo|date=1998|publisher=Europia|others=Golinelli, Paolo.|isbn=88-16-77105-4|location=[Novara]|oclc=883745329}}, pp. 23-34</ref> These include:\n\n*Andrew of Strumi's ''Life of Saint Ariald''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dmgh.de/mgh_ss_30_2/index.htm#page/1047/mode/1up|title=Latin edition in the MGH|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n*[[Bonizo of Sutri]]'s ''Liber ad amicum''\n*[[Arnulf of Milan]]'s ''Deeds of the Archbishops of Milan''\n*[[Landulf of Milan|Landulf Senior]]'s ''History of Milan''\n\n== Modern historiography ==\nAs Paolo Golinelli has emphasised, modern debates about the Pataria have often centred on whether the Pataria was primarily a religious movement, or whether it was instead the religious expression of social tensions within the city and region of Milan.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Pataria : lotte religiose e sociali nella Milano dell'11. secolo|date=1998|publisher=Europia|others=Golinelli, Paolo.|isbn=88-16-77105-4|location=[Novara]|oclc=883745329}}, p. 59</ref> The Italian historian Gioacchino Volpe, for instance, argued in 1907 that the Pataria was a class conflict between the elites of Milan and the lower-status population. This interpretation was also supported by Ernst Werner in 1956.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Werner|first=Ernst|title=Pauperes Christi : Studien zu sozial-religi\u00f6sen Bewegungen im Zeitalter des Reformpapsttums|publisher=|year=1956|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> For Hagen Keller, the Pataria is best understood as part of the history of the emergence of the Italian commune.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Hagen|date=|title=Pataria und Stadtverfassung, Stadtgemeinde und Reform.

It was designed by H. W. Newman, Alexander Marshall and Frederick McFadzean and built from 1890 to 1940. Machinery includes a Thompson's winding engine from {{VICcity|Castlemaine}}. It is also known as Main Mine or Wentworth Main Mine; Industrial Archaeological Site. The site is owned by the Orange City Council and was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 August 2018.<ref name=nswshr-2004>{{cite NSW SHR|5056732|Wentworth and Reform Gold Mines|hr=02004|fn=H07/00030-001|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe village of Lucknow has historic and scientific significance for its links with gold mining activity dating from the very first discovery in 1851 up to the present day. The Wentworth (or Lucknow) Goldfield was discovered in 1851, only two months after Australia's first payable gold find was made at nearby [[Ophir, New South Wales|Ophir]]. It is a good representative example of the many small gold mining settlements which spread throughout the state, and nation, during the mid-late 19th century. This significance is enhanced by the degree to which it has retained many key elements of its original character both above and below ground. The above and below ground evidence of the village's early mining activity is both extensive and varied and the high scientific significance reflects its potential to provide information on early gold mining activity, if appropriately investigated.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe character of the village is enhanced by the extent of the remaining above ground mine shaft structures - particularly the steel head frames of the Wentworth Main and Reform sites - which are rare survivors, both within the region and the state, and give the village a striking historic accessible immediacy because of their prominent location on the main road.<ref name=nswshr-2004/><ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[City of Orange (New South Wales)|Orange City Council]] |title=Heritage Study |year=2012 |isbn= |access-date= |page= }}</ref>\n\nThe Wentworth gold field was private, and owned by [[William Wentworth|W. C. Wentworth]] who controlled the number of mining ventures carried out on his land. The mining operations necessitated the establishment of a village that was to become known as Lucknow. Closely associated with the success of the Wentworth gold field was Henry H. Newman who was the company mine manager during the peak of the region's [[New South Wales gold rush|gold rush]]. Newman became a member of the [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW Parliament]] from 1891 until his death in 1904.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe Reform Mine has been described as the richest small gold field of its type in the world. Mining began here in the 1870s or earlier and prospered until the late 1890s. In 1935 the Wentworth Company built a new poppet head over the shaft to pump water in conjunction with the Wentworth Main shaft. At the height of the gold rush the whole hillside beyond the Reform site was a hive of activity, including a battery, foundry and grand two-storey mine office, along with houses, stables and numerous shafts and tunnels. Behind the Reform poppet head, impressive remains of bluestone walls can still be seen. Built on a series of levels, these formed the foundations of the mill, or battery. The small corrugated iron shed behind the poppet head, old equipment and overgrown mullock heaps are other reminders of years of toil by hundreds of men.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe site remains a significant landmark within the village of Lucknow, and is situated adjacent to the Michell Highway. In this initial era mining was limited to alluvial works followed by a scattering of underground mining activity, before mining became concentrated on the Chapel Hill area.  An 1857 map of the [[Great Western Road (New South Wales)|Great Western Road]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Cook, Kerrin |title=Lucknow A veritable Goldmine |year=1995 |page=37 |publisher=[[City of Orange (New South Wales)|Orange City Council]] }}</ref> shows two mine shafts and managers residence approximately in the same location as the present Wentworth main shaft.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nHe was renowned as both a mine owner, mine manager and a miners' advocate, supporting a range of charitable and community causes. A legacy of Newman's wealth is the magnificent Lucknow home \"Mamhead\". It was Newman who negotiated the purchase of the Wentworth Main Mine site, the relocation of the Wesleyan Church and the sinking of the Main Mine shaft. He was also responsible for the construction of the mine's associated 1890s infrastructure.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nMining activity declined in Lucknow by the 1920s, only to be renewed under amalgamated companies, particularly during the ownership of the Marshall family from the 1930s era. Most of the current infrastructure situated on the Wentworth main Mine site was constructed during this era. The Wentworth Main Shaft was used for dewatering, rather than mining access and extraction. Of note is the complex underground system of interconnected mine workings. The extraordinary underground system provides an efficient and specialised integrated network, now all substantially flooded due to a rising water table. From the 1960s, the mine site reverted to domestic small scale farming uses. Sheds were adapted for livestock management, gardens and trees were planted around the site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe complex history of the site relates it to numerous other shafts, leases and companies that made up the mining history of Lucknow. The Wentworth Main Shaft Mine site covers the three main eea of central west mining from the first gold rush era of the 1850s, to the peak of the rush and the importation of mining technology during the 1870s-1890s, to the renewal of mining activity in the 1930s/40s. Each era represents differing technology for mining and ore treatment. Elements from all these eras can be interpreted in the Wentworth mine site, whereas the Reform Mine site has belowground evidence of significant technical achievement.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nAs Lucknow has retained its village character, so has the area retained its social and family history connections. Therefore, their descendants represent many of the pioneer mining families in the Lucknow area today. This provides valuable insight into the social and cultural aspects of the miners who worked on the Wentworth goldfield and in particular on the Wentworth Main Mine site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nOrange City Council purchased the Wentworth Main Mine site in 2000. Conservation work was undertaken in 2004 to secure and weatherproof all mine buildings and infrastructure on the site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/><ref name=grant/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe {{convert|1.89|ha|acre|0|adj=on}} site contains the Wentworth Main Shaft that was sunk to a depth of some {{convert|240|m}} during the 1890s. The original timber poppet head was replaced in the 1930s with a metal poppet head frame. Also during the 1930s, as a result of overseas investment, much of the Wentworth Main Mine infrastructure was renewed. The machinery room, office and equipment store are from this era. As mining operations expanded on the site previous eras of mining history disappeared under the new layers of infrastructure and mining activity. It appears from early records that one of the first shafts sunk on the Wentworth goldfield at Lucknow was located on this land. From a {{circa|1890}}s photo there is clear evidence of a small shaft with a hand-operated windlass located near the quartz outcrop close to the creek. This shaft is still in existence today and may well relate to the 1850s-1860 gold rush.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe site contains a series of [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] buildings that remain intact. These buildings include the mine office, equipment storeroom, first aid room, blacksmith, change [[shed]], machinery shed, mine managers cottage and stamper battery shed. The existence of a stamper battery shed is rare - it is the only known example in NSW and one of only five still in-situ within Australia. The stamper battery building houses a 10 head stamper and the ore processing tables. A steam engine, ore box and ore chute also remain in situ. Nearby are ash heaps from boilers and the water pipes that connected to the stamper battery.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nConcrete pads provide evidence of the location of the former assay building as well as the site of cyanide tanks for the treatment of tailings. Cyanide sand dumps are also clearly visible.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nProminent to the site is the poppet head and the associated winding gear. The mine was used during the 20th century for dewatering, to lower the watertable within the Lucknow goldfields to permit mining at the Reform mine site. The poppet head ws constructed for this purpose rather than for removing ore, and it is a dewatering bucket that is clearly visible suspended over the main shaft.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nOne of the unique factors of the Lucknow gold field was its operation as a private gold field. As a result, the underground workings (now flooded) form an extensive, integrated and highly organised structure.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nDuring the 1960-1980s the site was used for domestic occupation. Domestic changes are minor and include construction of a stockyard adjacent to the blacksmith. A variety of ore bins and similar vessels were reused as poultry feeders and nesting boxes. During the 1980s a garage located adjacent to the equipment room was fitted with a roller panel and the room used as a roadside fruit stall.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nSince Orange City Council's purchase of the site in 2000 a man proof security fence has been constructed around the site, and the site has been interpreted as an important introduction into the complexities of gold-mining.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe Reform Mine began production in the {{circa|1870}}s and was described as one of the richest small gold fields of its type. The Wentworth Company built the new poppet head over the main shaft in 1935 in order to pump water. At its peak, the Reform Mine had a battery, foundry, mine office, stables and houses. There are also an extensive network of underground shafts and tunnels. The condition of this site is poor compared to the Wentworth Mine, visible on the site now is the poppet head, a small shed, overgrown mullock heaps and remains of a bluestone wall. However, by way of contrast, the Reform Mine shows an appreciably industrial history of intensive mine activity rare by way of its preservation.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 14 December 2005, the collection of buildings provides an exception example of an early 20th century rural gold mine. The Wentworth site and its buildings are in good condition. Buildings are intact and have been subject to a recent program of conservation and maintenance. The majority of the machinery is no longer in-situ, however, base plates and machinery parts remain on site for further interpretation. Archaeological significance is moderate here. Much of the site's mullock heaps were removed during the 1950s, and each era of mining activity have encompassed early eras of operation.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nNo evidence remains of the church that was once located on the site, and given its vernacular construction there is little likelihood of archaeological evidence.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe winding engine and stamper battery, and an early boiler are in fair condition; the winder devoid of its brass fittings. Timber processing tables that were situation adjacent to the stamper battery are intact but their condition has deteriorated from use and immersion in water.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nAt its peak, the Reform Mine had a battery, foundry, mine office, stables and houses. There were also an extensive network of underground shafts and tunnels. Visible on the site now is the poppet head, a small shed, overgrown mullock heaps and remains of a bluestone wall.  There is archaeological potential here, however, the presence of underground shafts and tunnels would make work challenging. The area is fenced from the public and a small funding grant has been provided to light up the poppet head.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n{{as of|2019}}, many of the western facing doors and windows have been exposed to the elements over time and now essential conservation and restoration work to the sites main infrastructure is required to maintain the site as a leading tourism and educational destination of the Central West.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe program of works will include:<ref name=nswshr-2004/><ref name=grant>Grant application, March 2019.</ref>\n* Wash Room - repairs to the door and [[architrave]]\n* Infirmary - repairs to the door and architrave\n* Blacksmith Shop - adjustments to door and installation of flashing\n* Storage Shed - replacement of posts, repairs to doors and construction of a new [[awning]]\n* Pay Office - replay window putty on western windows\n* Mine Managers Cottage - refix door hardware and re-divert water across ground service\n* Pathways - install new edging and crushed [[granite]]\n* Check all roofing screws and gutters.\n\nThe site has high to exception degree of integrity. The intactness of the site by its buildings and associated site workings ie mullock heaps, abandoned equipment, ash heaps etc., makes this site an exceptionally compact example of gold mining history and technology.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe first mining carried out on this site may have been as early as the 1850s. This would have been limited to a shaft located near the creek. The shaft remains and may have been altered to act as an air vent to the 1890s main shaft.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nA timber and corrugated iron church was constructed on the site and relocated in the early 1890s. There is no evidence of the building.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe 1890s timber poppet head and associated corrugated iron machinery buildings no longer exist. A metal poppet head replaced the timber poppet head in 1930s. The machinery building has been extended and altered; the concrete footprint however reveals the various extensions to the building to accommodate larger compressors and the like.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe site includes an intact collection of 1930s era mining buildings and associated equipment. The 10 head stamper battery, ore processing tables, ore chute, ore buckets and the like remain in-situ. Also located upon the site are remnants of machinery including machinery from cyanide processing tank, a large boiler, various parts such as fire irons from boilers, ash deposits and cyanide sands.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nDuring the era 1960-1980 the mine office and the mine managers cottage were used as residential buildings. Minor domestic scale works occurred during this time, such as construction of a stockyard and reuse of ore bins for poultry feeders and nesting boxes. The impact of these changes is minor and adds to the layers of history relating to the sits use. Also added to the site during the 1970s was a small laundry/shower building. The use of corrugated iron and a design that is in scale and keeping with the earlier buildings reduces the visual impact of this addition. The facility is located to the north of the office building.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nDuring the 1990s the site was connected to the village sewer system.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n=== Further information ===\n\nInvaluable to the history if the site is the social history of the pioneer mining families of Lucknow. Many of the families remained in the area and their knoweldge through family history associations adds an important and vital part to the Wentworth Mine story. The book ''Lucknow: A veritable gold mine'' by Kerrin Cook puts together the social history of the pioneer mining families of Lucknow and forms a basis for further work relating to the Wentworth mine site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 13 September 2017, the Wentworth and Reform Mines are of state heritage significance as together the sites form relatively intact representations of the central west's gold mining history.  The central west was the most productive gold mining area in NSW during the gold rush era.These sites are rare due to the intactness of buildings and significant associated with their prominence as significant and prominent  landmarks and representing the cultural heritage association with Lucknow's mining past.  Overall the sites represent a compact and intact example of late 19th century and early 20th century gold mining. The presence of the intact stamper battery building and its associated infrastructure is a rare example of its type remaining in situ in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nWentworth and Reform Gold Mines was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 August 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe sites together are of state heritage significance for their historical values which demonstrate, by their high degree of intactness and integrity, aspects of early 20th century rural commercial gold mines. The sites represent and demonstrate three eras of gold mining in NSW from the initial 1851 gold rush, through the mechanisation of gold mining during the 1870-80s to the resurgence of mining operations during the 1930s. The Wentworth site is highly significant for its intact collection of mining infrastructure and ability to demonstrate the continuity of gold mining activity on the site over a 100-year time frame. The presence of an intact stamper battery building complete with ten head stamper battery and ore tables is exceptional and a rare example in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nAt the time of the first gold finds, explorer, businessman and politician W. C. Wentworth owned the site. Various owners/directors of this private gold field included Orange businessman [[James Dalton (pastoralist)|James Dalton]] and [[Cobb & Co]] directors [[James Rutherford (Australian pioneer)|James Rutherford]] and W. F. Whitney. During the peak of the Wentworth gold field Henry W. Newman, miner, mine manager, advocate and Parliamentarian managed the mines. This historical association demonstrates the sites' state significance.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBoth mine areas demonstrate technical significance at a state level, though the expression of these differ. Wentworth mine demonstrates a high degree of significance as a landmark, exemplifying old mining technology covering 100 years of NSW mining history. Located prominently adjacent to the Mitchell Highway, the poppet head dominates the landscape. The intactness of the site establishes the buildings and machinery utilised in the gold mining company operations, particularly of the 1930s era.

It was designed by H. W. Newman, Alexander Marshall and Frederick McFadzean and built from 1890 to 1940. Machinery includes a Thompson's winding engine from {{VICcity|Castlemaine}}. It is also known as Main Mine or Wentworth Main Mine; Industrial Archaeological Site. The site is owned by the Orange City Council and was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 August 2018.<ref name=nswshr-2004>{{cite NSW SHR|5056732|Wentworth and Reform Gold Mines|hr=02004|fn=H07/00030-001|accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe village of Lucknow has historic and scientific significance for its links with gold mining activity dating from the very first discovery in 1851 up to the present day. The Wentworth (or Lucknow) Goldfield was discovered in 1851, only two months after Australia's first payable gold find was made at nearby [[Ophir, New South Wales|Ophir]]. It is a good representative example of the many small gold mining settlements which spread throughout the state, and nation, during the mid-late 19th century. This significance is enhanced by the degree to which it has retained many key elements of its original character both above and below ground. The above and below ground evidence of the village's early mining activity is both extensive and varied and the high scientific significance reflects its potential to provide information on early gold mining activity, if appropriately investigated.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe character of the village is enhanced by the extent of the remaining above ground mine shaft structures - particularly the steel head frames of the Wentworth Main and Reform sites - which are rare survivors, both within the region and the state, and give the village a striking historic accessible immediacy because of their prominent location on the main road.<ref name=nswshr-2004/><ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[City of Orange (New South Wales)|Orange City Council]] |title=Heritage Study |year=2012 |isbn= |access-date= |page= }}</ref>\n\nThe Wentworth gold field was private, and owned by [[William Wentworth|W. C. Wentworth]] who controlled the number of mining ventures carried out on his land. The mining operations necessitated the establishment of a village that was to become known as Lucknow. Closely associated with the success of the Wentworth gold field was Henry H. Newman who was the company mine manager during the peak of the region's [[New South Wales gold rush|gold rush]]. Newman became a member of the [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW Parliament]] from 1891 until his death in 1904.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe Reform Mine has been described as the richest small gold field of its type in the world. Mining began here in the 1870s or earlier and prospered until the late 1890s. In 1935 the Wentworth Company built a new poppet head over the shaft to pump water in conjunction with the Wentworth Main shaft. At the height of the gold rush the whole hillside beyond the Reform site was a hive of activity, including a battery, foundry and grand two-storey mine office, along with houses, stables and numerous shafts and tunnels. Behind the Reform poppet head, impressive remains of bluestone walls can still be seen. Built on a series of levels, these formed the foundations of the mill, or battery. The small corrugated iron shed behind the poppet head, old equipment and overgrown mullock heaps are other reminders of years of toil by hundreds of men.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe site remains a significant landmark within the village of Lucknow, and is situated adjacent to the Michell Highway. In this initial era mining was limited to alluvial works followed by a scattering of underground mining activity, before mining became concentrated on the Chapel Hill area.  An 1857 map of the [[Great Western Road (New South Wales)|Great Western Road]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Cook, Kerrin |title=Lucknow A veritable Goldmine |year=1995 |page=37 |publisher=[[City of Orange (New South Wales)|Orange City Council]] }}</ref> shows two mine shafts and managers residence approximately in the same location as the present Wentworth main shaft.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nHe was renowned as both a mine owner, mine manager and a miners' advocate, supporting a range of charitable and community causes. A legacy of Newman's wealth is the magnificent Lucknow home \"Mamhead\". It was Newman who negotiated the purchase of the Wentworth Main Mine site, the relocation of the Wesleyan Church and the sinking of the Main Mine shaft. He was also responsible for the construction of the mine's associated 1890s infrastructure.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nMining activity declined in Lucknow by the 1920s, only to be renewed under amalgamated companies, particularly during the ownership of the Marshall family from the 1930s era. Most of the current infrastructure situated on the Wentworth main Mine site was constructed during this era. The Wentworth Main Shaft was used for dewatering, rather than mining access and extraction. Of note is the complex underground system of interconnected mine workings. The extraordinary underground system provides an efficient and specialised integrated network, now all substantially flooded due to a rising water table. From the 1960s, the mine site reverted to domestic small scale farming uses. Sheds were adapted for livestock management, gardens and trees were planted around the site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe complex history of the site relates it to numerous other shafts, leases and companies that made up the mining history of Lucknow. The Wentworth Main Shaft Mine site covers the three main eea of central west mining from the first gold rush era of the 1850s, to the peak of the rush and the importation of mining technology during the 1870s-1890s, to the renewal of mining activity in the 1930s/40s. Each era represents differing technology for mining and ore treatment. Elements from all these eras can be interpreted in the Wentworth mine site, whereas the Reform Mine site has belowground evidence of significant technical achievement.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nAs Lucknow has retained its village character, so has the area retained its social and family history connections. Therefore, their descendants represent many of the pioneer mining families in the Lucknow area today. This provides valuable insight into the social and cultural aspects of the miners who worked on the Wentworth goldfield and in particular on the Wentworth Main Mine site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nOrange City Council purchased the Wentworth Main Mine site in 2000. Conservation work was undertaken in 2004 to secure and weatherproof all mine buildings and infrastructure on the site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/><ref name=grant/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe {{convert|1.89|ha|acre|0|adj=on}} site contains the Wentworth Main Shaft that was sunk to a depth of some {{convert|240|m}} during the 1890s. The original timber poppet head was replaced in the 1930s with a metal poppet head frame. Also during the 1930s, as a result of overseas investment, much of the Wentworth Main Mine infrastructure was renewed. The machinery room, office and equipment store are from this era. As mining operations expanded on the site previous eras of mining history disappeared under the new layers of infrastructure and mining activity. It appears from early records that one of the first shafts sunk on the Wentworth goldfield at Lucknow was located on this land. From a {{circa|1890}}s photo there is clear evidence of a small shaft with a hand-operated windlass located near the quartz outcrop close to the creek. This shaft is still in existence today and may well relate to the 1850s-1860 gold rush.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe site contains a series of [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] buildings that remain intact. These buildings include the mine office, equipment storeroom, first aid room, blacksmith, change [[shed]], machinery shed, mine managers cottage and stamper battery shed. The existence of a stamper battery shed is rare - it is the only known example in NSW and one of only five still in-situ within Australia. The stamper battery building houses a 10 head stamper and the ore processing tables. A steam engine, ore box and ore chute also remain in situ. Nearby are ash heaps from boilers and the water pipes that connected to the stamper battery.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nConcrete pads provide evidence of the location of the former assay building as well as the site of cyanide tanks for the treatment of tailings. Cyanide sand dumps are also clearly visible.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nProminent to the site is the poppet head and the associated winding gear. The mine was used during the 20th century for dewatering, to lower the watertable within the Lucknow goldfields to permit mining at the Reform mine site. The poppet head ws constructed for this purpose rather than for removing ore, and it is a dewatering bucket that is clearly visible suspended over the main shaft.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nOne of the unique factors of the Lucknow gold field was its operation as a private gold field. As a result, the underground workings (now flooded) form an extensive, integrated and highly organised structure.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nDuring the 1960-1980s the site was used for domestic occupation. Domestic changes are minor and include construction of a stockyard adjacent to the blacksmith. A variety of ore bins and similar vessels were reused as poultry feeders and nesting boxes. During the 1980s a garage located adjacent to the equipment room was fitted with a roller panel and the room used as a roadside fruit stall.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nSince Orange City Council's purchase of the site in 2000 a man proof security fence has been constructed around the site, and the site has been interpreted as an important introduction into the complexities of gold-mining.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe Reform Mine began production in the {{circa|1870}}s and was described as one of the richest small gold fields of its type. The Wentworth Company built the new poppet head over the main shaft in 1935 in order to pump water. At its peak, the Reform Mine had a battery, foundry, mine office, stables and houses. There are also an extensive network of underground shafts and tunnels. The condition of this site is poor compared to the Wentworth Mine, visible on the site now is the poppet head, a small shed, overgrown mullock heaps and remains of a bluestone wall. However, by way of contrast, the Reform Mine shows an appreciably industrial history of intensive mine activity rare by way of its preservation.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 14 December 2005, the collection of buildings provides an exception example of an early 20th century rural gold mine. The Wentworth site and its buildings are in good condition. Buildings are intact and have been subject to a recent program of conservation and maintenance. The majority of the machinery is no longer in-situ, however, base plates and machinery parts remain on site for further interpretation. Archaeological significance is moderate here. Much of the site's mullock heaps were removed during the 1950s, and each era of mining activity have encompassed early eras of operation.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nNo evidence remains of the church that was once located on the site, and given its vernacular construction there is little likelihood of archaeological evidence.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe winding engine and stamper battery, and an early boiler are in fair condition; the winder devoid of its brass fittings. Timber processing tables that were situation adjacent to the stamper battery are intact but their condition has deteriorated from use and immersion in water.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nAt its peak, the Reform Mine had a battery, foundry, mine office, stables and houses. There were also an extensive network of underground shafts and tunnels. Visible on the site now is the poppet head, a small shed, overgrown mullock heaps and remains of a bluestone wall.  There is archaeological potential here, however, the presence of underground shafts and tunnels would make work challenging. The area is fenced from the public and a small funding grant has been provided to light up the poppet head.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n{{as of|2019}}, many of the western facing doors and windows have been exposed to the elements over time and now essential conservation and restoration work to the sites main infrastructure is required to maintain the site as a leading tourism and educational destination of the Central West.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe program of works will include:<ref name=nswshr-2004/><ref name=grant>Grant application, March 2019.</ref>\n* Wash Room - repairs to the door and [[architrave]]\n* Infirmary - repairs to the door and architrave\n* Blacksmith Shop - adjustments to door and installation of flashing\n* Storage Shed - replacement of posts, repairs to doors and construction of a new [[awning]]\n* Pay Office - replay window putty on western windows\n* Mine Managers Cottage - refix door hardware and re-divert water across ground service\n* Pathways - install new edging and crushed [[granite]]\n* Check all roofing screws and gutters.\n\nThe site has high to exception degree of integrity. The intactness of the site by its buildings and associated site workings ie mullock heaps, abandoned equipment, ash heaps etc., makes this site an excpetionally compact example of gold mining history and technology.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe first mining carried out on this site may have been as early as the 1850s. This would have been limited to a shaft located near the creek. The shaft remains and may have been altered to act as an air vent to the 1890s main shaft.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nA timber and corrugated iron church was constructed on the site and relocated in the early 1890s. There is no evidence of the building.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe 1890s timber poppet head and associated corrugated iron machinery buildings no longer exist. A metal poppet head replaced the timber poppet head in 1930s. The machinery building has been extended and altered; the concrete footprint however reveals the various extensions to the building to accommodate larger compressors and the like.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe site includes an intact collection of 1930s era mining buildings and associated equipment. The 10 head stamper battery, ore processing tables, ore chute, ore buckets and the like remain in-situ. Also located upon the site are remnants of machinery including machinery from cyanide processing tank, a large boiler, various parts such as fire irons from boilers, ash deposits and cyanide sands.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nDuring the era 1960-1980 the mine office and the mine managers cottage were used as residential buildings. Minor domestic scale works occurred during this time, such as construction of a stockyard and reuse of ore bins for poultry feeders and nesting boxes. The impact of these changes is minor and adds to the layers of history relating to the sits use. Also added to the site during the 1970s was a small laundry/shower building. The use of corrugated iron and a design that is in scale and keeping with the earlier buildings reduces the visual impact of this addition. The facility is located to the north of the office building.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nDuring the 1990s the site was connected to the village sewer system.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n=== Further information ===\n\nInvaluable to the history if the site is the social history of the pioneer mining families of Lucknow. Many of the families remained in the area and their knoweldge through family history associations adds an important and vital part to the Wentworth Mine story. The book ''Lucknow: A veritable gold mine'' by Kerrin Cook puts together the social history of the pioneer mining families of Lucknow and forms a basis for further work relating to the Wentworth mine site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 13 September 2017, the Wentworth and Reform Mines are of state heritage significance as together the sites form relatively intact representations of the central west's gold mining history.  The central west was the most productive gold mining area in NSW during the gold rush era.These sites are rare due to the intactness of buildings and significant associated with their prominence as significant and prominent  landmarks and representing the cultural heritage association with Lucknow's mining past.  Overall the sites represent a compact and intact example of late 19th century and early 20th century gold mining. The presence of the intact stamper battery building and its associated infrastructure is a rare example of its type remaining in situ in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nWentworth and Reform Gold Mines was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 August 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe sites together are of state heritage significance for their historical values which demonstrate, by their high degree of intactness and integrity, aspects of early 20th century rural commercial gold mines. The sites represent and demonstrate three eras of gold mining in NSW from the initial 1851 gold rush, through the mechanisation of gold mining during the 1870-80s to the resurgence of mining operations during the 1930s. The Wentworth site is highly significant for its intact collection of mining infrastructure and ability to demonstrate the continuity of gold mining activity on the site over a 100-year time frame. The presence of an intact stamper battery building complete with ten head stamper battery and ore tables is exceptional and a rare example in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nAt the time of the first gold finds, explorer, businessman and politician W. C. Wentworth owned the site. Various owners/directors of this private gold field included Orange businessman [[James Dalton (pastoralist)|James Dalton]] and [[Cobb & Co]] directors [[James Rutherford (Australian pioneer)|James Rutherford]] and W. F. Whitney. During the peak of the Wentworth gold field Henry W. Newman, miner, mine manager, advocate and Parliamentarian managed the mines. This historical association demonstrates the sites' state significance.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBoth mine areas demonstrate technical significance at a state level, though the expression of these differ. Wentworth mine demonstrates a high degree of significance as a landmark, exemplifying old mining technology covering 100 years of NSW mining history. Located prominently adjacent to the Mitchell Highway, the poppet head dominates the landscape. The intactness of the site establishes the buildings and machinery utilised in the gold mining company operations, particularly of the 1930s era. The technology used in ore extraction and processing can be readily interpreted from this site.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\nThe Reform Mine site, in comparison, has a distinctive poppet head and associated infrastructure scattered across the site, but its state level technical significance lies in the below-ground mining infrastructure, particularly the network of mine shafts, and Uncle Tom's mine, one of the richest gold veins in NSWs history.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe Wentworth and Reform sites provide an important and identifiable collection of buildings, relics and landscape features that represent the importance of Lucknow's mining heritage and that of one of the premier goldfields in NSW. The presence of the site adjacent to a State Highway makes the site highly visible to the travelling public, and its dominant landmark features are important to the wider community of regular travellers moving from all parts of NSW through the central west region.<ref name=nswshr-2004/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Wentworth Mine site with its various buildings, machinery and landscape feature may have high significance in its potential to contribute NSW's knowledge of gold mining activities and the advances of technology.

During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008.

These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref>\n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main article|Typography}}\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref>\n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of [[Edward Johnston]] to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Meggs|first=Philip|title=A History of Graphic Design|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=0-471-29198-6|location=New York|pages=229-230}}</ref><!-- Why is this a classic design example?\nWho is Edward Johnston?

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main article|Typography}}\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases.

He was a leader in the pro-Nazi youth movement during the Vichy wartime years, but after prison time built a major newspaper empire and engaged in conservative politics.  At the time of death he operated he operated 40 publications and employed 8,000 people, but failed in his leap into television.\n\n== Biography ==\nHersant was born in [[Vertou]], [[Loire-Atlantique]].  . He was the son of a captain in the\nmerchant navy and showed early on an interest in school nnewspapers.\n===Vichy France===\nInitially involved with the Socialist Youth movement in 1935, Robert Hersant founded the rightist political party ''[[Jeune Front]]'' in the summer 1940. During that period, he became a friend of [[Jean-Marie Balestre]]. ''Jeune Front'' although a  small group, was publishing the pro-Nazi newspaper ''[[Au Pilori]]''. He left this movement in October 1940, to become a member of the secretariat general de la jeunesse of the [[Vichy Regime]]. In 1941-1942, he created a camp in [[Br\u00e9vannes]], named after the Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] to indoctrinate young people in the [[R\u00e9volution nationale]] ideology.   He was not affected in the first waves of the [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale]] after liberation. He was arrested and jailed for one month in [[Fresnes Prison|Fresnes]] on 15 June 1945. He was tried in 1947 and sentenced  to 10 years of national indignity for [[collaborationism|collaboration]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. The court emphasized that ''Jeune Front'' had received support from the Nazis as early as August 1940 to justify that sentence. \n===Publishing and politics===\nHe was released through the general amnesties in 1947, 1951 and 1953. His personal friendships with notable Socialist leaders such as Guy Mollet and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand during the 1950s enabled him to start fresh. After launching a few unsuccessful publications, (''Bazars et Galeries'', ''l'Equipement M\u00e9nager'', ''le Quincailler''), in 1950, he started ''[[L'Auto-Journal]]'', which met success due to the increasing popularity of automobiles.\n\nIn October 1952, he bought ''la semaine de l'Oise'' and used it to launch his political career. In February 1953, he was elected mayor of [[Ravenel, Oise]], and in January 1956 he ran for a deputy seat in the [[Assembl\u00e9e Nationale]] as a [[Radical Party (France)|radical]] candidate. He was elected with the support of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (UDSR). However, on 18 April 1956 his election caused a heated debate at the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale due to his collaborationist past. The Assembl\u00e9e Nationale cancelled his election, but on 25 October 1956 he was reelected. As a deputy, Hersant championed a reform of the constitution of 1946, altering the articles 45, 46, 47, 48 and 52. It would have permitted the direct election of the ''Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil'', and would have obliged him to form his cabinet from personalities that did not belong to legislative bodies. \n\nHersant  advocated a partition of [[Algeria]] as a solution to the [[Algerian War]]. In 1958, Hersant became [[Gaullist]]. In 1967, he was elected as a Radical within the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]]. He then became a conservative supporting [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]. He remained a deputy until 1978. In 1984, he became a deputy in the [[European Parliament]] on the [[Rally for the Republic]]&ndash;[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) list led by [[Simone Veil]]. He remained a European Deputy until his death.\n\nHe gradually built his empire by buying or creating local or regional newspapers through his holding company ''[[Socpresse]]'' (and its associate ''[[France-Antilles]]''). In 1957, he created ''Centre Presse'' and in 1964, ''[[France-Antilles]]''. Robert Hersant also took control of  various regional titles such as ''Le Courrier de l'Ouest'', ''Nord Matin'' (bought in 1967), ''Paris Normandie'' (bought in 1972), ''[[Nord Eclair]]'' (bought in 1975, and merged with ''Nord Matin'').\n\nIn 1975, he purchased from [[Jean Prouvost]] the great conservative newspaper ''[[le Figaro]]'' (with the help of [[Pierre Juillet]] and [[Marie-France Garaud]], then adviser of [[Jacques Chirac]]), in 1976 the popular daily ''[[France-Soir]]'',  and in 1980 acquired \"L'Aurore\" from the estate of [[Marcel Boussac]]. At the time, it was rumored that president Giscard d'Estaing had facilitated the obtaining of loans by Hersant in order to have the three Parisian newspapers (totalling 1.06 million in circulation) controlled by a political ally. In 1979, Hersant launched ''Le Figaro-Magazine'', a weekly supplement of ''Le Figaro'', headed by [[Louis Pauwels]].  In 1980, ''Le Figaro'' absorbed ''L'Aurore''. In 1983, Hersant bought [[Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], in 1986, ''[[Le Progr\u00e8s de Lyon]]'' and ''[[l'Union de Reims]]'', and in 1987 ''[[Les Nouvelles Cal\u00e9doniennes]]''. As a result, in 1986, according to [[Daniel Singer (journalist)|Daniel Singer]],  he was controlling 38% of the national press, and 26% of the regional press in France.\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Hersant extended his activities to eastern Europe. In 1991, he bought ''[[Magyar Nemzet]]'' (Hungary), 51% of [[Rzeczpospolita]] (Poland), [[Tempo]], [[Dziennik Baltycki]], [[Dziennik Lodzki]], [[Trybuna Slaska]], [[Express Ilustrowany]], [[Wieczor Wybrzeza]], [[Dziennik Zachodni]] and [[Gazeta Krakowska]]. This large number of acquisitions gained him the nicknames of ''Citizen H'' and ''Le Papivore'' in the satirist ''[[Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9]]''.\n\nIn 1987, he was involved with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] in the launching of the [[La Cinq]] TV-channel. He withdrew in 1990 after suffering serious losses.

21 April 1996) was a French newspaper magnate. He was a leader in the pro-Nazi youth movement during the Vichy wartime years, but after prison time built a major newspaper empire and engaged in conservative politics.  At the time of death he operated he operated 40 publications and employed 8,000 people, but failed in his leap into television.\n\n== Biography ==\nHersant was born in [[Vertou]], [[Loire-Atlantique]].  . He was the son of a captain in the\nmerchant navy and showed edarly on an interest in school nnewspapers.\n===Vichy France===\nInitially involved with the Socialist Youth movement in 1935, Robert Hersant founded the rightist political party ''[[Jeune Front]]'' in the summer 1940. During that period, he became a friend of [[Jean-Marie Balestre]]. ''Jeune Front'' although a  small group, was publishing the pro-Nazi newspaper ''[[Au Pilori]]''. He left this movement in October 1940, to become a member of the secretariat general de la jeunesse of the [[Vichy Regime]]. In 1941-1942, he created a camp in [[Br\u00e9vannes]], named after the Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] to indoctrinate young people in the [[R\u00e9volution nationale]] ideology.   He was not affected in the first waves of the [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale]] after liberation. He was arrested and jailed for one month in [[Fresnes Prison|Fresnes]] on 15 June 1945. He was tried in 1947 and sentenced  to 10 years of national indignity for [[collaborationism|collaboration]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. The court emphasized that ''Jeune Front'' had received support from the Nazis as early as August 1940 to justify that sentence. \n===Publishing and politics===\nHe was released through the general amnesties in 1947, 1951 and 1953. His personal friendships with notable Socialist leaders such as Guy Mollet and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand during the 1950s enabled him to start fresh. After launching a few unsuccessful publications, (''Bazars et Galeries'', ''l'Equipement M\u00e9nager'', ''le Quincailler''), in 1950, he started ''[[L'Auto-Journal]]'', which met success due to the increasing popularity of automobiles.\n\nIn October 1952, he bought ''la semaine de l'Oise'' and used it to launch his political career. In February 1953, he was elected mayor of [[Ravenel, Oise]], and in January 1956 he ran for a deputy seat in the [[Assembl\u00e9e Nationale]] as a [[Radical Party (France)|radical]] candidate. He was elected with the support of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (UDSR). However, on 18 April 1956 his election caused a heated debate at the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale due to his collaborationist past. The Assembl\u00e9e Nationale cancelled his election, but on 25 October 1956 he was reelected. As a deputy, Hersant championed a reform of the constitution of 1946, altering the articles 45, 46, 47, 48 and 52. It would have permitted the direct election of the ''Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil'', and would have obliged him to form his cabinet from personalities that did not belong to legislative bodies. \n\nHersant  advocated a partition of [[Algeria]] as a solution to the [[Algerian War]]. In 1958, Hersant became [[Gaullist]]. In 1967, he was elected as a Radical within the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]]. He then became a conservative supporting [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]. He remained a deputy until 1978. In 1984, he became a deputy in the [[European Parliament]] on the [[Rally for the Republic]]&ndash;[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) list led by [[Simone Veil]]. He remained a European Deputy until his death.\n\nHe gradually built his empire by buying or creating local or regional newspapers through his holding company ''[[Socpresse]]'' (and its associate ''[[France-Antilles]]''). In 1957, he created ''Centre Presse'' and in 1964, ''[[France-Antilles]]''. Robert Hersant also took control of  various regional titles such as ''Le Courrier de l'Ouest'', ''Nord Matin'' (bought in 1967), ''Paris Normandie'' (bought in 1972), ''[[Nord Eclair]]'' (bought in 1975, and merged with ''Nord Matin'').\n\nIn 1975, he purchased from [[Jean Prouvost]] the great conservative newspaper ''[[le Figaro]]'' (with the help of [[Pierre Juillet]] and [[Marie-France Garaud]], then adviser of [[Jacques Chirac]]), in 1976 the popular daily ''[[France-Soir]]'',  and in 1980 acquired \"L'Aurore\" from the estate of [[Marcel Boussac]]. At the time, it was rumored that president Giscard d'Estaing had facilitated the obtaining of loans by Hersant in order to have the three Parisian newspapers (totalling 1.06 million in circulation) controlled by a political ally. In 1979, Hersant launched ''Le Figaro-Magazine'', a weekly supplement of ''Le Figaro'', headed by [[Louis Pauwels]].  In 1980, ''Le Figaro'' absorbed ''L'Aurore''. In 1983, Hersant bought [[Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], in 1986, ''[[Le Progr\u00e8s de Lyon]]'' and ''[[l'Union de Reims]]'', and in 1987 ''[[Les Nouvelles Cal\u00e9doniennes]]''. As a result, in 1986, according to [[Daniel Singer (journalist)|Daniel Singer]],  he was controlling 38% of the national press, and 26% of the regional press in France.\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Hersant extended his activities to eastern Europe. In 1991, he bought ''[[Magyar Nemzet]]'' (Hungary), 51% of [[Rzeczpospolita]] (Poland), [[Tempo]], [[Dziennik Baltycki]], [[Dziennik Lodzki]], [[Trybuna Slaska]], [[Express Ilustrowany]], [[Wieczor Wybrzeza]], [[Dziennik Zachodni]] and [[Gazeta Krakowska]]. This large number of acquisitions gained him the nicknames of ''Citizen H'' and ''Le Papivore'' in the satirist ''[[Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9]]''.\n\nIn 1987, he was involved with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] in the launching of the [[La Cinq]] TV-channel. He withdrew in 1990 after suffering serious losses. ''[[La Cinq]]'' collapsed in 1992.\n\nRobert Hersant's group was, in 1996, employing 8,000 persons, and generating a revenue of 6 billion French francs.\n\nHe died at [[Saint-Cloud]] in 1996. After his death of Hersant, [[Socpresse]] was sold to [[Serge Dassault]].\n\n== List of papers owned by Robert Hersant in 1996 ==\n\n=== France ===\n* ''[[Le Figaro]]''\n* ''[[France-Soir]]''\n* ''[[le Progr\u00e8s]]'' ([[Lyon]])\n* ''[[le Journal de Sa\u00f4ne et Loire]]''\n* ''[[Le Bien public]]'' ([[Dijon]])\n* ''[[le Courrier de l'Ouest]]'' [[Angers]]\n* ''[[le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]'' ([[Grenoble]])\n* ''[[Presse Oc\u00e9an]]'' ([[Nantes]])\n* ''[[l'Eclair]]'' (Nantes)\n* ''[[Centre presse]]'' ([[Poitiers]])\n* ''[[le Maine libre]]'' ([[Le Mans]])\n* ''[[Le Havre presse]]''\n* ''[[Le Havre libre]]''\n* ''[[la Libert\u00e9 du Morbihan]]''\n* ''[[l'Union]]'' ([[Reims]])\n* ''[[l'Ardennais]]''\n* ''[[Nord-Eclair]]''\n* ''[[Nord-Matin]]''\n* ''[[Paris-Normandie]]''\n* ''[[les Derni\u00e8res Nouvelles d'Alsace]]''\n* ''[[L'Est R\u00e9publicain]]''\n* ''[[l'Est \u00e9clair]]''\n* ''[[Lib\u00e9ration Champagne]]'' (not to be confused with [[Lib\u00e9ration]])\n* ''[[la Haute-Marne lib\u00e9r\u00e9e]]''\n* ''[[France-Antilles Martinique]]''\n* ''[[France-Antilles Guadeloupe]]''\n* ''[[la D\u00e9p\u00eache de Tahiti]]''\n* ''[[le Quotidien de la R\u00e9union]]''\n\n=== Belgium ===\n* 42% of the capital of ''[[Le Soir]]''\n\n=== Poland ===\n* One national daily, and one sports daily\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n* One national and four regional dailies\n\n=== Slovakia ===\n* two dailies\n\n==Further reading==\n* Chalaby, Jean K. \"The Press, 1945\u201369.\" in ''The de Gaulle Presidency and the Media;;
