On [[November 2]], [[1885]] king [[Milan I of Serbia|Milan I]] declared a war to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] and same day Royal Serbian Army started attack on Bulgarian Army trying as quick as possible to reach [[Sofia]] and capture Bulgaria in situation where Serbia will be able to dictate all terms after the war including territorial changes. King Milan I thought that Bulgaria is too busy with preparing of the war with [[Ottoman Empire]] so logically was that western borders are mainly undefended. Before the attack Danube Division of Ni\u0161 Army was taking positions around [[Pirot]] and preparing the action towards Caribrod.\n[[File:Bulgarian unification and Serbo-Bulgarian War.png|thumb|Map of the Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n== Battle ==\nSerbian attack started on November 2 when Royal Serbian Army launched attack with 3-4 hours of late in for directions towards Sofia and on every direction there was one division. Danube Division had task to enter Bulgarian territory, capture Caribrod, come to line [[Kalotina]] \u2013 [[Vishan, Sofia Province|Vishan]] and to take Dragoman pass. In that way Danube Division will be support to \u0160umadija Division on right side.\n\nEntering into Bulgarian territory Serbian units had great fire resistance from Bulgarian side. Forces of the Danube Division were divided in two columns. Division's right column was composed of 7th Serbian Infantry Regiment that attacked from [[Sre\u0107kovac]] to [[\u017delju\u0161a]] and continuing to Caribrod. Cavalry Brigade (composed of three battalions of 9th Serbian Infantry Regiment) and 19th Guard Battalion with one artillery battery, composing division's left column, passed state border, reached villages [[Viso\u010dki Odorovci|Odorovci]] and [[\u010ciniglavci]], passed Caribrod and attack finished on line [[Stanyantsi]] \u2013 [[Berende Izvor|Izvor]]. Drina Division was left in reserve untill the success on [[Sukovo]] Bridge.  \n\nAll Serbian divisions very soon after the start of attack made contact with Bulgarians. Morava Division was stopped about two hours by [[Opalchentsi]] detachment with 60 fighters after passing the border near Daschen pass. Later division stayed on [[Ruj Mountain]] where stayed during night because of fog without any greater success. \u0160umadija Division was stopped by small battalion of captain Andrei Bukureshtliev (4th Plevne Infantry Regiment) on road between [[Planinica|Planinci]] and [[Banjski Dol]]. Danube Division only had approximate success to the planned one. Caribrod Detachment resisted to Danube Division near Caribrod for a bit of time and at 16:30 Serbs captured Caribrod but they couldn't continue to the planned line Kalotina\u2013Vishan. Right column stopped its attack in [[Lukavica]] village where forces stayed during night. Cavalry Brigade awaited 19th Infantry Regiment and artillery battery to be sent to their positions. Cavalry Brigade launched attack on 14:00 and on night came to the [[Smilovci]] village where it was waited by bad fortified detachment of Bahchevanov (one infantry battalion, one cavalry squadron and 4 cannons). In night that detachment together with Caribrod Detachment retreated to Stanyantsi village.\n\nBattle was finished without big casualties on Bulgarian side but also without great territorial success of Royal Serbian Army that entered into Bulgaria only about 5 km.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [http://www.slovo.bg/showwork.php3?AuID=101&WorkID=4482&Level=3 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u0442\u043e\u043c 1, \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u2013 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u044a\u0442, I. \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044a\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435]\n\n[[Category:Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|text=the [[2nd Battle of Caribrod]] fought on November 24 1885}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = 1st Battle of Caribrod\n| width       = \n| partof      = [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n| image       = \n| image_size  =\n| alt         =\n| caption     = \n| date        = November 14, 1885;<br/> ''November 2, 1885'' ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]])\n| place       = [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Caribrod]],{{flagdeco|Bulgaria}} [[Principality of Bulgaria]]; today [[Serbia]]\n| coordinates = <!--Use the {{coord}} template -->\n| map_type    = \n| map_relief  = \n| map_size    = \n| map_marksize = \n| map_caption = \n| map_label   = \n| territory   = Captured Caribrod, first Bulgarian territories occupied\n| result      = [[Royal Serbian Army|Serbian]] victory\n| status      = \n| combatants_header = Belligerents\n| combatant1  = {{flagcountry|Kingdom of Serbia}} \n| combatant2  = {{flagdeco|Bulgaria}} [[Principality of Bulgaria]]\n| combatant3  = \n| commander1  = general Milutin Jovanovi\u0107\n| commander2  = captain Popov\n| commander3  = \n| units1      = {{flagdeco|Kingdom of Serbia}} Danube Division\n| units2      = {{flagdeco|Bulgaria}} Caribrod detachment\n| units3      = \n| strength1   = \n| strength2   = \n| strength3   = \n| casualties1 = \n| casualties2 = \n| casualties3 = \n| notes       = \n| campaignbox = \n}}\n'''1st Battle of Caribrod''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''\u0411\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430'') was battle during [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] fought on November 2, 1885 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) between [[Royal Serbian Army]] and [[Bulgarian Army]] around Caribrod, todays [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Dimitrovgrad]], [[Serbia]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[Unification of Bulgaria]] wasn't accepted well in [[Balkan Peninsula|Balkan]] states.

Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[Molecular Beacons]], and Scorpions. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes, Molecular Beacons and Scorpions generation of fluorescence depend on [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M.

The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, [[SYBR Green]] is the most economical and easiest to use.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid11227069\"/>\n[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman Probes]]\n''''' TaqMan Probes: ''''' [[TaqMan]] probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid18645596\"/><ref name=\"pmid15613819\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J.

This mutation was hypothesized to selectively abolish Gal expression. To confirm this, gene expression levels of yeast cells containing this mutation were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The researchers were able to conclusively determine that the mutation of this regulatory protein reduced Gal expression.<ref name=\"pmid22308403\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin L, Chamberlain L, Zhu LJ, Green MR | title = Analysis of Gal4-directed transcription activation using Tra1 mutants selectively defective for interaction with Gal4 | journal = Proc.

Because most eukaryotic genes contain [[introns]], which are present in the genome but not in the mature mRNA, the cDNA generated from a RT-PCR reaction is the exact (without regard to the error-prone nature of reverse transcriptases) DNA sequence that would be directly translated into protein after transcription. When these genes are expressed in prokaryotic cells for the sake of protein production or purification, the RNA produced directly from transcription need not undergo splicing as the transcript contains only [[exons]]. (Prokaryotes, such as E. coli, lack the mRNA splicing mechanism of eukaryotes).\n\n=== Genetic disease diagnosis ===\nRT-PCR can be used to diagnose genetic disease such as [[Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome]]. This genetic disease is caused by a malfunction in the HPRT1 gene, which clinically leads to the fatal uric acid urinary stone and symptoms similar to gout.[6] Analyzing a pregnant mother and a fetus for mRNA expression levels of HPRT1 will reveal if the mother is a carrier and if the fetus will likely to develop Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome.<ref name=\"pmid23046577\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Torres RJ, Garcia MG, Puig JG | title = Carrier and prenatal diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan disease due to a defect in HPRT gene expression regulation | journal = Gene | volume = 511 | issue = 2 | pages = 306\u20137 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23046577 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.121 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cancer detection ===\nScientists are working on ways to use RT-PCR in [[cancer]] detection to help improve [[prognosis]], and monitor response to therapy.

Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[Molecular Beacons]], and Scorpions. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes, Molecular Beacons and Scorpions generation of fluorescence depend on [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M.

The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, [[SYBR Green]] is the most economical and easiest to use.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid11227069\"/>\n[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman Probes]]\n''''' TaqMan Probes: ''''' [[TaqMan]] probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid18645596\"/><ref name=\"pmid15613819\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J.

When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET.

The MIQE guidelines describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating [[quantitative PCR]] experiments that should be required for publication for encouraging better experimental practice and ensuring the relevance, accuracy, correct interpretation, and repeatability of quantitative PCR data.<ref name=\"Bustin et al\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bustin SA, Benes V, Garson JA, etal |title=The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments |journal=Clin.

It is also proposes that commercially derived terms like TaqMan probes should not be used but instead referred to as hydrolysis probes. Additionally, it is proposed that quantification cycle (Cq) be used to describe the PCR cycle used for quantification instead of threshold cycle (Ct), crossing point (Cp), and takeoff point (TOP), which refer to the same value but were coined by different manufacturers of [[Quantitative PCR instrument|real-time instruments]].<ref name=\"urlwww.microarrays.ca\"/>\n\nThe guideline consists of the following elements: 1) experimental design, 2) sample, 3) nucleic acid extraction, 4) reverse transcription, 5) qPCR target information, 6) oligonucleotides, 7) protocol, 8) validation, and 9) data analysis. Specific items within each element carry a label of either E (essential) or D (desirable). Those labelled E are considered critical and indispensable while those labelled D are considered peripheral yet important for best-practices.<ref name=\"Bustin et al\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cas.psu.edu/docs/CASDEPT/VET/jackvh/jvhpcr.html RT-PCR protocols from Penn state University]\n* [http://www.realtimeprimers.org Database of validated PCR primer sets] ([http://www.genengnews.com/bestofweb/list.aspx?iid=93 website critique])\n* [http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/immunology/Flash/RT_PCR.html Animation to illustrate RT-PCR procedure, from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]\n* [http://www.gene-quantification.info/ The Reference in qPCR -- an Academic & Industrial Information Platform]\n\n{{PCR}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction}}\n[[Category:Laboratory techniques]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Polymerase chain reaction]]\n\n[[fr:RT-PCR#Apr\u00e8s transcription inverse]]\n", "name_user": "2403:6200:8896:ccc2:dc1a:3e7c:4394:c36f", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEnd-point RT-PCR vs. real-time RT-PCR)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction"}
