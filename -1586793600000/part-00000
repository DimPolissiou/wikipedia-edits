His grandmother was an eminent pupil of Thoman, at the Franz Liszt Academy (a direct disciple of [[Franz Liszt]]). At a very early age, his mother, herself an accomplished pianist and teacher had discovered his musical talent. At the age of five he began his musical studies with his mother and a year later he entered the then newly established [[Kod\u00e1ly School of Music]], under the personal supervision of the Hungarian composer-educator [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]].\n\nIn short time, he attracted the attention of Kod\u00e1ly himself, who developed a lifelong teacher-student relationship with Jo\u00f3, which lasted until the death of the composer. During his studies in the Kod\u00e1ly school he was introduced by his teachers to visiting musicians such as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Carl Orff]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. He studied at the Bart\u00f3k Conservatory and, at the age of 16, he was admitted to the University level of the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] where he studied piano with Joseph Gat and [[P\u00e1l Kadosa]].\n\nBy this time Jo\u00f3 had won his first international Piano competition in [[Taormina]] in Italy, playing the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1. As a child prodigy he periodically visited [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]] to study at the Mozarteum. At the age of 17 he was invited to give a solo recital in the Montreux festival (Switzerland) in the same series as Martha Argerich, Geza Anda, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. Joo\u2019s piano performances took him to Switzerland, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Germany.\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nAt the age of 20, Jo\u00f3 emigrated to the United States, to study at the [[Juilliard School]] of Music in New York City as a Special Student. In his first year of study at Juilliard, he won the First Prize of the [[International Franz Liszt Piano Competition]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He became a citizen of the [[United States]] and started his conducting career in [[San Diego]], [[California]] at the age of 21, conducting at the Summer Festival a production of the [[Mozart]]\u2019s ''Le Nozze di Figaro''. At the age of 22, he entered [[Indiana University]], in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] to study conducting. Jo\u00f3 graduated with a MM in Conducting (Orchestral and Opera). During this time he also studied conducting with [[Igor Markevitch]] in Monte Carlo after which he was named the resident Music Director and Principal Conductor of the [[Knoxville Symphony Orchestra]] in [[Tennessee]] at the age of 24. Joo was the youngest ever Music Director/Conductor of a metropolitan orchestra in the history of the United States.\n\nDuring this time he guest conducted in many different places including the Netherlands, Mexico, and the US. At the age of 26, the cultural arm of the United Nations, [[UNESCO]], selected him to conduct a special performance representing the United States in Monte Carlo \u2014which he accomplished to great critical acclaim. At this time he became a private student/confidante of the Italian conductor [[Carlo Maria Giulini]]. Next he became the Music Director and Principal Conductor of the [[Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra]]. During this time he had many guest conducting appearances all over the world, with many leading orchestras of the world, including the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], The [[Philharmonia Orchestra of London]], [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Amsterdam Philharmonic]], [[Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Vienna Tonkunstler Orchestra]].\n\nIn 1980-81, Jo\u00f3 recorded the complete orchestral works of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] with the Budapest Symphony and Philharmonic Orchestras. Virtually all the newspapers and magazines in the United States and Europe such as ''Newsweek'', ''Time Magazine'', ''New York Times'', ''Los Angeles Times'', ''San Francisco Chronicle'', ''Saturday Review'', ''Chicago Tribune'', ''The Times'', (even ''Sports Illustrated'' and ''National Geographic'') hailed these recordings as a milestone both in digital (then new) technology and the quality of the performances.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  ''Stereo Review'' (1981) awarded the Record of the Year to maestro Joo for his five-disc Bart\u00f3k set. In 1982, he recorded the complete orchestral works of Kod\u00e1ly. For the next 15 years, he conducted many of the leading orchestras of the world and toured in Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1987, Jo\u00f3 took the position of Music Director and Principal Conductor of the [[RTVE Symphony Orchestra|Orquesta Sinfonica De Radio Television Espanola]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] (Spanish Radio and Television Orchestra) under Royal Patronage. He was only the third foreign\u2013born conductor to hold this position (after [[Igor Markevitch]] and [[Sergiu Comissiona]]).

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. While primarily a first baseman, Branyan was capable of playing [[third base]] and the [[outfield]], as well. \n\nBranyan began his professional career in the Cleveland Indians minor league system. He made his big league debut with the Indians, on September 26, 1998, and was ranked the Indians' top prospect in 1999 by ''[[Baseball America]]''. Though he demonstrated the ability to hit [[home run]]s with Cleveland, his [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]] was low. Indians' manager [[Charlie Manuel]] suggested in 2002 that Branyan could benefit from more playing time, but he was traded to the Reds for prospect [[Ben Broussard]] during the season. Excited to have a \"clean slate,\" as he put it, Branyan hit 16 home runs with the Reds in 2002 but struggled with injuries in the 2003 campaign. Allowed to become a [[free agent]], he spent 2004 in the minor leagues for the [[Atlanta Braves]] and Cleveland before Milwaukee picked him up on July 26. In 51 games for the Brewers, Branyan hit 11 home runs. He competed with [[Wes Helms]] for the starting spot at third base in 2005 but again battled injuries much of the season. Branyan signed with the Devil Rays in 2006 and spent most of the year on their roster, but he expressed concern at the fact that he was not an everyday player with Tampa Bay. Traded to the Padres in August, he hit what was at the time the longest home run in [[Petco Park]] history, measured at 453 feet. He batted .197 for the Padres in 2007 and was released July 28. Branyan spent brief stints with the Phillies and Cardinals that season before becoming a free agent at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2008, Branyan split the season between Milwaukee and the minor leagues, hitting 12 home runs at both destinations while serving in a [[Platoon (sports)|platoon]] role with [[Bill Hall (utility player)|Bill Hall]] in Milwaukee. With the Mariners in 2009, Branyan started doing eye exercises with an [[ophthalmologist]]. He attributed them to his most successful year in the major leagues thus far, when he hit a career-high 31 home runs while serving as an everyday player much of the season. Branyan signed with the Indians again in 2010. After starting the year on the [[disabled list]], he hit 10 home runs for them before getting traded back to Seattle. With 15 home runs for the Mariners, Branyan finished the year with 25. He signed with the Diamondbacks in 2011, but only batted .197 with them and the Angels, with whom he finished the year. Branyan played in the minor leagues in 2012, did not play at all in 2013, and finished his career with time in the [[Mexican League]] and the Indians' system in 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nBranyan was born December 19, 1975, in [[Warner Robins, Georgia]].<ref name=\"bbrefbranyanmaj\"/> He graduated from [[Stratford Academy]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=316|title=Baseball: Eagles in College/Pros|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025094134/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=316|archivedate=October 25, 2007}}</ref> His high school fostered such athletic talent like professional football player [[Le Kevin Smith]] and professional golfer [[Peter Persons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=1688|title=Stratford Athletic Hall of Fame|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124083226/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=1688|archivedate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Branyan was selected as an All-Georgia State baseball player in both 1993 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=501|title=All State Players|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716004102/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=501|archivedate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> He was drafted out of Stratford Academy in the [[1994 Major League Baseball draft]] by the Cleveland Indians in the seventh round (185th pick overall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/draft.jsp?year=1994|title=1994 Draft \u2013 June Regular Phase|author=|date=|work=Major League Baseball|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Baseball career==\n===Cleveland Indians===\nBranyan began his professional career with the [[Minor League Baseball#Rookie|rookie-level]] [[Burlington Indians]] of the [[Appalachian League]] in {{baseball year|1994}}.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. While primarily a first baseman, Branyan was capable of playing [[third base]] and the [[outfield]], as well. \n\nBranyan began his professional career in the Cleveland Indians minor league system. He made his big league debut with the Indians, on September 26, 1998, and was ranked the Indians' top prospect in 1999 by ''[[Baseball America]]''. Though he demonstrated the ability to hit [[home run]]s with Cleveland, his [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]] was low. Indians' manager [[Charlie Manuel]] suggested in 2002 that Branyan could benefit from more playing time, but he was traded to the Reds for prospect [[Ben Broussard]] during the season. Excited to have a \"clean slate,\" as he put it, Branyan hit 16 home runs with the Reds in 2002 but struggled with injuries in the 2003 campaign. Allowed to become a [[free agent]], he spent 2004 in the minor leagues for the [[Atlanta Braves]] and Cleveland before Milwaukee picked him up on July 26. In 51 games for the Brewers, Branyan hit 11 home runs. He competed with [[Wes Helms]] for the starting spot at third base in 2005 but again battled injuries much of the season. Branyan signed with the Devil Rays in 2006 and spent most of the year on their roster, but he expressed concern at the fact that he was not an everyday player with Tampa Bay. Traded to the Padres in August, he hit what was at the time the longest home run in [[Petco Park]] history, measured at 453 feet. He batted .197 for the Padres in 2007 and was released July 28. Branyan spent brief stints with the Phillies and Cardinals that season before becoming a free agent at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2008, Branyan split the season between Milwaukee and the minor leagues, hitting 12 home runs at both destinations while serving in a [[Platoon (sports)|platoon]] role with [[Bill Hall (utility player)|Bill Hall]] in Milwaukee. With the Mariners in 2009, Branyan started doing eye exercises with an [[ophthalmologist]]. He attributed them to his most successful year in the major leagues thus far, when he hit a career-high 31 home runs while serving as an everyday player much of the season. Branyan signed with the Indians again in 2010. After starting the year on the [[disabled list]], he hit 10 home runs for them before getting traded back to Seattle. With 15 home runs for the Mariners, Branyan finished the year with 25. He signed with the Diamondbacks in 2011, but only batted .197 with them and the Angels, with whom he finished the year. Branyan played in the minor leagues in 2012, did not play at all in 2013, and finished his career with time in the [[Mexican League]] and the Indians' system in 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nBranyan was born December 19, 1975, in [[Warner Robins, Georgia]].<ref name=\"bbrefbranyanmaj\"/> He graduated from [[Stratford Academy]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=316|title=Baseball: Eagles in College/Pros|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025094134/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=316|archivedate=October 25, 2007}}</ref> His high school fostered such athletic talent like professional football player [[Le Kevin Smith]] and professional golfer [[Peter Persons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=1688|title=Stratford Athletic Hall of Fame|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124083226/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=1688|archivedate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Branyan was selected as an All-Georgia State baseball player in both 1993 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=501|title=All State Players|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716004102/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=501|archivedate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> He was drafted out of Stratford Academy in the [[1994 Major League Baseball draft]] by the Cleveland Indians in the seventh round (185th pick overall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/draft.jsp?year=1994|title=1994 Draft \u2013 June Regular Phase|author=|date=|work=Major League Baseball|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Baseball career==\n===Cleveland Indians===\nBranyan began his professional career with the [[Minor League Baseball#Rookie|rookie-level]] [[Burlington Indians]] of the [[Appalachian League]] in {{baseball year|1994}}.

Montefiore]]. He was born at the family home of number 12, [[Portman Square]] on 2 June 1889. His mother, Therese Alice, died on the following day, and so he was brought up by his grandmother, Emma Montefiore, who was from the wealthy [[Goldsmid family]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHe was educated at [[Clifton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he read history. While a student, he spent time in Berlin and Hanover, where he became fluent in German. After graduation, he worked and lived at [[Toynbee Hall]]\u2014a [[settlement movement|settlement]] house in which rich people lived alongside the poor to do social work and alleviate poverty.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nIn 1914, at the start of the [[First World War]], he joined a cycling battalion of the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]. He served in India and [[Siberian intervention|Siberia]], rising to the rank of captain. In 1918, he was admitted to the [[Order of the British Empire]], and in 1921 he joined the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]], being introduced by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Viscount Milner]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\nIn 1924, he married the sister of a close friend from college, Muriel Jeanetta Tuck (1892\u20131988), who was from the wealthy family that ran [[Raphael Tuck & Sons]]. They had two sons, David and Alan, who became a physician and Oxford don.<ref name=DNB/>{{clarify|date=April 2020}}<!-- who became a physician? -->\n\n==Charitable service==\nLeonard Montefiore was active in numerous charitable, cultural, and philanthropic organisations. [[Chaim Bermant]] wrote, \"He attended them all, gave money to them all, offered guidance to them all\".<ref name=DNB/>\n\nThese organisation included:<ref name=DNB/>\n* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] \u2013 president, vice-president, chairman of the industrial committee\n* [[Bernhard Baron Settlement]]\n* [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]\n* [[Clifton College]] \u2013 governor\n* [[Froebel Educational Institute]] \u2013 chairman 1939\u20131961\n* [[Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women]]\n* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]] \u2013 chairman of the industrial committee\n* [[Jewish Colonization Association]]\n* [[Jewish Refugees Committee]] \u2013 chairman\n* [[Jews\u2019 Free School]]\n* [[Jews\u2019 Temporary Shelter]]\n* [[League of British Jews]]\n* [[Leo Baeck College]] \u2013 chairman\n* [[Reform Synagogues Association]] \u2013 president\n* [[West London Synagogue]] \u2013 reader, senior treasurer, vice-president and warden\n* [[Wiener Library]] \u2013 founder and president\n\n==Germany and the Second World War==\nWhen Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and his National Socialist party seized power, they threatened the Jewish community in Germany. Montefiore was at that time co-chairman of the Joint Foreign Committee of the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] and the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]; the other co-chairman was [[Neville Laski]]. This committee had a tradition of protecting and supporting overseas Jews and it then established the [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]. Another founder member was Otto Schiff, who organised the Jewish Refugees Committee, which Montefiore chaired. The wealth supporting this fund enabled a promise to be made to the British government that Jewish refugees from Germany would not be a burden on public finances.<ref name=KC/> They also lobbied British society to protest against German discrimination against Jews but were not successful initially. Others wanted to organise a boycott of German goods but the Board of Deputies saw this as too extreme. There was also concern about [[Zionism|Zionist]] influence, which the Board opposed as subverting their status as British.<ref name=Gewirtz/> Montefiore was himself opposed to Zionism until he visited Israel in 1955.<ref name=DNB/>     \n\nMontefiore's fluency in the German language enabled him to study the details of the oppression of the Jews in Germany.<ref name=DNB/> He publicised these, writing articles, letters and [[pamphlet]]s including ''The Jews in Germany: Facts and Figures'' (1934) and ''Exiles from Germany'' (1937).<ref name=Palgrave/>\n\nIn 1944, he toured the Mediterranean theatre to meet [[Jewish Brigade|Jewish servicemen]] for the Welfare Branch of the [[War Office]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\n==The Windermere children==\nMontefiore organised aid for hundreds of Jewish orphans after the Second World War, acting as their [[legal guardian|guardian]] and arranging for them to be flown to England in heavy bombers by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].<ref name=ToI/> They had been liberated from Nazi concentration camps and so required care and rehabilitation for which he arranged a special camp at [[Windermere]]. Montefiore made regular visits and took a personal interest in their development. Nurse Eva Kahn-Minden recalled his manner,\n\n{{quote|text=Monty has been to pay one of his flying visits.

Julie is awakened by Nick knocking on the door wanting to get back together. Lynette walks up to the front door and overhears Julie and Nick arguing. When Lynette asks what was going on, Julie reluctantly reveals to Lynette that Nick is the man she was having the affair with. Lynette tells Julie she will take care of it and promises not to tell Susan. The next day, Lynette confronts Nick by telling him she knows about the affair and demands he leave Julie alone. Nick warns Lynette that if he finds out she told anyone about the affair she will be sorry. Tom and Lynette tell Julie they think Nick is responsible for her attack, but she refuses to believe it would be him, however after Tom and Lynette tell her they care about her wellbeing, it is clear that even Julie is doubting his innocence.\n\nGaby continues to struggle teaching Juanita so Carlos tells her he will get a housekeeper but Gaby wants a tutor. Carlos reminds Gaby that Juanita just had to leave all her friends and school so he does not want Gaby to abandon her for a stranger. Gaby tries to get Juanita to focus by offering to get ice cream if she finishes the page but she turns Gaby down so she has the housekeeper watch Juanita while she gets some air. When Gaby returns she is surprised that Juanita finished the problems but she tells her that the housekeeper helped her. After finding out the housekeeper has a Ph.D she has her skip cleaning the house and tutor Juanita instead. Later, Carlos comes home to find the house a total mess so he calls the agency to get a different housekeeper. The new housekeeper has trouble speaking and understanding English so Gaby goes over to where Ivana is and while she tutors Juanita, Gaby does her job by scrubbing the floors. Gaby tells Carlos that teaching Juanita is hurting their mother-daughter relationship so Carlos agrees to find a better solution.\n\nMike and Susan are at the police station hoping to get the detectives to interrogate Katherine as they believe she is responsible for attacking Julie. The two pompous detectives do not believe it was Katherine and find it hilarious that Susan believes Katherine mistook her for Julie, even in the dim light of night. They sarcastically tell Susan that they will continue to treat it as a random attack unless there is actual evidence. Just as Mike and Susan are about to give up, a female detective offers to look into Katherine and after they leave she informs the other detectives that she and Susan go way back. Later, when Susan is telling the detective about Katherine, the detective tells Susan that she used to go to high school with her and that her name is Denise. Denise goes over to Katherine's to check out her alibi, but Susan does not want Katherine finding out she is the one accusing her so she tells Denise to say it was an anonymous tip. After seeing Denise's picture in the yearbook, Susan realizes she had a hand in giving Denise the nickname \"Moose\" and stole her boyfriend. Mike reassures her that nobody holds a grudge that long but they see Denise and Katherine hugging through the window. Later, when Susan goes back to the station, Denise informs her that Katherine could not have strangled Julie as she was on the phone to her daughter, Dylan, all night and the phone records prove it. But Denise also tells Susan that Katherine told her about Susan shooting Katherine, and not reporting it is a crime so the clearly vindictive detective has Susan arrested and put in jail. Lynette and Tom then go to the police station informing the detectives that Nick was having an affair with Julie and she ended it right before she was attacked. That evening, Angie tells Nick that the police called her to ask about his whereabouts the night Julie was attacked, and she lied to them by explaining that he was with her all night. Angie tells Nick that she has known about his affair with Julie for weeks and lets it slide because of everything that she has put him through. When Nick asks her if they are good, Angie punches him in the nose and tells him they are now.\n\nAngie invites Bree and Orson over for dinner but Bree is not looking forward to it as she is not fond of Angie. Bree is surprised at how much she enjoys Angie's cooking so Nick suggests she hire Angie but Bree tells them they are not hiring. Angie is fine with it but Nick continues to push for it which angers Angie. After an awkward silence, Angie blames Nick for making them wish they never came. The next day, Bree tries to convince an Italian couple to hire her for their anniversary party but the husband does not want elegant food. When Bree finds out there will be 500 guests she lies and tells the couple she is Italian and will make a complete Italian meal. Bree tries to get Angie to give her the family recipes for the dinner she made but she does not share them with anyone but changes her mind after Bree lies about her friend having been in a fire. Later, when Angie drops by the test kitchen she notices the large amounts of food and discovers it is for a catering job. When Orson tries to give Bree jewelry, she snaps at him by telling him she wants a divorce and to stop trying to change her mind. After Bree and Angie get all their opinions of each other out in the open, Angie agrees to work for Bree and helps her with the catering job.\n\n==Notes==\n*The title is taken from the lyrics of the song \"Children Will Listen\" written by [[Stephen Sondheim]] for the musical [[Into the Woods]].\n*Although credited, [[Maiara Walsh]] ([[Ana Solis]]), [[Charles Carver]] ([[Porter Scavo]]), Joshua Logan Moore ([[Parker Scavo]]), and [[Mason Vale Cotton (actor)|Mason Vale Cotton]] ([[Acquaintances of Susan Mayer#M.J.
