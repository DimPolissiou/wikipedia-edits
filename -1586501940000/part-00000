While once a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] stronghold, the constituency was captured from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government by the [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance]] at a dramatic [[1985 Brecon and Radnor by-election|by-election in 1985]]. It was regained by the Conservatives in 1992, taken back by the Liberal Democrat from 1997\u20132015, and then went back to the Conservatives in 2015 and 2017. It was the Conservative Party's fifteenth target seat at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]], but their share of the vote fell, leaving it as the Conservatives' 95th target seat in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], requiring a swing of 5.09%. In the event, the swing to the Conservatives was 0.3%, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] retained the seat, with [[Roger Williams (UK politician)|Roger Williams]] remaining the MP. In 2015 the seat was reclaimed for the [[Conservatives]] by [[Chris Davies (Conservative politician)|Chris Davies]] whose majority of 5,102 was the largest in the constituency since [[Tom Hooson]] won the seat, also for the Conservatives, in 1983. Roger Williams stood for the Liberal Democrats in 2015 but shed over 6,500 votes from his 2010 result, a loss of 17.8%.\n\nIn 2019, Davies pleaded guilty to filing false expenses claims, triggering a [[2019 Brecon and Radnorshire recall petition|recall petition]], the third such [[Recall election#United Kingdom|petition]] in the UK. The petition was successful, forcing Davies to vacate the seat.<ref>{{cite news |title=Recall petition for convicted MP confirmed |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-48038005 |work=BBC

While once a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] stronghold, the constituency was captured from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government by the [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance]] at a dramatic [[1985 Brecon and Radnor by-election|by-election in 1985]]. It was regained by the Conservatives in 1992, taken back by the Liberal Democrat from 1997\u20132015, and then went back to the Conservatives in 2015 and 2017. It was the Conservative Party's fifteenth target seat at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]], but their share of the vote fell, leaving it as the Conservatives' 95th target seat in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], requiring a swing of 5.09%. In the event, the swing to the Conservatives was 0.3%, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] retained the seat, with [[Roger Williams (UK politician)|Roger Williams]] remaining the MP. In 2015 the seat was reclaimed for the [[Conservatives]] by [[Chris Davies (Conservative politician)|Chris Davies]] whose majority of 5,102 was the largest in the constituency since [[Tom Hooson]] won the seat, also for the Conservatives, in 1983. Roger Williams stood for the Liberal Democrats in 2015 but shed over 6,500 votes from his 2010 result, a loss of 17.8%.\n\nIn 2019, Davies pleaded guilty to filing false expenses claims, triggering a [[2019 Brecon and Radnorshire recall petition|recall petition]], the third such [[Recall election#United Kingdom|petition]] in the UK. The petition was successful, forcing Davies to vacate the seat.<ref>{{cite news |title=Recall petition for convicted MP confirmed |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-48038005 |work=BBC

[[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.

The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

[[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

The jacky winter is instead a [[sexually monomorphic]] bird, which means that both the male and female are almost identical in appearance.<ref name=\"wood\" /> Rather than plumage playing a significant role in attracting the opposite sex, the jacky winter male uses song to attract a female during courtship.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In the eastern states of Australia, the jacky winter breeds mostly to the west of the Great Dividing Range, where a suitable habitat of eucalyptus woodland is present. They build a small, open cup-shaped [[nest]], which is often made from grass and bark strips held together by spider webs. The nest is built in an exposed position, usually on a fork of a branch.<ref name=\"wood\" />\n\nThe breeding season of jacky winters occurs from September to November. Leading up to September, singing from the males is at its highest peak, then as the [[nestlings]] are born around late September, the singing becomes quite minimal.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In late October, the singing increases again, lasting until early November, when the females lay a second [[brooding|brood]] of the season. By late November with the hatching of the young, the males stop singing, making vocalisations almost non-existent from then on. It stays like this until the birds have left the area.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> The nesting period lasts for 15 to 20 days, while the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] is between 16 and 18 days. Only the female will [[Egg incubation|incubate]] the eggs, while the male will help feed the young once they have hatched. 92 per cent of the time, the female will lay only two eggs per clutch.<ref name=\"wood\" />  It is uncommon for this number to vary, since many different [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors determine the number of eggs per clutch in order to maximize the survival rate of fledglings from the nest.<ref>Winkler, D.

The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding that contain a [[eucalyptus]] box woodland or open box woodland, which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular sustained call. The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2&nbsp;ha for one pair.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\n== Status ==\n\nThe jacky winter is a common species of bird found throughout [[Australia]], and is described as a bird of [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

This is a continuous activity that can cover long distances in order to find prey items.<ref name=\"rec\" /> The jacky winter has two methods of hunting, which include hawking and ground-pouncing. Hawking is when a bird flies and drops to the ground, grabbing their prey during flight, while ground-pouncing is when they fly from a perch, grabbing prey as they land.<ref name=\"mill\">Miller, J.

The jacky winter is instead a [[sexually monomorphic]] bird, which means that both the male and female are almost identical in appearance.<ref name=\"wood\" /> Rather than plumage playing a significant role in attracting the opposite sex, the jacky winter male uses song to attract a female during courtship.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In the eastern states of Australia, the jacky winter breeds mostly to the west of the Great Dividing Range, where a suitable habitat of eucalyptus woodland is present. They build a small, open cup-shaped [[nest]], which is often made from grass and bark strips held together by spider webs. The nest is built in an exposed position, usually on a fork of a branch.<ref name=\"wood\" />\n\nThe breeding season of jacky winters occurs from September to November. Leading up to September, singing from the males is at its highest peak, then as the [[nestlings]] are born around late September, the singing becomes quite minimal.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In late October, the singing increases again, lasting until early November, when the females lay a second [[brooding|brood]] of the season. By late November with the hatching of the young, the males stop singing, making vocalisations almost non-existent from then on. It stays like this until the birds have left the area.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> The nesting period lasts for 15 to 20 days, while the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] is between 16 and 18 days. Only the female will [[Egg incubation|incubate]] the eggs, while the male will help feed the young once they have hatched. 92 per cent of the time, the female will lay only two eggs per clutch.<ref name=\"wood\" />  It is uncommon for this number to vary, since many different [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors determine the number of eggs per clutch in order to maximize the survival rate of fledglings from the nest.<ref>Winkler, D.

The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding that contain a [[eucalyptus]] box woodland or open box woodland, which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular sustained call. The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2&nbsp;ha for one pair.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\n== Status ==\n\nThe jacky winter is a common species of bird found throughout [[Australia]], and is described as a bird of [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

It returns one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), elected by the [[first past the post]] system.\n\n==Boundaries==\nPontypridd constituency can be split into two parts, an eastern part containing the town itself, and a western part focussed on Llantrisant. In [[Pontypridd]] township itself the wards are: Town, [[Treforest]], Rhondda (consisting of [[Hopkinstown]], [[Maesycoed]], [[Graigwen]], [[Trehafod]], & [[Pwllgwaun]]), [[Graig, Pontypridd|Graig]], [[Trallwng]], [[Rhydyfelin]] Central & Ilan, & [[Hawthorn, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Hawthorn]]. The Western half consists of the following wards: [[Taffs Well]], [[Beddau]], [[Church Village]], [[Tonteg]], [[Llantwit Fardre]], [[Llantrisant]], [[Pontyclun]], [[Talbot Green]], [[Tonyrefail]] East and Tonyrefail West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcomm-wales.gov.uk/fifth_review/midglamstatistics_e.pdf |title=Comisiwn Ffiniau i Gymru |publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales |date= |accessdate=2016-07-23}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, one can think of the constituency as being divided between a 'suburban' district in the south and communities that grew in the industrial revolution to the north; the Southern area, particularly between Church Village and Llantrisant, contains much new residential and light industrial development, and benefits from good transport links due to its proximity to the M4. This section has a growing population and is an important 'dormitory' for Cardiff. The Northern parts, particularly Tonyrefail and the northern end of Pontypridd town consists of large sections of 19th century housing and suffered high unemployment in the 1980s as the old industries closed. However, in recent years, economic recovery has been firm, especially considered with neighbouring constituencies to the north.\n\nThe Pontypridd constituency was created in its original form from parts of the old [[South Glamorganshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Glamorganshire]] & [[East Glamorganshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Glamorganshire]] constituencies as part of [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] (sometimes referred to as 'The Fourth Reform Act') which granted virtually all men over 21 the right to vote, extended voting rights to women over 30 years of age, & increased the number of the now abolished [[University constituencies]]. Part of this Act also effected a 'General Redistribution of Seats' on an 'equitable basis'.<ref>The Times House of Commons Guide 1910, 1911, 1919, Poltico's Publishing Page 8 1918 Election section</ref> It originally included the old Borough & Rural district of [[Cowbridge]] (which included [[Ystradowen]], [[Bonvilston]], [[St Athan]], [[Llantwit Major]] & [[Llandow]]) & the Urban district of Pontypridd plus the Rural District of Llantrisant & Llantwit Fardre.<ref>The Times House of Commons Guide 1950, The Times Office, Printing House Square Page 55</ref> The constituency remained unchanged from this form until the Third Periodic Parliamentary Boundary Review's proposals were implemented in 1983.<ref>Third Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission for Wales. February 1983.\nCmd.8798.</ref> This removed Cowbridge Borough and the Cowbridge Rural District placing them in the [[Vale of Glamorgan (UK Parliament constituency)|Vale of Glamorgan constituency]] additionally moving out the communities of [[Llanharry]], [[Llanharan]], and [[Brynna]]  into the [[Ogmore (UK Parliament constituency)|Ogmore constituency]]. However, the communities of [[Creigiau]] and [[Pentyrch]] were added to the seat at this time, only to be removed again in time for the 2010 general election.\n\nPrior to 2010 the Pontypridd Constituency also consisted of the [[Cilfynydd]], [[Glyncoch]], [[Creigiau & St. Fagans|Creigiau]] & [[Pentyrch]] Wards. The Fifth Periodic Parliamentary Boundary Review for Wales placed Cilfynydd & Glyncoch wards in the [[Cynon Valley (UK Parliament constituency)]] <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bcomm-wales.gov.uk/fifth_review/midglamstatistics_e.pdf| title = Fifth Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission for Wales | publisher = Stationery Office | accessdate = 2014-04-03}}</ref> & the Creigiau & Pentyrch wards in the [[Cardiff West (UK Parliament constituency)]]. These changes were made & in place for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\nLike many seats in South Wales, Pontypridd has been retained by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] for over 97 years.\n\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| Election !!

It returns one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), elected by the [[first past the post]] system.\n\n==Boundaries==\nPontypridd constituency can be split into two parts, an eastern part containing the town itself, and a western part focussed on Llantrisant. In [[Pontypridd]] township itself the wards are: Town, [[Treforest]], Rhondda (consisting of [[Hopkinstown]], [[Maesycoed]], [[Graigwen]], [[Trehafod]], & [[Pwllgwaun]]), [[Graig, Pontypridd|Graig]], [[Trallwng]], [[Rhydyfelin]] Central & Ilan, & [[Hawthorn, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Hawthorn]]. The Western half consists of the following wards: [[Taffs Well]], [[Beddau]], [[Church Village]], [[Tonteg]], [[Llantwit Fardre]], [[Llantrisant]], [[Pontyclun]], [[Talbot Green]], [[Tonyrefail]] East and Tonyrefail West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcomm-wales.gov.uk/fifth_review/midglamstatistics_e.pdf |title=Comisiwn Ffiniau i Gymru |publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales |date= |accessdate=2016-07-23}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, one can think of the constituency as being divided between a 'suburban' district in the south and communities that grew in the industrial revolution to the north; the Southern area, particularly between Church Village and Llantrisant, contains much new residential and light industrial development, and benefits from good transport links due to its proximity to the M4. This section has a growing population and is an important 'dormitory' for Cardiff. The Northern parts, particularly Tonyrefail and the northern end of Pontypridd town consists of large sections of 19th century housing and suffered high unemployment in the 1980s as the old industries closed. However, in recent years, economic recovery has been firm, especially considered with neighbouring constituencies to the north.\n\nThe Pontypridd constituency was created in its original form from parts of the old [[South Glamorganshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Glamorganshire]] & [[East Glamorganshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Glamorganshire]] constituencies as part of [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] (sometimes referred to as 'The Fourth Reform Act') which granted virtually all men over 21 the right to vote, extended voting rights to women over 30 years of age, & increased the number of the now abolished [[University constituencies]]. Part of this Act also effected a 'General Redistribution of Seats' on an 'equitable basis'.<ref>The Times House of Commons Guide 1910, 1911, 1919, Poltico's Publishing Page 8 1918 Election section</ref> It originally included the old Borough & Rural district of [[Cowbridge]] (which included [[Ystradowen]], [[Bonvilston]], [[St Athan]], [[Llantwit Major]] & [[Llandow]]) & the Urban district of Pontypridd plus the Rural District of Llantrisant & Llantwit Fardre.<ref>The Times House of Commons Guide 1950, The Times Office, Printing House Square Page 55</ref> The constituency remained unchanged from this form until the Third Periodic Parliamentary Boundary Review's proposals were implemented in 1983.<ref>Third Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission for Wales. February 1983.\nCmd.8798.</ref> This removed Cowbridge Borough and the Cowbridge Rural District placing them in the [[Vale of Glamorgan (UK Parliament constituency)|Vale of Glamorgan constituency]] additionally moving out the communities of [[Llanharry]], [[Llanharan]], and [[Brynna]]  into the [[Ogmore (UK Parliament constituency)|Ogmore constituency]]. However, the communities of [[Creigiau]] and [[Pentyrch]] were added to the seat at this time, only to be removed again in time for the 2010 general election.\n\nPrior to 2010 the Pontypridd Constituency also consisted of the [[Cilfynydd]], [[Glyncoch]], [[Creigiau & St. Fagans|Creigiau]] & [[Pentyrch]] Wards. The Fifth Periodic Parliamentary Boundary Review for Wales placed Cilfynydd & Glyncoch wards in the [[Cynon Valley (UK Parliament constituency)]] <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bcomm-wales.gov.uk/fifth_review/midglamstatistics_e.pdf| title = Fifth Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission for Wales | publisher = Stationery Office | accessdate = 2014-04-03}}</ref> & the Creigiau & Pentyrch wards in the [[Cardiff West (UK Parliament constituency)]]. These changes were made & in place for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\nLike many seats in South Wales, Pontypridd has been retained by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] for over 97 years.\n\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| Election !!
