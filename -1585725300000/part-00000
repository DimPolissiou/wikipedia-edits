They have long, thin legs; a pointy, downward curving bill; and a brush-like tipped tongue. Adult males are covered in brown feathers, have red crowns and under parts; a black mask around their eyes; and white throats. Females and younger chats are colored similarly, but with paler markings. The males are usually more brightly colored than females, specifically during the breeding season in order to attract a mate.\n\n==='''Similar species'''===\nA bird species similar to and often confused with the crimson chat is the male [[red-capped robin]], whose scientific name is ''Petroica goodenovii''. However, there are three main differences between their characteristics. A male crimson chat has crimson crown and underparts, white throat and a yellow eye; whereas the red-capped robin has a black body with crimson chest and cap, white wing marks and a dark eye. Also, the crimson chat's bill is thinner and longer than the robin's. When a crimson chat is seen, a saltbush, ''Spinifex'', or mulga can usually be found nearby, as they are plants often associated with this species. According to relevant Federal and NSW organizations, the conservation of this bird is secure. Its only significant threat is being killed by predators.'''\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nCrimson chats can be found in deserts, semi-arid regions, woodlands, grasslands and coastal shrublands in the central part of Australia from the west coast to the Great Dividing Range and from the tropics to the south coast. Generally, they tend to inhabit areas on the fringes of wet regions, where it is more dry. They live in various types of shrubland: saltbush, bluebush, acacia and samphire. They move to wetter areas when rainfall is insufficient, which means that there are not enough nutrients produced for the birds to consume. Flocks of crimson chats may wander over a wide area around their range in order to track rain. This nomadic movement helps them find the best flowers and nectar. However, chats do not follow routine seasonal migrations.\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[Image:Crimson Chat female.jpg|thumb|left|Female]]\n\n===Diet===\nCrimson chats eat insects and spiders that are on the ground or in shrubs, and they can use their brush-like tongue to extract nectar or take seeds from flowers close to the ground. They walk more often than they hop and are usually seen on or near the ground.\n\n===Breeding===\nCrimson chats are found in small flocks and go in pairs throughout the breeding season and the rest of the year. Chats have a long breeding season from August to November and a shorter period after the rain season from March to April. These flocks form clusters of nests, which are defended by both the male and female chats. Most calls are soft, metallic twangs (\u2018dik it - dik it\u2019) or high pitched whistles (like \u2018see\u2019 or 'seet'). When agitated they make a chattering sound (a quick \u2018check - check\u2019), which is where their name originates.\n\nIn this species, both sexes help build a nest in a cup shape, which is located close to the ground. It is usually made with grass, rootlets, hair, feathers and twigs. The female lays 2 to 5 pink and white, brown-red spotted eggs, approximately 1\u20132&nbsp;cm (\u00bd inch) in length and width. Both parents help incubate the eggs for around two weeks and feed the young birds once they have hatched until they can fly on their own to find food. If a predator comes near the nest either parent will fake an injury to distract the creature away from the nest. Predators include cats, snakes, foxes and larger birds like ravens.\n\n==== Summary of Facts ==== <br />'''Minimum Size:''' 11&nbsp;cm<br />'''Maximum Size:''' 13&nbsp;cm<br />'''Average Size:''' 12&nbsp;cm<br />'''Minimum Weight:''' 9 g<br />'''Maximum Weight:''' 12 g<br />'''Average Weight:''' 10.5 g<br />'''Breeding Season:''' August to October (or any time after rain)<br />'''Clutch Size:''' 2 to 4<br />'''Incubation:''' 14 days<br />'''Time in Nest:''' 14 days<br />'''Egg Size:''' 17x14&nbsp;mm\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Honeyeaters and Australian Chats.\"Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds. 1st ed. 2003.\n* Perrins, Christopher. \"Australian Chats.\"Birds: Their Life, Their Ways, Their World. 3rd ed. 1979.\n* \"Australian Chats: Epthianuridae.\" 21 Dec 2003. 13 Dec 2006 [http://montereybay.com/creagrus/Australian_chats.html].\n* \"Australian Chat.\" Ebsco Animals.

After graduating from the Academy, he became a teacher there and began his career as a composer in 1959 during the [[Warsaw Autumn]] festival. His ''Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima'' for [[string orchestra]] and the choral work ''St. Luke Passion'' have received popular acclaim. His first opera, ''[[The Devils of Loudun (opera)|The Devils of Loudun]]'', was not immediately successful. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Penderecki's composing style changed, with his first violin concerto focusing on the [[semitone]] and the [[tritone]]. His choral work ''Polish Requiem'' was written in the 1980s and expanded in 1993 and 2005.\n\nPenderecki won many prestigious awards, including the [[Prix Italia]] in 1967 and 1968; four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1987, 1998 (twice), and 2017; the [[Wolf Prize in Arts]] in 1987; and the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award (Music Composition)|Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition]] in 1992.<ref name=grawemeyer.org>{{Cite web|url=http://grawemeyer.org/1992-krzysztof-penderecki/|title=1992 \u2013 Krzysztof Penderecki \u2013 Grawemeyer Awards|website=Grawemeyer.org}}</ref> In 2012, [[Sean Michaels (writer)|Sean Michaels]] of ''The Guardian'' called him \"arguably Poland's greatest living composer\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/23/jonny-greenwood-krzysztof-penderecki?newsfeed=true | work=The Guardian | first=Sean | last=Michaels | title=Jonny Greenwood reveals details of Krzysztof Penderecki collaboration | date=23 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n===1933\u20131958: Early years===\nPenderecki was born on 23 November 1933 in [[D\u0119bica]], the son of Zofia and Tadeusz Penderecki, a lawyer.

Tadeusz was a [[violin]]ist and also played [[piano]].<ref name=\"Schwinger16\"/>\n\nIn 1939, the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out, and Penderecki's family moved out of their apartment as the Ministry of Food was to operate there. After the war, Penderecki began attending [[grammar school]] in 1946. He began studying the violin under Stanis\u0142aw Dar\u0142ak, D\u0119bica's military bandmaster who organized an orchestra for the local music society after the war.<ref name=\"Schwinger17\">Schwinger, p. 17.</ref> Upon graduating from grammar school, Penderecki moved to Krak\u00f3w in 1951, where he attended [[Jagiellonian University]].<ref name=\"Schwinger17\"/> He studied violin with Stanis\u0142aw Tawroszewicz and music theory with Franciszek Sko\u0142yszewski.<ref name=\"Schwinger18\">Schwinger, p. 18.</ref> In 1954, Penderecki entered the [[Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w]] and, having finished his studies on violin after his first year, focused entirely on composition. Penderecki's main teacher there was Artur Malawski, a composer known for his choral and orchestral works, as well as chamber music and songs. After Malawski's death in 1957, Penderecki took further lessons with [[Stanis\u0142aw Wiechowicz]], a composer primarily known for his choral works.<ref name=\"Schwinger18&19\">Schwinger, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> At the time, the 1956 overthrow of [[Stalinism]] in Poland lifted strict cultural censorship and opened the door to a wave of creativity.<ref name=\"LOC1\">{{cite journal |last =Monastra |first =Peggy |title =Krzysztof Penderecki's Polymorphia and Fluorescences |journal = Moldenhauer Archives, Library of Congress |url =http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/moldenhauer/2428143.pdf | accessdate = 19 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===1958\u20131970s: First compositions===\nOn graduating from the Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w in 1958, Penderecki took up a teaching post at the Academy. His early works show the influence of [[Anton Webern]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] (Penderecki was also influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]]). Penderecki's international recognition began in 1959 at the [[Warsaw Autumn]] with the premieres of the works ''Strophen'', ''Psalms of David'', and ''Emanations'', but the piece that truly brought him to international attention was ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'' (see [[threnody]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]), written in 1960 for 52 [[string instrument]]s. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece). There are many novel textures in the work, which makes extensive use of [[tone cluster]]s. He originally titled the work ''8' 37\"'', but decided to dedicate it to the victims of Hiroshima.<ref>Thomas (2008), p. 165</ref>\n\n''Fluorescences'' followed a year later; it increases the orchestral density with more wind and brass, and an enormous percussion section of 32 instruments for six players, including a Mexican g\u00fciro, typewriters, gongs and other unusual instruments. The piece was composed for the [[Donaueschingen Festival]] of contemporary music of 1962, and its performance was regarded as provocative and controversial. Even the score appeared revolutionary; the form of [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] that Penderecki had developed rejected the familiar look of notes on a staff, instead representing music as morphing sounds.<ref name=\"LOC1\" /> His intentions at this stage were quite [[John Cage|Cagean]]: \"All I'm interested in is liberating sound beyond all tradition.\"<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite web |last =Tomaszewski |first =Mieczyslaw |year =2000 |title =Orchestral Works Vol 1 Liner Notes |journal = |url =https://www.amazon.com/Penderecki-Orchestral-Works-Vol-01/dp/B00004D3II | accessdate = }}</ref> This preoccupation with sound culminated in ''De Natura Sonoris I'', which frequently calls upon the orchestra to use non-standard playing techniques to produce original sounds and colours. A sequel, ''De Natura Sonoris II'', was composed in 1971: with its more limited orchestra, it incorporates more elements of post-[[Romanticism]] than its predecessor. This foreshadowed Penderecki's renunciation of the avant-garde in the mid-1970s, although both pieces feature dramatic [[glissando]]s, dense clusters, use of harmonics, and unusual instruments (the [[musical saw]] features in the second piece).\n\nIn 1968 Penderecki received the State Prize 1st class.<ref>''Dziennik Polski'', rok XXIV, nr 172 (7599), p. 6.</ref> During the jubilee of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] he received the Commander's Cross (1974)<ref>Dziennik Polski, rok XXX, nr 175 (9456), p. 2.</ref> and Knight's Cross of [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1964).<ref>Dziennik Polski, rok XX, nr 171 (6363), p. 6.</ref>\n\n===''The St. Luke Passion''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!'''Year''' || '''Song title'''   || '''Work'''  || '''Instrumentation'''\n|-\n| 1968:\n| \"Miserere mei, Deus\"<br />''{{audio|Krzysztof Penderecki Miserere mei-Deus.ogg|Listen}}''\n|| Saint Luke Passion\n|| Chorus\n|}\n\nThe large-scale ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1963\u201366) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, not least because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Western audiences saw it as a snub to the Soviet authorities. Various different musical styles can be seen in the piece. The experimental textures, such as were employed in the ''Threnody'', are balanced by the work's [[Baroque music|Baroque]] form and the occasional use of more traditional [[harmony|harmonic]] and [[melody|melodic]] writing. Penderecki makes use of [[serialism]] in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the [[BACH motif]], which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The [[Stabat Mater#Musical settings|Stabat Mater]] section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple [[chord (music)|chord]] of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walter |first=Meinrad |date=2002 |title=Avantgarde mit menschlichem Antlitz |url=https://www.herder.de/hk/hefte/archiv/2002/10-2002/avantgarde-mit-menschlichem-antlitz-ein-portraet-des-komponisten-und-guardini-preistraegers-krzysztof-penderecki/ |journal=Herder Korrespondenz |volume=2002 |issue=10 |pages=507\u2013512 |doi= |language=de |access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPenderecki continued to write pieces that explored the sacred in music.

The [[Violin Concerto]] No. 1 largely leaves behind the dense tone clusters with which he had been associated, and instead focuses on two [[melody|melodic]] intervals: the [[semitone]] and the [[tritone]]. This direction continued with the [[Symphony No. 2 (Penderecki)|Symphony No. 2, ''Christmas'']] (1980), which is harmonically and melodically quite straightforward. It makes frequent use of the tune of the [[Christmas carol]] ''[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]''.\n\nPenderecki explained this shift by stating that he had come to feel that the experimentation of the avant-garde had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: \"The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of [[Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Nono]], Boulez and Cage was for us, the young \u2013 hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country \u2013 a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation, and formal speculation, is more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone.\" Penderecki concluded that he was \"saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition\".<ref name=\"liner\"/> Penderecki has written relatively little chamber music. However, compositions for smaller ensembles range in date from the start of his career to the end, reflecting the changes his style of writing has undergone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naxos.com/person/Krzysztof_Penderecki_21188/21188.htm|title=Krzysztof Penderecki- Bio, Albums, Pictures \u2013 Naxos Classical Music.|website=Naxos.com|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Penderecki was commissioned by [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] to compose a piece to accompany the unveiling of a statue at the [[Gda\u0144sk]] shipyards to commemorate those killed in anti-government riots there in 1970. Penderecki responded with ''Lacrimosa'', which he later expanded into one of the best-known works of his later period, the ''[[Polish Requiem]]'' (1980\u201384, 1993, 2005). Later, he tended towards more traditionally conceived tonal constructs, as heard in works such as the Cello Concerto No. 2 and the [[Credo (Penderecki)|Credo]], which received the [[Grammy Award]] for best choral performance for the world-premiere recording made by the [[Oregon Bach Festival]], which commissioned the piece. The same year, Penderecki was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Prize]] in Spain, one of the highest honours given in Spain to individuals, entities, organizations or others from around the world who make notable achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, or public affairs. Invited by [[Walter Fink]], he was the eleventh composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2001.

His ''Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima'' for [[string orchestra]] and the choral work ''St. Luke Passion'' have received popular acclaim. His first opera, ''[[The Devils of Loudun (opera)|The Devils of Loudun]]'', was not immediately successful. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Penderecki's composing style changed, with his first violin concerto focusing on the [[semitone]] and the [[tritone]].

After the war, Penderecki began attending [[grammar school]] in 1946. He began studying the violin under Stanis\u0142aw Dar\u0142ak, D\u0119bica's military bandmaster who organized an orchestra for the local music society after the war.<ref name=\"Schwinger17\">Schwinger, p. 17.</ref> Upon graduating from grammar school, Penderecki moved to Krak\u00f3w in 1951, where he attended [[Jagiellonian University]].<ref name=\"Schwinger17\"/> He studied violin with Stanis\u0142aw Tawroszewicz and music theory with Franciszek Sko\u0142yszewski.<ref name=\"Schwinger18\">Schwinger, p. 18.</ref> In 1954, Penderecki entered the [[Academy of Music in Krak\u00f3w]] and, having finished his studies on violin after his first year, focused entirely on composition.

His early works show the influence of [[Anton Webern]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] (Penderecki was also influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]]). Penderecki's international recognition began in 1959 at the [[Warsaw Autumn]] with the premieres of the works ''Strophen'', ''Psalms of David'', and ''Emanations'', but the piece that truly brought him to international attention was ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'' (see [[threnody]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]), written in 1960 for 52 [[string instrument]]s. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece). There are many novel textures in the work, which makes extensive use of [[tone cluster]]s. He originally titled the work ''8' 37\"'', but decided to dedicate it to the victims of Hiroshima.<ref>Thomas (2008), p. 165</ref>\n\n''Fluorescences'' followed a year later; it increases the orchestral density with more wind and brass, and an enormous percussion section of 32 instruments for six players, including a Mexican g\u00fciro, typewriters, gongs and other unusual instruments. The piece was composed for the [[Donaueschingen Festival]] of contemporary music of 1962, and its performance was regarded as provocative and controversial. Even the score appeared revolutionary; the form of [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] that Penderecki had developed rejected the familiar look of notes on a staff, instead representing music as morphing sounds.<ref name=\"LOC1\" /> His intentions at this stage were quite [[John Cage|Cagean]]: \"All I'm interested in is liberating sound beyond all tradition.\"<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite web |last =Tomaszewski |first =Mieczyslaw |year =2000 |title =Orchestral Works Vol 1 Liner Notes |journal = |url =https://www.amazon.com/Penderecki-Orchestral-Works-Vol-01/dp/B00004D3II | accessdate = }}</ref> This preoccupation with sound culminated in ''De Natura Sonoris I'', which frequently calls upon the orchestra to use non-standard playing techniques to produce original sounds and colours. A sequel, ''De Natura Sonoris II'', was composed in 1971: with its more limited orchestra, it incorporates more elements of post-[[Romanticism]] than its predecessor. This foreshadowed Penderecki's renunciation of the avant-garde in the mid-1970s, although both pieces feature dramatic [[glissando]]s, dense clusters, use of harmonics, and unusual instruments (the [[musical saw]] features in the second piece).\n\nIn 1968 Penderecki received the State Prize 1st class.<ref>''Dziennik Polski'', rok XXIV, nr 172 (7599), p. 6.</ref> During the jubilee of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] he received the Commander's Cross (1974)<ref>Dziennik Polski, rok XXX, nr 175 (9456), p. 2.</ref> and Knight's Cross of [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1964).<ref>Dziennik Polski, rok XX, nr 171 (6363), p. 6.</ref>\n\n===''The St. Luke Passion''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!'''Year''' || '''Song title'''   || '''Work'''  || '''Instrumentation'''\n|-\n| 1968:\n| \"Miserere mei, Deus\"<br />''{{audio|Krzysztof Penderecki Miserere mei-Deus.ogg|Listen}}''\n|| Saint Luke Passion\n|| Chorus\n|}\n\nThe large-scale ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1963\u201366) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, not least because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Western audiences saw it as a snub to the Soviet authorities. Various different musical styles can be seen in the piece. The experimental textures, such as were employed in the ''Threnody'', are balanced by the work's [[Baroque music|Baroque]] form and the occasional use of more traditional [[harmony|harmonic]] and [[melody|melodic]] writing. Penderecki makes use of [[serialism]] in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the [[BACH motif]], which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The [[Stabat Mater#Musical settings|Stabat Mater]] section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple [[chord (music)|chord]] of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walter |first=Meinrad |date=2002 |title=Avantgarde mit menschlichem Antlitz |url=https://www.herder.de/hk/hefte/archiv/2002/10-2002/avantgarde-mit-menschlichem-antlitz-ein-portraet-des-komponisten-und-guardini-preistraegers-krzysztof-penderecki/ |journal=Herder Korrespondenz |volume=2002 |issue=10 |pages=507\u2013512 |doi= |language=de |access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPenderecki continued to write pieces that explored the sacred in music.

The [[Violin Concerto]] No. 1 largely leaves behind the dense tone clusters with which he had been associated, and instead focuses on two [[melody|melodic]] intervals: the [[semitone]] and the [[tritone]]. This direction continued with the [[Symphony No. 2 (Penderecki)|Symphony No. 2, ''Christmas'']] (1980), which is harmonically and melodically quite straightforward. It makes frequent use of the tune of the [[Christmas carol]] ''[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]''.\n\nPenderecki explained this shift by stating that he had come to feel that the experimentation of the avant-garde had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: \"The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of [[Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Nono]], Boulez and Cage was for us, the young \u2013 hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country \u2013 a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation, and formal speculation, is more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone.\" Penderecki concluded that he was \"saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition\".<ref name=\"liner\"/> Penderecki has written relatively little chamber music. However, compositions for smaller ensembles range in date from the start of his career to the end, reflecting the changes his style of writing has undergone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naxos.com/person/Krzysztof_Penderecki_21188/21188.htm|title=Krzysztof Penderecki- Bio, Albums, Pictures \u2013 Naxos Classical Music.|website=Naxos.com|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Penderecki was commissioned by [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] to compose a piece to accompany the unveiling of a statue at the [[Gda\u0144sk]] shipyards to commemorate those killed in anti-government riots there in 1970. Penderecki responded with ''Lacrimosa'', which he later expanded into one of the best-known works of his later period, the ''[[Polish Requiem]]'' (1980\u201384, 1993, 2005). Later, he tended towards more traditionally conceived tonal constructs, as heard in works such as the Cello Concerto No. 2 and the [[Credo (Penderecki)|Credo]], which received the [[Grammy Award]] for best choral performance for the world-premiere recording made by the [[Oregon Bach Festival]], which commissioned the piece. The same year, Penderecki was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Prize]] in Spain, one of the highest honours given in Spain to individuals, entities, organizations or others from around the world who make notable achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, or public affairs. Invited by [[Walter Fink]], he was the eleventh composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2001. He conducted the Credo on the occasion of the 70th birthday of [[Helmuth Rilling]], 29 May 2003.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040057/http://www.helmuth-rilling.de/programm.htm Benefizkonzert zum 70.
