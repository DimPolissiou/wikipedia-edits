In fact, some athletes who specialize in anaerobic sports (e.g., weightlifting) believe a very high level of protein intake is necessary, and so consume high protein meals and also protein supplements.<ref name=genton/><ref name=lemon/><ref name=phillips/><ref name=IOC>[https://hub.olympic.org/athlete365/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1378_IOC_NutritionAthleteHandbook_1e.pdf Nutrition for Athletes, International Olympic Committee] Nutrition Working Group of the Medical and Scientific Commission of the International Olympic Committee, Revised and Updated in June 2016.</ref>\n\n===Special populations===\n\n====Protein allergies====\n{{Main|Food allergy}}\nA food allergy is an abnormal [[immune system|immune response]] to proteins in food. The signs and symptoms may range from mild to severe. They may include [[pruritus|itchiness]], swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. These symptoms typically occurs within minutes to one hour after exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as [[anaphylaxis]]. The following eight foods are responsible for about 90% of allergic reactions: [[cow's milk]], [[egg as food|eggs]], [[wheat]], [[shellfish]], [[fish]], [[peanut]]s, [[tree nuts]] and [[soybean|soy]].<ref name=NIH2012pdf>{{cite web|author =National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|title=Food Allergy An Overview|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodAllergy/Documents/foodallergy.pdf|date=July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145206/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodallergy/documents/foodallergy.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==== Chronic kidney disease ====\nWhile there is no conclusive evidence that a high protein diet can cause [[chronic kidney disease]], there is a consensus that people with this disease should decrease consumption of protein. According to one 2009 review, people with chronic kidney disease who reduce protein consumption have a 32% lower risk of death in comparison to affected people who do not make these dietary changes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fouque D, Laville M | title = Low protein diets for chronic kidney disease in non diabetic adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD001892 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19588328 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001892.pub3 }}</ref>{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30284724|date = December 2018}}<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwingshackl L, Hoffmann G | title = Comparison of high vs. normal/low protein diets on renal function in subjects without chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e97656 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24852037 | pmc = 4031217 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0097656 }}</ref> Moreover, people with this disease while using a low protein diet (0.6 g/kg/d - 0.8 g/kg/d) may develop [[Metabolism#Amino acids and proteins|metabolic compensations]] that preserve kidney function, although in some people, [[malnutrition]] may occur.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====Phenylketonuria====\nIndividuals with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) must keep their intake of phenylalanine - an essential amino acid - extremely low to prevent a mental disability and other metabolic complications.

They have high blood levels of BCAAs and must severely restrict their intake of BCAAs in order to prevent mental retardation and death. The amino acids in question are leucine, isoleucine and valine. The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine. Children of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]], and Ashkenazi Jewish descent have a high prevalence of this disease compared to other populations.<ref name=\"DRIProteinChpt\" />\n\n==Excess consumption==\nThe U.S. and Canadian Dietary Reference Intake review for protein concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to establish a [[Tolerable upper intake level]], i.e., an upper limit for how much protein can be safely consumed.<ref name=\"DRIProteinChpt\" />\n\nWhen amino acids are in excess of needs, the liver takes up the amino acids and [[deamination|deaminates]] them, a process converting the nitrogen from the amino acids into [[ammonia]], further processed in the liver into urea via the [[urea cycle]].

The series completed its eighth season in 2009, and in that time it had produced more than 60 films in over 50 countries.\n\n''Wide Angle'' also produced a companion website, still extant, and additional educational materials for each film. The series website includes background information on the issues from the films, interactive features, exclusive video and audio, and full streaming versions of many programs. Additional educational materials are distributed to high schools and colleges. In 2006, ''Wide Angle'''s online ''Window into Global History'' project earned the [[Goldman Sachs Foundation]]'s Prize for Excellence in International Education.<ref name=\"awards\">{{cite web | title=Wide Angle .

It focused on [[Saddam Hussein]]\u2019s biological and chemical weapons and the wider threat they imply.<ref name=\"snapshots\" /> In a host interview broadcast immediately following the episode, resident fellow at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] [[Richard Perle]] stated that \"the thing that is brought home so clearly in this film is the connection among terrorist organizations now implicating Saddam Hussein directly with [[Al Qaeda]]\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/saddams-ultimate-solution/interview-richard-perle/1864/ | title=Saddam's Ultimate Solution - Interview: Richard Perle | publisher=PBS | accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Wide Angle'' programs have won numerous awards, including an [[Emmy Award]], the [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]], the Chicago International Television Hugo award, the [[Gabriel Award]], several top awards from the [[South Asian Journalists Association]] (SAJA), citations from the [[Overseas Press Club]], and 22 [[CINE|Cine Golden Eagle]] awards.<ref name=\"awards\" />\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' had a mixed review of the first program \"Saddam\u2019s Ultimate Solution\", especially concerning the interview of Richard Perle by host James Rubin: {{quote|Mr. Perle offers an argument rather than analysis when he says an American operation in Iraq will be \"quicker and easier than many people think,\" a matter of weeks not months. Mr. Rubin questions what he calls this \"optimistic scenario,\" but because it's not his role to take a position, the Perle interview is the lopsided half of a debate. Still, in a television landscape where network news is dominated by tiny sound bites and cable by shouting heads, ''Wide Angle'' had a distinct and valuable place.<ref>{{cite news | title=Television Review; Close Look at Iraq on Poison Gas and bin Laden | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EED71530F932A25754C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 | author=Caryn James | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 11, 2002 | accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>|Caryn James|''The New York Times''}}\n\n==Focal Point==\n\nIn December 2008, ''Wide Angle'' launched, ''Focal Point'', a new online-exclusive documentary series.

It focused on [[Saddam Hussein]]\u2019s biological and chemical weapons and the wider threat they imply.<ref name=\"snapshots\" /> In a host interview broadcast immediately following the episode, resident fellow at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] [[Richard Perle]] stated that \"the thing that is brought home so clearly in this film is the connection among terrorist organizations now implicating Saddam Hussein directly with [[Al Qaeda]]\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/saddams-ultimate-solution/interview-richard-perle/1864/ | title=Saddam's Ultimate Solution - Interview: Richard Perle | publisher=PBS | accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Wide Angle'' programs have won numerous awards, including an [[Emmy Award]], the [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]], the Chicago International Television Hugo award, the [[Gabriel Award]], several top awards from the [[South Asian Journalists Association]] (SAJA), citations from the [[Overseas Press Club]], and 22 [[CINE|Cine Golden Eagle]] awards.<ref name=\"awards\" />\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' had a mixed review of the first program \"Saddam\u2019s Ultimate Solution\", especially concerning the interview of Richard Perle by host James Rubin: {{quote|Mr. Perle offers an argument rather than analysis when he says an American operation in Iraq will be \"quicker and easier than many people think,\" a matter of weeks not months. Mr. Rubin questions what he calls this \"optimistic scenario,\" but because it's not his role to take a position, the Perle interview is the lopsided half of a debate. Still, in a television landscape where network news is dominated by tiny sound bites and cable by shouting heads, ''Wide Angle'' had a distinct and valuable place.<ref>{{cite news | title=Television Review; Close Look at Iraq on Poison Gas and bin Laden | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EED71530F932A25754C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 | author=Caryn James | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 11, 2002 | accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>|Caryn James|''The New York Times''}}\n\n==Focal Point==\n\nIn December 2008, ''Wide Angle'' launched, ''Focal Point'', a new online-exclusive documentary series.
