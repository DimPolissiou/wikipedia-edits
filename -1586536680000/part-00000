Though it was their overall strangeness and shared taste in non-mainstream music that caused them to become friends, both appeared to be headed for very conventional careers. Haynes, as captain of Trinity's basketball team, as well as the school's \"[[Accountant]] of the Year,\" soon graduated to a position with a respected Texas accounting firm, while Leary remained in college working on his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 276.</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Haynes and Leary published the [[magazine]] ''Strange V.D.'', which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous explanations for the diseases.<ref name=spin>Morthland & Patoski, \"Feeding the Fish: An Oral History of the Butthole Surfers\", ''SPIN''.</ref> After being caught with one of these pictures at work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, dropped out of college and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 277\">Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 277.</ref>\n\n=== Early years (1981\u20131984) ===\nHaynes and Leary played their debut show at a San Antonio night club, The Bonham Exchange, in 1981; at that time they had not yet settled on the band name \"Butthole Surfers\". By 1982, the band were backed by the sibling rhythm section composed of bassist Quinn Mathews and his brother, drummer Scott Mathews. The band did not gain a following in San Antonio, and purchased a van to return to California later that summer.<ref name=spin/><ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 277\"/>\n\nDuring a brief concert at the [[Valencia Tool & Die|Tool and Die club]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman and [[Alternative Tentacles]] overseer [[Jello Biafra]] witnessed their performance and became a fervent fan.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 277\u2013278.</ref> Biafra invited the group to open for Dead Kennedys and [[T.S.O.L.]] at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and soon made an offer that would launch their recording career; if they could get someone to lend them [[recording studio|studio]] time, Alternative Tentacles would reimburse the studio when the album was complete. The band then returned to San Antonio to record at BOSS Studios (a.k.a. Bob O'Neill's Sound Studios, a.k.a. the Boss).<ref name=spin/> However, the Mathews brothers did not enter the studio with Haynes and Leary; the two had quit following a physical altercation between Scott Mathews and Haynes. The bass position was taken over by Bill Jolly, who would play on Butthole Surfers' next two releases, and a number of drummers participated.

He refused to release them until he'd been reimbursed for the sessions, and Alternative Tentacles couldn't immediately afford to pay. After months of waiting, the band issued the concert recording ''[[Live PCPPEP]]'' on Alternative Tentacles out of financial desperation in September 1984. Mostly made up of live performances of songs from their debut, it prompted some critics and fans to joke that they had released the same album twice.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Meanwhile, Bob O'Neill was preparing to release ''Psychic...'' on his own Ward 9 label to recoup his expenses.<ref>Paytress, \"The Butthole Surfers: Mark Paytress Unravels the Career of the Cult American Band\", ''Record Collector'' No.&nbsp;114.</ref>\n\n=== Legend grows (1984\u20131987) ===\n\nWith some members working as dishwashers, the group was apparently not thrilled with the album being released on Ward 9. [[Terry Tolkin]], a friend and their East Coast booking agent, signed the band to Corey Rusk's then-nascent [[Touch and Go Records]] in Detroit. ''Psychic... Powerless...

It was on this outing that they truly established a national presence, starting at Touch and Go's early headquarters in Detroit before heading to New York City, where they impressed members of [[Sonic Youth]], as well as [[Shockabilly]] member (and future Butthole Surfers bassist) [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]]. They then crisscrossed the country for several months, including a show in Seattle, that made a fan of future [[Soundgarden]] guitarist [[Kim Thayil]]. While in San Francisco at the end of the tour, and without a place to live, the band collectively decided to move to Winterville (a small town outside Athens, Georgia), where they admittedly made a hobby of stalking members of [[R.E.M.]] They purportedly planned to leave a van parked in front of Michael Stipe's house, with \"Michael Stipe/Despite the Hype/I Still Wanna Suck/Your Big Long Pipe\" painted on the side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=41&threadid=20768&bookmarkedmessageid=83|title=Songs about other musicians|date=September 11\u201318, 2003|publisher=ilXor.com|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Heller|first1=Phyllis|date=June 1986|title=This Butt's for You: Interview by Phyllis Heller|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=2|issue=3|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOtx9nPM4ncC&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82#v=onepage&q&f=false|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref> Smart quit after falling in love with a friend of the band, and Trevor Malcolm, a young Canadian musician recommended by Touch and Go, replaced him on bass.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 291\u2013292.</ref>\n\nWord was spreading about the band's bizarre stage show by the time they hit the road again, resulting in ever-larger audiences at their concerts.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 292\"/> Not long after Malcolm's arrival, the band recorded their act for posterity by filming two concerts at Detroit's Traxx club. Some of this footage was eventually packaged as ''[[Blind Eye Sees All]]'', their only official video release to date. They purchased their first 8-track recorder at this time, and used it to record two songs later used on the A-side of ''[[Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis]]''.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\nReportedly unhappy with life in the band, Malcolm quit in mid-1985.<ref name=autogenerated9>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 295.</ref> A friend of the band's from Athens, Juan Molina, was brought in for a brief U.S. tour, but was not interested in becoming a full-time member.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> Without a permanent bassist and a quickly approaching European tour looming\u2014the band's first\u2014they contacted [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]], who quickly agreed to join.<ref name=autogenerated9 /> Meanwhile, their second LP, which had been submitted to Alternative Tentacles as ''Rembrandt Pussy Horse'', was still in limbo.

EP's B-side.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\nFollowing the European tour, Butthole Surfers experienced more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, as she was tired of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be with family.<ref>Interview, ''Tripping Yarns'' No.&nbsp;2, interview conducted 1987.</ref> She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band.<ref>Interview with Haynes, SPIN Magazine, June 1986</ref> Cabbage had previously performed with [[Kathleen Lynch (performer)|Kathleen Lynch]] (a.k.a.

Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by [[Jeff Pinkus]], who gave the band's bass position its longest period of stability by staying until 1994.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 299.</ref>\n\nTheir second LP was finally issued as ''[[Rembrandt Pussyhorse]]'' on Touch and Go in April 1986. Coming out some two years after the original sessions, it featured a different mix and song selection than Alternative Tentacles' unreleased version.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> Best known for its minimalist reworking of [[The Guess Who]]'s \"[[American Woman (song)|American Woman]]\", it is one of the most experimental albums in Butthole Surfers' heavily experimental career.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Following a particularly out-of-control tour, even by Butthole Surfers' standards, the band semi-settled in Austin, Texas in the summer of 1986. Nervosa rejoined them (Cabbage having been fired months earlier), and they went to work on crafting their first home studio in a rental house on the outskirts of town. Before long, they started a leisurely recording session for their third full-length project.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 303.</ref> Released in March 1987, ''[[Locust Abortion Technician]]'' is one of the heaviest Butthole Surfers albums, and it is often considered their finest to date.<ref>''Locust Abortion Technician'' review, ''Allmusic''.</ref> Harnessing aspects of punk, heavy metal, and psychedelia, its unique sound produced a number of grinding, slower-paced songs, arguably making it an early precursor of [[grunge]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n=== Evolution (1987\u20131991) ===\nAround the time of ''Locust Abortion Technician'''s debut, the group bought a home in [[Driftwood, Texas]], approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} outside Austin. It was a ranch house built into the side of a hill, with {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of surrounding property. As with the rental home, the compound was turned into a ''de facto'' recording studio. They did not live together in the new house for long, though, with Coffey being the first to move out and get his own place. They all had separate residences by 1991.<ref name=spin/>\n\nIn early 1988, Butthole Surfers were ready to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, choosing a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 306.</ref> The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Lieck, \"Reissuing the Butthole Surfers: Tongue-in-Cheek Terror\", ''Austin Chronicle''.</ref>\n\n''[[Hairway to Steven]]'' was issued in April, and marked a midway point between the band's experimental roots, and the more accessible recordings that would follow. While half of the material is as extreme sounding as their earlier work, other songs are more conventional. This was the first Butthole Surfers album to make extensive use of acoustic guitar. ''Hairway to Steven'' did not have song titles when first released, and instead represented each track with an absurdist, often [[scatological]], cartoon.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> The band traveled widely in support of the album over the next year, including a very successful tour of Europe (helped in part by the influence of new UK distributor [[Blast First]]). Like their studio recordings, their live shows were beginning to lose much of their earlier chaos.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nWhile touring during the winter of 1988, Butthole Surfers used a portable [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] recorder to tape various concerts. The strongest of these recordings were packaged as ''[[Double Live (Butthole Surfers album)|Double Live]]'', a limited edition double album released on vinyl and cassette in 1989, and on CD the following year. This was the first release on the band's [[Latino Buggerveil]] label. Though the album, as of spring 2007, is out of print, its songs are available as free [[MP3]] downloads on the band's official website. Issued in response to widespread, for-profit [[Music piracy|bootlegging]] of their live shows, it contained performances of songs from all of their previous studio albums and EPs.<ref>''Double Live'' MP3 download page, Butthole Surfers.com.</ref>\n\n''Double Live'' was to be the last Butthole Surfers album to feature Nervosa, who left early in 1989. Shortly after leaving, she was diagnosed with an aneurysm, and was forced to undergo brain surgery. She further began to suffer from strobe light-induced seizures.<ref name=spin/> In 1991, Nervosa (who has gone by Teresa Taylor since her retirement) had a small role in [[Richard Linklater]]'s film ''[[Slacker (movie)|Slacker]]''. She was employed at the [[Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired]] as recently as 1995.<ref name=autogenerated11 /><ref>''Slacker'' page, IMDb.com.</ref>\n\nButthole Surfers did not seek to replace her at the time, and opted to continue as a quartet. Following a final EP for Touch and Go\u20141989's ''[[Widowermaker]]''\u2014the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter [[Terry Tolkin]] at [[Rough Trade Records]] who had also brought them to [[Touch and Go Records|Touch and Go]], for a reportedly generous one-album deal.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 309.</ref> Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990's ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man (EP)|The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'', which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued ''[[Digital Dump]]'' by [[The Jackofficers]], Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic [[house music]] side project.<ref>Orr, \"Journey to the Sphincter of Your Mind or... Cowabunghole\", ''Reflex Magazine''.</ref>\n\n''[[piouhgd]]'' (pronounced \"p.o.-ed\", as in \"pissed off\") was the band's fifth full-length studio album, and their first for Rough Trade. Released in April 1991, it featured more electronic instrumentation, but was largely viewed as a disappointment in comparison to past recordings. Both Haynes and Leary have since expressed displeasure with the album.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>Nunez, \"The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt\", ''Fiz Magazine''.</ref> Regardless, the band was invited to be part of that summer's inaugural [[Lollapalooza]] tour.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 311\">Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 311.</ref> Around this time, Haynes collaborated with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], contributing vocals on their 1991 single \"[[Jesus Built My Hotrod]]\", which was later included on 1992's ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs]]''.\n\n=== Mainstream recognition (1991\u20131999) ===\nRough Trade filed for bankruptcy in 1991, but not before releasing Leary's solo project, ''[[The History of Dogs]]''. The following year, Butthole Surfers shocked many fans and critics by signing with the major label [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 311\"/> In 2017, Paul Leary reflected: \"I grew up listening to [[The Beatles]] and [[Grand Funk Railroad]] and [[Dean Martin]], and the thought of being on the same record label that they were on was too fucking weird, really weird.

Haynes was working with [[Johnny Depp]], [[Bill Carter]], Sal Jenco, [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], and others in a new group, [[P (group)|P]]. In 1993, Haynes played with this band in Los Angeles' [[Viper Room]], on the night the actor [[River Phoenix]] died of a drug overdose.<ref name=spin/> Meanwhile, Leary was building a reputation as a skilled music producer, while Coffey set up his own record label [[Trance Syndicate]].<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Lieck, \"Reissuing the Butthole Surfers: Tongue-in-Cheek Terror\", ''Austin Chronicle'' vol. 18 No.&nbsp;52.</ref> According to Leary and industry insiders, Haynes was increasingly dependent on hard drugs at this time, though Haynes has downplayed their concerns.<ref name=spin/>\n\nIn 1995, the band contributed a cover of the ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'' theme song to be included on the [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]].<ref>Track listing & liner notes, ''Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits'' (album), 1995.</ref> Later that year, Haynes's side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey's Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album.<ref>''P'', 1995.</ref><ref>''The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt'' (album), 1995.</ref> Titled ''[[The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt]]'', it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991.<ref>Liner notes, ''The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt'' (album), 1995.</ref> In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with Touch and Go.

Haynes and others said they wouldn't have initiated the proceedings if they felt Rusk's dealings had been honorable. Rusk provided the band with indecipherable accounting statements. Rusk continued to insist his actions were honest even though the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found otherwise.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/> With the case resolved, the band reissued ''Psychic...

Currently, Paul Leary is producing the debut album from Carny. Butthole Surfers played two shows in Austin at Scoot Inn during Halloween 2010. A report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that, even though Butthole Surfers had not released an album of new material since 2001, the \"songs are practically incidental to the spectacle\" after seeing them perform along with psychedelic band [[Lumerians]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]].<ref name=twsO19>{{cite news|title=Pop and Rock Listings for Dec. 24-30|work=The New York Times|quote=The band hasn't released an album of new material since 2001, but the songs are practically incidental to the spectacle.

Early aliases included The [[Dick Clark]] Five, Nine cm Worm Makes Own Food, The Vodka Family Winstons, Ashtray Babyheads, [[Ed Asner]] Is Gay, [[Fred Astaire]]'s Asshole, The Right To Eat Fred Astaire's Asshole, Zipgun, The Inalienable Right To Eat Fred Astaire's Asshole, and many others.<ref name=spin/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jim-jarmusch.net/miscellanea/author_jim_jarmusch/interviewed_by_jim/gibby_haynes.html|title=Gibby Haynes of The Butthole Surfers &#124; The Jim Jarmusch Resource Page|publisher=Jim-jarmusch.net|accessdate=March 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325192516/http://www.jim-jarmusch.net/miscellanea/author_jim_jarmusch/interviewed_by_jim/gibby_haynes.html|archivedate=March 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In a 1996 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, when asked if he could go back and choose a different name for the band, Haynes replied \"I would name the band: I'm Going to Shit in Your Mother's Vagina.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/where-would-the-beatles-be-today-if-they-had-called-themselves-the-butthole-surfers-19961226|title=Butthole Surfers: America's Most Notorious Psycho-Delic Band|first=Charles M.|last=Young|date=December 26, 1996|website=rollingstone.com|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe name has long been a source of trouble for the band. Many clubs, newspapers, radio, and TV stations refuse to print or mention their full name, and instead opted to use \"B.H. Surfers\", or other abbreviations.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 277\"/>\n\n== Live performances ==\n[[File:Butthole Surfers Live.jpg|thumb|Butthole Surfers performing on December 6, 2008 in [[Minehead]], England. This performance features [[strobe lights]], [[smoke machine]]s and a projected film in the background.]]\nIn the 1980s, Butthole Surfers earned a reputation for their disturbing live performances that were both decadent and violent. As a result, they began to attract a wide range of curiosity seekers within a few years of their debut, in addition to traditional fans of [[punk rock]] who had supported them from the beginning.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 293\">Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 293.</ref> A staged reproduction of the band's live show was filmed for 1988's ''[[Bar-B-Que Movie]]'', a short [[Super 8 mm film]] movie directed by [[Alex Winter]], who is best known as \"Bill S. Preston, Esq.\" from ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]''.<ref>''Bar-B-Que Movie'' page, IMDb.com.</ref> Bar-B-Que Movie is a spoof of 1974's ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', and the film ends with a music video-style performance of the song \"Fast\" (a.k.a. \"Fart Song\"), featuring Haynes, Leary, Coffey, Nervosa, and [[Jeff Pinkus]], as well as dancer [[Kathleen Lynch (performer)|Kathleen Lynch]]. The track displayed many of the band's stage gimmicks, such as the burning cymbal, strobe lights, films, and smoke.<ref>''Bar-B-Que Movie'', YouTube.</ref>\n\nBy the time Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show had become more predictable, with previously random shockers being done at the same point in each night's performance. [[Teresa Taylor|Teresa Nervosa]] quit for good around the same time, and [[King Coffey]] became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even [[Gibby Haynes]]' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 288-289, 309.</ref>\n\n=== Appearance ===\nLead vocalist and saxophonist Haynes (who sometimes sang through a [[megaphone|bullhorn]]), guitarist Paul Leary, dual drummers Coffey and Nervosa (the latter briefly replaced by Cabbage), and whichever bassist happened to be filling in at the time, had a visual aspect. As with their music, their appearance was exceptionally non-conventional in the early days, including sideways mohawks, dreadlocks, unnaturally colored hair, and the like.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 282.</ref>\n\nKnown for taking the stage at early concerts with hundreds of clothespins attached to his hair and clothes, Haynes would often strip throughout a show until he was down to his underwear, or less, by the end. Other attire included flasher-style trench coats over his nakedness, ridiculously home-styled wigs and cross-dressing; often enjoying a skirt made of an American flag and a large '60s torpedo-style stuffed bra. At other times he would hide condoms full of stage blood in his clothes and repeatedly fall to the floor, appearing to bleed profusely. Some of Haynes' other favorite tricks involved throwing handfuls of photocopied cockroach images into the crowd, rolls and rolls of toilet paper tossed across the audience, as well as filling an inverted cymbal with lighter fluid, setting it (and sometimes his hand) on fire, and repeatedly hitting it with a mallet. As previously mentioned he would sing through almost anything that would alter his voice, including toilet paper rolls and megaphones early on, which eventually evolved into \"Gibby's kit\", a.k.a. \"Gibbytronix,\" a rack of vocal effects stacked as high as he could reach, before which he would often stand for the majority of the show in later performances. He also often utilized various foot switches which would be used to activate certain vocal effects, and when thought to be dancing during some performances he would actually be stepping on his various pedals. Adding to the spectacle were Coffey and Nervosa, who played in unison on stand-up drum kits; behind which they would collapse onto the floor and out of eyeshot, to collect their breath and strength before rising just in time to play the next song. Finally, the whole band would often tear apart stuffed animals while on stage, throwing the stuffing through the air, creating a rather disturbing throbbing effect, caused by the stroboscopes that were always on. <ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 288\u2013289.</ref>\n\nIn 1986, they first met Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady), who was then working at a strip club called Sex World in New York City.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 299, 301.</ref> Though never an official member, she became Butthole Surfers' famous \"naked dancer\", performing intermittently with them through 1989.<ref name=spin/> One show in Washington, D.C. with GWAR saw Kathleen take the stage to dance in nothing but gold body paint and antique wooden snow shoes. At another particularly wild concert in 1986, Haynes and Lynch, by now completely bald, reportedly engaged in sexual intercourse while on stage, as Leary used a screwdriver to vandalize the club's speakers. This came after only five songs, during which time Haynes had started a small fire.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 300.</ref>\n\n=== Equipment ===\nButthole Surfers began to take the collection of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 289, 293.</ref> Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies at the same time which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.<ref name=spin/>\nThe films' subject matter were often as disturbing as the manner in which they were played; with images of accidents, nuclear explosions, meat processing, spiders and scorpions stalking prey, gory driver's education films, and penis reconstruction surgery.<ref name=spin/><ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 293\"/> Not all of the movies were horrific, and they often included nature, wildlife, and aquatic footage; as well as a color negative of a ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' episode.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 294.</ref>\n\n== Members ==\nThough Butthole Surfers have been through numerous official and unofficial members since 1981, current members Gibby Haynes, Paul Leary, and King Coffey have been together since 1983.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Current\n|-\n!

and guitarist [[Paul Leary]] in 1981. The band has had numerous personnel changes, but its core lineup of Haynes, Leary, and [[drummer]] [[King Coffey]] has been consistent since 1983. [[Teresa Taylor|Teresa Nervosa]] served as second drummer from 1983 to 1985, 1986 to 1989, and 2009. The band has also employed a variety of bass players, most notably [[Jeff Pinkus]].<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 289.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Lieck, \"Reissuing the Butthole Surfers: Tongue-in-Cheek Terror\", Austin Chronicle vol. 18 No.&nbsp;52.</ref>\n\nEmerging from the 1980s [[hardcore punk]] scene, Butthole Surfers quickly became known for their chaotic live shows, [[black comedy]], and a sound that incorporated elements of [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[noise rock]], and [[punk rock|punk]] as well as their use of sound manipulation and tape editing.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Young, \"Butthole Surfers biography\", RollingStone.com.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://therumpus.net/2009/03/how-did-it-comes-to-this/|title=How Did It Come to This?|last1=Yates Wuelfing|first1=Amy|date=March 5, 2009|publisher=The Rumpus|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough they were respected by their peers and attracted a devoted fanbase, Butthole Surfers had little commercial success until 1996's ''[[Electriclarryland]]''.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 274\u2013311\">Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 274\u2013311.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Gold & Platinum Record Database, RIAA.</ref> The album contained the hit single \"[[Pepper (song)|Pepper]]\" which climbed to number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart that year.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Charts & awards \u2013 Billboard singles, ''Allmusic''.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation (1976\u20131981) ===\nButthole Surfers formed at [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]] during the late 1970s, when students [[Gibby Haynes|Gibson \"Gibby\" Haynes]] and [[Paul Leary|Paul Leary Walthall]] (later just Paul Leary) met for the first time. Though it was their overall strangeness and shared taste in non-mainstream music that caused them to become friends, both appeared to be headed for very conventional careers. Haynes, as captain of Trinity's basketball team, as well as the school's \"[[Accountant]] of the Year,\" soon graduated to a position with a respected Texas accounting firm, while Leary remained in college working on his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 276.</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Haynes and Leary published the [[magazine]] ''Strange V.D.'', which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous explanations for the diseases.<ref name=spin>Morthland & Patoski, \"Feeding the Fish: An Oral History of the Butthole Surfers\", ''SPIN''.</ref> After being caught with one of these pictures at work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, dropped out of college and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 277\">Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 277.</ref>\n\n=== Early years (1981\u20131984) ===\nHaynes and Leary played their debut show at a San Antonio night club, The Bonham Exchange, in 1981; at that time they had not yet settled on the band name \"Butthole Surfers\". By 1982, the band were backed by the sibling rhythm section composed of bassist Quinn Mathews and his brother, drummer Scott Mathews. The band did not gain a following in San Antonio, and purchased a van to return to California later that summer.<ref name=spin/><ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 277\"/>\n\nDuring a brief concert at the [[Valencia Tool & Die|Tool and Die club]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman and [[Alternative Tentacles]] overseer [[Jello Biafra]] witnessed their performance and became a fervent fan.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 277\u2013278.</ref> Biafra invited the group to open for Dead Kennedys and [[T.S.O.L.]] at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and soon made an offer that would launch their recording career; if they could get someone to lend them [[recording studio|studio]] time, Alternative Tentacles would reimburse the studio when the album was complete. The band then returned to San Antonio to record at BOSS Studios (a.k.a. Bob O'Neill's Sound Studios, a.k.a. the Boss).<ref name=spin/> However, the Mathews brothers did not enter the studio with Haynes and Leary; the two had quit following a physical altercation between Scott Mathews and Haynes. The bass position was taken over by Bill Jolly, who would play on Butthole Surfers' next two releases, and a number of drummers participated. The last of these, [[King Coffey]] (born Jeffrey Coffey), is still with the band to this day.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 278.</ref>\n\nReleased on Alternative Tentacles in July 1983, the resulting EP, ''[[Butthole Surfers (EP)|Butthole Surfers]]'' (also known as ''Brown Reason to Live'' and ''Pee Pee the Sailor''), offered songs with provocatively absurd titles like \"The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's Grave\" and \"Bar-B-Q Pope\", alternately sung by Haynes and Leary. (Haynes would become the band's primary singer by the time of their first [[LP album|LP]].) The album cover, like the many bizarre illustrations that would accompany Surfers' succeeding work, was designed by the band itself.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', pp. 275, 288, 294.</ref> Teeming with humor, ''Butthole Surfers'' laid the foundation for what was to come.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> It influenced at least one future superstar in [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]], who listed it as one of his ten favorite albums in his ''[[Journals (Cobain)|Journals]]''.<ref>Cobain, ''Journals''.</ref> Cobain later went on to list the album \"Pee Pee the Sailor\" by Butthole Surfers as one of the fifty most influential albums for Nirvana's sound.<ref name=\"joyfulnoiserecordings.com\">{{cite web|title=Top 50 by Nirvana |url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/ |accessdate=May 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018034220/http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/ |archivedate=October 18, 2014 }}</ref> Cobain would later meet his wife, [[Courtney Love]] of [[Hole (band)|Hole]], at a Butthole Surfers/[[L7 (band)|L7]] concert in 1991.<ref>Kelly, \"Kurt and Courtney Sitting in a Tree\", ''Sassy''.</ref>\n\nSoon after the release of ''Butthole Surfers'', the band recruited a second drummer, [[Teresa Taylor|Teresa Nervosa]] (born Teresa Taylor), who had played with Coffey in a number of [[high school]] [[marching band]]s in the Texas' [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Leland & Robbins, \"Butthole Surfers biography\", ''Trouser Press''.</ref><ref>Interview, ''Flipside'' No.&nbsp;46.</ref> She and Coffey would [[double drumming|drum in unison]] on separate, stand-up kits, adding to the spectacle of Surfers' ever-evolving stage show.

Both were originally offered to Alternative Tentacles, with the first being ''[[Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac]]''.<ref name=autogenerated10>Interview, ''Forced Exposure'' No.&nbsp;11.</ref> Before either album could be released, though, Alternative Tentacles had to acquire the [[multitrack recording|master tapes]] from Bob O'Neill, BOSS Studios' namesake and owner. He refused to release them until he'd been reimbursed for the sessions, and Alternative Tentacles couldn't immediately afford to pay. After months of waiting, the band issued the concert recording ''[[Live PCPPEP]]'' on Alternative Tentacles out of financial desperation in September 1984. Mostly made up of live performances of songs from their debut, it prompted some critics and fans to joke that they had released the same album twice.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Meanwhile, Bob O'Neill was preparing to release ''Psychic...'' on his own Ward 9 label to recoup his expenses.<ref>Paytress, \"The Butthole Surfers: Mark Paytress Unravels the Career of the Cult American Band\", ''Record Collector'' No.&nbsp;114.</ref>\n\n=== Legend grows (1984\u20131987) ===\n\nWith some members working as dishwashers, the group was apparently not thrilled with the album being released on Ward 9. [[Terry Tolkin]], a friend and their East Coast booking agent, signed the band to Corey Rusk's then-nascent [[Touch and Go Records]] in Detroit. ''Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac'' was released in 1984.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\"/><ref>''The Baffler'', Volume 4.</ref><ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 292\">Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 292.</ref> Building on their first EP, the band made psychedelia a much bigger part of their sound on this release, which made full use of the tape editing, non-traditional instrumentation, and sound modulation that came to define their studio recordings.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nJust before the release of ''Psychic...'', and with new bassist Terence Smart in tow (the first of many through 1986), the band commenced their first nationwide tour. It was on this outing that they truly established a national presence, starting at Touch and Go's early headquarters in Detroit before heading to New York City, where they impressed members of [[Sonic Youth]], as well as [[Shockabilly]] member (and future Butthole Surfers bassist) [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]]. They then crisscrossed the country for several months, including a show in Seattle, that made a fan of future [[Soundgarden]] guitarist [[Kim Thayil]]. While in San Francisco at the end of the tour, and without a place to live, the band collectively decided to move to Winterville (a small town outside Athens, Georgia), where they admittedly made a hobby of stalking members of [[R.E.M.]] They purportedly planned to leave a van parked in front of Michael Stipe's house, with \"Michael Stipe/Despite the Hype/I Still Wanna Suck/Your Big Long Pipe\" painted on the side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=41&threadid=20768&bookmarkedmessageid=83|title=Songs about other musicians|date=September 11\u201318, 2003|publisher=ilXor.com|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Heller|first1=Phyllis|date=June 1986|title=This Butt's for You: Interview by Phyllis Heller|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=2|issue=3|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOtx9nPM4ncC&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82#v=onepage&q&f=false|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref> Smart quit after falling in love with a friend of the band, and Trevor Malcolm, a young Canadian musician recommended by Touch and Go, replaced him on bass.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 291\u2013292.</ref>\n\nWord was spreading about the band's bizarre stage show by the time they hit the road again, resulting in ever-larger audiences at their concerts.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 292\"/> Not long after Malcolm's arrival, the band recorded their act for posterity by filming two concerts at Detroit's Traxx club. Some of this footage was eventually packaged as ''[[Blind Eye Sees All]]'', their only official video release to date. They purchased their first 8-track recorder at this time, and used it to record two songs later used on the A-side of ''[[Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis]]''.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\nReportedly unhappy with life in the band, Malcolm quit in mid-1985.<ref name=autogenerated9>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 295.</ref> A friend of the band's from Athens, Juan Molina, was brought in for a brief U.S. tour, but was not interested in becoming a full-time member.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> Without a permanent bassist and a quickly approaching European tour looming\u2014the band's first\u2014they contacted [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]], who quickly agreed to join.<ref name=autogenerated9 /> Meanwhile, their second LP, which had been submitted to Alternative Tentacles as ''Rembrandt Pussy Horse'', was still in limbo. The reasons for Alternative Tentacles' actions are unclear, but it is known that the label delayed a decision for about a year before ultimately refusing to publish it.<ref name=autogenerated8>Paytress, ''Record Collector'' No.&nbsp;114.</ref> While waiting, the band released the four-song ''Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis'' EP on Touch and Go in late 1985. Once Alternative Tentacles finally declined, the group went back into the studio to record two new tracks to replace \"Two Part\" and \"Tornadoes\", which were originally intended for ''Rembrandt...'' before appearing on the ''Cream Corn...'' EP's B-side.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\nFollowing the European tour, Butthole Surfers experienced more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, as she was tired of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be with family.<ref>Interview, ''Tripping Yarns'' No.&nbsp;2, interview conducted 1987.</ref> She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band.<ref>Interview with Haynes, SPIN Magazine, June 1986</ref> Cabbage had previously performed with [[Kathleen Lynch (performer)|Kathleen Lynch]] (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by [[Jeff Pinkus]], who gave the band's bass position its longest period of stability by staying until 1994.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 299.</ref>\n\nTheir second LP was finally issued as ''[[Rembrandt Pussyhorse]]'' on Touch and Go in April 1986. Coming out some two years after the original sessions, it featured a different mix and song selection than Alternative Tentacles' unreleased version.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> Best known for its minimalist reworking of [[The Guess Who]]'s \"[[American Woman (song)|American Woman]]\", it is one of the most experimental albums in Butthole Surfers' heavily experimental career.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Following a particularly out-of-control tour, even by Butthole Surfers' standards, the band semi-settled in Austin, Texas in the summer of 1986. Nervosa rejoined them (Cabbage having been fired months earlier), and they went to work on crafting their first home studio in a rental house on the outskirts of town. Before long, they started a leisurely recording session for their third full-length project.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 303.</ref> Released in March 1987, ''[[Locust Abortion Technician]]'' is one of the heaviest Butthole Surfers albums, and it is often considered their finest to date.<ref>''Locust Abortion Technician'' review, ''Allmusic''.</ref> Harnessing aspects of punk, heavy metal, and psychedelia, its unique sound produced a number of grinding, slower-paced songs, arguably making it an early precursor of [[grunge]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n=== Evolution (1987\u20131991) ===\nAround the time of ''Locust Abortion Technician'''s debut, the group bought a home in [[Driftwood, Texas]], approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} outside Austin. It was a ranch house built into the side of a hill, with {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of surrounding property. As with the rental home, the compound was turned into a ''de facto'' recording studio. They did not live together in the new house for long, though, with Coffey being the first to move out and get his own place. They all had separate residences by 1991.<ref name=spin/>\n\nIn early 1988, Butthole Surfers were ready to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, choosing a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 306.</ref> The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Lieck, \"Reissuing the Butthole Surfers: Tongue-in-Cheek Terror\", ''Austin Chronicle''.</ref>\n\n''[[Hairway to Steven]]'' was issued in April, and marked a midway point between the band's experimental roots, and the more accessible recordings that would follow. While half of the material is as extreme sounding as their earlier work, other songs are more conventional. This was the first Butthole Surfers album to make extensive use of acoustic guitar. ''Hairway to Steven'' did not have song titles when first released, and instead represented each track with an absurdist, often [[scatological]], cartoon.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> The band traveled widely in support of the album over the next year, including a very successful tour of Europe (helped in part by the influence of new UK distributor [[Blast First]]). Like their studio recordings, their live shows were beginning to lose much of their earlier chaos.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nWhile touring during the winter of 1988, Butthole Surfers used a portable [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] recorder to tape various concerts. The strongest of these recordings were packaged as ''[[Double Live (Butthole Surfers album)|Double Live]]'', a limited edition double album released on vinyl and cassette in 1989, and on CD the following year. This was the first release on the band's [[Latino Buggerveil]] label. Though the album, as of spring 2007, is out of print, its songs are available as free [[MP3]] downloads on the band's official website. Issued in response to widespread, for-profit [[Music piracy|bootlegging]] of their live shows, it contained performances of songs from all of their previous studio albums and EPs.<ref>''Double Live'' MP3 download page, Butthole Surfers.com.</ref>\n\n''Double Live'' was to be the last Butthole Surfers album to feature Nervosa, who left early in 1989. Shortly after leaving, she was diagnosed with an aneurysm, and was forced to undergo brain surgery. She further began to suffer from strobe light-induced seizures.<ref name=spin/> In 1991, Nervosa (who has gone by Teresa Taylor since her retirement) had a small role in [[Richard Linklater]]'s film ''[[Slacker (movie)|Slacker]]''. She was employed at the [[Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired]] as recently as 1995.<ref name=autogenerated11 /><ref>''Slacker'' page, IMDb.com.</ref>\n\nButthole Surfers did not seek to replace her at the time, and opted to continue as a quartet. Following a final EP for Touch and Go\u20141989's ''[[Widowermaker]]''\u2014the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter [[Terry Tolkin]] at [[Rough Trade Records]] who had also brought them to [[Touch and Go Records|Touch and Go]], for a reportedly generous one-album deal.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 309.</ref> Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990's ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man (EP)|The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'', which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued ''[[Digital Dump]]'' by [[The Jackofficers]], Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic [[house music]] side project.<ref>Orr, \"Journey to the Sphincter of Your Mind or... Cowabunghole\", ''Reflex Magazine''.</ref>\n\n''[[piouhgd]]'' (pronounced \"p.o.-ed\", as in \"pissed off\") was the band's fifth full-length studio album, and their first for Rough Trade. Released in April 1991, it featured more electronic instrumentation, but was largely viewed as a disappointment in comparison to past recordings. Both Haynes and Leary have since expressed displeasure with the album.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>Nunez, \"The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt\", ''Fiz Magazine''.</ref> Regardless, the band was invited to be part of that summer's inaugural [[Lollapalooza]] tour.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 311\">Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 311.</ref> Around this time, Haynes collaborated with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], contributing vocals on their 1991 single \"[[Jesus Built My Hotrod]]\", which was later included on 1992's ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs]]''.\n\n=== Mainstream recognition (1991\u20131999) ===\nRough Trade filed for bankruptcy in 1991, but not before releasing Leary's solo project, ''[[The History of Dogs]]''. The following year, Butthole Surfers shocked many fans and critics by signing with the major label [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 311\"/> In 2017, Paul Leary reflected: \"I grew up listening to [[The Beatles]] and [[Grand Funk Railroad]] and [[Dean Martin]], and the thought of being on the same record label that they were on was too fucking weird, really weird.

Haynes was working with [[Johnny Depp]], [[Bill Carter]], Sal Jenco, [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], and others in a new group, [[P (group)|P]]. In 1993, Haynes played with this band in Los Angeles' [[Viper Room]], on the night the actor [[River Phoenix]] died of a drug overdose.<ref name=spin/> Meanwhile, Leary was building a reputation as a skilled music producer, while Coffey set up his own record label [[Trance Syndicate]].<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Lieck, \"Reissuing the Butthole Surfers: Tongue-in-Cheek Terror\", ''Austin Chronicle'' vol. 18 No.&nbsp;52.</ref> According to Leary and industry insiders, Haynes was increasingly dependent on hard drugs at this time, though Haynes has downplayed their concerns.<ref name=spin/>\n\nIn 1995, the band contributed a cover of the ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'' theme song to be included on the [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]].<ref>Track listing & liner notes, ''Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits'' (album), 1995.</ref> Later that year, Haynes's side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey's Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album.<ref>''P'', 1995.</ref><ref>''The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt'' (album), 1995.</ref> Titled ''[[The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt]]'', it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991.<ref>Liner notes, ''The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt'' (album), 1995.</ref> In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with Touch and Go. At first, they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion. The case quickly became a fight for all ownership rights that dragged on for more than three years.\n\n{{Listen|type=single|filename= |format=[[Ogg]] |title=\"Pepper\"}}\n\nIn 1996, Capitol released Butthole Surfers' ''[[Electriclarryland]]'', which climbed to number 31 on the ''Billboard'' 200; the single \"[[Pepper (song)|Pepper]]\" topped the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks chart.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref>Charts & awards \u2013 Billboard albums, ''Allmusic''</ref> Their songs started appearing on the soundtracks of major Hollywood movies, including [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1996 movie)|Romeo + Juliet]]'' and [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Escape from L.A.]]''<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Despite improved sales with their second Capitol album, the group's relationship with the label was increasingly troubled.

Haynes and others said they wouldn't have initiated the proceedings if they felt Rusk's dealings had been honorable. Rusk provided the band with indecipherable accounting statements. Rusk continued to insist his actions were honest even though the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found otherwise.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/> With the case resolved, the band reissued ''Psychic...

Having resolved their dispute with Capitol, Butthole Surfers re-recorded most of ''After the Astronaut'''s songs for ''[[Weird Revolution]]'', on the [[Hollywood Records]]/[[Surfdog Records]] imprint. The album was released in August 2001, and reached number 130 on the ''Billboard'' 200. It was their most electronic album to date,<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/><ref>Kennedy, ''Weird Revolution'' review, ''Allmusic''.</ref> and the single \"The Shame of Life\" peaked at number 24 on the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks chart.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nSince then, the group has released two compilations on Latino Buggerveil: 2002's ''[[Humpty Dumpty LSD]]'' is a compilation of studio outtakes, while 2003's ''[[Butthole Surfers/Live PCPPEP]]'', combines their first two Alternative Tentacles EPs.<ref>Track listing & liner notes, ''Humpty Dumpty LSD'' (album), 2002.</ref><ref>Track listing & liner notes, ''Butthole Surfers/Live PCPPEP'' (album), 2003.</ref> In 2004, Haynes formed Gibby Haynes and His Problem, who released an eponymous album on Surfdog Records later that year. While promoting the side project, Haynes indicated that another Butthole Surfers studio album was likely, and remarked that it would be \"noisy\".<ref>Rock, \"Dr Rock VS Gibby Haynes\", PlayLouder.com.</ref> However, no release date has been announced.\n\nThe band reunited with [[Jeff Pinkus]] and [[Teresa Taylor|Teresa Nervosa]] for a tour of the East Coast and Europe in Summer 2008 with the Paul Green School of Rock All Stars. It was the first time the reunited line up played together since 1989. The group performed at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival curated by [[Melvins]] and [[Mike Patton]] of [[Faith No More]]. The group's appearance at All Tomorrow's Parties led to a dispute with ATP founder and organizer Barry Hogan, who told a reporter for the [[Village Voice]] that Butthole Surfers (along with [[Killing Joke]] and [[The Black Lips]]) would never play the festival again.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weingarten|first=Christopher|title=An Oral History of All Tomorrow's Parties|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-09-01/music/an-oral-history-of-all-tomorrow-s-parties/2/|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}</ref> The reunited 1986-1989 \"classic\" lineup continued to tour into 2009, with stops in the United States & Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buttholesurfers.com/tourdates.html|title=Butthole Surfers Tour Dates|website=buttholesurfers.com|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Austin, Texas]], during their last scheduled show for the North American/Canada 2008-2009 tour on October 31, 2009, Haynes said \"We played our first show as the Butthole Surfers in Austin. And this may be our last.\" Haynes has not yet clarified this statement. Recently, Paul Leary and King Coffey have both stated that the band will tour again if they can pull off another album. Currently, Paul Leary is producing the debut album from Carny. Butthole Surfers played two shows in Austin at Scoot Inn during Halloween 2010. A report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that, even though Butthole Surfers had not released an album of new material since 2001, the \"songs are practically incidental to the spectacle\" after seeing them perform along with psychedelic band [[Lumerians]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]].<ref name=twsO19>{{cite news|title=Pop and Rock Listings for Dec. 24-30|work=The New York Times|quote=The band hasn't released an album of new material since 2001, but the songs are practically incidental to the spectacle.

It's not fun, I don't like touring.

Especially now that [[Donald Trump|Trump]] is president, jeez! If there was ever a time for a Butthole Surfers album it's fucking now. It just doesn't get any weirder than that.\"<ref name=\"thequietus.com\"/>\n\nIn March 2019, the band released a visual history coffee table book, ''Butthole Surfers: What Does Regret Mean?'', with author [[Aaron Tanner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/butthole-surfers-new-book-gibby-haynes-763780/|title=Butthole Surfers Talk New Book: 'I Regret Not Regretting a Thing'|last=Grow|first=Kory|date=2018-12-07|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nThe band did not begin as Butthole Surfers, although they did have a song of that title, possibly an early version of 1984's \"Butthole Surfer\". This changed at their first paid concert, when an announcer forgot what the band was called and used the song title for the group's name. They decided to keep the moniker, and have largely been billed as such ever since.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 277\"/> Prior to that, Butthole Surfers performed under a different name at every live show. Early aliases included The [[Dick Clark]] Five, Nine cm Worm Makes Own Food, The Vodka Family Winstons, Ashtray Babyheads, [[Ed Asner]] Is Gay, [[Fred Astaire]]'s Asshole, The Right To Eat Fred Astaire's Asshole, Zipgun, The Inalienable Right To Eat Fred Astaire's Asshole, and many others.<ref name=spin/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jim-jarmusch.net/miscellanea/author_jim_jarmusch/interviewed_by_jim/gibby_haynes.html|title=Gibby Haynes of The Butthole Surfers &#124; The Jim Jarmusch Resource Page|publisher=Jim-jarmusch.net|accessdate=March 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325192516/http://www.jim-jarmusch.net/miscellanea/author_jim_jarmusch/interviewed_by_jim/gibby_haynes.html|archivedate=March 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In a 1996 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, when asked if he could go back and choose a different name for the band, Haynes replied \"I would name the band: I'm Going to Shit in Your Mother's Vagina.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/where-would-the-beatles-be-today-if-they-had-called-themselves-the-butthole-surfers-19961226|title=Butthole Surfers: America's Most Notorious Psycho-Delic Band|first=Charles M.|last=Young|date=December 26, 1996|website=rollingstone.com|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe name has long been a source of trouble for the band. Many clubs, newspapers, radio, and TV stations refuse to print or mention their full name, and instead opted to use \"B.H. Surfers\", or other abbreviations.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 277\"/>\n\n== Live performances ==\n[[File:Butthole Surfers Live.jpg|thumb|Butthole Surfers performing on December 6, 2008 in [[Minehead]], England. This performance features [[strobe lights]], [[smoke machine]]s and a projected film in the background.]]\nIn the 1980s, Butthole Surfers earned a reputation for their disturbing live performances that were both decadent and violent. As a result, they began to attract a wide range of curiosity seekers within a few years of their debut, in addition to traditional fans of [[punk rock]] who had supported them from the beginning.<ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 293\">Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 293.</ref> A staged reproduction of the band's live show was filmed for 1988's ''[[Bar-B-Que Movie]]'', a short [[Super 8 mm film]] movie directed by [[Alex Winter]], who is best known as \"Bill S. Preston, Esq.\" from ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]''.<ref>''Bar-B-Que Movie'' page, IMDb.com.</ref> Bar-B-Que Movie is a spoof of 1974's ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', and the film ends with a music video-style performance of the song \"Fast\" (a.k.a. \"Fart Song\"), featuring Haynes, Leary, Coffey, Nervosa, and [[Jeff Pinkus]], as well as dancer [[Kathleen Lynch (performer)|Kathleen Lynch]]. The track displayed many of the band's stage gimmicks, such as the burning cymbal, strobe lights, films, and smoke.<ref>''Bar-B-Que Movie'', YouTube.</ref>\n\nBy the time Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show had become more predictable, with previously random shockers being done at the same point in each night's performance. [[Teresa Taylor|Teresa Nervosa]] quit for good around the same time, and [[King Coffey]] became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even [[Gibby Haynes]]' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 288-289, 309.</ref>\n\n=== Appearance ===\nLead vocalist and saxophonist Haynes (who sometimes sang through a [[megaphone|bullhorn]]), guitarist Paul Leary, dual drummers Coffey and Nervosa (the latter briefly replaced by Cabbage), and whichever bassist happened to be filling in at the time, had a visual aspect. As with their music, their appearance was exceptionally non-conventional in the early days, including sideways mohawks, dreadlocks, unnaturally colored hair, and the like.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 282.</ref>\n\nKnown for taking the stage at early concerts with hundreds of clothespins attached to his hair and clothes, Haynes would often strip throughout a show until he was down to his underwear, or less, by the end. Other attire included flasher-style trench coats over his nakedness, ridiculously home-styled wigs and cross-dressing; often enjoying a skirt made of an American flag and a large '60s torpedo-style stuffed bra. At other times he would hide condoms full of stage blood in his clothes and repeatedly fall to the floor, appearing to bleed profusely. Some of Haynes' other favorite tricks involved throwing handfuls of photocopied cockroach images into the crowd, rolls and rolls of toilet paper tossed across the audience, as well as filling an inverted cymbal with lighter fluid, setting it (and sometimes his hand) on fire, and repeatedly hitting it with a mallet. As previously mentioned he would sing through almost anything that would alter his voice, including toilet paper rolls and megaphones early on, which eventually evolved into \"Gibby's kit\", a.k.a. \"Gibbytronix,\" a rack of vocal effects stacked as high as he could reach, before which he would often stand for the majority of the show in later performances. He also often utilized various foot switches which would be used to activate certain vocal effects, and when thought to be dancing during some performances he would actually be stepping on his various pedals. Adding to the spectacle were Coffey and Nervosa, who played in unison on stand-up drum kits; behind which they would collapse onto the floor and out of eyeshot, to collect their breath and strength before rising just in time to play the next song. Finally, the whole band would often tear apart stuffed animals while on stage, throwing the stuffing through the air, creating a rather disturbing throbbing effect, caused by the stroboscopes that were always on. <ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 288\u2013289.</ref>\n\nIn 1986, they first met Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady), who was then working at a strip club called Sex World in New York City.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 299, 301.</ref> Though never an official member, she became Butthole Surfers' famous \"naked dancer\", performing intermittently with them through 1989.<ref name=spin/> One show in Washington, D.C. with GWAR saw Kathleen take the stage to dance in nothing but gold body paint and antique wooden snow shoes. At another particularly wild concert in 1986, Haynes and Lynch, by now completely bald, reportedly engaged in sexual intercourse while on stage, as Leary used a screwdriver to vandalize the club's speakers. This came after only five songs, during which time Haynes had started a small fire.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 300.</ref>\n\n=== Equipment ===\nButthole Surfers began to take the collection of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 289, 293.</ref> Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies at the same time which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.<ref name=spin/>\nThe films' subject matter were often as disturbing as the manner in which they were played; with images of accidents, nuclear explosions, meat processing, spiders and scorpions stalking prey, gory driver's education films, and penis reconstruction surgery.<ref name=spin/><ref name=\"Azerrad, Our Band, p. 293\"/> Not all of the movies were horrific, and they often included nature, wildlife, and aquatic footage; as well as a color negative of a ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' episode.<ref>Azerrad, ''Our Band'', p. 294.</ref>\n\n== Members ==\nThough Butthole Surfers have been through numerous official and unofficial members since 1981, current members Gibby Haynes, Paul Leary, and King Coffey have been together since 1983.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Current\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "User agent", "text_new": "{{pp-pc1}}\nIn [[computing]], a '''user agent''' is software (a [[software agent]]) that is acting on behalf of a [[user (computing)|user]], such as a [[web browser]] that \"retrieves, renders and facilitates end user interaction with Web content\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent |title=W3C Definition of User Agent |publisher=www.w3.org |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=2018-10-20}}</ref> An email reader is a [[mail user agent]]. \n\nIn many cases, a user agent acts as a [[client (computing)|client]] in a [[network protocol]] used in communications within a [[client\u2013server]] distributed computing system. In particular, the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) identifies the client software originating the request, using a user-agent header, even when the client is not operated by a user.  The [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) protocol (based on HTTP) followed this usage. In the SIP, the term ''user agent'' refers to both end points of a communications session.<ref name=\"rfc3261\">RFC 3261, ''SIP: Session Initiation Protocol'', IETF, The Internet Society (2002)</ref>\n\n==User agent identification== <!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[User agent identification]] and several other redirects links here -->\nWhen a software agent operates in a network protocol, it often identifies itself, its application type, [[operating system]], software vendor, or software revision, by submitting a characteristic identification [[string (computer science)|string]] to its operating peer. In [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]],<ref name=\"rfc7231\">RFC 7231, ''Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content'', IETF, The Internet Society (June 2014)</ref> SIP,<ref name=\"rfc3261\" /> and NNTP<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Netnews Article Format |rfc=5536 |section=3.2.13 |date=November 2009 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref> protocols, this identification is transmitted in a header field ''User-Agent''. [[Internet bot|Bot]]s, such as Web crawlers, often also include a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] and/or [[e-mail address]] so that the [[Webmaster]] can contact the operator of the bot.\n\n==Use in HTTP==\nIn HTTP, the '''User-Agent string''' is often used for [[content negotiation]], where the origin server selects suitable content or operating parameters for the response. For example, the User-Agent string might be used by a web server to choose variants based on the known capabilities of a particular version of client software. The concept of content tailoring is built into the HTTP standard in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#page-46 RFC 1945] \"for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations.\u201d\n\nThe User-Agent string is one of the criteria by which Web crawlers may be excluded from accessing certain parts of a website using the [[Robots Exclusion Standard]] (''robots.txt'' file).\n\nAs with many other HTTP request headers, the information in the \"User-Agent\" string contributes to the information that the client sends to the server, since the string can vary considerably from user to user.<ref>Peter Eckersley. \"[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/tracking-by-user-agent Browser Versions Carry 10.5 Bits of Identifying Information on Average]\", [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], 27 January 2010. Retrieved 25 August 2011.</ref>\n\n===Format for human-operated web browsers===\nThe User-Agent string format is currently specified by section 5.5.3 of  [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3 HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content]. The format of the User-Agent string in HTTP is a list of product tokens (keywords) with optional comments. For example, if a user's product were called WikiBrowser, their user agent string might be ''WikiBrowser/1.0 Gecko/1.0''. The \"most important\" product component is listed first.\n\nThe parts of this string are as follows:\n\n* product name and version (''WikiBrowser/1.0'')\n* layout engine and version (''Gecko/1.0'')\n\nDuring the first [[browser wars|browser war]], many web servers were configured to only send web pages that required advanced features, including [[Framing (World Wide Web)|frames]], to clients that were identified as some version of [[Mozilla]].<ref>[http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/ History of the browser user-agent string]. WebAIM.</ref> Other browsers were considered to be older products such as [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]], or [[Samba (web browser)|Samba]], and would be sent a bare bones HTML document.\n\nFor this reason, most Web browsers use a User-Agent string value as follows:\n\n''Mozilla/[version] ([system and browser information]) [platform] ([platform details]) [extensions]''. For example, Safari on the iPad has used the following:\n\n Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405\n\nThe components of this string are as follows:\n\n* ''Mozilla/5.0'': Previously used to indicate compatibility with the Mozilla rendering engine.\n* ''(iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us)'': Details of the system in which the browser is running.\n* ''AppleWebKit/531.21.10'': The platform the browser uses.\n* ''(KHTML, like Gecko)'': Browser platform details.\n* ''Mobile/7B405'': This is used by the browser to indicate specific enhancements that are available directly in the browser or through third parties. An example of this is Microsoft Live Meeting which registers an extension so that the Live Meeting service knows if the software is already installed, which means it can provide a streamlined experience to joining meetings.\n\nBefore migrating to the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] code base, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] was the most widely used web browser that did not have the User-Agent string with \"Mozilla\" (instead beginning it with \"Opera\"). Since July 15, 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2013/07/15/opera-user-agent-strings-opera-15-and-beyond |title=Opera User Agent Strings: Opera 15 and Beyond |publisher=dev.opera.com |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}</ref> Opera's User-Agent string begins with \"Mozilla/5.0\" and, to avoid encountering legacy server rules, no longer includes the word \"Opera\" (instead using the string \"OPR\" to denote the Opera version).\n\n===Format for automated agents (bots) ===\nAutomated web crawling tools can use a simplified form, where an important field is contact information in case of problems.  By convention the word \"bot\" is included in the name of the agent{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. For example:\n\n <nowiki>Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)</nowiki>\n\nAutomated agents are expected to follow rules in a special file called \"[[robots.txt]]\".\nkkk\n\n===User agent spoofing=== <!-- courtesy note per [[WP:RESECT]]: [[User agent spoofing]] links here -->\nThe popularity of various Web browser products has varied throughout the Web's history, and this has influenced the design of websites in such a way that websites are sometimes designed to work well only with particular browsers, rather than according to uniform standards by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) or the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF). Websites often include code to detect browser version to adjust the page design sent according to the user agent string received. This may mean that less-popular browsers are not sent complex content (even though they might be able to deal with it correctly) or, in extreme cases, refused all content.<ref>[http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/ Burstein complaining \"...&nbsp;I've been rejected until I come back with Netscape\"]</ref> Thus, various browsers have a feature to ''cloak'' or ''spoof'' their identification to force certain server-side content. For example, the Android browser identifies itself as [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (among other things) in order to aid compatibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://androidcommunity.com/forums/f8/android-browser-reports-itself-as-apple-safari-4701/ |title=Android Browser Reports Itself as Apple Safari |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806170335/http://androidcommunity.com/forums/f8/android-browser-reports-itself-as-apple-safari-4701/ |archivedate=August 6, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=User Agent String explained: Android Webkit Browser|url=http://www.useragentstring.com/Android%20Webkit%20Browser_id_18070.php|publisher=UserAgentString.com|accessdate=29 July 2012|quote=Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2; en-sa; HTC_DesireHD_A9191 Build/FRF91) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1}}</ref>\n\nOther HTTP client programs, like [[download manager]]s and [[offline browser]]s, often have the ability to change the user agent string.\n\n[[Spam bots]] and [[Web scrapers]] often use fake user agents.\n\nA result of user agent spoofing may be that collected [[Usage share of web browsers|statistics of Web browser usage]] are inaccurate.\n\n===User agent sniffing===\n{{main article|Browser sniffing}}\n''User agent sniffing'' is the practice of websites showing different or adjusted content when viewed with certain user agents. An example of this is [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] 2003's Outlook Web Access feature.

In particular, the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) identifies the client software originating the request, using a user-agent header, even when the client is not operated by a user.  The [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) protocol (based on HTTP) followed this usage. In the SIP, the term ''user agent'' refers to both end points of a communications session.<ref name=\"rfc3261\">RFC 3261, ''SIP: Session Initiation Protocol'', IETF, The Internet Society (2002)</ref>\n\n==User agent identification== <!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[User agent identification]] and several other redirects links here -->\nWhen a software agent operates in a network protocol, it often identifies itself, its application type, [[operating system]], software vendor, or software revision, by submitting a characteristic identification [[string (computer science)|string]] to its operating peer. In [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]],<ref name=\"rfc7231\">RFC 7231, ''Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content'', IETF, The Internet Society (June 2014)</ref> SIP,<ref name=\"rfc3261\" /> and NNTP<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Netnews Article Format |rfc=5536 |section=3.2.13 |date=November 2009 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref> protocols, this identification is transmitted in a header field ''User-Agent''. [[Internet bot|Bot]]s, such as Web crawlers, often also include a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] and/or [[e-mail address]] so that the [[Webmaster]] can contact the operator of the bot.\n\n==Use in HTTP==\nIn HTTP, the '''User-Agent string''' is often used for [[content negotiation]], where the origin server selects suitable content or operating parameters for the response. For example, the User-Agent string might be used by a web server to choose variants based on the known capabilities of a particular version of client software. The concept of content tailoring is built into the HTTP standard in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#page-46 RFC 1945] \"for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations.\u201d\n\nThe User-Agent string is one of the criteria by which Web crawlers may be excluded from accessing certain parts of a website using the [[Robots Exclusion Standard]] (''robots.txt'' file).\n\nAs with many other HTTP request headers, the information in the \"User-Agent\" string contributes to the information that the client sends to the server, since the string can vary considerably from user to user.<ref>Peter Eckersley. \"[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/tracking-by-user-agent Browser Versions Carry 10.5 Bits of Identifying Information on Average]\", [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], 27 January 2010. Retrieved 25 August 2011.</ref>\n\n===Format for human-operated web browsers===\nThe User-Agent string format is currently specified by section 5.5.3 of  [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3 HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content]. The format of the User-Agent string in HTTP is a list of product tokens (keywords) with optional comments. For example, if a user's product were called WikiBrowser, their user agent string might be ''WikiBrowser/1.0 Gecko/1.0''. The \"most important\" product component is listed first.\n\nThe parts of this string are as follows:\n\n* product name and version (''WikiBrowser/1.0'')\n* layout engine and version (''Gecko/1.0'')\n\nDuring the first [[browser wars|browser war]], many web servers were configured to only send web pages that required advanced features, including [[Framing (World Wide Web)|frames]], to clients that were identified as some version of [[Mozilla]].<ref>[http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/ History of the browser user-agent string]. WebAIM.</ref> Other browsers were considered to be older products such as [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]], or [[Samba (web browser)|Samba]], and would be sent a bare bones HTML document.\n\nFor this reason, most Web browsers use a User-Agent string value as follows:\n\n''Mozilla/[version] ([system and browser information]) [platform] ([platform details]) [extensions]''. For example, Safari on the iPad has used the following:\n\n Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405\n\nThe components of this string are as follows:\n\n* ''Mozilla/5.0'': Previously used to indicate compatibility with the Mozilla rendering engine.\n* ''(iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us)'': Details of the system in which the browser is running.\n* ''AppleWebKit/531.21.10'': The platform the browser uses.\n* ''(KHTML, like Gecko)'': Browser platform details.\n* ''Mobile/7B405'': This is used by the browser to indicate specific enhancements that are available directly in the browser or through third parties. An example of this is Microsoft Live Meeting which registers an extension so that the Live Meeting service knows if the software is already installed, which means it can provide a streamlined experience to joining meetings.\n\nBefore migrating to the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] code base, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] was the most widely used web browser that did not have the User-Agent string with \"Mozilla\" (instead beginning it with \"Opera\"). Since July 15, 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2013/07/15/opera-user-agent-strings-opera-15-and-beyond |title=Opera User Agent Strings: Opera 15 and Beyond |publisher=dev.opera.com |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}</ref> Opera's User-Agent string begins with \"Mozilla/5.0\" and, to avoid encountering legacy server rules, no longer includes the word \"Opera\" (instead using the string \"OPR\" to denote the Opera version).\n\n===Format for automated agents (bots) ===\nAutomated web crawling tools can use a simplified form, where an important field is contact information in case of problems.  By convention the word \"bot\" is included in the name of the agent{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. For example:\n\n <nowiki>Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)</nowiki>\n\nAutomated agents are expected to follow rules in a special file called \"[[robots.txt]]\".\n\n===User agent spoofing=== <!-- courtesy note per [[WP:RESECT]]: [[User agent spoofing]] links here -->\nThe popularity of various Web browser products has varied throughout the Web's history, and this has influenced the design of websites in such a way that websites are sometimes designed to work well only with particular browsers, rather than according to uniform standards by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) or the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF). Websites often include code to detect browser version to adjust the page design sent according to the user agent string received. This may mean that less-popular browsers are not sent complex content (even though they might be able to deal with it correctly) or, in extreme cases, refused all content.<ref>[http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/ Burstein complaining \"...&nbsp;I've been rejected until I come back with Netscape\"]</ref> Thus, various browsers have a feature to ''cloak'' or ''spoof'' their identification to force certain server-side content. For example, the Android browser identifies itself as [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (among other things) in order to aid compatibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://androidcommunity.com/forums/f8/android-browser-reports-itself-as-apple-safari-4701/ |title=Android Browser Reports Itself as Apple Safari |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806170335/http://androidcommunity.com/forums/f8/android-browser-reports-itself-as-apple-safari-4701/ |archivedate=August 6, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=User Agent String explained: Android Webkit Browser|url=http://www.useragentstring.com/Android%20Webkit%20Browser_id_18070.php|publisher=UserAgentString.com|accessdate=29 July 2012|quote=Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2; en-sa; HTC_DesireHD_A9191 Build/FRF91) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1}}</ref>\n\nOther HTTP client programs, like [[download manager]]s and [[offline browser]]s, often have the ability to change the user agent string.\n\n[[Spam bots]] and [[Web scrapers]] often use fake user agents.\n\nA result of user agent spoofing may be that collected [[Usage share of web browsers|statistics of Web browser usage]] are inaccurate.\n\n===User agent sniffing===\n{{main article|Browser sniffing}}\n''User agent sniffing'' is the practice of websites showing different or adjusted content when viewed with certain user agents.

Theerthamalai is a village situated about 16&nbsp;km (about 9.9&nbsp;mi) northeast of Harur. Theerthagirishwarar Temple is located at the top of a hillock. The temple, situated about 1&nbsp;km (about 0.6&nbsp;mi) up the steep slope of the hillock, derives its name from the five springs in the temple. Lord '''Theerthagireeswar''' ([[Shiva]]) is the worshipping deity.\n\n==History==\nTheerthagirishwarar was built in the 7th century, with many contributions being made by the Chola and Pandya Kings. Several inscriptions can be found in Theerthagireeswarar Temple. The inscriptions on the temple say that Chola emperors, including Rajendra Cholan, regularly visited this temple. Poet Saint Arunagirinathar referred to Theerthagirieeswarar Temple in his compositions.\n\n===Greatness of the Temple===\nLord [[Sri Rama]], after winning the war against Ravana and returning to [[Ayodhya]], wanted to perform [[Shiva]] Puja in the temple. As Sri [[Hanuman]] could not return in time with holy Ganga water and flowers from Kasi, Rama shot an arrow on rock creating the Rama Theertha and completed the puja. The Rama Theertham is a tiny waterfall about 9.1 meters (about 30 feet) high. During summer, even when the river is dry, there will be sweet water in the spring that flows from rock. Sri Hanuman threw the pot of water from here, which fell at a distance of about 12&nbsp;km (about 7.4&nbsp;mi) from the hill and became ''Hanuman Theertham''. People take the first dip in Hanuman Theertha and then at Rama Theertha for relief from sins.\n\n==List of Theertham==\nTheertham means Holy water in Tamil. The most fascinating factor is that the tiny waterfalls never dry out, even during the most drought seasons recorded in the history.\nAll of which have their origin in different parts of the rocky surface.
