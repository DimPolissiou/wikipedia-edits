{"title_page": "Schwarzschild metric", "text_new": "{{General relativity sidebar |solutions}}\n\nIn [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], the '''Schwarzschild metric''' (also known as the '''Schwarzschild vacuum''' or '''Schwarzschild solution''') is the solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] that describes the [[gravitational field]] outside a spherical mass, on the assumption that the [[electric charge]] of the mass, [[angular momentum]] of the mass, and universal [[cosmological constant]] are all zero. The solution is a useful approximation for describing slowly rotating astronomical objects such as many [[star]]s and [[planet]]s, including Earth and the Sun. It was found by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1916, and around the same time independently by Johannes Droste, who published his much more complete and modern-looking discussion only four months after Schwarzschild.\n\nAccording to [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]], the Schwarzschild metric is the most general [[rotational symmetry|spherically symmetric]] [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]] of the Einstein field equations. A '''Schwarzschild black hole''' or '''static black hole''' is a [[black hole]] that has neither electric charge nor angular momentum. A Schwarzschild black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric, and cannot be distinguished from any other Schwarzschild black hole except by its mass.\n\nThe Schwarzschild black hole is characterized by a surrounding spherical boundary, called the [[event horizon]], which is situated at the [[Schwarzschild radius]], often called the radius of a black hole. The boundary is not a physical surface, and if a person fell through the event horizon (before being torn apart by tidal forces), they would not notice any physical surface at that position; it is a mathematical surface which is significant in determining the black hole's properties. Any non-rotating and non-charged mass that is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius forms a black hole. The solution of the Einstein field equations is valid for any mass {{mvar|M}}, so in principle (according to general relativity theory) a Schwarzschild black hole of any mass could exist if conditions became sufficiently favorable to allow for its formation.\n\n== The Schwarzschild metric ==\n{{See also|Deriving the Schwarzschild solution}}\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is a [[Spherically symmetric spacetime|spherically symmetric Lorentzian metric]] (here, with signature convention {{math|(-, +, +, +)}},) defined on (a subset of) \n::<math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\left(E^3 - O\\right) \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\times (0,\\infty) \\times S^2</math> \nwhere <math>E^3</math> is 3 dimensional Euclidean space, and <math>S^2 \\subset E^3</math> is the two sphere.

The Schwarzschild metric is a solution of [[Einstein's field equation#Vacuum field equations|Einstein's field equations]] in empty space, meaning that it is valid only ''outside'' the gravitating body. That is, for a spherical body of radius <math>R</math> the solution is valid for <math>r > R</math>.

They, however, did not recognize that their solutions were just coordinate transforms, and in fact used their solution to argue that Einstein's theory was wrong.

This led to definitive identification of the {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} singularity in the Schwarzschild metric as an [[event horizon]] (a hypersurface in spacetime that can be crossed in only one direction).<ref name=earman />\n\n== Singularities and black holes ==\nThe Schwarzschild solution appears to have [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] at {{math|1=''r'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}; some of the metric components \"blow up\" (entail division by zero or division by infinity) at these radii. Since the Schwarzschild metric is expected to be valid only for those radii larger than the radius {{mvar|R}} of the gravitating body, there is no problem as long as {{math|''R'' > ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. For ordinary stars and planets this is always the case. For example, the radius of the [[Sun]] is approximately {{val|700000|u=km}}, while its Schwarzschild radius is only {{val|3|u=km}}.\n\nThe singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} divides the Schwarzschild coordinates in two [[connectedness|disconnected]] [[coordinate patch|patches]]. The ''exterior Schwarzschild solution'' with {{math|''r'' > ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} is the one that is related to the gravitational fields of stars and planets. The ''interior Schwarzschild solution'' with {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' < ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}, which contains the singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = 0}}, is completely separated from the outer patch by the singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. The Schwarzschild coordinates therefore give no physical connection between the two patches, which may be viewed as separate solutions. The singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} is an illusion however; it is an instance of what is called a ''[[coordinate singularity]]''. As the name implies, the singularity arises from a bad choice of coordinates or [[coordinate conditions]]. When changing to a different coordinate system (for example [[Lemaitre coordinates]], [[Eddington\u2013Finkelstein coordinates]], [[Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates]], Novikov coordinates, or [[Gullstrand\u2013Painlev\u00e9 coordinates]]) the metric becomes regular at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} and can extend the external patch to values of {{mvar|r}} smaller than {{math|''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. Using a different coordinate transformation one can then relate the extended external patch to the inner patch.<ref>{{cite book\n |last1=Hughston |first1=L. P.\n |last2=Tod |first2=K.

If one asks that the solution be valid for all {{mvar|r}} one runs into a true physical singularity, or ''[[gravitational singularity]]'', at the origin. To see that this is a true singularity one must look at quantities that are independent of the choice of coordinates. One such important quantity is the [[Kretschmann invariant]], which is given by\n:<math>R^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} = \\frac{12 r_\\mathrm{s}^2}{r^6} = \\frac{48 G^2 M^2}{c^4 r^6} \\,.</math>\n\nAt {{math|1=''r'' = 0}} the curvature becomes infinite, indicating the presence of a singularity. At this point the metric, and spacetime itself, is no longer well-defined. For a long time it was thought that such a solution was non-physical. However, a greater understanding of general relativity led to the realization that such singularities were a generic feature of the theory and not just an exotic special case.\n\nThe Schwarzschild solution, taken to be valid for all {{math|''r'' > 0}}, is called a '''Schwarzschild black hole'''. It is a perfectly valid solution of the Einstein field equations, although it has some rather bizarre properties. For {{math|''r'' < ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} the Schwarzschild radial coordinate {{mvar|r}} becomes [[Spacetime#Time-like interval|timelike]] and the time coordinate {{mvar|t}} becomes [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|spacelike]]. A curve at constant {{mvar|r}} is no longer a possible [[worldline]] of a particle or observer, not even if a force is exerted to try to keep it there; this occurs because spacetime has been curved so much that the direction of cause and effect (the particle's future [[light cone]]) points into the singularity{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The surface {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} demarcates what is called the ''[[event horizon]]'' of the black hole. It represents the point past which light can no longer escape the gravitational field. Any physical object whose radius {{mvar|R}} becomes less than or equal to the Schwarzschild radius will undergo [[gravitational collapse]] and become a black hole.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Brill |first=D.\n |date=19 January 2012\n |title=Black Hole Horizons and How They Begin\n |url=http://astroreview.com/issue/2012/article/black-hole-horizons-and-how-they-begin\n |journal=Astronomical Review\n}}</ref>\n\n== Alternative coordinates ==\nThe Schwarzschild solution can be expressed in a range of different choices of coordinates besides the Schwarzschild coordinates used above.

It should not be confused with the unrelated concept of a [[gravity well]].]]\n\nThe spatial curvature of the Schwarzschild solution for {{math|''r'' > ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} can be visualized as the graphic shows. Consider a constant time equatorial slice through the Schwarzschild solution ({{math|1=''\u03b8'' = {{frac|\u03c0|2}}}}, {{mvar|t}} = constant) and let the position of a particle moving in this plane be described with the remaining Schwarzschild coordinates {{math|(''r'', ''\u03c6'')}}. Imagine now that there is an additional Euclidean dimension {{mvar|w}}, which has no physical reality (it is not part of spacetime). Then replace the {{math|(''r'', ''\u03c6'')}} plane with a surface dimpled in the {{mvar|w}} direction according to the equation (''Flamm's paraboloid'')\n:<math>w = 2 \\sqrt{r_\\mathrm{s} \\left( r - r_\\mathrm{s} \\right)}.</math>\n\nThis surface has the property that distances measured within it match distances in the Schwarzschild metric, because with the definition of ''w'' above,\n:<math>dw^2 + dr^2 + r^2\\, d\\varphi^2 = -c^2 \\,d\\tau^2 = \\frac{dr^2}{1 - \\frac{r_\\mathrm{s}}{r}} + r^2\\, d\\varphi^2</math>\n\nThus, Flamm's paraboloid is useful for visualizing the spatial curvature of the Schwarzschild metric. It should not, however, be confused with a [[gravity well]]. No ordinary (massive or massless) particle can have a worldline lying on the paraboloid, since all distances on it are [[spacelike]] (this is a cross-section at one moment of time, so any particle moving on it would have an infinite [[velocity]]). A [[tachyon]] could have a spacelike worldline that lies entirely on a single paraboloid. However, even in that case its [[geodesic]] path is not the trajectory one gets through a \"rubber sheet\" analogy of gravitational well: in particular, if the dimple is drawn pointing upward rather than downward, the tachyon's geodesic path still curves toward the central mass, not away. See the [[gravity well]] article for more information.\n\nFlamm's paraboloid may be derived as follows. The Euclidean metric in the [[cylindrical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''\u03c6'', ''w'')}} is written\n:<math>ds^2 = dw^2 + dr^2 + r^2 \\,d\\varphi^2 \\,.</math>\n\nLetting the surface be described by the function {{math|1=''w'' = ''w''(''r'')}}, the Euclidean metric can be written as\n:<math>ds^2 = \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{dw}{dr}\\right)^2 \\right) \\,dr^2 + r^2\\,d\\varphi^2 \\,,</math>\n\nComparing this with the Schwarzschild metric in the equatorial plane ({{math|1=''\u03b8'' = {{sfrac|\u03c0|2}}}}) at a fixed time ({{mvar|t}} = constant, {{math|1=''dt'' = 0}})\n:<math>ds^2 = \\left(1-\\frac{r_\\mathrm{s}}{r} \\right)^{-1} \\,dr^2 + r^2\\,d\\varphi^2 \\,,</math>\n\nyields an integral expression for {{math|''w''(''r'')}}:\n:<math>w(r) = \\int \\frac{dr}{\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r_\\mathrm{s}}-1}} = 2 r_\\mathrm{s} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r_\\mathrm{s}}- 1} + \\mbox{constant}</math>\n\nwhose solution is Flamm's paraboloid.\n\n== Orbital motion ==\n[[File:Newton.vs.Schwarzschild.thumbnail.250px.png|thumb|right|link=File:Newton_versus_Schwarzschild_trajectories.gif|Comparison between the orbit of a test particle in Newtonian (left) and Schwarzschild (right) spacetime; note the [[Apsidal precession]] on the right.]]{{Details|Schwarzschild geodesics}}\n\nA particle orbiting in the Schwarzschild metric can have a stable circular orbit with {{math|''r'' > 3''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. Circular orbits with {{mvar|r}} between {{math|1.5''r''<sub>s</sub>}} and {{math|3''r''<sub>s</sub>}} are unstable, and no circular orbits exist for {{math|''r'' < 1.5''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. The circular orbit of minimum radius {{math|1.5''r''<sub>s</sub>}} corresponds to an orbital velocity approaching the speed of light. It is possible for a particle to have a constant value of {{mvar|r}} between {{math|''r''<sub>s</sub>}} and {{math|1.5''r''<sub>s</sub>}}, but only if some force acts to keep it there.\n\nNoncircular orbits, such as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s, dwell longer at small radii than would be expected in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian gravity]] . This can be seen as a less extreme version of the more dramatic case in which a particle passes through the event horizon and dwells inside it forever. Intermediate between the case of Mercury and the case of an object falling past the event horizon, there are exotic possibilities such as knife-edge orbits, in which the satellite can be made to execute an arbitrarily large number of nearly circular orbits, after which it flies back outward.\n\n== Symmetries ==\nThe group of isometries of the Schwarzschild metric is the subgroup of the ten-dimensional [[Poincar\u00e9 group]] which takes the time axis (trajectory of the star) to itself. It omits the spatial translations (three dimensions) and boosts (three dimensions). It retains the time translations (one dimension) and rotations (three dimensions). Thus it has four dimensions. Like the Poincar\u00e9 group, it has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time reversed and spatially inverted.\n\n==Curvatures==\nThe Ricci curvature scalar and the [[Ricci curvature tensor]] are both zero.

The solution is a useful approximation for describing slowly rotating astronomical objects such as many [[star]]s and [[planet]]s, including Earth and the Sun. It was found by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1916, and around the same time independently by Johannes Droste, who published his much more complete and modern-looking discussion only four months after Schwarzschild.\n\nAccording to [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]], the Schwarzschild metric is the most general [[rotational symmetry|spherically symmetric]] [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]] of the Einstein field equations. A '''Schwarzschild black hole''' or '''static black hole''' is a [[black hole]] that has neither electric charge nor angular momentum. A Schwarzschild black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric, and cannot be distinguished from any other Schwarzschild black hole except by its mass.\n\nThe Schwarzschild black hole is characterized by a surrounding spherical boundary, called the [[event horizon]], which is situated at the [[Schwarzschild radius]], often called the radius of a black hole. The boundary is not a physical surface, and if a person fell through the event horizon (before being torn apart by tidal forces), they would not notice any physical surface at that position; it is a mathematical surface which is significant in determining the black hole's properties. Any non-rotating and non-charged mass that is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius forms a black hole. The solution of the Einstein field equations is valid for any mass {{mvar|M}}, so in principle (according to general relativity theory) a Schwarzschild black hole of any mass could exist if conditions became sufficiently favorable to allow for its formation.\n\n== The Schwarzschild metric ==\n{{See also|Deriving the Schwarzschild solution}}\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is a [[Spherically symmetric spacetime|spherically symmetric Lorentzian metric]] (here, with signature convention {{math|(-, +, +, +)}},) defined on (a subset of) \n::<math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\left(E^3 - O\\right) \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\times (0,\\infty) \\times S^2</math> \nwhere <math>E^3</math> is 3 dimensional Euclidean space, and <math>S^2 \\subset E^3</math> is the two sphere.

Depending on the point of view, the metric is therefore defined only on the exterior region <math>r > r_s</math>, only on the interior region <math>r < r_s</math> or their disjoint union. However, the metric is actually non singular across the event horizon as one sees in suitable coordinates (see below). For <math>r \\gg r_s </math>, the Schwarzschild metric is asymptotic to the standard Lorentz metric on Minkowski space. For almost all astrophysical objects, the ratio <math>\\frac{r_s}{R}</math> is extremely small.

Although there was general consensus that the singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = 0}} was a 'genuine' physical singularity, the nature of the singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} remained unclear.<ref name=earman />\n\nIn 1921 [[Paul Painlev\u00e9]] and in 1922 [[Allvar Gullstrand]] independently produced a metric, a spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's equations, which we now know is coordinate transformation of the Schwarzschild metric, [[Gullstrand\u2013Painlev\u00e9 coordinates]], in which there was no singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. They, however, did not recognize that their solutions were just coordinate transforms, and in fact used their solution to argue that Einstein's theory was wrong. In 1924 [[Arthur Eddington]] produced the first coordinate transformation ([[Eddington\u2013Finkelstein coordinates]]) that showed that the singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} was a coordinate artifact, although he also seems to have been unaware of the significance of this discovery.

In 1939 [[Howard Percy Robertson|Howard Robertson]] showed that a free falling observer descending in the Schwarzschild metric would cross the {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} singularity in a finite amount of [[proper time]] even though this would take an infinite amount of time in terms of coordinate time {{mvar|t}}.<ref name=earman>{{cite book\n |last=Earman |first=J.\n |year=1999\n |chapter=The Penrose\u2013Hawking singularity theorems: History and Implications\n |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mGZno8CvnQC&pg=PA236\n |page=236-\n |editor-first=H. |editor-last=Goenner\n |title=The expanding worlds of general relativity\n |isbn=978-0-8176-4060-6\n |publisher=[[Birkh\u00e4user]]\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, [[John Lighton Synge|John Synge]] produced a paper<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Synge |first=J.

This led to definitive identification of the {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} singularity in the Schwarzschild metric as an [[event horizon]] (a hypersurface in spacetime that can be crossed in only one direction).<ref name=earman />\n\n== Singularities and black holes ==\nThe Schwarzschild solution appears to have [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] at {{math|1=''r'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}; some of the metric components \"blow up\" (entail division by zero or division by infinity) at these radii. Since the Schwarzschild metric is expected to be valid only for those radii larger than the radius {{mvar|R}} of the gravitating body, there is no problem as long as {{math|''R'' > ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. For ordinary stars and planets this is always the case. For example, the radius of the [[Sun]] is approximately {{val|700000|u=km}}, while its Schwarzschild radius is only {{val|3|u=km}}.\n\nThe singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} divides the Schwarzschild coordinates in two [[connectedness|disconnected]] [[coordinate patch|patches]]. The ''exterior Schwarzschild solution'' with {{math|''r'' > ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} is the one that is related to the gravitational fields of stars and planets. The ''interior Schwarzschild solution'' with {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' < ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}, which contains the singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = 0}}, is completely separated from the outer patch by the singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. The Schwarzschild coordinates therefore give no physical connection between the two patches, which may be viewed as separate solutions. The singularity at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} is an illusion however; it is an instance of what is called a ''[[coordinate singularity]]''. As the name implies, the singularity arises from a bad choice of coordinates or [[coordinate conditions]]. When changing to a different coordinate system (for example [[Lemaitre coordinates]], [[Eddington\u2013Finkelstein coordinates]], [[Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates]], Novikov coordinates, or [[Gullstrand\u2013Painlev\u00e9 coordinates]]) the metric becomes regular at {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} and can extend the external patch to values of {{mvar|r}} smaller than {{math|''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. Using a different coordinate transformation one can then relate the extended external patch to the inner patch.<ref>{{cite book\n |last1=Hughston |first1=L. P.\n |last2=Tod |first2=K.

If one asks that the solution be valid for all {{mvar|r}} one runs into a true physical singularity, or ''[[gravitational singularity]]'', at the origin. To see that this is a true singularity one must look at quantities that are independent of the choice of coordinates. One such important quantity is the [[Kretschmann invariant]], which is given by\n:<math>R^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} = \\frac{12 r_\\mathrm{s}^2}{r^6} = \\frac{48 G^2 M^2}{c^4 r^6} \\,.</math>\n\nAt {{math|1=''r'' = 0}} the curvature becomes infinite, indicating the presence of a singularity. At this point the metric, and spacetime itself, is no longer well-defined. For a long time it was thought that such a solution was non-physical. However, a greater understanding of general relativity led to the realization that such singularities were a generic feature of the theory and not just an exotic special case.\n\nThe Schwarzschild solution, taken to be valid for all {{math|''r'' > 0}}, is called a '''Schwarzschild black hole'''. It is a perfectly valid solution of the Einstein field equations, although it has some rather bizarre properties. For {{math|''r'' < ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} the Schwarzschild radial coordinate {{mvar|r}} becomes [[Spacetime#Time-like interval|timelike]] and the time coordinate {{mvar|t}} becomes [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|spacelike]]. A curve at constant {{mvar|r}} is no longer a possible [[worldline]] of a particle or observer, not even if a force is exerted to try to keep it there; this occurs because spacetime has been curved so much that the direction of cause and effect (the particle's future [[light cone]]) points into the singularity{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The surface {{math|1=''r'' = ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} demarcates what is called the ''[[event horizon]]'' of the black hole. It represents the point past which light can no longer escape the gravitational field. Any physical object whose radius {{mvar|R}} becomes less than or equal to the Schwarzschild radius will undergo [[gravitational collapse]] and become a black hole.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Brill |first=D.\n |date=19 January 2012\n |title=Black Hole Horizons and How They Begin\n |url=http://astroreview.com/issue/2012/article/black-hole-horizons-and-how-they-begin\n |journal=Astronomical Review\n}}</ref>\n\n== Alternative coordinates ==\nThe Schwarzschild solution can be expressed in a range of different choices of coordinates besides the Schwarzschild coordinates used above.

It should not be confused with the unrelated concept of a [[gravity well]].]]\n\nThe spatial curvature of the Schwarzschild solution for {{math|''r'' > ''r''<sub>s</sub>}} can be visualized as the graphic shows. Consider a constant time equatorial slice through the Schwarzschild solution ({{math|1=''\u03b8'' = {{frac|\u03c0|2}}}}, {{mvar|t}} = constant) and let the position of a particle moving in this plane be described with the remaining Schwarzschild coordinates {{math|(''r'', ''\u03c6'')}}. Imagine now that there is an additional Euclidean dimension {{mvar|w}}, which has no physical reality (it is not part of spacetime). Then replace the {{math|(''r'', ''\u03c6'')}} plane with a surface dimpled in the {{mvar|w}} direction according to the equation (''Flamm's paraboloid'')\n:<math>w = 2 \\sqrt{r_\\mathrm{s} \\left( r - r_\\mathrm{s} \\right)}.</math>\n\nThis surface has the property that distances measured within it match distances in the Schwarzschild metric, because with the definition of ''w'' above,\n:<math>dw^2 + dr^2 + r^2\\, d\\varphi^2 = -c^2 \\,d\\tau^2 = \\frac{dr^2}{1 - \\frac{r_\\mathrm{s}}{r}} + r^2\\, d\\varphi^2</math>\n\nThus, Flamm's paraboloid is useful for visualizing the spatial curvature of the Schwarzschild metric. It should not, however, be confused with a [[gravity well]]. No ordinary (massive or massless) particle can have a worldline lying on the paraboloid, since all distances on it are [[spacelike]] (this is a cross-section at one moment of time, so any particle moving on it would have an infinite [[velocity]]). A [[tachyon]] could have a spacelike worldline that lies entirely on a single paraboloid. However, even in that case its [[geodesic]] path is not the trajectory one gets through a \"rubber sheet\" analogy of gravitational well: in particular, if the dimple is drawn pointing upward rather than downward, the tachyon's geodesic path still curves toward the central mass, not away. See the [[gravity well]] article for more information.\n\nFlamm's paraboloid may be derived as follows. The Euclidean metric in the [[cylindrical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''\u03c6'', ''w'')}} is written\n:<math>ds^2 = dw^2 + dr^2 + r^2 \\,d\\varphi^2 \\,.</math>\n\nLetting the surface be described by the function {{math|1=''w'' = ''w''(''r'')}}, the Euclidean metric can be written as\n:<math>ds^2 = \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{dw}{dr}\\right)^2 \\right) \\,dr^2 + r^2\\,d\\varphi^2 \\,,</math>\n\nComparing this with the Schwarzschild metric in the equatorial plane ({{math|1=''\u03b8'' = {{sfrac|\u03c0|2}}}}) at a fixed time ({{mvar|t}} = constant, {{math|1=''dt'' = 0}})\n:<math>ds^2 = \\left(1-\\frac{r_\\mathrm{s}}{r} \\right)^{-1} \\,dr^2 + r^2\\,d\\varphi^2 \\,,</math>\n\nyields an integral expression for {{math|''w''(''r'')}}:\n:<math>w(r) = \\int \\frac{dr}{\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r_\\mathrm{s}}-1}} = 2 r_\\mathrm{s} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r_\\mathrm{s}}- 1} + \\mbox{constant}</math>\n\nwhose solution is Flamm's paraboloid.\n\n== Orbital motion ==\n[[File:Newton.vs.Schwarzschild.thumbnail.250px.png|thumb|right|link=File:Newton_versus_Schwarzschild_trajectories.gif|Comparison between the orbit of a test particle in Newtonian (left) and Schwarzschild (right) spacetime; note the [[Apsidal precession]] on the right.]]{{Details|Schwarzschild geodesics}}\n\nA particle orbiting in the Schwarzschild metric can have a stable circular orbit with {{math|''r'' > 3''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. Circular orbits with {{mvar|r}} between {{math|1.5''r''<sub>s</sub>}} and {{math|3''r''<sub>s</sub>}} are unstable, and no circular orbits exist for {{math|''r'' < 1.5''r''<sub>s</sub>}}. The circular orbit of minimum radius {{math|1.5''r''<sub>s</sub>}} corresponds to an orbital velocity approaching the speed of light. It is possible for a particle to have a constant value of {{mvar|r}} between {{math|''r''<sub>s</sub>}} and {{math|1.5''r''<sub>s</sub>}}, but only if some force acts to keep it there.\n\nNoncircular orbits, such as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s, dwell longer at small radii than would be expected in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian gravity]] . This can be seen as a less extreme version of the more dramatic case in which a particle passes through the event horizon and dwells inside it forever. Intermediate between the case of Mercury and the case of an object falling past the event horizon, there are exotic possibilities such as knife-edge orbits, in which the satellite can be made to execute an arbitrarily large number of nearly circular orbits, after which it flies back outward.\n\n== Symmetries ==\nThe group of isometries of the Schwarzschild metric is the subgroup of the ten-dimensional [[Poincar\u00e9 group]] which takes the time axis (trajectory of the star) to itself. It omits the spatial translations (three dimensions) and boosts (three dimensions). It retains the time translations (one dimension) and rotations (three dimensions). Thus it has four dimensions. Like the Poincar\u00e9 group, it has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time reversed and spatially inverted.\n\n==Curvatures==\nThe Ricci curvature scalar and the [[Ricci curvature tensor]] are both zero. Non-zero components of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] are<ref>Misner, Charles W., Thorne, Kip S., Wheeler, John Archibald, \"Gravitation\", W.H.

In an orthonormal basis of an observer the non-zero components in [[geometric units]] are<ref>Misner, Charles W., Thorne, Kip S., Wheeler, John Archibald, \"Gravitation\", W.H.

Earth Defense Force}} is a 1957 Japanese [[science fiction]] film directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] and stars [[Kenji Sahara]], [[Yumi Shirakawa]] and [[Takashi Shimura]]. The film begins with a giant fissure destroying an entire village. This leads to an investigation whereby the source is discovered to be Moguera, a giant robot, who is then destroyed by the military. The remains are analyzed and discovered to be of alien origin. Shortly after, an alien race known as the Mysterians arrive, declaring they have taken some Earth women captive and that they demand both land and the right to marry women of Earth.\n\nFor ''The Mysterians'', producer [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]] recruited [[Jojiro Okami]], a science fiction writer, to develop the story. Honda later elaborated that he wanted the film to differ from both ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Rodan (film)|Rodan]]'' and to make it more of a \"true science fiction film,\" one to promote peace and understanding between cultures. The film was popular upon its release in Japan, where it was among the top ten grossing domestic productions of the year. Contemporary reviews from Western critics in the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the special effect work but criticized the plot as confusing and juvenile, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Astrophysicist]] Ryoichi Shiraishi, his fiancee Hiroko, his sister Etsuko, and his friend Joji Atsumi attend a festival at a local village near [[Mount Fuji]]. Shiraishi then tells Atsumi that he has broken off his engagement with Hiroko but gives no reason other than an undisclosed obligation to remain in the village. Then, a  mysterious forest fire flares up, burning more rapidly than normal and emanating from the ground, and Shiraishi rushes out to investigate and disappears during the confusion.\n\nThe next day, Atsumi is at the local observatory, where he meets with his mentor, head [[astronomer]], Tanjiro Adachi. He hands the doctor a report written by Shiraishi that concerns a newly discovered [[asteroid]] that Shiraishi theorized was once a planet between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. He has named it Mysteroid. However, Adachi does not believe in his radical theory and also points out that the report is not complete.\n\nMeanwhile, the village in which the festival was held is completely wiped out by a massive [[earthquake]]. While investigating the area, Atsumi and a group of police officers stumble upon a giant robot, [[Moguera]], which bursts from the side of a hill. It emits rays which decimate the investigation team; only Atsumi and the lead policeman survive. The robot then advances to a town near Koyama Bridge that night, and is met by heavy resistance from Japan's self-defense force. However, the conventional artillery has no effect on the war machine, and the automaton continues its rampage until it tries to cross the Koyama Bridge, which is detonated, sending the machine crashing down to the ground below and destroying it.\n\nAt the [[Diet Building]], Atsumi briefs officials on what has been learned about the robot. The remains of the giant machine reveal that it was manufactured out of an unknown chemical compound. Shortly afterwards, astronomers witness activity in outer space around the moon. They alert the world to this discovery, and not long after, the aliens emerge, their gigantic dome breaking through Earth's crust near Mount Fuji.\n\nAs a combined military and scientific entourage observes the dome, a voice calls out to request five scientists, including Dr. Adachi, who is among the observers, to come to the dome for a conference. The men agree to this meeting and are formally ushered into the dome, where the Mysterians, a scientifically advanced humanoid alien race, list their demands from the people of Earth: a two-mile-radius strip of land and the right to marry women of Earth. The reason for this is that 100,000 years ago their planet&mdash;Mysteroid, once the [[Planet V|fifth planet from the sun]]&mdash;was destroyed by a nuclear war. Some Mysterians were able to escape to Mars before their planet was rendered uninhabitable. However, owing to the nuclear war, Strontium-90 has left 80&nbsp;percent of the aliens' population deformed and crippled. The proposed interbreeding with women on Earth would produce healthier offspring and keep their race alive. The latter part of their demands is downplayed, as they admit to already taking three women captive and reveal two others that they are interested in, one of which is Etsuko.\n\nJapan quickly dismisses this request and begins the mobilization of its armed forces around [[Mount Fuji]]. It is also discovered that the missing Shiraishi has sided with the advance race because of their technological achievements. Japan wastes no time, though, and quickly launches a full-scale attack against the Mysterians' dome. However, the modern weaponry is no match for their technology, and Japan's forces are easily fought back. Distraught by this setback, Japan sends their plea to other nations that they join together to remove the threat of the Mysterians from Earth. The nations around the world answer the plea and in no time issue another raid against the Mysterians' dome, this time utilizing the newly developed Alpha and Beta class airships. Sadly, this attack meets failure as well.\n\nThe Mysterians then increase their demand, asking for a 75-mile-radius plot of land, as the Earth continues to develop a new method of attack. Earth's efforts in this matter pay off as a Markalite FAHP (Flying Atomic Heat Projector), a gigantic lens that can reflect the Mysterians\u2019 weaponry, is designed. Meanwhile, the Mysterians kidnap Etsuko and Hiroko, causing Atsumi to search for, and locate, a cave entrance to a tunnel under the Mysterians' dome.\n\nIn the meantime, the Markalite FAHP's are deployed by large Markalite GYRO rockets, and the final battle against the Mysterians' base of operations commences. Atsumi enters the dome and finds the women, alive and unharmed, in an unguarded room. Taking them back to the tunnel, Atsumi finds Shiraishi, who admits the Mysterians duped him and have no good intentions, and then returns to the dome and sacrifices himself in a final attack on the base from the inside while the Markalite FAHP's assault the base from above ground.

Earth Defense Force}} is a 1957 Japanese [[science fiction]] film directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] and stars [[Kenji Sahara]], [[Yumi Shirakawa]] and [[Takashi Shimura]]. The film begins with a giant fissure destroying an entire village. This leads to an investigation whereby the source is discovered to be Moguera, a giant robot, who is then destroyed by the military. The remains are analyzed and discovered to be of alien origin. Shortly after, an alien race known as the Mysterians arrive, declaring they have taken some Earth women captive and that they demand both land and the right to marry women of Earth.\n\nFor ''The Mysterians'', producer [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]] recruited [[Jojiro Okami]], a science fiction writer, to develop the story. Honda later elaborated that he wanted the film to differ from both ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Rodan (film)|Rodan]]'' and to make it more of a \"true science fiction film,\" one to promote peace and understanding between cultures. The film was popular upon its release in Japan, where it was among the top ten grossing domestic productions of the year. Contemporary reviews from Western critics in the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the special effect work but criticized the plot as confusing and juvenile, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Astrophysicist]] Ryoichi Shiraishi, his fiancee Hiroko, his sister Etsuko, and his friend Joji Atsumi attend a festival at a local village near [[Mount Fuji]]. Shiraishi then tells Atsumi that he has broken off his engagement with Hiroko but gives no reason other than an undisclosed obligation to remain in the village. Then, a  mysterious forest fire flares up, burning more rapidly than normal and emanating from the ground, and Shiraishi rushes out to investigate and disappears during the confusion.\n\nThe next day, Atsumi is at the local observatory, where he meets with his mentor, head [[astronomer]], Tanjiro Adachi. He hands the doctor a report written by Shiraishi that concerns a newly discovered [[asteroid]] that Shiraishi theorized was once a planet between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. He has named it Mysteroid. However, Adachi does not believe in his radical theory and also points out that the report is not complete.\n\nMeanwhile, the village in which the festival was held is completely wiped out by a massive [[earthquake]]. While investigating the area, Atsumi and a group of police officers stumble upon a giant robot, [[Moguera]], which bursts from the side of a hill. It emits rays which decimate the investigation team; only Atsumi and the lead policeman survive. The robot then advances to a town near Koyama Bridge that night, and is met by heavy resistance from Japan's self-defense force. However, the conventional artillery has no effect on the war machine, and the automaton continues its rampage until it tries to cross the Koyama Bridge, which is detonated, sending the machine crashing down to the ground below and destroying it.\n\nAt the [[Diet Building]], Atsumi briefs officials on what has been learned about the robot. The remains of the giant machine reveal that it was manufactured out of an unknown chemical compound. Shortly afterwards, astronomers witness activity in outer space around the moon. They alert the world to this discovery, and not long after, the aliens emerge, their gigantic dome breaking through Earth's crust near Mount Fuji.\n\nAs a combined military and scientific entourage observes the dome, a voice calls out to request five scientists, including Dr. Adachi, who is among the observers, to come to the dome for a conference. The men agree to this meeting and are formally ushered into the dome, where the Mysterians, a scientifically advanced humanoid alien race, list their demands from the people of Earth: a two-mile-radius strip of land and the right to marry women of Earth. The reason for this is that 100,000 years ago their planet&mdash;Mysteroid, once the [[Planet V|fifth planet from the sun]]&mdash;was destroyed by a nuclear war. Some Mysterians were able to escape to Mars before their planet was rendered uninhabitable. However, owing to the nuclear war, Strontium-90 has left 80&nbsp;percent of the aliens' population deformed and crippled. The proposed interbreeding with women on Earth would produce healthier offspring and keep their race alive. The latter part of their demands is downplayed, as they admit to already taking three women captive and reveal two others that they are interested in, one of which is Etsuko.\n\nJapan quickly dismisses this request and begins the mobilization of its armed forces around [[Mount Fuji]]. It is also discovered that the missing Shiraishi has sided with the advance race because of their technological achievements. Japan wastes no time, though, and quickly launches a full-scale attack against the Mysterians' dome. However, the modern weaponry is no match for their technology, and Japan's forces are easily fought back. Distraught by this setback, Japan sends their plea to other nations that they join together to remove the threat of the Mysterians from Earth. The nations around the world answer the plea and in no time issue another raid against the Mysterians' dome, this time utilizing the newly developed Alpha and Beta class airships. Sadly, this attack meets failure as well.\n\nThe Mysterians then increase their demand, asking for a 75-mile-radius plot of land, as the Earth continues to develop a new method of attack. Earth's efforts in this matter pay off as a Markalite FAHP (Flying Atomic Heat Projector), a gigantic lens that can reflect the Mysterians\u2019 weaponry, is designed. Meanwhile, the Mysterians kidnap Etsuko and Hiroko, causing Atsumi to search for, and locate, a cave entrance to a tunnel under the Mysterians' dome.\n\nIn the meantime, the Markalite FAHP's are deployed by large Markalite GYRO rockets, and the final battle against the Mysterians' base of operations commences. Atsumi enters the dome and finds the women, alive and unharmed, in an unguarded room. Taking them back to the tunnel, Atsumi finds Shiraishi, who admits the Mysterians duped him and have no good intentions, and then returns to the dome and sacrifices himself in a final attack on the base from the inside while the Markalite FAHP's assault the base from above ground. The dome collapses and then explodes as Adachi and the women reach safety in the hills above the Mysterians' occupied land. A few enemy spaceships are observed fleeing into space, out of range of Earth weaponry, and Dr. Adachi comments on the need for continued vigilance.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kenji Sahara]] as J\u014dji Atsumi\n*[[Yumi Shirakawa]] as Etsuko Shiraishi\n*[[Momoko K\u014dchi]] as Hiroko Iwamoto\n*[[Akihiko Hirata]] as Ry\u014dichi Shiraishi\n*[[Takashi Shimura]] as Dr. Kenjir\u014d Adachi\n*[[Susumu Fujita]] as General Morita\n*[[Hisaya It\u014d]] as Captain Seki\n*[[Yoshio Kosugi]] as Commander Sugimoto\n*[[Fuyuki Murakami]] as Dr. Nobu Kawanami\n*[[Tetsu Nakamura (actor)|Tetsu Nakamura]] as Dr. K\u014dda\n*[[Yoshio Tsuchiya]] as Mysterian Leader\n\n==Production==\nDirector Ishiro Honda described the film, saying it was \"larger in scale compared to ''Godzilla'' or ''Rodan'' and is aimed to be more of a true science fiction film&nbsp;...
