Adorno had been a member of the \"[[Frankfurt School]]\", a group of philosophers and Marxist theorists who fled Germany when Hitler shut down their [[Institute for Social Research]]. Adorno et al. were thus motivated by a desire{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} to identify and measure factors that were believed to contribute to antisemitic and fascist traits. The book was part of a \"Studies in Prejudice\" series sponsored by the [[American Jewish Committee]]'s Department of Scientific Research.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Horkheimer, Max |author2=Flowerman, Samuel H | year = 1950 | title =  Foreword to Studies in Prejudice in \"The Authoritarian Personality\" | publisher = Norton Library|pages=v\u2013vi}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/5A52.PDF American Jewish Committee ''News''], 15 March 1950.</ref>\n\n==Sources and influences==\n''The Authoritarian Personality'' was based in part on earlier Frankfurt School analyses undertaken in Germany, but with a few key changes. First, their Marxist and radical roots were downplayed.  For example, the earlier \u201cauthoritarian personality/revolutionary personality\u201d axis was changed to an \u201cauthoritarian personality/democratic personality\u201d axis in America.  Thus, values and behaviors earlier associated with revolutionary Marxism were now associated with support for [[democracy]].<ref>Jay, Martin (1973).

Instead, it recognizes that\nsocial science research is inevitably value-laden, which calls for a model of\nscientist who is a self-reflective interpreter, rather than a technical\nproblem-solver.  Furthermore, it assigns a practical purpose in social science.\nFollowing a marxist tradition, it requires that theories in social\nscience should not only describe and explain the social world, but also should\nserve a human emancipation agenda in all circumstances of oppression and\ndominance. This is a different approach in [[philosophy of science]] than [[Falsifiability|falsification]], more popular in the natural sciences.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Fall 2016| publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| editors = Edward N.

Excessively harsh and punitive parenting was posited to cause children to feel immense anger towards their parents; yet fear of parental disapproval or punishment caused people to not directly confront their parents, but rather to identify with and idolize authority figures.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}} Moreover, the book suggested that authoritarianism was rooted in suppressed [[homosexuality]], which was redirected into outward hostility towards the father, which was, in turn, suppressed for fear of being infantilized and castrated by the father.<ref>\"The forbidden action which is converted into aggression is generally homosexual in nature. Through fear of castration, obedience to the father is taken to the extreme of an anticipation of castration in conscious emotional approximation to the nature of a small girl, and actual hatred to the father is suppressed\" Adorno, T. W., E. Frenkel-Brunswik, D. J. Levinson, & R. N. Sanford. (1950). The Authoritarian Personality . Publication No. 3 of the American Jewish Committee Social Studies Series. New York: Harper & Brothers., p. 192.</ref>\nThis hypothesis was consistent with prevailing psychological theories of the time, and Frenkel-Brunswik reported some preliminary support, but empirical data have generally not confirmed this prediction.<ref>{{cite book\n | author = Altemeyer, B.\n | year = 1988\n | title = Enemies of freedom: Understanding right-wing authoritarianism\n | publisher =\n | location =\n | id =\n }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}} Authoritarianism was measured by the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]. The \"F\" was short for \"pre-fascist personality.\" Another major hypothesis of the book is that the authoritarian syndrome is predisposed to [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] ideology and therefore receptive to [[fascism|fascist]] governments.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe study employs both quantitative and qualitative components. The first part\nof the research resembles a survey type of research with structured\nquestionnaires. Based on the scores on the questionnaires, a smaller number of\nparticipants was elected for [[clinical interviews]] and administration of the\n[[Thematic Apperception Test]]. Interviews were coded with the techniques of\n[[content analysis]].{{efn|Based on Brown (2004) <ref name=\"brown04\">{{Cite book| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-1-84169-070-4| pages = 45\u201385| editors = John T.

There\nare reasons to believe that there are systematic difference between such a\nsample and the aforementioned population (see section Overall Criticism).\n\n=== Response format ===\n\n[[Likert type items]] ranging from -3 to +3 without a middle point.\n\n=== Psychometric scales ===\n\n* Anti-Semitism Scale\n* Ethnocentrism Scale\n* Political & Economical Conservatism Scale\n\n==== Anti-Semitism scale ====\n\nThis is a listing of the content categories featured in the items. These traits\nare attributed to [[Jewish]] people.<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|48}}\n\n* ''Offensive'' (conceited, sensual, dirty)\n* ''Threatening'' (ruthless, competitive, radical)\n* ''Attitudes'' (discriminative action to be taken)\n* ''Seclusive'' (clannish, keeping apart from gentiles)\n* ''Intrusive'' (desire to intrude where not welcome)\n\nAll items were phrased in affirmation of the Anti-Semitic sentiment. Brown (2004, p.&nbsp;48),\ntogether with many others, criticizes this choice as \"unwise\".<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|48}}\n\nThe items were phrased in a superficially moderate language, which nonetheless\nconveyed the saliency of Jews to the respondent and a negative sentiment towards\nthem <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|49}}\n\n==== Ethnocentrism ====\n\n[[Split-half reliability]] for the scale was .91 (high). The correlation between\n''Ethnocentrism'' and ''Anti-Semitism'' scales was .80 (relatively high). This\nresult is \"evidence that antagonism to the culturally unlike is a generalized\nsentiment\" <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|50}}\n\n==== Political and economical conservatism ====\n\nSplit-half reliability for PEC scale was .73 (moderate). The scale's correlation\nwith A-S and E was not strong, but in none of the groups was it negative. \"[...]\nneither ethnocentrism nor Anti-Semitism ever showed a tendency to go with\nleftist liberal views.\" <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|50}}\n\n==== F Scale ====\n\nThe F scale targets an authoritarian, anti-democratic personality profile that makes a person susceptible to Fascist propaganda. The items were written in accordance to fascist propaganda materials as well as ''priory held'' TAT protocol data and interviews with ethnocentric participants.\n\n* ''Conventionalism'': Adherence to conventional values.\n* ''Authoritarian Submission'': Towards [[ingroup]] authority figures.\n* ''Authoritarian Aggression'': Against people who violate conventional values.\n* ''Anti-Intraception'': Opposition to subjectivity and imagination.\n* ''Superstition and Stereotypy'': Belief in individual fate; thinking in rigid categories.\n* ''Power and Toughness'': Concerned with submission and domination; assertion of strength.\n* ''Destructiveness and Cynicism'': hostility against human nature.\n* ''Projectivity'': Perception of the world as dangerous; tendency to project unconscious impulses.\n* ''Sex'': Overly concerned with modern sexual practices.\n\nAcross various participant groups, the average [[item-total correlation]] was 0.33. Subsequent factor analysis confirmed a one-dimensional structure of these content subsets of items (Eysenck 1954, p 152, ref by Brown, p.&nbsp;53). The first form of the F-Scale correlated 0.53 with A-S, 0.65 to E and 0.54 to PEC. The scale was revised by dropping items with low item-total correlations and/or low predictive value of A-S and E scores. The revised form correlated by 0.75 to a combined A-S/E scale, and 0.57 to PEC. Ethnocentrism, anti-Semitism and potentiality for fascism were inter-related to each other, as well as to conservatism, although not as prominently.\n\n==== Correlations with IQ, SES, and education ====\n\nEthnocentrism is negatively correlated with both IQ and years of education.\nSubsequent analyses by Christie showed that education is the mediating factor in\nthis set of relationships. Intelligence is not as strongly correlated to E ''per\nse'' if years of education are partialed out, the partial correlation being as\nsmall as -.20. Christie also estimated the expected\ncorrelation between \"either IQ and F scores or years of education and F scores\nfor a representative cross-sectional sample, range between -.50 and -.60\".<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|74}}\n\n=== Clinical and projective data ===\n\n==== Interviews ====\n\nThe interviewers were instructed to obtain information of the following areas.\nThere were more specific instructions and points of emphasis within each of\nthese areas.\n\n* Vocation\n* Income\n* Religion\n* Clinical Data\n** Family Background: Sociological Aspects\n** Family Figures: Personal Aspects\n** Childhood\n** Sex\n** Social Relationships\n** School\n* Politics\n* Minorities and Race\n\n[Critique Point] Interviewers (but not coders) were aware of the participants\nresponses and were instructed to study them before interview. This choice was\nalso \"severely criticized\" <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|55}}\n\n\"In considerable degree, [...], the projective data confirm the covariation of\nimplicit antidemocratic trends with prejudice which was demonstrated by the\nquestionnaire data\".\n\n==== Construction of personality ====\n\n* Self Glorification ''vs'' Objective Self Appraisal\n* Conventional Idealization of Parents ''vs'' Objective Appraisal\n* Family status-concerned ''vs'' Family status-relaxed\n\nAdditional: Coping with Ambivalence about Self and Others, Lack of acceptance\nof aggressive feelings towards the parents, Projection of sexual and aggressive\nimpulses to minorities, and its psychological function. \"Repression of impulses\nleads to projection which functions as rationalization for an expression.'\n<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|62}}\n\n[Critique Point]: Coding and Interpretation is informed by psychoanalytic\ntheory.\n\n==== Cognitive style ====\n\n* Rigidity ''vs'' Flexibility\n* Intolerance of Ambiguity 'vs'' Tolerance of Ambiguity\n\n(see [[Jaensch's Typology]])\n\n[Critique Point] Due to the coders having access to the protocols, the\ndependency between prejudice and rigidity may be biased.<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|65}}\n\n=== Overall ahahahah M5 RS6  ===\n\n==== Sampling ====\n\nParticipants were recruited through formal organizations. Christie reports\nthough that people belonging to at least one organization differ significantly\nfrom people that do not belong to organizations at all. Thus the sample taken\nwas not representative of white, non-Jewish, middle-class, Americans. The\ncorrelations between A-S, E and F vary in different samples, subsequent studies\nshowed. However, a negative correlation was never found between those scales.\n\n==== Acquiescence Response Set ====\n\nCouch and Keniston (1960) addressed the problem of the items being all phrased in an affirmative direction towards anti-Semitism.<ref name=\"couch60\">{{Cite journal| issn = 0096-851X| volume = 60| issue = 2| pages = 151\u2013174| last1 = Couch| first1 = A.| last2 = Keniston| first2 = K.| title = Yeasayers and naysayers: agreeing response set as a personality variable| journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology| date = 1960| pmid = 13812335| doi=10.1037/h0040372}}</ref> In a large number of psychometric instruments, they showed that the tendency to respond affirmatively (Yeasayers) or negatively (Naysayers) is a relevant psychological factor despite the content of specific questionnaires.<ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\nIt is now accepted that a greater proportion of variance can be attributed to\nindividual response patterns rather than the targeted Anti-Semitic attitude.\nThis poses a [[Validity (logic)|validity]] problem: The scale may not accurately record the\nvariable it is intended to measure.\n\nBass found a .20 correlation between F-scale and an item-by-item reversed version.\n(expected correlation if the phrasing played no role would be -1.00)\nChristie used more elaborate reversal of items accounting for linguistic and\npsychological subtleties preserving the original rationale of the items\npreparation.<ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|67}} See section on Overall Criticism.\n\n==== Criticisms of content analyses ====\n\n* Interviewer Knowledge of Questionnaire Responses\n* Examination of Data in Advance of Coding\n* Coding Multiple Variables from the Same Content\n* Reporting Inter-rater Reliability for Too General Coding Categories <ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|69\u201372}}\n\n==== Explanation in terms of SES rather than repression ====\n\n\"We can easily imagine plausible reasons for the association of each\nauthoritarian trait with the cluster that includes low IQ, little education, and\nlow SES and so the explanation of covariation among the traits is simply their\nseveral particular ties to the same underlying factors. [...][However][...]\nNorms are not put together at random or incidentally. When they stabilize into a\nparticular combination it must be because that is a combination that works for\nhuman personalities\" (Brown, p.&nbsp;75) <ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|75}}\n\n==== Left wing authoritarianism ====\n\nA number of studies have examined the [[Validity (psychometrics)| external\ncriterion validity]] of F scale, with various demographic and political groups.\nSuch groups included: German cosmetic factory workers (Cohn and Carsch, 1954);\nEnglish fascists and communists, compared to 'politically neutral' soldiers\n(Coulter, 1953). Both studies found high scores (>5) in F-Scale.\n\nHowever, the Coulter study also found the Communists scored higher in F-Scale than\nthe politically neutral group. Eysenck (1954, ref. by Brown, p.&nbsp;80) commented that Coulter's results indicate\nthat the F-Scale actually measures general authoritarianism, rather than\nfascist tendencies in particular. (see [[Left-Wing Authoritarianism]])\n\nChristie (1956) attributed Coulter's findings to sampling fluctuation, pointing\nout the politically neutral group was unusually low in F-Scale, compared to\n50 known group means at the time. Rokeach (1960) obtained F-Scale scores from 13\nCommunist college students in England. Their mean was the lowest of all known\ngroups.\n\nBrown, (2004, p.&nbsp;80) states: \"... the Berkley researchers seem to have been correct in their belief that the\nF-Scale is a measure of fascism.\" <ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\n==Authors and conflicts==\n\nSanford and Levinson were both psychology professors at Berkeley. They did much of the preliminary work on ethnocentrism and statistical measurement. Frenkel-Brunswik examined personality variables and family background with a series of interview studies. Adorno provided a political and sociological perspective to the book. Although Adorno's name heads the alphabetical list of authors, he arrived late to the project and made a relatively small contribution.<ref>Stone, W. F., Lederer, G., and Christie, R. (1993). Introduction: Strength and weakness. In Stone, W. F., Lederer, G., and Christie, R. (Eds.). ''Strength and weakness: The authoritarian personality today''. New York: Springer-Verlag.</ref>{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}} Adorno, in a 1947 letter to Horkheimer, said that his main contribution was the F-scale, which in the end was the \"core of the whole thing.\"<ref name=\"Wiggershaus1995p411\"/> An agreement among the authors held that each one was to sign the individual chapters to which he or she had contributed, and that all four were to sign the chapter on the F-scale;<ref name=\"Wiggershaus1995p411\">Wiggershaus, Rolf (1995) [https://archive.org/details/frankfurtschooli0000wigg/page/411 ''The Frankfurt School: Its History, Theories, and Political Significance''], p.411</ref> Adorno was credited in 5 of the 23 chapters.\n\nThe initially planned title for the book was ''The Fascist Character and the Measurement of Fascist Trends'', but as early as 1947 Adorno feared that the assistants at Berkeley would try to sanitize it to a more innocuous title like ''Character and Prejudice''. The final title was the result of a compromise.<ref name=\"Wiggershaus1995p411\"/>\n\n==Responses==\n''The Authoritarian Personality'' inspired extensive research in [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]] during the 1950s and early 1960s on the relation between personality traits, behavior, and political beliefs. ''The Authoritarian Personality'' has often provoked polarized responses: \u201cThe Berkeley study of authoritarian personality does not leave many people indifferent.\u201d<ref>Brown, R. (1965).

The Journal of Libertarian Studies, Vol. IV, No.  1, Winter 1980, pp. 39-43.</ref> argued that the project of ''The Authoritarian Personality'' was seriously flawed{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}} on several points: for not asking questions regarding [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] politics (which according to Ray are typically more anti-authoritarian than right- or left-wing politics{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}}); for failing to demonstrate that authoritarian/right-wing beliefs are correlated with [[psychopathology]]; and, most importantly, for failing to demonstrate that authoritarian beliefs are associated with authoritarian behavior. In 1993, over a decade later, the latter point was also criticized  by Billings, et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Billings S. W. |author2=Guastello S. J. |author3=Reike M.

Psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]] argued against that conclusion, saying that Fascist Italy was not characterized by antisemitism, and that Jews occupied high positions in Mussolini\u2019s government until pressure from Hitler disenfranchised these Jews.<ref>Altemeyer, B. (1981). ''Right-Wing Authoritarianism''. Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press., p. 28.</ref>\n\nRubenstein\u2019s research in Israel revealed that Orthodox Jews scored higher on right wing politics and authoritarianism as traits than Reform Jews, and that both groups scored higher than Secular Jews. However, it cannot be said that there is no relationship between traits of Right-Wing Authoritarians and antisemitism. In fact, Adorno's nine traits of the \"F scale\" are rather general and have been thought to identify fascist as well as anti-Semitic individual attributes. The fact that Rubenstein himself affirms that \"the results confirm the validity of the RWA\" represents a particularly interesting outcome: Orthodox and Reform Jews in Israel are classified closer to the fascist and anti-Semitic traits, as thought in 1950 by Adorno et al., compared to Secular Jews in Israel.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rubenstein G | year = 1996 | title = Two peoples in one land: A validation study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 216\u2013230 | doi=10.1177/0022022196272005}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have criticized what they saw as a strongly politicized agenda to ''The Authoritarian Personality''. Social critic [[Christopher Lasch]]<ref>Lasch, Christopher (1991). The True and Only Heaven: Progress and Its Critics. New York: W. W. Norton, p. 453.</ref> argued that by equating mental health with left-wing politics and associating right-wing politics with an invented \u201cauthoritarian\u201d pathology, the book's goal was to eliminate antisemitism by \u201csubjecting the American people to what amounted to collective psychotherapy\u2014by treating them as inmates of an insane asylum.\u201d \n''The Authoritarian Personality'' remains widely cited in the social sciences and continues to inspire research interest today.<ref>\"Political conservatism as motivated social cognition\", authors John T.

Adorno had been a member of the \"[[Frankfurt School]]\", a group of philosophers and Marxist theorists who fled Germany when Hitler shut down their [[Institute for Social Research]]. Adorno et al. were thus motivated by a desire{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} to identify and measure factors that were believed to contribute to antisemitic and fascist traits. The book was part of a \"Studies in Prejudice\" series sponsored by the [[American Jewish Committee]]'s Department of Scientific Research.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Horkheimer, Max |author2=Flowerman, Samuel H | year = 1950 | title =  Foreword to Studies in Prejudice in \"The Authoritarian Personality\" | publisher = Norton Library|pages=v\u2013vi}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/5A52.PDF American Jewish Committee ''News''], 15 March 1950.</ref>\n\n==Sources and influences==\n''The Authoritarian Personality'' was based in part on earlier Frankfurt School analyses undertaken in Germany, but with a few key changes. First, their Marxist and radical roots were downplayed.  For example, the earlier \u201cauthoritarian personality/revolutionary personality\u201d axis was changed to an \u201cauthoritarian personality/democratic personality\u201d axis in America.  Thus, values and behaviors earlier associated with revolutionary Marxism were now associated with support for [[democracy]].<ref>Jay, Martin (1973).

Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press., p. 363.</ref> More generally, the Frankfurt School has been critical of [[reductionism]] and the\n[[third-person perspective]] in the social sciences. Instead, it recognizes that\nsocial science research is inevitably value-laden, which calls for a model of\nscientist who is a self-reflective interpreter, rather than a technical\nproblem-solver.  Furthermore, it assigns a practical purpose in social science.\nFollowing a marxist tradition, it requires that theories in social\nscience should not only describe and explain the social world, but also should\nserve a human emancipation agenda in all circumstances of oppression and\ndominance. This is a different approach in [[philosophy of science]] than [[Falsifiability|falsification]], more popular in the natural sciences.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Fall 2016| publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| editors = Edward N.

Excessively harsh and punitive parenting was posited to cause children to feel immense anger towards their parents; yet fear of parental disapproval or punishment caused people to not directly confront their parents, but rather to identify with and idolize authority figures.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}} Moreover, the book suggested that authoritarianism was rooted in suppressed [[homosexuality]], which was redirected into outward hostility towards the father, which was, in turn, suppressed for fear of being infantilized and castrated by the father.<ref>\"The forbidden action which is converted into aggression is generally homosexual in nature. Through fear of castration, obedience to the father is taken to the extreme of an anticipation of castration in conscious emotional approximation to the nature of a small girl, and actual hatred to the father is suppressed\" Adorno, T. W., E. Frenkel-Brunswik, D. J. Levinson, & R. N. Sanford. (1950). The Authoritarian Personality . Publication No. 3 of the American Jewish Committee Social Studies Series. New York: Harper & Brothers., p. 192.</ref>\nThis hypothesis was consistent with prevailing psychological theories of the time, and Frenkel-Brunswik reported some preliminary support, but empirical data have generally not confirmed this prediction.<ref>{{cite book\n | author = Altemeyer, B.\n | year = 1988\n | title = Enemies of freedom: Understanding right-wing authoritarianism\n | publisher =\n | location =\n | id =\n }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}} Authoritarianism was measured by the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]. The \"F\" was short for \"pre-fascist personality.\" Another major hypothesis of the book is that the authoritarian syndrome is predisposed to [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] ideology and therefore receptive to [[fascism|fascist]] governments.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe study employs both quantitative and qualitative components. The first part\nof the research resembles a survey type of research with structured\nquestionnaires. Based on the scores on the questionnaires, a smaller number of\nparticipants was elected for [[clinical interviews]] and administration of the\n[[Thematic Apperception Test]]. Interviews were coded with the techniques of\n[[content analysis]].{{efn|Based on Brown (2004) <ref name=\"brown04\">{{Cite book| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-1-84169-070-4| pages = 45\u201385| editors = John T. Jost, Jim Sidanius (eds.)| last = Brown| first = Roger| title = Political Psychology: Key Readings| chapter = The Authoritarian Personality and the Organization of Attitudes| date = 2004}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Sample ===\n\n\"The majority of the subjects could be characterized as white, non-Jewish,\nnative-born, middle-class Americans and the authors guessed that their findings\nwould hold for this population\" <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|48}}\n\n''[Critique point]'': The individuals were sampled from formal organizations. There\nare reasons to believe that there are systematic difference between such a\nsample and the aforementioned population (see section Overall Criticism).\n\n=== Response format ===\n\n[[Likert type items]] ranging from -3 to +3 without a middle point.\n\n=== Psychometric scales ===\n\n* Anti-Semitism Scale\n* Ethnocentrism Scale\n* Political & Economical Conservatism Scale\n\n==== Anti-Semitism scale ====\n\nThis is a listing of the content categories featured in the items. These traits\nare attributed to [[Jewish]] people.<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|48}}\n\n* ''Offensive'' (conceited, sensual, dirty)\n* ''Threatening'' (ruthless, competitive, radical)\n* ''Attitudes'' (discriminative action to be taken)\n* ''Seclusive'' (clannish, keeping apart from gentiles)\n* ''Intrusive'' (desire to intrude where not welcome)\n\nAll items were phrased in affirmation of the Anti-Semitic sentiment. Brown (2004, p.&nbsp;48),\ntogether with many others, criticizes this choice as \"unwise\".<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|48}}\n\nThe items were phrased in a superficially moderate language, which nonetheless\nconveyed the saliency of Jews to the respondent and a negative sentiment towards\nthem <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|49}}\n\n==== Ethnocentrism ====\n\n[[Split-half reliability]] for the scale was .91 (high). The correlation between\n''Ethnocentrism'' and ''Anti-Semitism'' scales was .80 (relatively high). This\nresult is \"evidence that antagonism to the culturally unlike is a generalized\nsentiment\" <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|50}}\n\n==== Political and economical conservatism ====\n\nSplit-half reliability for PEC scale was .73 (moderate). The scale's correlation\nwith A-S and E was not strong, but in none of the groups was it negative. \"[...]\nneither ethnocentrism nor Anti-Semitism ever showed a tendency to go with\nleftist liberal views.\" <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|50}}\n\n==== F Scale ====\n\nThe F scale targets an authoritarian, anti-democratic personality profile that makes a person susceptible to Fascist propaganda. The items were written in accordance to fascist propaganda materials as well as ''priory held'' TAT protocol data and interviews with ethnocentric participants.\n\n* ''Conventionalism'': Adherence to conventional values.\n* ''Authoritarian Submission'': Towards [[ingroup]] authority figures.\n* ''Authoritarian Aggression'': Against people who violate conventional values.\n* ''Anti-Intraception'': Opposition to subjectivity and imagination.\n* ''Superstition and Stereotypy'': Belief in individual fate; thinking in rigid categories.\n* ''Power and Toughness'': Concerned with submission and domination; assertion of strength.\n* ''Destructiveness and Cynicism'': hostility against human nature.\n* ''Projectivity'': Perception of the world as dangerous; tendency to project unconscious impulses.\n* ''Sex'': Overly concerned with modern sexual practices.\n\nAcross various participant groups, the average [[item-total correlation]] was 0.33. Subsequent factor analysis confirmed a one-dimensional structure of these content subsets of items (Eysenck 1954, p 152, ref by Brown, p.&nbsp;53). The first form of the F-Scale correlated 0.53 with A-S, 0.65 to E and 0.54 to PEC. The scale was revised by dropping items with low item-total correlations and/or low predictive value of A-S and E scores. The revised form correlated by 0.75 to a combined A-S/E scale, and 0.57 to PEC. Ethnocentrism, anti-Semitism and potentiality for fascism were inter-related to each other, as well as to conservatism, although not as prominently.\n\n==== Correlations with IQ, SES, and education ====\n\nEthnocentrism is negatively correlated with both IQ and years of education.\nSubsequent analyses by Christie showed that education is the mediating factor in\nthis set of relationships. Intelligence is not as strongly correlated to E ''per\nse'' if years of education are partialed out, the partial correlation being as\nsmall as -.20. Christie also estimated the expected\ncorrelation between \"either IQ and F scores or years of education and F scores\nfor a representative cross-sectional sample, range between -.50 and -.60\".<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|74}}\n\n=== Clinical and projective data ===\n\n==== Interviews ====\n\nThe interviewers were instructed to obtain information of the following areas.\nThere were more specific instructions and points of emphasis within each of\nthese areas.\n\n* Vocation\n* Income\n* Religion\n* Clinical Data\n** Family Background: Sociological Aspects\n** Family Figures: Personal Aspects\n** Childhood\n** Sex\n** Social Relationships\n** School\n* Politics\n* Minorities and Race\n\n[Critique Point] Interviewers (but not coders) were aware of the participants\nresponses and were instructed to study them before interview. This choice was\nalso \"severely criticized\" <ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|55}}\n\n\"In considerable degree, [...], the projective data confirm the covariation of\nimplicit antidemocratic trends with prejudice which was demonstrated by the\nquestionnaire data\".\n\n==== Construction of personality ====\n\n* Self Glorification ''vs'' Objective Self Appraisal\n* Conventional Idealization of Parents ''vs'' Objective Appraisal\n* Family status-concerned ''vs'' Family status-relaxed\n\nAdditional: Coping with Ambivalence about Self and Others, Lack of acceptance\nof aggressive feelings towards the parents, Projection of sexual and aggressive\nimpulses to minorities, and its psychological function. \"Repression of impulses\nleads to projection which functions as rationalization for an expression.'\n<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|62}}\n\n[Critique Point]: Coding and Interpretation is informed by psychoanalytic\ntheory.\n\n==== Cognitive style ====\n\n* Rigidity ''vs'' Flexibility\n* Intolerance of Ambiguity 'vs'' Tolerance of Ambiguity\n\n(see [[Jaensch's Typology]])\n\n[Critique Point] Due to the coders having access to the protocols, the\ndependency between prejudice and rigidity may be biased.<ref name=\"brown04\" />{{rp|65}}\n\n=== Overall criticism ===\n\n==== Sampling ====\n\nParticipants were recruited through formal organizations. Christie reports\nthough that people belonging to at least one organization differ significantly\nfrom people that do not belong to organizations at all. Thus the sample taken\nwas not representative of white, non-Jewish, middle-class, Americans. The\ncorrelations between A-S, E and F vary in different samples, subsequent studies\nshowed. However, a negative correlation was never found between those scales.\n\n==== Acquiescence Response Set ====\n\nCouch and Keniston (1960) addressed the problem of the items being all phrased in an affirmative direction towards anti-Semitism.<ref name=\"couch60\">{{Cite journal| issn = 0096-851X| volume = 60| issue = 2| pages = 151\u2013174| last1 = Couch| first1 = A.| last2 = Keniston| first2 = K.| title = Yeasayers and naysayers: agreeing response set as a personality variable| journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology| date = 1960| pmid = 13812335| doi=10.1037/h0040372}}</ref> In a large number of psychometric instruments, they showed that the tendency to respond affirmatively (Yeasayers) or negatively (Naysayers) is a relevant psychological factor despite the content of specific questionnaires.<ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\nIt is now accepted that a greater proportion of variance can be attributed to\nindividual response patterns rather than the targeted Anti-Semitic attitude.\nThis poses a [[Validity (logic)|validity]] problem: The scale may not accurately record the\nvariable it is intended to measure.\n\nBass found a .20 correlation between F-scale and an item-by-item reversed version.\n(expected correlation if the phrasing played no role would be -1.00)\nChristie used more elaborate reversal of items accounting for linguistic and\npsychological subtleties preserving the original rationale of the items\npreparation.<ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|67}} See section on Overall Criticism.\n\n==== Criticisms of content analyses ====\n\n* Interviewer Knowledge of Questionnaire Responses\n* Examination of Data in Advance of Coding\n* Coding Multiple Variables from the Same Content\n* Reporting Inter-rater Reliability for Too General Coding Categories <ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|69\u201372}}\n\n==== Explanation in terms of SES rather than repression ====\n\n\"We can easily imagine plausible reasons for the association of each\nauthoritarian trait with the cluster that includes low IQ, little education, and\nlow SES and so the explanation of covariation among the traits is simply their\nseveral particular ties to the same underlying factors. [...][However][...]\nNorms are not put together at random or incidentally. When they stabilize into a\nparticular combination it must be because that is a combination that works for\nhuman personalities\" (Brown, p.&nbsp;75) <ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|75}}\n\n==== Left wing authoritarianism ====\n\nA number of studies have examined the [[Validity (psychometrics)| external\ncriterion validity]] of F scale, with various demographic and political groups.\nSuch groups included: German cosmetic factory workers (Cohn and Carsch, 1954);\nEnglish fascists and communists, compared to 'politically neutral' soldiers\n(Coulter, 1953). Both studies found high scores (>5) in F-Scale.\n\nHowever, the Coulter study also found the Communists scored higher in F-Scale than\nthe politically neutral group. Eysenck (1954, ref. by Brown, p.&nbsp;80) commented that Coulter's results indicate\nthat the F-Scale actually measures general authoritarianism, rather than\nfascist tendencies in particular. (see [[Left-Wing Authoritarianism]])\n\nChristie (1956) attributed Coulter's findings to sampling fluctuation, pointing\nout the politically neutral group was unusually low in F-Scale, compared to\n50 known group means at the time. Rokeach (1960) obtained F-Scale scores from 13\nCommunist college students in England. Their mean was the lowest of all known\ngroups.\n\nBrown, (2004, p.&nbsp;80) states: \"... the Berkley researchers seem to have been correct in their belief that the\nF-Scale is a measure of fascism.\" <ref name=\"brown04\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\n==Authors and conflicts==\n\nSanford and Levinson were both psychology professors at Berkeley. They did much of the preliminary work on ethnocentrism and statistical measurement. Frenkel-Brunswik examined personality variables and family background with a series of interview studies. Adorno provided a political and sociological perspective to the book. Although Adorno's name heads the alphabetical list of authors, he arrived late to the project and made a relatively small contribution.<ref>Stone, W. F., Lederer, G., and Christie, R. (1993).

New York: Springer-Verlag.</ref>{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}} Adorno, in a 1947 letter to Horkheimer, said that his main contribution was the F-scale, which in the end was the \"core of the whole thing.\"<ref name=\"Wiggershaus1995p411\"/> An agreement among the authors held that each one was to sign the individual chapters to which he or she had contributed, and that all four were to sign the chapter on the F-scale;<ref name=\"Wiggershaus1995p411\">Wiggershaus, Rolf (1995) [https://archive.org/details/frankfurtschooli0000wigg/page/411 ''The Frankfurt School: Its History, Theories, and Political Significance''], p.411</ref> Adorno was credited in 5 of the 23 chapters.\n\nThe initially planned title for the book was ''The Fascist Character and the Measurement of Fascist Trends'', but as early as 1947 Adorno feared that the assistants at Berkeley would try to sanitize it to a more innocuous title like ''Character and Prejudice''. The final title was the result of a compromise.<ref name=\"Wiggershaus1995p411\"/>\n\n==Responses==\n''The Authoritarian Personality'' inspired extensive research in [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]] during the 1950s and early 1960s on the relation between personality traits, behavior, and political beliefs.

Psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]] argued against that conclusion, saying that Fascist Italy was not characterized by antisemitism, and that Jews occupied high positions in Mussolini\u2019s government until pressure from Hitler disenfranchised these Jews.<ref>Altemeyer, B.

However, it cannot be said that there is no relationship between traits of Right-Wing Authoritarians and antisemitism. In fact, Adorno's nine traits of the \"F scale\" are rather general and have been thought to identify fascist as well as anti-Semitic individual attributes. The fact that Rubenstein himself affirms that \"the results confirm the validity of the RWA\" represents a particularly interesting outcome: Orthodox and Reform Jews in Israel are classified closer to the fascist and anti-Semitic traits, as thought in 1950 by Adorno et al., compared to Secular Jews in Israel.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rubenstein G | year = 1996 | title = Two peoples in one land: A validation study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 216\u2013230 | doi=10.1177/0022022196272005}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have criticized what they saw as a strongly politicized agenda to ''The Authoritarian Personality''.

And it has 7 Sub-Parishes.\n\n= History =\nHistory states that in 1979 there were 14 Catholic families in [[Pragasapuram]]. Initially Pragasapuram was the Sub-Parish of the Sathankulam Parish. In 15-08-1880, Our Lady of Assumption Chapel was opened by Fr.Denish Kushan. The first Car Procession of Our Lady of Assumption was held on 15-08-1895. At that time there was 3 Chapparam. Devotees carry it on their shoulders. In 1907, [[Arthur Margoschis]] (Father of Nazareth) presented the Holy Cross of Jesus Christ that he kept in his Prayer hall,\u00a0 to the Our Lady of Assumption Church, Pragasapuram. \n\nIn 1909, Pragasapuram became an independent Parish. Sub-Parishes separated from the [[Sathankulam]] and [[Punnaikayal]] Parishes were merged with the Pragasapuram Parish. The foundation stone for New Church was laid in 1913 by Fr.T.Michael. After the completion of the New Church foundation work, the Church building work was stopped. Thus the Holy Mass was conducted in the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. Many years later the New Church was built and the New Church was opened by Bishop.Rev.Fr.Thomas on 21-11-1967.As the days went by, In 1975 during Fr.Cruz Mariyan period, Chapparam was replaced by Chariot. In the feasts that followed, the devotees\u00a0 celebrated the Annual Feast of Our Lady of Assumption by pulling the St.Mary's Chariot.\n\nSt. Mary's Kebi was built on 11-08-1980 at the site of the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel to commemorate the Century year (1880- 1980) of Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. The new Church altar was refurbished and the floors replaced with marbles when Fr.Jackson was a Parish Priest. In the 25th year of the construction of the St.Mary's Century Kebi, it was restored and renovated by Fr.A.S.Raja on 14-08-2007\n\n= Sub Parishes =\n\n1.

And it has 7 Sub-Parishes.\n\n= History =\nHistory states that in 1979 there were 14 Catholic families in [[Pragasapuram]]. Initially Pragasapuram was the Sub-Parish of the Sathankulam Parish. In 15-08-1880, Our Lady of Assumption Chapel was opened by Fr.Denish Kushan. The first Car Procession of Our Lady of Assumption was held on 15-08-1895. At that time there was 3 Chapparam. Devotees carry it on their shoulders. In 1907, [[Arthur Margoschis]] (Father of Nazareth) presented the Holy Cross of Jesus Christ that he kept in his Prayer hall,\u00a0 to the Our Lady of Assumption Church, Pragasapuram. \n\nIn 1909, Pragasapuram became an independent Parish. Sub-Parishes separated from the [[Sathankulam]] and [[Punnaikayal]] Parishes were merged with the Pragasapuram Parish. The foundation stone for New Church was laid in 1913 by Fr.T.Michael. After the completion of the New Church foundation work, the Church building work was stopped. Thus the Holy Mass was conducted in the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. Many years later the New Church was built and the New Church was opened by Bishop.Rev.Fr.Thomas on 21-11-1967.As the days went by, In 1975 during Fr.Cruz Mariyan period, Chapparam was replaced by Chariot. In the feasts that followed, the devotees\u00a0 celebrated the Annual Feast of Our Lady of Assumption by pulling the St.Mary's Chariot.\n\nSt. Mary's Kebi was built on 11-08-1980 at the site of the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel to commemorate the Century year (1880- 1980) of Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. The new Church altar was refurbished and the floors replaced with marbles when Fr.Jackson was a Parish Priest.
