He is voiced by [[Owen Wilson]] in the films, ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'', the [[Cars (video game)|''Cars'' video game]] and the last episode of ''[[Cars Toons|Cars Toons: Tales from Radiator Springs]]'' and by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]] in all other media. McQueen is not modeled directly after a specific make and model, although his design contains some elements inspired by the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|Chevrolet Corvette C6]]. His Corvette lineage is further suggested by the \"retro\" paint scheme he acquires in Radiator Springs, which resembles that of a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Corvette C1]].\n\n====Mack====\n'''Mack''' (voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) is a 1985 [[Mack Super-Liner]] bearing license plate \"RUSTEZ3\". A dedicated member of the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment Team (and now Dinoco Oil), having the role of McQueen's (and now Ramirez's) transport, Mack pulls Lightning McQueen's (and now Ramirez's) trailer to his (and now her) races. Lightning's one loyal teammate after his entire pit crew resigns in protest at the end of the season decider, he inadvertently sets up the predicament suffered by McQueen throughout the movie. The grill on him suggests a nose and his top cover (with the Rusteze logo) suggests a Lumberjack hat.\n\nMcQueen exhorts Mack to drive through the night to his tiebreaker race with [[#Chick Hicks|Chick Hicks]] and [[#Strip \"The King\" Weathers|The King]] in Los Angeles, despite [[hours of service|federal DOT regulations]] which legally grant Mack ten hours daily of much-needed off-duty rest<ref name=\"DOT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/HOS-2005.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907135839/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/hos-2005.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-09-07 |title=Hours-of-Service Regulations - Effective October 1, 2005 |access-date=2012-07-07 |publisher=US DOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration}}</ref> alongside \"all those sleeping trucks\" at the last truck stop on I-40. Lightning hopes to reach the venue first and to hang out with the [[Dinoco]] team. As a result, Mack falls asleep and, distracted by the Delinquent Road Hazards (who attempt to push him off the road to the shoulder), loses Lightning. Mack arrives in Radiator Springs after Doc reveals Lightning's location and is both very relieved (\"Thank the manufacturer, you're alive!\") and apologetic (\"I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you...\"). Lightning, who is glad to see him, forgives him.\n\nMack acts as Lightning's pit crew for the big race (since he has none) and worriedly asks if he's alright when he spins out, just before Doc and the others show up to help. Following the race, he congratulates McQueen on his loss for helping Strip Weathers after he is taken out. During the closing credits, Mack views automotive versions of previous Pixar films (such as ''Toy Car Story'' and ''Monster Trucks, Inc.'') at a restored 1950s [[drive-in theater|drive-in cinema]]. Commenting on other characters played by John Ratzenberger (including Hamm the piggy truck and the Abominable Snowplow), he eagerly applauds each of them until he realizes they're all played by the same actor, then demands to know \"What kind of cut-rate production is this?!\".\n\n{{quote|\"This one is a homage to my father... John Lasseter knew that my father drove a Mack truck and that's why he gave me this character. The truck was one of my first loves because I used to ride around with him in it from time to time.\"|John Ratzenberger<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/entertainment/9340180/detail.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710114354/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/entertainment/9340180/detail.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=Memories Of Dad Drive Ratzenberger's Mack In 'Cars': Actor Voices Seventh Consecutive Pixar Film |author=Tim Lammers |date=June 8, 2006 }}</ref> }}\n\n[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] Mayor Ed Pawlowski proclaimed April 21, 2006, Friday [[Mack Trucks]]-[[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] [[Cars (film)|\"Cars\" Day]]<ref>{{cite news|date=April 22, 2006 |author=Joanna Poncavage |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2006-04-22/news/3673203_1_mack-trucks-world-headquarters-lightning-mcqueen-pixar-cars-day |title=Mack among the stars |publisher=Morning Call |access-date=August 6, 2012}}</ref> in Mack's honor during the 41-city \"CARS Road Trip '06\" promotional tour.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-stars-of-disneypixars-cars-hit-the-road-for-cars-road-trip-06-presented-by-state-farmr-56420187.html \"CARS Road Trip '06\" promotional tour dates] from Disney press release.</ref>\n\nMack is seen in the short ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'' after Lightning established his headquarters on US Route 66. In ''Cars 2'' he appears in a pair of brief cameo appearances at the start and end, where his two lines are \"Oh, his best friend greetings. They get longer every year,\" and \"Oh, those two are perfect for each other.\". He appears in ''Cars 3'' with a much larger role compared to ''Cars 2''. He is still working as McQueen's transport. 4 months after McQueen's accident, he is in Radiator Springs and takes McQueen, Luigi, and Guido to the Rust-eze training center. Later, he takes McQueen, Cruz, Luigi, and Guido to the Thunder Hollow demolition derby circuit and after arriving, he comes up with the idea to disguise McQueen. On their way back, he is forced to pull over when Cruz opens his hauler and decides to part ways. He accompanies McQueen to pick Cruz up again and they head to Thomasville, and then to the Florida 500.\n\nIn a deleted scene, before McQueen heads to the tiebreaker race in California, Mack heads to a truck stop, after his grill is covered by a moth blizzard, to be washed. A still impatient McQueen comes outside the trailer to chase after Mack, and that is how he was lost. In another deleted scene, albeit a dream sequence where McQueen is in radiator springs, his V8 Alcohol motor is inside a steamroller, and Mater borrows his body; Mack makes a mistake, thinking Mater is McQueen, and takes him to the race.\n\n====Chuck and Lightning McQueen\u2019s pit crew====\n'''Lightning McQueen's pit crew''' are generic [[forklift]]s who only appear at the start of the film, never to be acknowledged again. They quit after McQueen said that he is a one-man show. One of them, presumably the acting [[pit stop|crew chief]] is voiced by Mike Nelson. After the official crew chief had decided to quit, he is referred to by McQueen as \"Chuck\", and retorts angrily afterwards, \"And my name is not Chuck!\". In the credits, he is referred to as \"Not Chuck\". They appear in the film (only to leave almost immediately) to show McQueen's selfishness and inability to work with others. McQueen had a crew chief before the film, but was not seen in the film, because McQueen fired him (believing he was a one-man show, which later came back to haunt him for his return). The chief was mentioned several times at the Dinoco 400 race. The crew is later replaced by McQueen's friends from Radiator Springs and Mack for the big race. In ''[[Cars 2]]'', McQueen has apparently hired a new pit crew as he mentions having given them all a vacation when asked to attend the World Grand Prix, but his friends from Radiator Springs again offer to become his crew for a race and he accepts.\n\n====Harv====\n'''Harv''' is [[Lightning McQueen]]'s agent. Never seen on-screen, McQueen speaks to Harv via his speaker phone when McQueen and Mack are en route to the tiebreaker race and again when Mack is in Radiator Springs to pick up McQueen. Consequently, very little is known of Harv's character except that he threatened to fire Mack if he doesn't get McQueen into his trailer.\n\nHarv is voiced by [[Jeremy Piven]] in the U.S. version and ''[[The Grand Tour]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] in the UK version. He is also based on the character [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]] from the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''. Although he is not seen in the actual film, Jeremy Clarkson believes that he is a 1979 [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada Ghia]], while in the American version, he is thought to be a 1996 [[Oldsmobile]].\n\n===Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze===\nThe '''Rust-eze Brothers''', '''Rusty''' and '''Dusty''', are the spokescars and owners of Rust-eze, the team that sponsors Lightning and that gave him his \"big break\", but they are somewhat awkward. Rusty is a 1963 [[Dodge Dart]] and Dusty, a 1967 [[Dodge A100]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=8}}</ref> Rusty and Dusty are voiced by real-life brothers [[Tom and Ray Magliozzi]] (respectively) of [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Car Talk]]'', using that program's [[Car Talk#Humor|closing line]] \"...and don't drive like my brother!\". Rusty bears an intentional resemblance to Tom Magliozzi's infamous green 1963 Dart, named \"The Dartre\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Dodge Dart owners still love the oldies|author=Sam Whiting|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=June 29, 2012|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dodge-Dart-owners-still-love-the-oldies-3673737.php }}</ref>\n\nThey appear three times in the first  film, at the beginning with McQueen looking forward to leaving them, in the middle very briefly being interviewed and at the end after the tiebreaker race when McQueen realises he is happy with them. In a deleted scene on the DVD, much of their dialogue (heard at the sponsors' tent in the final script) was originally part of a brief stop at the Top Down Truck Stop. On the die-cast cars, Rusty's license plate states \"Rust\" and Dusty's sports \"Eze\". Their license plates are from \"R Fair City\", a term the ''Car Talk'' brothers use to describe their home town of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. They appear four times in the third film, when they talked with McQueen about his winnings, McQueen was going to see Cal Weathers, when the Radiator Springs gang members and McQueen were talking on the phone and at the Rust-eze racing center to hand the sponsor over to Sterling.\n\nFollowing Tom's death in 2014, unused archive recordings from the first film were used to provide Rusty's speaking parts in ''Cars 3''.\n\n===Sterling===\nSterling is a billionaire and the new owner of the Rust-eze Racing Center. He reveals himself to be a fan of Lightning McQueen. He assigns Cruz Ramirez to train McQueen and prepare him for the Florida 500. After watching McQueen's poor performance on the simulator, Sterling attempted to convince McQueen to retire and become a racing brand. McQueen convinces him to give him a chance at winning the Florida 500, then McQueen could decide when to stop racing. Sterling reluctantly agrees.\n\nAt the Florida 500, Sterling reveals himself as greedy and self-centered when he cruelly ordered Cruz to leave and resume her job as a trainer. Against Sterling's will, McQueen puts Cruz in the race. After Cruz wins, Sterling asks her to race for him, but she refuses and quits. Tex Dinoco, owner of Dinoco, purchases Rust-eze from him, allowing Cruz to race and McQueen to train her.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Nathan Fillion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/cars-3-cast/|title=Cars 3 Cast: Meet New Characters Voiced by Nathan Fillion, Kerry Washington & Lea DeLaria|date=9 March 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Hamilton===\nA personal voice command assistant to Cruz Ramirez that's able to track McQueen's speed through his electronic suit.\nPlayed by British Formula One driver [[Lewis Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2017/05/25/hamilton-vettel-return-to-lend-their-voices-to-cars-3-video/|title=Hamilton, Vettel return to lend their voices to \u2018Cars 3\u2019 (VIDEO)|date=25 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Cruz Ramirez===\nCruz Ramirez, a Hispanic female, is Lightning McQueen's trainer and technician at the Rust-eze Racing Center.  Inspired by the [[Nissan 370z]] and the 2012 [[Ferrari F12 Berlinetta]]. She is known for training some of the best newer elite rookies through her unconventional training methods. She is assigned to train McQueen for the Florida 500. She attempts to train McQueen at Fireball Beach, but McQueen ends up teaching her how to race on sand. After surviving a Demolition Derby, which Cruz wins, McQueen lashes out on her for wasting his time and humiliating him on TV. Then, Cruz reveals that she always wanted to be a racer, but never found the confidence to do so.\n\nCruz and McQueen reconcile and head to Thomasville where they meet the former crew chief of Doc Hudson, Smokey. Smokey trains McQueen and inspires Cruz as well. At the Florida 500, Cruz is sent back to the Racing Center. McQueen exits the race to allow Cruz to race. Using what she's learned on the road, Cruz catches up to Jackson Storm, who tries to overtake her. However, Cruz flips over him and lands in first place. She begins to race for the Dinoco team, sporting Doc's former #51, with McQueen as her mentor. In the post-credits, Cruz has won the Piston Cup with Lightning by her side.\n\nCruz is voiced by [[Cristela Alonzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/who-is-cruz-ramirez-in-cars-3-cristela-alonzo-is-a-lot-like-her-trailblazing-character-64565|title=Who Is Cruz Ramirez In 'Cars 3'?

Weathers is an anthropomorphic version of Petty's [[Aero Warriors|aerodynamic]] 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]], sporting same shade of blue and Petty's racecar number, 43.<ref>{{cite news |title=Now 75, Richard Petty remains \u2018The King\u2019 20 years after his last victory |date=July 4, 2012 |publisher=Palm Beach Post |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/sports/motor-sports/now-75-richard-petty-remains-the-king-20-years-aft/nPmdw/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119033605/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/sports/motor-sports/now-75-richard-petty-remains-the-king-20-years-aft/nPmdw/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 19, 2012 }}</ref> He is one of the racecars in the 2006 Piston Cup three-way tie, along with [[Chick Hicks]] and [[Lightning McQueen]]. His sponsor ([[Dinoco]]), like Petty's ([[STP (motor oil company)|STP]]), is a well-known oil company.\n\n[[File:RichardPettyRoadrunner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Petty]]'s #43 [[Plymouth Superbird]]]]\nHe is Dinoco's \"Golden Boy\", having won seven Piston Cups<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=24|quote=This seven-time Piston Cup Champion...}}</ref> (the same number of NASCAR Cup Series championships Petty himself won in his career) and is hoping for his eighth in the tiebreaker race before entering retirement. He tells McQueen to remember the importance of his team, but the rookie does not pay any attention, being more preoccupied with the thought of taking over the Dinoco sponsorship after Weathers' retirement.\n\nOn the final lap of the tie-breaker race, Hicks rams into Weathers, sending him into a dangerous rollover. When McQueen sees this, he realizes that Weathers' career might end the way [[Doc Hudson]]'s did. After stopping short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, McQueen pushes Weathers across the finish line to let him finish his last race before his retirement, much to the audience's delight. Weathers is last seen visiting the racing museum in Radiator Springs with his wife and another Piston Cup racer, [[#\"Junior\"|\"Junior\"]], stating that Hudson was his inspiration (In NASCAR, \"The King\" #43 is the second of four generations of racers; his father [[Lee Petty]] won [[List of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champions|his first Cup]] in 1954, one year after the multiple [[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]] victories).\n\nHe returns in ''Cars 3'' as the crew chief of his nephew and new Dinoco racer Cal Weathers with Richard Petty reprising his role as the voice of The King. He is only shown in the first race of the film, where he tells Cal nice comeback after he gets his tires for a pit stop, and when he and his nephew pass the sponsorship to Cruz Ramirez after she wins the Florida 500. His only line in the film is \"Nice comeback, Cal\". (In real-life, Petty's nephew [[Trent Owens]], son of his wife Lynda's brother Randy, is a [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] crew chief.)\n\nIn the Danish edition of the movie, the King is voiced by nine-time [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]]. In the Finnish edition of the movie, The King is voiced by Finnish two-time Formula One World Champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]]. In the German edition, he is voiced by Austrian three-time Formula One World Champion [[Niki Lauda]].\n\nStrip Weathers also appears in the film's [[Cars (video game)|video game]] as an unlockable character in the Arcade. He is mentioned by Darrell Cartrip in the game's Story Mode.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]''.\n\n====Lynda Weathers====\n'''Lynda Weathers''', also known as '''\"Mrs. The King\"''', (voiced by Richard Petty's wife Lynda Petty) is similar in design to a [[station wagon]] that brought the Petty family to \"The King\"'s races during the 1970s. Like Tex, Lynda follows each race from a Dinoco VIP booth, rooting for the #43 car. Throughout the film, she is constantly shown supporting her husband and she worries deeply when he is flipped by Chick Hicks. After the race, while Chick Hicks is booed for wrecking her husband and winning the Piston Cup, she kisses Lightning on the cheek to thank him for helping her husband finish his final race.\n\nDuring the ending credits of ''Cars'', Mrs. The King can be seen at the Doc Hudson Museum with her husband and Mater as a tour guide throughout the museum. She asks to see and meet Doc Hudson, but Mater is unsure of his whereabouts at the present time \u2013 but assumes he is out racing, most likely with McQueen (which turns out to be true).\n\n====Cal Weathers====\nNew Dinoco racer. Took over as Dinoco racer after his uncle Strip Weathers retired and became his crew chief. Cal Weathers is numbered 42, and is a Piston Cup Stock Car with blue rims. He often races with Lightning McQueen and Bobby Swift and constantly pull pranks with each other after a race. Unlike his uncle, he seemed to be one of the weak Dinoco racers and never won any Piston Cups (according to Tex as a joke when he talks to Cruz Ramirez on joining Dinoco), though he does win some races as shown when he beats McQueen in a close finish at Rocker Arms Speedway. He later retires when new next gen racers including Jackson Storm take over the sport. He is voiced by real-life driver [[Kyle Petty]] who is Richard Petty's son.\n\n====Tex Dinoco====\n'''Tex Dinoco''', voiced by [[Humpy Wheeler]] of [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], is a billionaire and the owner of [[Dinoco]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=37|quote=Tex has been Dinoco's team owner...}}</ref> Packaged as \"Tex Dinoco with bullhorns\" as a diecast car, he is simply called \"Tex\" in the film's credits. He speaks with a Carolina accent and resembles a 1975 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]] <ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=37}}</ref> at [[The Big Texan Steak Ranch]] in [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]. He is the King's manager and sponsor. Unlike Lightning's agent (Harv, who doesn't watch the race), Tex is an avid race fan who would never miss a race. As a supportive and long-time friend of both Lynda and \"The King\", he has been a loyal fan of the #43 car for many years and boasts that The King \"has made Dinoco proud\".\n\nAfter [[#Chick Hicks|Chick Hicks]] wins by employing a [[PIT maneuver]] to sabotage The King in the final lap of the tiebreaker, sending the Dinoco blue #43 car into a dangerous rollover crash, Tex (angered by Hicks' unsportsmanlike driving) offers the lucrative sponsorship to Lightning with the explanation that \"there's a whole lot more to racing than just winning\" this is an echo of a line that McQueen used at the end of the race shown at the start of the film but with an entirely different meaning. However, McQueen turns down the offer, opting to stay with Rust-Eze.\n\nHe returns for ''Cars 3'' as the sponsor for Cal Weathers. After Cal retired, Tex sought to have newcomer Cruz Ramirez to race for him after watching her performance in the Florida 500. He also purchases Rust-eze from Sterling and allows Lightning McQueen to continue racing.\n\n====Dinoco Transport Helicopter====\nThe '''Dinoco Transport Helicopter''' is based on a [[Bell 430]]. Without a speaking part, he has no voice actor and is not named in the closing credits. His name is '''Rotor Turbosky''' (in apparent reference to helicopter maker [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation|Sikorsky]]) in the die-cast ''Cars'' toy collection. He is seen on top of the Dinoco tent during the races. Mater gets a ride over Radiator Springs at the end of the film, a favor which Lightning had promised Mater earlier when dreaming of the big trophy and the big sponsor (Dinoco) with the fancy helicopter.\n\n===HTB team===\n====Chick Hicks====\n[[File:pit maneuver.svg|thumb|120px|right|The [[PIT maneuver]], long banned in racing, shown in use to end a police chase]]\n'''Chick Hicks''' (voiced by [[Michael Keaton]] in [[Cars (film)|Cars]], [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] in [[Cars 3]]) serves as Lightning McQueen's primary rival in the first film. He is \"a generic Pixar design, 'a stock 1980s American car'\" according to Pixar publicity coordinator Amanda Sorena,<ref name=\"MSNinsidescoop\">{{cite web|title=New movie rekindles love affair with cars |author=Ann Job |publisher=The Star-Ledger |date=May 7, 2006 |url=http://autos.ca.msn.com/editors-picks/article.aspx?cp-documentid=18737087 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615114304/http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4024001 |archivedate = June 15, 2006}}</ref> and strongly resembles a [[GM G platform (1969)|GM G-body]] with features from both the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Fourth Generation|Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] and the [[Buick Grand National]]. As the real-life [[General Motors]] wanted nothing to do with the character by rejecting an initial Pixar proposal to cast a [[Chevrolet]] stock car as the movie's villain, Chick is effectively an orphan.<ref name=\"MSNinsidescoop\"/> He has spent his entire career trailing Strip \"The King\" Weathers, and is bitter about this fact. One of his most notable quotes in the movie is \u201cKachigga\u201d which he uses as his version of Lightning McQueen's quote \u201cKachow\u201d. His racing sponsor is Hostile Takeover Bank ('''HTB''' for short).\n\nHis pit crew generally mock Guido as compared to them he is very small, however they are surprised when Guido shows off his extremely quick tyre changing capabilities. Hicks' racing number is 86, a reference to 1986, the year Pixar Animation Studios was founded; [[86 (term)|86 itself]] is also a [[slang]] term for destroying or getting rid of something. Since 86 is twice the number 43 (King's number), it could also be an allusion to his entire career in relation to King.\n\nHicks is extremely determined to win to the point that often he turns to [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] to do so. Hicks cheats his way through all of his races by [[Bump and run (auto racing)|ramming other cars]] or sideswiping them via the [[PIT maneuver]] in an attempt to cause [[The Big One (NASCAR)|racing incidents]] for his own benefit. He despises and mocks McQueen, adopting the nickname '''Thunder''' which McQueen previously used as a put-down (McQueen: \"Because thunder always comes after 'lightning'\"). Hicks is also equally antagonistic towards The King, having come 2nd or 3rd place to The King his entire career. While McQueen is presumed missing, Hicks tries to take away McQueen's fans and increase his fame.\n\nDuring the final lap of the tiebreaker race, Hicks (refusing to come in behind Strip Weathers again) PITs The King, sending him flying off the race track and into a rollover wreck on the in-field. He expects a huge ovation after McQueen deliberately gives up the Piston Cup in order to help Weathers, but nobody cheers Hicks on once he wins because they're fed up with his dirty tricks. Shortly afterwards, as Hicks gets on stage to claim his trophy and celebrate his victory, an angered crowd and media snub Hicks' victory by branding him a cheater. He is then pelted with discarded tires and booed off the stage with his trophy in humiliation. The immediate backlash is similar to backlash against [[Rusty Wallace]] after he spun out [[Darrell Waltrip]] in Turn 4 during Segment 3, Lap 9 of the [[NASCAR lore#Controversial races|Sprint All-Star Race V]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], sending Waltrip spinning into the grass. In the film, a lucrative corporate sponsorship is at stake. Hicks and McQueen both share the dream of being the new face of Dinoco Oil, a firm long represented by retiring champion #43 \"The King\". They race on the assumption that winning the championship cup will land them the big sponsor, however, Dinoco owner Tex offers the sponsorship to McQueen, stating that there's more to racing than winning.\n\nHe returns in ''[[Cars 3]]'', where he now hosts his own talk show, ''Chick's Picks''. He constantly boasts about his previous Piston Cup championship and cracks jokes at McQueen's expense as Jackson Storm takes over the sport. He also interviews him after he wins one of the races.\nThe film's co-writer [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] voices Chick in this film as Keaton was filming ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''. Due to his voice actor change, his voice seems to be identical to other characters Bob Peterson voiced such as Mr. Ray from ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and its [[Finding Dory|sequel]].\n\nChick returns in the ''[[Cars (video game)|Cars]]'' video game, which is written by Pixar and considered a continuation to the story started in the movie, once again as McQueen's rival and the main antagonist. In the game, he is less rude than he was in the movie. He is first seen spying on Lightning's practice sessions with Doc Hudson. In Palm Mile Speedway, he ineffectively taunts Lightning before the first race of the season until Doc warns him off, then falls in with a gang of New York-based greaser cars in Carburetor County to challenge McQueen. The DRH gang jumps Mack on the interstate to steal McQueen's racing gear, but finger Chick as the one who hired them when caught by the Sheriff. In the ''[[Cars Race-O-Rama]]'' video game, he seeks revenge by attempting to close down McQueen's racing academy to start his own in Radiator Springs, although he gets defeated at the end. His catchphrase is \"Ka-Chick-Ah!\", a blatant rip-off of McQueen's catchphrase \"KA-CHOW!\". {{Clarify|date=October 2019}}\n\nDespite the fact he did not appear in ''[[Cars 2]]'', he does show up in the film's [[Cars 2 (video game)|video game]] as a downloadable character for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] editions. He also appears in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]''.\n\nIn the [[Rioplatense Spanish]] version of ''Cars'', Hicks is voiced by Marcos di Palma, a racecar driver also known for his brash attitude.\n\nIn the Ukrainian dub of ''Cars'', Hicks is voiced by [[Komu Vnyz]] frontman Andrei Sereda.\n\nBesides him, there is a similar character named Ripslinger in the 2013 ''Cars'' spin-off movie ''[[Planes (film)|Planes]]'' and its 2014 sequel, produced by DisneyToon Studios.\n\n===IGNTR team===\n====Jackson Storm====\nJackson Storm, an arrogant blue-and-black 2017 custom built \"next generation\" Piston Cup racer, is one of the newer rookies that comes into the racing sport, and the main racing rival of Lightning McQueen in the third installment in the franchise. He set records and won many races, including the final race in Los Angeles and presumably achieved the goal of winning the Piston Cup in his rookie year, which McQueen almost did in the first film. Whenever someone intimidates him, he goes back to insult them and make them lose their focus so he can take back the lead.\n\nAt the Florida 500, he is overtaken by McQueen's former trainer Cruz Ramirez. He attempts to make her lose focus by telling her that she doesn't belong on a track. Cruz, however, regains her confidence and drives up next to  Storm, who rammed her into a wall but Cruz flips over him and lands, in exactly the same fashion as Doc Hudson was shown to do in an earlier scene.\n\nHe returns in ''Cars 3: Driven to Win'', as both the main antagonist and a playable character.\n\nJackson Storm is voiced by [[Armie Hammer]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|title=Sneak peek: 'Cars 3' zooms ahead with new character Cruz Ramirez|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/05/30/sneak-peek-exclusive-cars-3-new-character-cruz-ramirez/84981778/|accessdate=July 23, 2016|work=USA Today|date=May 30, 2016}}</ref> In the game, he is voiced by AJ Hamilton. He is based on the Peugeot Onyx Concept.\n\n====Ray Reverham====\nRay Reverham is Jackson Storm's crew chief. He is always supportive of Storm's performance, and when Cruz attempts to win, he reminds Jackson at any opportunity he can.  He is voiced by the real-life [[Ray Evernham]].\n\n==Radiator Springs==\nThese characters live in Radiator Springs with Lightning McQueen, his trainer Cruz Ramirez and their hauler, Mack.\n\n===Tow Mater===\n{{Main|Mater (Cars)}}\n[[File:G-Mater2.jpg|thumb|right]]\n'''Mater''' is a rusty but extremely smart [[tow truck]] and McQueen's best friend, and Holley Shiftwell's boyfriend. He is voiced by [[Larry the Cable Guy]]. He's the main character in ''Cars 2'' and a major character in the other films.\n\n===Sally Carrera===\n{{main|Sally Carrera}}\n'''Sally Carrera''' is the town's attorney and McQueen's girlfriend. She is voiced by [[Bonnie Hunt]], and she is a [[Porsche 996|Porsche 911]]. [[Image:Cars movie's car.jpg|thumb|[[Sally Carrera|Sally]] as Eddie Paul custom vehicle for [[Cars (film)|Cars]] promotional tour]]\n\n===Doc Hudson===\n{{main|Doc Hudson}}\n[[File:Hudson Hornet, 1951 - Flickr - granada turnier.jpg|thumb|right|1951 Hudson Hornet similar to Doc Hudson]]\n'''Doc Hudson''' is the town's medical doctor, a local judge, and Lightning McQueen's mentor, voiced by actor [[Paul Newman]] in the first film and its [[Cars (video game)|video game]] and [[Corey Burton]] in all other related media. He is based on the Hudson Hornet. He did not appear in [[Cars 2|the second film]], as it is implied that Doc died, and Newman died in September 2008 from lung cancer.\n\nHe won three consecutive Piston Cups in 1951, 1952, and 1953, with Smokey as his crew chief, corresponding to the first three of the real-life Hornet's production years.\n\n===Sheriff===\nThe '''Sheriff''' (voiced by Route 66 historian and author [[Michael Wallis]]) is a 1949 [[Mercury Eight]] Police Cruiser [[police car]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=13}}</ref> bearing Carburetor County license plate '''001'''. Sheriff is painted in the classic law enforcement black and white with a single red light dome, two [[siren (noisemaker)|sirens]], and [[curb feeler]]s. Sheriff was the first resident of Radiator Springs to appear in the original film and the first to meet [[Lightning McQueen]] during a police chase when McQueen was speeding through the town, attempting to locate [[#Mack|Mack]]. Upon catching McQueen, who had become ensnared in wires and fencing, Sheriff paraphrases a line used by actor Joe Higgins, who played a sheriff in early 1970s [[Dodge]] commercials, as \"Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.\".<ref>Joe Higgins (as a sheriff), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2UvBjNh58 1970 Dodge Challenger advertisement], uses the line \"you're in a lot of trouble, boy\".</ref>\n\nSheriff was known to distrust McQueen; at one point when Sally gives McQueen some gasoline, Sheriff notices McQueen smiling at the road as if he is planning to escape. In reply Sheriff with a glare turns on his [[Teardrop light|gumball]] in case. Lightning chooses to accompany Sally, rather than making an escape attempt, resulting in Sheriff switching off his emergency lighting. This marks the beginning of trust in Lightning by Sheriff. He later befriends Lightning McQueen, offering him a police escort to California and even giving a few sniffles when he thought Lightning had left after finishing fixing the road (though he denied it, claiming he was glad Lightning was gone), and joins his [[pit crew]] for the championship race. In the end credits, Sheriff arrests the Road Hazards (the same ones who separated McQueen from Mack) caught racing illegally (via speeding) to Radiator Springs and have them impounded. As punishment for their crimes, he forces them to repave the roads with Bessie.\n\nSheriff reappears in ''Cars 2'', seeing Lightning and his race crew off to the World Grand Prix. When Mater goes missing, Ramone mentions that Sheriff has [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] scouring London for Mater. During the climax of the film, Sheriff arrives with the other Radiator Springs residents as new members of McQueen's pit crew in England, and is informed by Mater of the Lemons cars' plot to kill McQueen in order to turn all vehicles in the world against [[alternate energy]] and rely on gasoline for profit. Sheriff then has Red the Firetruck squirt water on the Lemon cars during the final battle, and arrests most of the defeated ones with help from Sarge. Then the next day Sheriff cheers Mater on when he is knighted for foiling the evil plot led by surprisingly, the race and Allinol inventor Sir Miles Axlerod.\n\n===Luigi===\n[[File:1970 Fiat 500 L -- 2011 DC 1.jpg|thumb|[[Fiat 500]]]]\n'''Luigi''' (voiced by [[Tony Shalhoub]], Michael Shalhoub in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'') is a 1959 [[Fiat 500]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=12}}</ref> He is a [[Scuderia Ferrari]] fan, and has followed racing his entire life.

His assistant is an Italian [[forklift truck]] named [[#Guido|Guido]].\n\nInside his shop are many framed pictures of [[World Sportscar Championship]] [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] Ferraris from various points in history. At first, Luigi and Guido do not respect [[Lightning McQueen]] when he comes to [[Radiator Springs]] (owing to the substantial havoc that he inflicted upon the town when he first arrived), because he is not a Ferrari (\"Luigi follow only the Ferraris\"), but later on they learn to show courtesy to McQueen, fitting him with [[whitewall tires]], since Luigi is a fan of white tires (having a pair himself). During the final race, Luigi and Guido work as part of Lightning's pit crew, and Guido sets the Piston Cup record in changing tires, taking only 4 seconds to change all the tires, sending the other pit crew into shock. He later congratulates McQueen when he helps The King finish his last race. <span id=\"Maseratis\">After the race, a group of Italian sports cars \u2013 a Ferrari F430 (voiced by [[Michael Schumacher]]) and two [[Maserati Quattroporte]]s \u2013 arrive at his shop, explaining that \"Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires\" and requesting \"three or four sets each\".</span> The presence of a celebrity Ferrari in their store causes both Luigi and Guido to faint from shock and happiness.\n\nFor the Italian version of the film, Luigi was voiced by comedian Marco Della Noce; one of Della Noce's most popular characters was \"Oriano Ferrari\", a parody character meant to represent the leader of Ferrari's pit stop crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntmanagement.it/marco_della_noce.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216082952/http://www.ntmanagement.it/marco_della_noce.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 December 2004|title=Marco Della Noce|date=16 December 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Cars 2'', Luigi is a part of Lightning's pit crew, in charge of the racer's tires. In Japan, he is naturally overjoyed to see so many Ferraris at a party prior to the first race of the World Grand Prix. He also hesitantly begins to explain to Mater what a rendezvous is, but he and Guido do not believe Mater when he believes he has a date (\"Guido don't believe you!\" \"Guido still don't believe you!\") Luigi and Guido are overjoyed to be back in their home of Italy, and rejoin their large group of family and friends. A little more is discussed of Luigi's past with Guido: Luigi's Uncle Topolino mentions that Luigi and Guido often fought when they worked for him (over things like which Ferrari was the best, and which one of them looked more like a Ferrari, etc.) but they always made up after their fights. Luigi joins his friends in a m\u00eal\u00e9e against Professor Z\u00fcndapp's Lemons at the film's climax, and finally believes Mater's claims of a girlfriend when Holley Shiftwell confirms the fact in person at Radiator Springs.\n\n===Guido===\n'''Guido''' (voiced by [[Guido Quaroni]]) is a [[forklift truck]], who works at Luigi's Casa Della Tires, and is Luigi's best friend. The only language Guido can speak and understand fluently is Italian, though he appears to understand English, and even speaks a few phrases, including \"Pit stop\" but pronounced \"Peet stop!\". His dream is to perform a [[pit stop]] for a real racecar. Near the end of the movie, as a member of Lightning's new pit crew, he performs the fastest pit stop in Piston Cup history, speed-changing all four tires in only 4 seconds, shocking Chick Hicks' pit crew who had earlier made fun of him, and causing their moustaches/grills to fall off in the process.\n\nIn order to preserve the \"language barrier\" gags between Guido and the other characters in the Italian dub, his lines (and the other cars' lines in Italian) have been rendered with the [[Emiliano-Romagnolo]] accent spoken in the town of [[Modena]], Italy, home of the [[Ferrari]] car manufacturer and racing team. [[Alex Zanardi]], an Italian race driver who is a native of Bologna, the largest city in the Emilia-Romagna region (and thus presumably familiar with that dialect), voiced Guido for the Italian version. Coincidentally, or as a pun by the authors, the name \"Guido\" is a perfect [[homonym]] for the Italian inflected verb meaning \"I drive\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn ''Cars 2'', Guido serves the same purpose he served in the first film's climax in Lightning's pit crew throughout the film. He also removed all tires from some of the Lemons when the malicious cars surrounded Lightning and Mater, but is unable to remove the bomb from Mater's nose (engine). Guido does not believe Mater when he says he has a date (\"Non ci credo\"), but has a jaw-dropping moment when he sees that Mater was telling the truth about his new girlfriend Holley Shiftwell (Guido believe you now! - Luigi).\n\n===Ramone===\n\n'''Ramone''' (voiced by [[Cheech Marin]]) is a [[Chevrolet Impala]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=11}}</ref> [[Lowrider]] that owns the Ramone's House of Body Art store, where he paints himself and other cars, including [[Lightning McQueen]] later in the film. His garage employs the distinctive architecture of the Tower Station ([[U-Drop Inn]]) in [[Shamrock, Texas]]. His license plate reads \"L0WNSL0\", which is a reference to his catchphrase, \"Low and slow\". He is married to [[Flo (Cars)#Flo|Flo]], whose restaurant is next door to his store. Ramone is usually depicted as purple with a yellow and orange flame job, but throughout the film, he changes his paint job every morning (green, yellow, red in the first film, blue in ''Mater and the Ghostlight'') to keep his skills sharp, owing to a lack of customers. This situation changes after Radiator Springs becomes vibrant again. He also likes to drive slow and very low on the road, and is overjoyed when the road is asphalted, enjoying the smoothness of the road. However, he does seem to have a childish side in his personality, as in a scene after Lightning McQueen has destroyed the town's main road, Sally asked Flo what she had in her store, the latter responding \"I have gas, lots of gas!\", and Ramone and Mater burst out laughing.\n\nIn a deleted scene that told the story of how Ramone and Flo fell in love, the only customer Ramone has refused to paint was his future wife Flo. When she asked him, \"Whassamatta, you too good to paint me?\", he promptly and smoothly replies, \"No baby, you too good for me to paint,\" and saying that he could not touch a classic like Flo, which made her heart melt. The story took place in Radiator Springs in 1974. This part was shown in the info on Ramone in Cars Mater-National Championship.\n\nRamone reappears in ''Cars 2'', making a few appearances in the Radiator Springs scenes, though he joins everyone else to help McQueen in England. In the melee scene, Ramone disables one of the lemon cars by spray painting into the car's eyes, blinding him.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Planes (film)|Planes]]'', when Dusty cuts off the radios power when El Chupacabra was singing the song \"Love Machine\", he says Ramone's catchphrase \"Low and slow\" which causes Chupacabra to sing a romance version of the song.\n\n===Flo===\n'''Flo''' (based on Fran Hauser of Adrian's [[Midpoint Caf\u00e9]] and voiced by [[Jenifer Lewis]]) is the owner of Radiator Springs only gas diner, \"Flo's V-8 Caf\u00e9\", and is married to [[Ramone (Cars)|Ramone]], the town's body artist. Her license plate reads \"SHOGRL\", the same as the license plates applied to many [[Motorama]] show cars and an abbreviation of the term \"[[showgirl]]\". During the cruising scene, \"Motorama 1957\" appears above her license plate. According to a deleted scene, she is a Motorama showcar who came to Radiator Springs during a national tour (although there wasn't a Motorama show held in 1957). Ramone custom painted her crew all except her. She asks \"What's the matter, you too good to paint me?\", and Ramone said \"No baby, you're too good for me to paint.\". They immediately fell in love. She appears to be inspired by two early- to mid-1950s show cars: the 1951 [[Buick XP-300]] (side trim), and the 1956/57 Chrysler Dart (cockpit, deck lid, and tailfins).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweteran.gower.pl/concept_timeline.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040830230627/http://www.autoweteran.gower.pl/concept_timeline.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 30, 2004|title=Concept Cars \u2013 Timeline 1938 \u2013 1981|access-date=October 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFlo reappears in ''Cars 2'' to help Lightning and Mater battle the Lemons (who were sent to kill Lightning by Miles Axlerod).

He owns an [[biofuel|organic fuel]] shop (Fillmore's Organic Fuel) which features several flavors, and believes gasoline companies are lying to the public. He is implied to smoke [[marijuana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thekindland.com/12-pixar-characters-that-were-most-definitely-high-985|title=12 Pixar Characters That Were Most Definitely High - KINDLAND|author=|date=|work=TheKindland.com|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> as it is indirectly referenced when he speaks of his organic fuel use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stonerdays.com/stoner-references-in-kids-movies/|title=Stoner References In Kids Movies - Stoner Blog|author=|date=17 January 2014|work=StonerDays.com|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> In the morning, when next-door neighbor Sarge plays [[Reveille]] and raises the [[Flag of the United States]], Fillmore interrupts Sarge's bugle reveille with [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s rendition of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\". This is much to Sarge's irritation, as he yells at Fillmore:\n\n: '''Sarge''': \"Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!\"\n: '''Fillmore''': \"Respect the classics, man! It's Hendrix!\"\n\nDespite this, he is friends with Sarge, and the two can be seen chatting throughout the film.\n\nHe has a sticker on his rear that says \"I brake for Jackalopes\". The [[jackalope]] is a mythical creature which features in the theatrical short ''[[Boundin']]'', shown with ''[[The Incredibles]]''. Another sticker says \"Save [[Traditional animation|2D Animation]]\". He has appeared in every Disney ''Cars'' game so far. As voiced by George Carlin, Fillmore's voice is similar to \"Al Sleet, the hippy-dippy weatherman\", a part of Carlin's comedy routine in the 1970s.\n\nFillmore reappears in ''Cars 2'', joining McQueen's pit crew for the World Grand Prix. Fillmore was re-cast due to George Carlin's death, and was voiced by Lloyd Sherr. Fillmore initially supports Allinol as it ''supposedly'' does not use oil, even convincing McQueen it is safe after several accidents involving other cars using Allinol. However, for the final race, Sarge replaces McQueen's Allinol with Fillmore's organic fuel, which is what prevents Lightning from being killed in the race.\n\nFillmore was originally going to be named '''Waldmire''', after a [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] resident, but Waldmire, a vegan, didn't want his name to be used, because Fillmore toys would be featured in [[Happy Meal]]s at [[McDonald's]].\n\n===Sarge===\n\n[[File:Covered Willy's jeep Wings Over Wine Country 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Willys MB]] Jeep]]\n'''Sarge''' (voiced by [[Paul Dooley]]) is a 1941 [[Willys Jeep]]. A veteran with a military green paint job and a slightly stylized [[Command Sergeant Major|Sergeant Major]] (E-9) insignia on his sides, he appears to be a [[World War II]] era [[Willys MB]]. His license plate reads \"41WW2\", which indicates the date the Willys MB entered the service of the U.S. Army (1941 World War II). He runs a surplus store, named \"'''Sarge's Surplus Hut'''\", next door to Fillmore and acts as part of Lightning's pit crew, gassing him up during the race. Near the end of the film,  he operates a [[Recruit training|boot camp]] to train SUVs and 4\u00d74s (some of whom had never been off-road) in rugged and dirt terrain. His recruits include T.J. Hummer, Murphy, Frank \"Pinky\" Pinkerton, and Charlie Cargo.\n\nSarge reappears in ''Cars 2'', using assistance from the British Army to aid in the melee against the Lemons. Prior to the final leg of the World Grand Prix, he secretly switches McQueen's supply of Allinol (the alternative fuel developed by race founder Sir Miles Axlerod) for Fillmore's organic fuel blend. Like Fillmore he became suspicious of the fuel after the incidents in Japan and Italy. The change saves McQueen from being killed as part of Axlerod's plot to discredit alternative fuels.\n\n===Lizzie===\n[[File:1919 Ford Model T Highboy Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1919 Model T Coupe]]\n'''Lizzie''' (voiced by [[Katherine Helmond]]), a 1923 [[Ford Model T]] Coupe,<ref name=MeeetheCarspg15>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=15}}</ref> is the widow of Radiator Springs' founder, Stanley, and the elderly owner of a roadside souvenir and accessory shop (Radiator Springs Curios, which uses the \"HERE IT IS\" slogan and signage of the [[Jack Rabbit Trading Post]] on US&nbsp;66). Her license plate, \"MT23\", is a reference to her model and year. Her name is derived from [[Tin Lizzie]], one of the Model T's popular nicknames. She appears to have gone somewhat [[senile]], and has a crush on [[Lightning McQueen]]. When she is shown teasing Luigi and Guido in the film, stating \"The new road makes your place look like a dump.\", Luigi angrily says that she is a crazy, devilish old woman but despairs at the truth of her words and sets to work repainting the Casa della Tires garage to its original appearance. She appears extremely motherly.\n\nLizzie reappears in ''Cars 2'' with a minor role. In the beginning she greets Lightning when he returns, but didn't even know he was gone all this time. She isn't present at the airport but is seen in the end talking to Mack about how crazy Holley Shiftwell is for keeping a dent. She also appears in ''Cars 3'', which would be Helmond's final role before her death.\n\nShe appears in the ''[[Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales]]'' episode \"Time Travel Mater\", where her and Stanley's backstories are revealed.\n\nLizzie was originally going to be named '''Henry F. Ord''', after [[Henry Ford]]. She also, at one point, originally resembled a [[Ford Model T]] \"Center Door\" Sedan{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\n===Red===\n'''Red''' (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]] and later [[Jerome Ranft]]) is a [[Pumper|closed-cab pumper]] bearing Carburetor County license plate \"002\". He is shy and emotional which explains why he cries and drives away at the same time. He spends most of his time gardening and washing things, such as the statue of Stanley in front of his [[fire station]]. It was stated by Mater that Red \"hated\" [[Lightning McQueen]], because he accidentally killed his flowers. Later, it is clear that Red had forgiven Lightning McQueen and warmed up to him, especially when he burst into tears and fled when he mistakenly thought that Lightning McQueen left without saying goodbye. While he gasped and sobbed in the film, he didn't really talk. In the first film, he seems to know about tractor-tipping as he used his horn to try and stop a stampede of tractors out of trying to protect his flowers. He formerly dislikes Lightning McQueen and he also dislikes crying and feeling upset and people vandalizing his flowers.\n\nRed reappears in ''Cars 2'' as a non-speaking character. He only makes a small appearance at the airport crying as he sees Team McQueen taking off for Tokyo, also in the battle against the Lemons, where he arrives just in time to blast some of the [[Lemon (automobile)|Lemons]] away with his fire hose.\n\nRed appears in the ''Tales from Radiator Springs'' short film: ''Bugged''. He was voiced by [[Jerome Ranft]], who voiced Gamma in ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''.\n\n===Stanley===\n[[File:1912 Staney steam car.JPG|right|thumb|Stanley steam car]]\n'''Stanley''' (voiced by [[John Michael Higgins]]) is Lizzie's late husband who was the founder of Radiator Springs.<ref name=\"MeeetheCarspg15\" /> Stanley was probably based on and named after a [[Stanley Steamer]], a steam-powered automobile. Lizzie, reminiscing, describes him as having been \"an awfully persistent li'l bugger for a two-cylinder\". A statue of Stanley stands outside the town hall, and although it was broken off its pedestal and dragged through the streets on a wire by Lightning McQueen, it was fortunately undamaged, and another mishap placed the statue right back where it was. Although dead, Stanley continues to exert an influence on the town, particularly over Lizzie, who often talks to his statue in memory of him.\n\nStanley's statue reappears in ''Cars 2'' where he was shown to be less old and broken, possibly renovated.\n\nIn the ''[[Cars Toon]]'', Time Travel Mater, Stanley appears alive for the first time. In the [[Cars Land]] theme park, signage commemorating \"The Original Radiator Spring\"  claims that \"On this site in the summer of 1909 Stanley, exploring out west, overheated as his radiator water boiled away. Coasting into the shade, he happened upon a life-saving natural spring. Upon this most fortunate discovery, Stanley founded the first settlement in Ornament Valley, and in honor of the oasis, christened it Radiator Springs.\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Cars Land Test Drive: Radiator Springs Racers|author=Adrienne Vincent-Phoenix|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=June 2012|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/alliance/destinations/mouseplanet/post/2012/06/Cars-Land-Test-Drive-Radiator-Springs-Racers/716686/1 }}</ref>  Stanley's Oasis is listed as the first local business in Radiator Springs, although [[steam locomotive condensing apparatus|condensers]] only appeared on Stanley steam cars beginning in 1915. The revised Timeline of the toon shows Lightning and Mater travelling back to 1909, meeting Stanley, and pointing Lizzie out to Stanley, prompting him to approach her to make a sale. A quick stop on their way back to the present allows Lightning and Mater to witness Stanley and Lizzie's wedding.\n\nStanley makes a silent cameo in the [[Pixar]] short, ''[[Boundin']]''.\n\n===Bessie===\n'''Bessie''' is a non-anthropomorphic [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]]-laying machine that is used to fix roads in Radiator Springs.<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=16}}</ref> <span id=\"Big Al\"> She was often used by one of the citizens of Radiator Springs, referenced as \"Big Al\", before the citizen in question left fifteen years ago.</span> When [[Lightning McQueen]] accidentally destroys the road by dragging the statue of Stanley, Radiator Springs traffic court judge [[Doc Hudson]] sentences him to fix the road with her. While Doc insists \"this here is Bessie, finest road-paving machine ever built\", a construction [[trade publication]]'s August 2006 editorial describes her as a \"tar-spewing hybrid paver/compactor\" and \"an ecological disaster\" as sometimes Bessie boils over and splats tar onto the car(s) pulling her.\n\n{{quote|\"If she doesn\u2019t hit you with a stray spray of hot asphalt burbling in two tanks heated by open flames, the fumes emanating from every orifice would prompt an asthma attack. Aggregate jostles loose in a top hopper, and her black-smoke-extruding exhaust pipes are coated with the remains of decades of paving seasons...

Bessie is a non-living vehicle; she cannot move by herself and she has no voice actress in the film.\n\n===Frank and the Tractors===\n'''Frank''' is a generic red [[combine harvester]] that resembles a [[bull]], and the guardian of the tractors (which \"moo\" as [[cow]]s). After [[Lightning McQueen]]'s first encounter with Frank during a night of [[cow tipping|tractor tipping]] with Mater, Lightning starts dreaming that he, The King, and [[Chick Hicks]] (the last of whom does not survive, getting chopped up while The King and McQueen move out of the way) are beaten by Frank in the tie-breaker race. Frank wins the Piston Cup and gets kissed while Lightning is surrounded by the tractors who are licking him. Later, the tractors end up stampeding into Radiator Springs following a mishap with them on Mater's part. He is last seen with the tractors at the drive-in theatre scenes behind the fence far behind Mack, watching the movie as well. He is also seen in the short ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'' when Mater races past him, waking him up, but does not chase him. Frank seems to be the soothing and kind master of the tractors and the leader of the herd and also hates trespassers who step into his farm and bother the tractors. The tractors also appear in ''Planes'' and are shown to be sacred in India (India's residents believing they will be reincarnated as tractors).\n\n===Former residents===\nA flashback in the original film devotes a little over a minute to show Radiator Springs in a pre-[[freeway]] era when all cross-country traffic would by necessity pass through the town's busy main street. Various old cars appear very briefly in this segment with no names and no dialogue, only to vanish when the town is bypassed.\n\n<span id=\"Miles Malone\">'''Miles \"Meattruck\" Malone''' was a red-cab delivery truck serving the Ornament Valley region;</span> <span id=\"Dustin Mellows\">'''Dustin Mellows''', a yellow delivery truck, bore the logo and initials TS for Trophy Sparkplugs.<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=17|quote=Dustin Mellows was a delivery truck for Trophy Sparkplugs in the 1950s.}}</ref></span> Local cars included <span id=\"Mildred Bylane\">'''Mildred Bylane''' (a light-brown car leaving Luigi's),</span> <span id=\"Percy Hanbrakes\">'''Percy Hanbrakes''' (a brown car towed to Flo's by Mater),</span> <span id=\"Edwin Kranks\"></span>'''Edwin Kranks''' (a two-tone apple-green car), <span id=\"Hank Murphy\">'''Hank \"Halloween\" Murphy''' (a two-tone orange \"Rumbler\" with tail fins, named as a parody of the [[Nash Motors|Nash]]/[[AMC (automobile)|AMC]] [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]])</span> and <span id=\"Milton Calypeer\">'''Milton Calypeer''' (a blue car on Route 66 at the town limits).</span>\n\n===Bugs===\nIn Radiator Springs and the surrounding desert area of Carburetor County, insects are depicted as small, winged [[VW Bug]]s (or beetles). The bugs appear at least three times in the original film, hovering around [[fluorescent lighting]] at [[Midpoint Caf\u00e9|Flo's V8 Caf\u00e9]] on Lightning's initial arrival, swarming around the windows and the one missing fuel pump at the [[Wagon Wheel Motel|Wheel Well Motel]] before its historic restoration, and in the [[desert]] where Minny and Van are still quite clearly lost at the end of the film, after the closing credits. (One bumps on the camera lens, leaving a mark on it, and flies off eventually) One also appears in ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'', which Mater had confused for the Ghostlight (despite the yellow headlights). The bugs are alive but do not speak (Vroomaroundus Bugus merely buzz with sped-up sounds of an air-cooled VW engine<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Cars\" Gets it Right |author=Damon Bell |publisher=Consumer Guide |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/cars-gets-it-right-cga.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513080833/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/cars-gets-it-right-cga.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-05-13 }}</ref>) so they are not named individually and they have no voice actors.\n\n==Piston Cup announcer and analyst==\n===Bob Cutlass===\n'''Bob Cutlass''' is an announcer for the Piston Cup races and friend of Darrell Cartrip.

Chuki has a very small appearance in Cars as she is shown as one of the news reporters who appear in the multi-clip footage of various TV news channels reporting [[Lightning McQueen|McQueen's]] sudden disappearance while being transported to the Los Angeles International Speedway for his tie-breaker final of the Piston Cup. In ''[[Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales]]'' episode \"Tokyo Mater\", Chuki is seen presenting a news broadcast on one of the large TVs installed in Tokyo.

After McQueen's disappearance, the twins are devastated that McQueen apparently will not make it to the race. [[Chick Hicks]] then swoops in and consoles them, loading them up with his own merchandise and a free Hostile Takeover Bank-sponsored green paint job. Mia and Tia accept the offer, not because they are Chick's fans, but because green complements their eyes. They soon return to being McQueen's fans, turning against Hicks after he deliberately causes [[Strip \"The King\" Weathers]] to wreck in the tie-breaker race.\n\nMia and Tia eventually move to Radiator Springs and are visible briefly as [[carhop|waitresses]] at Flo's V8 Caf\u00e9 during the end credits. Their characters are based on sisters Mary Lou and Christina Mendez at the [[Midpoint Caf\u00e9]] in [[Adrian, Texas]], where the caf\u00e9's (now semi-retired) owner Fran Houser is the basis for \"Flo\".<ref name=\"ocregister-carsland\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/houser-358737-caf-route.html|date=June 13, 2012|title=Life changed at her caf\u00e9 when Pixar dropped in: Fran Houser said her Route 66 Midpoint Caf\u00e9 in Texas was a sleepy spot \u2013 until the \"Cars\" movie premi\u00e8red.|author=Eric Carpenter|publisher=Orange County Register}}</ref>\n\nThey also appear in the video game of ''Cars'' where they challenge Sally to a race to determine who gets a date with Lightning Mcqueen.\n\nIn a deleted scene on the ''Cars'' DVD, the twins were fans who distract Lightning during a brief stop at the Top Down Truck Stop, a venue with \"all [[convertible]] [[waitress]]es\", causing Mack to inadvertently leave without him. The implicit reference to [[toplessness]] is largely removed from the final script, which has Mack driving straight through and separates the characters on I-40. Mia and Tia appear in every episode of ''Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales'' except Time Travel Mater and make a cameo appearance near the end of ''Cars 2'' as spectators at the new Radiator Springs Grand Prix.\n\nThey don't appear in ''Cars 3'' for unknown reasons, as they were replaced by a little red car named Maddy McGear.\n\n===Albert Hinkey===\n'''Albert Hinkey''' (voiced by A.J. Riebli, III) is an [[RV]] who proclaims himself as Lightning's \"biggest\" fan (\"biggest\" being a pun because he is such a large vehicle).<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=51|quote=Albert Hinkley is...Lightning McQueen's biggest fan...}}</ref> He is seen in the background of races. He is first seen shouting encouraging words to McQueen as he makes it through the big wreck Chick Hicks caused. He is later seen in the tie-breaker race, cheering for McQueen and is shocked when he notices Doc Hudson. When McQueen chooses to forfeit the win and help Strip Weathers finish his last race, he is shown sobbing when he sees what happens. He is later seen in ''Cars 3'', where shouts encouraging words to McQueen once again. His topside is decorated with rows of Lightning/Rust-eze flags. Hinkey also has a loud horn, which he uses while saying \"Ka-Chow!\" (McQueen's catchphrase) and the loud noise is a nuisance to fellow spectators. The Character is an obvious reference to [[John Hinckley Jr.|John Hinckley]], the stalker and attempted assassin of President Ronald Reagan who attempted such crimes to profess his love for actress Jodi Foster as her biggest fan.\n\n<span id=\"Larry Camper\">His friend '''Larry Camper''', voiced by Larry Benton, exclaims \"Dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It's the Hudson Hornet!\" when Lightning's Radiator Springs pit team arrives for the tiebreaker race. This is a joke on the old '''Harold Lloyd''' punch line, \"step right up and call me speedy!,\" which originated (mostly) in his hit '''silent film''' called '''The Freshman''' Lloyd also made another film called '''Speedy''', which may or may not have been a reference, as it was made three years after '''The Freshman'''.</span>\n\n===Fred===\n'''Fred''' (voiced by [[Andrew Stanton]]) is a starstruck, very rusty old car resembling a [[Lada Riva|Lada 2107]]. Everybody knows his name because his license plate holder and license plate read \"Hello, my name is\" and \"FRED\", respectively. He is the prop for the recurring gag in the film; when McQueen says his name, he shouts \"He knows my name!\" twice and, in his excitement, his front bumper (which happens to be his lower jaw) falls off. Later, when he is unable to gain access to the tie-breaker race and [[Mario Andretti]] (who would be waved through the gate on sight as a celebrity) likewise reads his license plate, Fred says, \"Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now!\" He is seen in Radiator Springs at the end of the film with [[bumper sticker]]s for the last three towns ([[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]], [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]) in [[Route 66 (song)]]; when he stops, his front bumper falls off again. He also shows up in [[Mater National]] and [[Cars Race-O-Rama|Race-O-Rama]].\n\nFred is one of the many rusty old cars at the Rust-eze sponsor tent for McQueen's personal appearance; others (listed in the \"Car Finder\" game but not named in the movie's credits) include <span id=\"Jonathan Wrenchworths\">'''Jonathan Wrenchworths''' (the rusted green car in Rust-eze advertisements)</span> and <span id=\"Donna Pits\">'''Donna Pits''' (a rusted 1970s car standing beside Fred)</span>.\n\n===Additional fans===\nA group of five transport lorries watch the race at a truck stop; two are identified in the \"Car Finder\" game as <span id=\"Gil\">'''Gil''' (a green Peterbilt)</span> and <span id=\"Paul Valdez\">'''Paul Valdez''' (an orange transport with a white stripe and 'PV' on his cap).</span>\n\nA group of RV's watching the tiebreaker at the speedway include <span id=\"Barry Diesel\">'''Barry Diesel''' (a thirsty RV with a blue Dinoco visor cap, sipping two kegs of Dinoco Light),</span> <span id=\"Bud\">'''Bud''' (a white RV with a jackalope painted on his back),</span> <span id=\"Clayton Gentlebreeze\">'''Clayton Gentlebreeze''' (a white RV with green stripes)</span> and <span id=\"Syd VanDerKamper\">'''Syd VanDerKamper''' (a camper van).</span>\n\nThe \"more than two hundred thousand cars\" watching the tiebreaker race include <span id=\"Coriander Widetrack\">'''Coriander Widetrack''' (a  small purple car holding a model aeroplane),</span> <span id=\"Marty Brakeburst\">'''Marty Brakeburst''' (a grey runabout wearing a Piston Cup antenna ball),</span> <span id=\"Mathew McCrew\">'''Mathew \"True Blue\" McCrew''' (a blue car behind a fence with \"the King\" flag on his antenna),</span> <span id=\"Milo\">'''Milo''' (a boxy green car beside McCrew),</span> <span id=\"Polly Puddlejumper\">'''Polly Puddlejumper''' (a small blue car with a blue \"the King\" crown on her antenna),</span> <span id=\"Swift Alternetter\">'''Swift Alternetter''' (a green SUV surrounded by RV's),</span> <span id=\"Timothy Twostroke\">'''Timothy Twostroke''' (a dark-red car displaying the #95 lightning bolt on his visor and antenna)</span> and <span id=\"Wilmar Flattz\">'''Wilmar Flattz''' (a small light-purple car with \"lightning\" on his antenna and \"95\" on his visor).</span>\n\n===Maddy McGear===\nMaddy McGear (voiced by Madeleine McGraw) is Lightning McQueen's biggest fan in ''Cars 3''.\n\n==Other race cars==\n===\"Junior\" No. #8===\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr car2006.jpg|thumb|[[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]]'s  #8 Budweiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo during a pit stop at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]] in 2006]]\n'''Dale Earnhardt Jr.''', often referred to as \"Junior\" is a red stock car similar to the Gen 4 cars that the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series used prior to 2007. He is voiced by [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.|the race car driver of the same name]], and closely resembles the #8 [[Budweiser]] [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS]] that he drove from his Sprint Cup debut in 1999 until his departure to the team his maternal grandfather Robert Gee, Sr. started, [[Hendrick Motorsports]], in [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2008]]. The car's Budweiser stickers are replaced by [[Dale Earnhardt Inc.]] stickers; these stickers refer to the same change made in NASCAR games as well as toys in order to avoid alcohol advertising. Junior is seen during the first race (Dinoco 400) and is involved in the wreck caused by Chick Hicks. When McQueen goes missing, Junior tells the Competition Racing Sports Network \"I sure hope that Lightning is okay. I would hate to see anything bad happen to him!\". At the tie-breaker, Junior wishes [[#Strip \"The King\" Weathers|The King]] good luck in his last race, as \"you've been an inspiration to me\". Junior is last seen at the Radiator Springs racing museum with The King and his wife Lynda, amazed by Doc Hudson's many season winnings during the 1950s. Junior does not appear in the video game nor the third film, due to his sponsor not returning in both, likely because it has gone out of business.  (The real-life Earnhardt Jr., his sister Kelley Miller, and their uncles Robert Gee, Jr. and Jimmy Gee, [[JR Motorsports|currently operate a second-tier NASCAR team]].)\nA replica of the red livery, with the Hendrick #88 on a Gen 6 [[Holden Commodore (VF)|Holden Commodore]] with Hendrick's current [[Axalta Coating Systems]] sponsor decals, was used for Earnhardt's final race as a full-time Cup driver in 2017.\n\n===Mario Andretti No. #11===\n[[Mario Andretti]] voices his eponymous character, who is a former racecar that believes every day is a great day for racing. He is based on the 1967 [[Holman Moody]] [[Ford Fairlane (North American)|Ford Fairlane]] that Andretti drove to victory lane in the [[1967 Daytona 500]]. In the Spanish edition of the movie, Andretti is voiced by Spanish [[Formula One]] champion [[Fernando Alonso]].\n\n<span id=\"Patty\">A small green car seen beside Andretti at the entrance to pit lane is identified in the \"Car Finder\" game as '''Patty''', Mario's personal assistant. She does not have a speaking role in the film.</span>\n\nThe actual Ford Fairlane that Andretti drove was rebuilt as a [[Mercury Cyclone]] by Robert Gee ([[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]]'s maternal grandfather), driven in 1971 by German F1 and sportscar driver [[Rolf Stommelen]] for his only NASCAR start at [[Talladega Superspeedway]], then sold to Darrell Waltrip for use his five races in 1972 and the first half of the 1973 season. It later became a Sportsman racer for Waltrip, but was crashed in 1975 at the [[DRIVE4COPD 300|Permatex 300 Sportsman]] race (now [[Xfinity Series]] race). Abandoned by Gee, it stayed there until a few NASCAR mechanics restored the car in its 1972 configuration as a 1971 Mercury Cyclone (brown #95) in the mid-1990s for a celebration of the 25th anniversary of Waltrip's first Cup start. It is displayed at Waltrip's museum in Harrisburg, North Carolina, and part of an Andretti exhibit at the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 2013. (A replica of the car as it looked in 1966 was also part of it.)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stockcarracing.com/featurestories/scrp_0610_darrell_waltrip_car_collection/index.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113093407/http://www.stockcarracing.com/featurestories/scrp_0610_darrell_waltrip_car_collection/index.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2007-11-13 | title=Darrell Waltrip's Car Collection | work=Stock Car Racing Magazine | date=June 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Michael Schumacher===\n'''[[Michael Schumacher]]''' is a 2004 [[Ferrari F430]] sports car voiced by Schumacher himself. He is a Ferrari in reference to five of his seven [[Formula One]] championships which were achieved with [[Ferrari F1]]. He appears at Luigi's shop at the end of the movie after being told by Lightning McQueen that \"this is the best place in the world to buy tires\", and asks to order a few sets of tires for himself and a pair of [[Maserati]] [[Maserati Quattroporte|Quattroportes]] who accompany him. After Luigi faints from the excitement of having \"a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in his store\", Schumacher speaks to Guido in Italian, and Guido subsequently faints. The Italian phrase he speaks is, \"I hope that your friend recovers, I was told that you are fantastic.\" Because of licensing issues, in the Cars toyline, his name is called Ferrari F430 instead of his name himself.\n\n===Darrell Cartrip===\n\n'''Darrell Cartrip''', a 1977 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, is a Piston Cup announcer in the first and the third film. A former Piston Cup racer, his character is based on his voice actor, [[1989 Daytona 500]] winner and ''[[Fox NASCAR]]'' commentator [[Darrell Waltrip]]. An enthusiastic Cartrip uses Waltrip's catchphrase \"Boogity boogity boogity!

The real-life car's original number (DiGard's #88) and green-and-white [[Gatorade]] livery do not appear on the character (the livery's design is now owned by [[PepsiCo]]). The film's credits list Darrell Waltrip Motorsports (his licensing arm) as the \"#17 Car\" (known for his Hendrick Motorsports and own efforts in winning three of NASCAR's four majors); Waltrip's various NASCAR entries have included a #17 (three times\u2014two of those he owned, the other belonging to [[Hendrick Motorsports]]) and a #95 (the one he drove in his 1972 debut was at one time the real-life former Mario Andretti #11 from 1967 seen in the Cars franchise, is one such).\n\nThe most famous of the real-life 1977 DiGard Monte Carlos was the infamous \"Bertha\", displayed at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in [[Talladega, Alabama|Talladega]], known for a weight-reduction scheme (devised by [[Gary Nelson (NASCAR)|Gary Nelson]] and [[Buddy Parrott]]) where up to {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of buckshot is dropped on-track on parade laps to lighten the car.

In the first film, they are lost and pass through Radiator Springs while trying to find their way back to [[Interstate 40]]. Van refuses to ask directions, claiming not to need them due to having a [[Global positioning system|GPS]]. Minny mentions that Van did the same when they were heading up to the \"Crazy Days\" (a parody of Derby Days<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shakopeederbydays.com|title=First Full Weekend in August|publisher=Shakopee Derby Days|access-date=May 29, 2010}}</ref>) in [[Shakopee, Minnesota|Shakopee]]. [[U.S. Route 66]], [[decommissioned highway|taken off the map]] in 1985, is conspicuously absent from stored maps in automotive aftermarket GPS units \u2014 an omission also noted by Harv, Lightning's agent, and a minor running joke in the film.\n\nBoth are equipped with [[car alarm]]s, which they arm after their encounter with Lightning McQueen when he begs them to call for help (they dismissed his plea as madness). After the final credits, Van and Minny are shown dirty and lost somewhere in the desert, having never asked for directions, with Van almost driven to [[insanity]]. Their names combine as a pun on \"[[minivan]]\". Van is a 2003 [[Ford Windstar]] and Minny appears to be a 1996 [[Dodge Caravan]]. Minny speaks with a pronounced Minnesota accent.\n\nVan and Minny reappear near the end of the second film. While Minny is mesmerized by Mater's spy story, Van does not believe one word of it until British agent Holley Shiftwell arrives to confirm it, which surprises Van, leaving him mesmerized by her and annoying Minny. In the final scene, when a rocket-propelled Mater rushes past Van, maps that Van was carrying are sent flying.\n\n===Delinquent Road Hazards===\nThe '''Delinquent Road Hazards''' are a group of four modified [[car tuning|tuner cars]] that intentionally cause trouble on the highway: '''Boost''' (Purple Neon/Carbon fibre covered 1994 [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]]), '''DJ''' (Blue 2004 [[Scion xB]]), '''Wingo''' (Green and purple 2000 [[Nissan Silvia]]) and '''Snot Rod''' (Orange 1971 [[Plymouth Barracuda]]). They get their group name from what Sheriff called McQueen when he ordered Mater to tow him to traffic court. They catch Mack nodding off to sleep on the way to California and amuse themselves by nudging him onto the [[rumble strip]]s along the shoulder. The resulting vibration causes Mack's trailer door to open and a sleeping McQueen to roll out of the trailer. When the chronically sniffly Snot Rod sneezes, Mack is startled awake, and accelerates away, leaving the still-sleeping McQueen behind near Radiator Springs. During the end credits, the Hazards are caught speeding on the outskirts of Radiator Springs by the Sheriff, who gives chase and places them in the impound lot. Like McQueen before them, they are sentenced to messy roadwork towing Bessie.\n\nIn the Italian dub, three of the Hazards are voiced by F1 drivers: [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] (Boost), [[Emanuele Pirro]] (Wingo) and [[Jarno Trulli]] (DJ). Boost, DJ and Wingo make a cameo appearance at the start of ''Tokyo Mater'', drifting along the main road of Radiator Springs and shouting insults at the residents before Sheriff gives chase to them. D.J. was voiced by his inspirational actor, E.J. Holowicki. Wingo, Boost and Snot Rod were voiced by Adrian Ochoa, [[Jonas Rivera]] and Pixar actor [[Lou Romano]].\n\n===TJ Hummer===\n'''TJ Hummer''' (voiced by [[Jan Rabson]]) is a vain [[Hummer H1]] that Sarge teaches in his boot camp during the end of the movie. Unlike the other SUVs in the boot camp, TJ refuses to go off-road, fearing that he will get dirt on his rims, but Sarge forces him to do so. His name may be a play on the action character [[T.J. Hooker]]. The other three boot camp recruits (none of which have speaking parts) are <span id=\"Frank Pinkerton\">'''Frank \"Pinky\" Pinkerton''' (a pink SUV),</span> <span id=\"Murphy\">'''Murphy''' (an orange SUV)</span> and <span id=\"Charlie Cargo\">'''Charlie Cargo'''.</span>\n\n===Sven \"The Governator\"===\n'''Sven \"The Governator\"''' (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) is a [[Hummer]]. His only line is \"Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!\" The name and vehicle is a parody of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s then-current position as [[Governor of California|California governor]], the first three ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' films he starred on, and the fact that he was one of the first [[Hummer H1]] owners.\n\n===Jerry Recycled Batteries===\n'''Jerry''' (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]]) is a 1979 [[Peterbilt]] 352 that Lightning McQueen mistook for Mack. He has the words \"Recycled Batteries\" on his side. His only line in the movie is a response to McQueen: \"Mack?! I ain't no Mack, I'm a Peterbilt for dang sake! Turn on your lights, you moron!\" The deleted scene on the DVD has the words \"Jerry's Junk\" and his only line is shortened saying: \"Turn on your lights, you moron!\"\n\n===Interstate 40 vehicles===\nVarious cars and trucks in non-speaking roles are named in the \"Car Finder\" game but have only silent cameos in the film.\n\n<span id=\"Bertha Butterswagon\">'''Bertha Butterswagon''', a small green runabout, watches Mack admiring his own reflection in a metal tanker truck.</span> <span id=\"Leroy Traffik\">'''Leroy Traffik''', a minivan with a mattress on his roof and a [[spare tire|temporary spare]] as his right-rear wheel, passes a tired Mack just before the truck stop. He is seen with new tires from Luigi's during the film's epilogue.</span>\n\n<span id=\"Ben Crankleshaft\">'''Ben Crankleshaft''',</span> <span id=\"Chet Boxkaar\">'''Chet Boxkaar'''</span> and <span id=\"Oliver Lightload\">'''Oliver Lightload''' are sleeping trucks at the Top Down Truck Stop.</span>\n\n<span id=\"Duff Wrecks\">'''Duff Wrecks''' is a white pickup truck briefly seen one lane away from the Delinquent Road Hazard gang on I-40.</span>\n\n==''Cars 2''==\n\nThese are characters who have first or only appeared in the film ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011).\n\n===Secret agents and spies===\n\n====Finn McMissile====\n\n'''Finn McMissile''' (voiced by [[Michael Caine]], [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] in all video games) is a British secret agent who recruits [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]], whom he mistakes for a cleverly disguised American agent, to help in his mission. Caine depicted his character Finn based on his previous role [[Harry Palmer]] from ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The IPCRESS File]]'' and its sequels. He is also similar to [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], whom Michael Caine did not portray.\n\nOriginally, Finn was supposed to appear in the first ''Cars'' movie. In a sequence that never went beyond the storyboarding stage, [[Lightning McQueen|Lightning]] and [[Sally Carrera|Sally]] visited a drive-in theater where a ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]''-type film about a superspy car named \"Finn McMissile\" was playing. This scene was deleted.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rebecca Keegan|date=January 16, 2011|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-sneaks-june-cars-20110116,0,427784.story|title=2011 Movie Preview: 'Cars 2'|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> The design of Finn is inspired by several cars: the roofline and doors of the [[Volvo P1800]] (possibly inspired by [[Roger Moore]]'s [[Volvo P1800#The Saint's Volvo 1800|ownership of one]] while filming ''The Saint'' TV espionage series in the early 1960s, as Moore also portrayed Bond from 1973 to 1985), the grill and fenders of the [[BMW 507]], and some major elements of the iconic ''James Bond'' [[Aston Martin DB5]], debuting in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (including its sound, as clearly heard in the intro of ''[[GoldenEye]]''); he also resembles a 1970s [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]]. The look of the car has been slightly modified; Finn has a different grill that looks like a suave mustache, but like Bond, he does have plenty of gadgets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.movies.yahoo.com/blog/134-disney-pixar-getting-back-in-the-fast-lane-with-cars-2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119101159/http://blog.movies.yahoo.com/blog/134-disney-pixar-getting-back-in-the-fast-lane-with-cars-2|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 November 2010|title=Disney/Pixar Getting Back in the Fast Lane With Cars 2|work=Yahoo Movies|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> His small tailfins were inspired by a 1958 British sports car called the [[Peerless (UK car)|Peerless]]\u2014one of the few British cars with fins.<ref name=\"skfacts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-news/movies/cars-2-introduces-1000-characters-fun-facts-minor-spoilers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426070910/http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-news/movies/cars-2-introduces-1000-characters-fun-facts-minor-spoilers/|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 April 2011|title=\u2018Cars 2\u2032 Introduces Nearly 1,000 New Characters and More Fun Facts|work=Stitch Kingdom|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> Finn is fluent in many languages, most notably English, French and Italian. He is outfitted with a plethora of gadgets, including: two (front) bumperette grappling hooks, a right headlight spy camera, a left headlight missile launcher, side mirror digital readouts, a deployable glass cutter, front wheel hub magnetic explosives launchers, side vent deployable machine guns, rear wheel hub deployable surveillance probes, rear bumperette grappling hooks, a rear turn signal oil dispenser, a miniature car that he can deploy (called a \"skate jack\"), an undercarriage mounted quad harpoon gun, a hydrofoil for oversea travel, a roof-deployed holographic disguise emitter, magnet tires, and a submarine-mode for underwater escapes.<ref name=\"skfacts\"/> Finn made a cameo in ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' on a poster in Andy's room. His license plate is 314 FMCM, which includes a reference to his initials. The number 314 indicates Caine's birthday, March 14, the same day as [[Billy Crystal]], another actor for Pixar. His belief about the World Grand Prix turns out to be true, as it was all just a setup by Miles Axlerod to make alternate fuel seem dangerous and make cars run on his own fuel with no choice.\n\nFinn McMissile appears in ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure]]''. It was revealed that Finn was a spy who was on the biggest oil platform in the world before he met Mater. None of them knew that Mater was not a spy. He just answered the question correctly.\n\n====Holley Shiftwell====\n'''Holley Shiftwell''' (voiced by [[Emily Mortimer]]) is a British spy-in-training who is Mater's love interest/girlfriend in the film. She is a 2011 [[Jaguar C-X75]]\n\nHolley's name is a reference to [[Holley Performance Products]], Inc., a manufacturer of high-performance carburetors and fuel systems located in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]]. Her design was made from a [[Jaguar XJR-15]]. Her name is possibly also a reference to [[Bond Girl]] [[Holly Goodhead]]. Her license plate is HS1201, which includes her initials. The number 1201 is Emily Mortimer's birthday in American date order (December 1).\n\nHolley is equipped with gadgets including: (front) projection lamps above headlights that emit a heads-up display, headlight cameras; a (side) right wheel concealed gun and an electro-shock device, a telescoping utility arm, (undercarriage) mounted dual trackball platforms for controlling the heads-up display, and retractable wings for flight.<ref name=\"skfacts\"/>\n\nHolley Shiftwell appears in ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure]]''. She is a playable character in the [[Disney Infinity (series)|''Disney Infinity'' series]]. \n\n====Siddeley====\n'''Siddeley''' (voiced by [[Jason Isaacs]]) is a [[Gulfstream V]] spy jet. He is 176 feet long with a 157-foot wingspan (53 and 48 meters respectively) and is shown to possess afterburners, though no aspect of his airframe is suited to supersonic flight, In addition, he has [[VTOL]] (vertical-takeoff and landing) capabilities. His tail has [[A113]] painted on it, a recurring gag in the Pixar films. Siddeley is also seen once in the Mexican Airport in a spinoff movie [[Planes (film)|Planes]] as a background jet, and twice in its sequel [[Planes: Fire and Rescue]] as a visiting VIP ('''V'''ery '''I'''mportant '''P'''lane), and was mentioned to be the cause of the massive wildfire during the third-fourth of the movie.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/cars-2-characters-rod-torque-redline-siddeley|title=Meet Two New \u2018Cars 2\u2032 Characters: Rod \"Torque\" Redline and Siddeley|access-date=February 27, 2011|author=Han, Angie|date=February 24, 2011|work=[[/Film]]}}</ref> His name is a reference to the British aerospace company [[Hawker Siddeley]].\n\n====Stephenson====\n'''Stephenson''' is a spy train, who first appeared in ''Cars 2'' working with Finn McMissile. Stephenson brings Finn, Holley, and Mater to Porto Corsa, Italy. Stephenson is a state-of-the-art bullet train, who scrambles switchboards, hops international rail lines, and can make it from Dover to Porto Corsa in five hours. He has no dining car and no spare compartment because he's filled with the finest in high-tech, classified spy gear and probably has a few secret agents aboard. One of his carriages contains high-tech equipment that modifies and adds gadgets to cars. His only line in ''Cars 2'' is \"Finn, one hour to Porta Corsa\". Stephenson is named after the \"father of railways\", namely [[George Stephenson]].\n\n====Leland Turbo====\n'''Leland Turbo''' (voiced by [[Jason Isaacs]]) was a British agent who appeared in the film's beginning. He sends a video message to Finn McMissile about what he sees in Professor Z\u00fcndapp's oil rig. However, by the time Finn arrives at the rig, the lemons have found Leland and crushed him into a cube. He appears to be based on a [[Jaguar E-Type]]. His name is most likely based on [[Leyland Motors]], a now-defunct British vehicle manufacturer.\n\n====Rod Redline====\n'''Rod Redline''' (voiced by [[Bruce Campbell]]) was considered by many as America's greatest spy. He is the agent McMissile and Shiftwell were supposed to meet before he ran into Mater, which leads to the mistake of the spy cars thinking Mater is Rod Redline. He is a crossover between a 2005 [[Mustang GT]] and a [[Dodge Challenger]] R/T. His license plate suggests that he is from Michigan, which is where Bruce is from.\n\nIn the beginning of the film, he is seen by McMissile (disguised as a lemon) talking to Professor Z\u00fcndapp about the camera. In the bathroom, Rod takes off his disguise so Finn and Holley can recognize him. Unfortunately, lemons Grem and Acer follow him in the bathroom and his plan backfires when they recognize him before Holley can meet him. Rod tries to fight them off, but the two lemons dodge his tactics and severely damage him. Cornered by the villains, he turns his information over to a rusty American tow truck named Mater before being captured. He is later filled with Allinol at the lemons' hideout. Rod thanks them due to the fact that Allinol is good for cars, but Professor Z\u00fcndapp reveals to the agent that Allinol explodes when it is hit with an electromagnetic pulse. As it turned out, the Lemons were going to torture him until he told them who the information was passed to. Despite the torture, Rod refuses to reveal the info, but the lemons realize that Redline passed the info to Mater. Redline is killed afterwards.\n\n====Tomber====\n'''Tomber''' (voiced by Michel Michelis) is Finn McMissile's underground informant. Having been saved from a long sentence in a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] impound lot (20 years to life) by McMissile, Tomber has since become an auto-parts dealer. He specializes in rare parts, such as the ones needed to keep a certain [[Sir Miles Axlerod|Rover V8]] going. Mater and Tomber get along from their first meeting, both respecting the other's knowledge of cars and specific parts. Tomber (French for \"to tumble\") is a [[Reliant Regal]] threewheeler, a car notorious for its poor handling and tendency to roll over in even gentle turns. His license plate reads \"PCS NO1R\". He may be based on [[Del Boy]] from [[Only Fools and Horses|Only Fools & Horses]]\n\n===Crabby the Boat===\n'''Crabby the Boat''' (voiced by [[Sig Hansen]]) is a [[fishing vessel]] that is based on the [[FV Northwestern|F/V ''Northwestern'']], a boat captained by Hansen and featured in the American reality TV series ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. Crabby is painted and designed like the ''Northwestern''. He is seen in the beginning of the film with [[Finn McMissile]] aboard him. Finn has paid Crabby to bring him to a certain location in the ocean so he can look for a car, a request that greatly puzzles Crabby. Once they reach the spot, Tony Trihull (see below) intercepts Crabby and threatens him with a [[RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile|missile launcher]], forcing him to turn back. Crabby apologizes to Finn as he heads home, not knowing that Finn has already slipped off board and hitched onto Tony to continue his mission.\n\n===Sir Miles Axlerod and his minions===\n\n====Sir Miles Axlerod====\n'''Sir Miles Axlerod''' (voiced by [[Eddie Izzard]]) is a former oil baron who has sold off his fortune after he supposedly converted himself into an electric vehicle. He is revealed to be the main antagonist at the end of  ''Cars 2''. He was the first car to circumnavigate the globe without any GPS which is similar to explorer, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] who circulated the globe. Axlerod created the World Grand Prix to promote his new wonder-fuel, Allinol. Axlerod later reveals that he owns the largest untapped oil reserves in the world. His \"alternative fuel\" is actually ordinary gasoline engineered to ignite if hit with [[electromagnetic pulse]]s from weapons disguised as television cameras. Axlerod's plans to use oil for world domination are eventually exposed. Axlerod plans to use Professor Z\u00fcndapp and the [[Lemon (automobile)|Lemon Cars]] to kill McQueen in the final race, but the EMP weapon fails to finish him off because Sarge switched McQueen's Allinol for Fillmore's organic fuel. As a backup, Axlerod has Z\u00fcndapp and the lemon cars implant a bomb on Mater's air filter which was not seen in the climax. Mater confronts Axlerod about the conspiracy and forces him to deactivate the bomb with a voice command, proving that he was the one who set it. Axlerod's engine turns out to be the [[Rover V8]] in the photo obtained by McMissile and Shiftwell after Mater opened his front hood (described by Mater and Tomber as \"the worst engine/motor ever made\"), and he is exposed as a fraud and a liar and is arrested by the British police, wondering how Mater figured out Axlerod was behind the whole scheme. He is based on a [[Range Rover L322]].\n\n====Professor Z\u00fcndapp====\n\n'''Professor Z\u00fcndapp''' (voiced by [[Thomas Kretschmann]]), often referred to as '''\"Professor Z\"''' (by his henchmen), is an internationally wanted weapons designer who is modelled after a [[Z\u00fcndapp Janus|Z\u00fcndapp Janus 250]] with a broken [[roof rack]] that evokes the look of a [[comb over]]. Though at first Professor Z\u00fcndapp appears to be the main villain, he is eventually revealed to be a subordinate to Miles Axlerod. According to Lego.com, it is revealed that his full name is '''Wolfgang Otto Zundapp'''. Z\u00fcndapp also appears in ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure]]''.\n\n====Grem and Acer====\n\n'''Grem''' (voiced by [[Joe Mantegna]]) is a dented, rusty orange [[AMC Gremlin]]. '''Acer''' (voiced by [[Peter Jacobson]]) is a beat-up green [[AMC Pacer]]. Both of these \"[[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]]\" cars are henchmen for Professor Z\u00fcndapp, Grem and Acer mistake Mater for an American agent with top-secret information, chasing him around the globe. Even though they don't have all the spy weapons and gadgets they are still tough and will do anything and everything to stop secret agents.\n\n====Tony Trihull====\n'''Tony Trihull''' (voiced by [[Lloyd Sherr]]) is a combat ship (modelled after {{USS|Independence|LCS-2}}) who works for Professor Z\u00fcndapp. He first appears in the beginning when he notices Crabby and Finn in the oil reserve, ordering Crabby to leave. When Crabby refuses, Tony threatens him with a missile battery (based on the [[RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile]]). As a result, Crabby leaves but Finn hitches a ride on the back of Tony without him knowing. He later appears again near the end of the film in London when Professor Z tries to escape from being caught by Finn McMissile, yelling for the Professor to hurry and get aboard him. When Finn McMissile stops the Professor, Tony uses a magnetic device to pull the Professor towards him. McMissile shoots several mine-bombs out of his wheels which cling to Tony's big magnet, resulting in a huge explosion killing Tony.\n\n===Hugos===\n\n====Victor Hugo====\n'''Victor Hugo''' (voiced by [[Stanley Townsend]]) is the head [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] of the Hugo family, being referred to as '''\"the boss\"''' by fellow Hugos. He and his Hugos work with Professor Z\u00fcndapp. During the film, Victor uses Ivan, a blue tow truck (which Mater masquerades as to infiltrate the lemons' meeting), as his own personal transportation that tows him place to place instead of having to drive on his own. Hugo and the other main heads of the three lemon families (Gremlin, Pacer, Trunkov) attend a meeting with Professor Z in Porto Corsa.\n\n====Alexander Hugo====\n'''Alexander Hugo''' (voiced by [[Velibor Topic]]) is part of the Hugo family that works for Professor Z and Miles Axlerod. He is the only black bodyguard lemon in the entire movie to talk, making him and Victor the only Hugo family members that talk. Despite his young age, he does dirty work (like Victor and Ivan) and attends the lemon meeting. He also is one of the lemons attempting to round up Mater so that the bomb would explode, killing both Mater and Lightning. Near the end of the film, Alexander is arrested in London with his fellow lemons.\n\n====Ivan====\n'''Ivan''' (voiced by [[Stanley Townsend]])  is a blue tow truck who serves as Victor Hugo's mode of transportation, towing him around. He resembles Mater greatly, in fact, Mater disguises as Ivan in order to infiltrate a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] crime meeting. The ''real'' Ivan was previously tazed by Holley. He later awoke and captured Holley and even intercepted Mater before he can warn Lightning McQueen about the truth of Allinol. In the end, he is defeated by Mater and arrested alongside the other lemons. His name is pronounced ee-van instead of eye-van.\n\n===Pacers===\n\n====Tubbs Pacer====\n'''Tubbs Pacer''' (portrayed by [[Brad Lewis]]) is the head [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] of the Pacer family. He and his Pacers work with Professor Z\u00fcndapp. During the film, Tubbs and the other main heads of the three lemon families (Gremlin, Trunkov, Hugo) attend a meeting with Professor Z in Porto Corsa to discuss their evil plans about discrediting the Allinol by using the radiation disguised camera to crash out the racers in the World Grand Prix that use the gas, and ensure that all cars keep using conventional fuel to secure the profits of their \"lemon\" organization who managed to secure the largest unexplored oil resources in the world. Tubbs is seen smiling at the idea and cannot wait.\n\n====Petey Pacer====\n'''Petey Pacer''' is a blue AMC Pacer member of the [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] organization. He can be recognized as one of the cars equipped with flamethrowers who attack Finn McMissile on the oil rigs' helipad.\n\n====Fred Pacer====\n'''Fred Pacer''' is a light yellow AMC Pacer.\n\n===Trunkovs===\n\n====Vladimir Trunkov====\n'''Vladimir Trunkov''' (voiced by [[Stanley Townsend]]) is the head [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] of the Trunkov family.

He is voiced by [[Owen Wilson]] in the films, ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'', the [[Cars (video game)|''Cars'' video game]] and the last episode of ''[[Cars Toons|Cars Toons: Tales from Radiator Springs]]'' and by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]] in all other media. McQueen is not modeled directly after a specific make and model, although his design contains some elements inspired by the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|Chevrolet Corvette C6]]. His Corvette lineage is further suggested by the \"retro\" paint scheme he acquires in Radiator Springs, which resembles that of a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Corvette C1]].\n\n====Mack====\n'''Mack''' (voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) is a 1985 [[Mack Super-Liner]] bearing license plate \"RUSTEZ3\". A dedicated member of the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment Team (and now Dinoco Oil), having the role of McQueen's (and now Ramirez's) transport, Mack pulls Lightning McQueen's (and now Ramirez's) trailer to his (and now her) races. Lightning's one loyal teammate after his entire pit crew resigns in protest at the end of the season decider, he inadvertently sets up the predicament suffered by McQueen throughout the movie. The grill on him suggests a nose and his top cover (with the Rusteze logo) suggests a Lumberjack hat.\n\nMcQueen exhorts Mack to drive through the night to his tiebreaker race with [[#Chick Hicks|Chick Hicks]] and [[#Strip \"The King\" Weathers|The King]] in Los Angeles, despite [[hours of service|federal DOT regulations]] which legally grant Mack ten hours daily of much-needed off-duty rest<ref name=\"DOT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/HOS-2005.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907135839/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/hos-2005.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-09-07 |title=Hours-of-Service Regulations - Effective October 1, 2005 |access-date=2012-07-07 |publisher=US DOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration}}</ref> alongside \"all those sleeping trucks\" at the last truck stop on I-40. Lightning hopes to reach the venue first and to hang out with the [[Dinoco]] team. As a result, Mack falls asleep and, distracted by the Delinquent Road Hazards (who attempt to push him off the road to the shoulder), loses Lightning. Mack arrives in Radiator Springs after Doc reveals Lightning's location and is both very relieved (\"Thank the manufacturer, you're alive!\") and apologetic (\"I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you...\"). Lightning, who is glad to see him, forgives him.\n\nMack acts as Lightning's pit crew for the big race (since he has none) and worriedly asks if he's alright when he spins out, just before Doc and the others show up to help. Following the race, he congratulates McQueen on his loss for helping Strip Weathers after he is taken out. During the closing credits, Mack views automotive versions of previous Pixar films (such as ''Toy Car Story'' and ''Monster Trucks, Inc.'') at a restored 1950s [[drive-in theater|drive-in cinema]]. Commenting on other characters played by John Ratzenberger (including Hamm the piggy truck and the Abominable Snowplow), he eagerly applauds each of them until he realizes they're all played by the same actor, then demands to know \"What kind of cut-rate production is this?!\".\n\n{{quote|\"This one is a homage to my father... John Lasseter knew that my father drove a Mack truck and that's why he gave me this character. The truck was one of my first loves because I used to ride around with him in it from time to time.\"|John Ratzenberger<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/entertainment/9340180/detail.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710114354/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/entertainment/9340180/detail.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=Memories Of Dad Drive Ratzenberger's Mack In 'Cars': Actor Voices Seventh Consecutive Pixar Film |author=Tim Lammers |date=June 8, 2006 }}</ref> }}\n\n[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] Mayor Ed Pawlowski proclaimed April 21, 2006, Friday [[Mack Trucks]]-[[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] [[Cars (film)|\"Cars\" Day]]<ref>{{cite news|date=April 22, 2006 |author=Joanna Poncavage |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2006-04-22/news/3673203_1_mack-trucks-world-headquarters-lightning-mcqueen-pixar-cars-day |title=Mack among the stars |publisher=Morning Call |access-date=August 6, 2012}}</ref> in Mack's honor during the 41-city \"CARS Road Trip '06\" promotional tour.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-stars-of-disneypixars-cars-hit-the-road-for-cars-road-trip-06-presented-by-state-farmr-56420187.html \"CARS Road Trip '06\" promotional tour dates] from Disney press release.</ref>\n\nMack is seen in the short ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'' after Lightning established his headquarters on US Route 66. In ''Cars 2'' he appears in a pair of brief cameo appearances at the start and end, where his two lines are \"Oh, his best friend greetings. They get longer every year,\" and \"Oh, those two are perfect for each other.\". He appears in ''Cars 3'' with a much larger role compared to ''Cars 2''. He is still working as McQueen's transport. 4 months after McQueen's accident, he is in Radiator Springs and takes McQueen, Luigi, and Guido to the Rust-eze training center. Later, he takes McQueen, Cruz, Luigi, and Guido to the Thunder Hollow demolition derby circuit and after arriving, he comes up with the idea to disguise McQueen. On their way back, he is forced to pull over when Cruz opens his hauler and decides to part ways. He accompanies McQueen to pick Cruz up again and they head to Thomasville, and then to the Florida 500.\n\nIn a deleted scene, before McQueen heads to the tiebreaker race in California, Mack heads to a truck stop, after his grill is covered by a moth blizzard, to be washed. A still impatient McQueen comes outside the trailer to chase after Mack, and that is how he was lost. In another deleted scene, albeit a dream sequence where McQueen is in radiator springs, his V8 Alcohol motor is inside a steamroller, and Mater borrows his body; Mack makes a mistake, thinking Mater is McQueen, and takes him to the race.\n\n====Chuck and Lightning McQueen\u2019s pit crew====\n'''Lightning McQueen's pit crew''' are generic [[forklift]]s who only appear at the start of the film, never to be acknowledged again. They quit after McQueen said that he is a one-man show. One of them, presumably the acting [[pit stop|crew chief]] is voiced by Mike Nelson. After the official crew chief had decided to quit, he is referred to by McQueen as \"Chuck\", and retorts angrily afterwards, \"And my name is not Chuck!\". In the credits, he is referred to as \"Not Chuck\". They appear in the film (only to leave almost immediately) to show McQueen's selfishness and inability to work with others. McQueen had a crew chief before the film, but was not seen in the film, because McQueen fired him (believing he was a one-man show, which later came back to haunt him for his return). The chief was mentioned several times at the Dinoco 400 race. The crew is later replaced by McQueen's friends from Radiator Springs and Mack for the big race. In ''[[Cars 2]]'', McQueen has apparently hired a new pit crew as he mentions having given them all a vacation when asked to attend the World Grand Prix, but his friends from Radiator Springs again offer to become his crew for a race and he accepts.\n\n====Harv====\n'''Harv''' is [[Lightning McQueen]]'s agent. Never seen on-screen, McQueen speaks to Harv via his speaker phone when McQueen and Mack are en route to the tiebreaker race and again when Mack is in Radiator Springs to pick up McQueen. Consequently, very little is known of Harv's character except that he threatened to fire Mack if he doesn't get McQueen into his trailer.\n\nHarv is voiced by [[Jeremy Piven]] in the U.S. version and ''[[The Grand Tour]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] in the UK version. He is also based on the character [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]] from the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''. Although he is not seen in the actual film, Jeremy Clarkson believes that he is a 1979 [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada Ghia]], while in the American version, he is thought to be a 1996 [[Oldsmobile]].\n\n===Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze===\nThe '''Rust-eze Brothers''', '''Rusty''' and '''Dusty''', are the spokescars and owners of Rust-eze, the team that sponsors Lightning and that gave him his \"big break\", but they are somewhat awkward. Rusty is a 1963 [[Dodge Dart]] and Dusty, a 1967 [[Dodge A100]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=8}}</ref> Rusty and Dusty are voiced by real-life brothers [[Tom and Ray Magliozzi]] (respectively) of [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Car Talk]]'', using that program's [[Car Talk#Humor|closing line]] \"...and don't drive like my brother!\". Rusty bears an intentional resemblance to Tom Magliozzi's infamous green 1963 Dart, named \"The Dartre\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Dodge Dart owners still love the oldies|author=Sam Whiting|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=June 29, 2012|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dodge-Dart-owners-still-love-the-oldies-3673737.php }}</ref>\n\nThey appear three times in the first  film, at the beginning with McQueen looking forward to leaving them, in the middle very briefly being interviewed and at the end after the tiebreaker race when McQueen realises he is happy with them. In a deleted scene on the DVD, much of their dialogue (heard at the sponsors' tent in the final script) was originally part of a brief stop at the Top Down Truck Stop. On the die-cast cars, Rusty's license plate states \"Rust\" and Dusty's sports \"Eze\". Their license plates are from \"R Fair City\", a term the ''Car Talk'' brothers use to describe their home town of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. They appear four times in the third film, when they talked with McQueen about his winnings, McQueen was going to see Cal Weathers, when the Radiator Springs gang members and McQueen were talking on the phone and at the Rust-eze racing center to hand the sponsor over to Sterling.\n\nFollowing Tom's death in 2014, unused archive recordings from the first film were used to provide Rusty's speaking parts in ''Cars 3''.\n\n===Sterling===\nSterling is a billionaire and the new owner of the Rust-eze Racing Center. He reveals himself to be a fan of Lightning McQueen. He assigns Cruz Ramirez to train McQueen and prepare him for the Florida 500. After watching McQueen's poor performance on the simulator, Sterling attempted to convince McQueen to retire and become a racing brand. McQueen convinces him to give him a chance at winning the Florida 500, then McQueen could decide when to stop racing. Sterling reluctantly agrees.\n\nAt the Florida 500, Sterling reveals himself as greedy and self-centered when he cruelly ordered Cruz to leave and resume her job as a trainer. Against Sterling's will, McQueen puts Cruz in the race. After Cruz wins, Sterling asks her to race for him, but she refuses and quits. Tex Dinoco, owner of Dinoco, purchases Rust-eze from him, allowing Cruz to race and McQueen to train her.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Nathan Fillion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/cars-3-cast/|title=Cars 3 Cast: Meet New Characters Voiced by Nathan Fillion, Kerry Washington & Lea DeLaria|date=9 March 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Hamilton===\nA personal voice command assistant to Cruz Ramirez that's able to track McQueen's speed through his electronic suit.\nPlayed by British Formula One driver [[Lewis Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2017/05/25/hamilton-vettel-return-to-lend-their-voices-to-cars-3-video/|title=Hamilton, Vettel return to lend their voices to \u2018Cars 3\u2019 (VIDEO)|date=25 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Cruz Ramirez===\nCruz Ramirez, a Hispanic female, is Lightning McQueen's trainer and technician at the Rust-eze Racing Center.  Inspired by the [[Nissan 370z]] and the 2012 [[Ferrari F12 Berlinetta]]. She is known for training some of the best newer elite rookies through her unconventional training methods. She is assigned to train McQueen for the Florida 500. She attempts to train McQueen at Fireball Beach, but McQueen ends up teaching her how to race on sand. After surviving a Demolition Derby, which Cruz wins, McQueen lashes out on her for wasting his time and humiliating him on TV. Then, Cruz reveals that she always wanted to be a racer, but never found the confidence to do so.\n\nCruz and McQueen reconcile and head to Thomasville where they meet the former crew chief of Doc Hudson, Smokey. Smokey trains McQueen and inspires Cruz as well. At the Florida 500, Cruz is sent back to the Racing Center. McQueen exits the race to allow Cruz to race. Using what she's learned on the road, Cruz catches up to Jackson Storm, who tries to overtake her. However, Cruz flips over him and lands in first place. She begins to race for the Dinoco team, sporting Doc's former #51, with McQueen as her mentor. In the post-credits, Cruz has won the Piston Cup with Lightning by her side.\n\nCruz is voiced by [[Cristela Alonzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/who-is-cruz-ramirez-in-cars-3-cristela-alonzo-is-a-lot-like-her-trailblazing-character-64565|title=Who Is Cruz Ramirez In 'Cars 3'?

Weathers is an anthropomorphic version of Petty's [[Aero Warriors|aerodynamic]] 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]], sporting same shade of blue and Petty's racecar number, 43.<ref>{{cite news |title=Now 75, Richard Petty remains \u2018The King\u2019 20 years after his last victory |date=July 4, 2012 |publisher=Palm Beach Post |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/sports/motor-sports/now-75-richard-petty-remains-the-king-20-years-aft/nPmdw/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119033605/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/sports/motor-sports/now-75-richard-petty-remains-the-king-20-years-aft/nPmdw/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 19, 2012 }}</ref> He is one of the racecars in the 2006 Piston Cup three-way tie, along with [[Chick Hicks]] and [[Lightning McQueen]]. His sponsor ([[Dinoco]]), like Petty's ([[STP (motor oil company)|STP]]), is a well-known oil company.\n\n[[File:RichardPettyRoadrunner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Petty]]'s #43 [[Plymouth Superbird]]]]\nHe is Dinoco's \"Golden Boy\", having won seven Piston Cups<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=24|quote=This seven-time Piston Cup Champion...}}</ref> (the same number of NASCAR Cup Series championships Petty himself won in his career) and is hoping for his eighth in the tiebreaker race before entering retirement. He tells McQueen to remember the importance of his team, but the rookie does not pay any attention, being more preoccupied with the thought of taking over the Dinoco sponsorship after Weathers' retirement.\n\nOn the final lap of the tie-breaker race, Hicks rams into Weathers, sending him into a dangerous rollover. When McQueen sees this, he realizes that Weathers' career might end the way [[Doc Hudson]]'s did. After stopping short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, McQueen pushes Weathers across the finish line to let him finish his last race before his retirement, much to the audience's delight. Weathers is last seen visiting the racing museum in Radiator Springs with his wife and another Piston Cup racer, [[#\"Junior\"|\"Junior\"]], stating that Hudson was his inspiration (In NASCAR, \"The King\" #43 is the second of four generations of racers; his father [[Lee Petty]] won [[List of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champions|his first Cup]] in 1954, one year after the multiple [[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]] victories).\n\nHe returns in ''Cars 3'' as the crew chief of his nephew and new Dinoco racer Cal Weathers with Richard Petty reprising his role as the voice of The King. He is only shown in the first race of the film, where he tells Cal nice comeback after he gets his tires for a pit stop, and when he and his nephew pass the sponsorship to Cruz Ramirez after she wins the Florida 500. His only line in the film is \"Nice comeback, Cal\". (In real-life, Petty's nephew [[Trent Owens]], son of his wife Lynda's brother Randy, is a [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] crew chief.)\n\nIn the Danish edition of the movie, the King is voiced by nine-time [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]]. In the Finnish edition of the movie, The King is voiced by Finnish two-time Formula One World Champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]]. In the German edition, he is voiced by Austrian three-time Formula One World Champion [[Niki Lauda]].\n\nStrip Weathers also appears in the film's [[Cars (video game)|video game]] as an unlockable character in the Arcade. He is mentioned by Darrell Cartrip in the game's Story Mode.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]''.\n\n====Lynda Weathers====\n'''Lynda Weathers''', also known as '''\"Mrs. The King\"''', (voiced by Richard Petty's wife Lynda Petty) is similar in design to a [[station wagon]] that brought the Petty family to \"The King\"'s races during the 1970s. Like Tex, Lynda follows each race from a Dinoco VIP booth, rooting for the #43 car. Throughout the film, she is constantly shown supporting her husband and she worries deeply when he is flipped by Chick Hicks. After the race, while Chick Hicks is booed for wrecking her husband and winning the Piston Cup, she kisses Lightning on the cheek to thank him for helping her husband finish his final race.\n\nDuring the ending credits of ''Cars'', Mrs. The King can be seen at the Doc Hudson Museum with her husband and Mater as a tour guide throughout the museum. She asks to see and meet Doc Hudson, but Mater is unsure of his whereabouts at the present time \u2013 but assumes he is out racing, most likely with McQueen (which turns out to be true).\n\n====Cal Weathers====\nNew Dinoco racer. Took over as Dinoco racer after his uncle Strip Weathers retired and became his crew chief. Cal Weathers is numbered 42, and is a Piston Cup Stock Car with blue rims. He often races with Lightning McQueen and Bobby Swift and constantly pull pranks with each other after a race. Unlike his uncle, he seemed to be one of the weak Dinoco racers and never won any Piston Cups (according to Tex as a joke when he talks to Cruz Ramirez on joining Dinoco), though he does win some races as shown when he beats McQueen in a close finish at Rocker Arms Speedway. He later retires when new next gen racers including Jackson Storm take over the sport. He is voiced by real-life driver [[Kyle Petty]] who is Richard Petty's son.\n\n====Tex Dinoco====\n'''Tex Dinoco''', voiced by [[Humpy Wheeler]] of [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], is a billionaire and the owner of [[Dinoco]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=37|quote=Tex has been Dinoco's team owner...}}</ref> Packaged as \"Tex Dinoco with bullhorns\" as a diecast car, he is simply called \"Tex\" in the film's credits. He speaks with a Carolina accent and resembles a 1975 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]] <ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=37}}</ref> at [[The Big Texan Steak Ranch]] in [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]. He is the King's manager and sponsor. Unlike Lightning's agent (Harv, who doesn't watch the race), Tex is an avid race fan who would never miss a race. As a supportive and long-time friend of both Lynda and \"The King\", he has been a loyal fan of the #43 car for many years and boasts that The King \"has made Dinoco proud\".\n\nAfter [[#Chick Hicks|Chick Hicks]] wins by employing a [[PIT maneuver]] to sabotage The King in the final lap of the tiebreaker, sending the Dinoco blue #43 car into a dangerous rollover crash, Tex (angered by Hicks' unsportsmanlike driving) offers the lucrative sponsorship to Lightning with the explanation that \"there's a whole lot more to racing than just winning\" this is an echo of a line that McQueen used at the end of the race shown at the start of the film but with an entirely different meaning. However, McQueen turns down the offer, opting to stay with Rust-Eze.\n\nHe returns for ''Cars 3'' as the sponsor for Cal Weathers. After Cal retired, Tex sought to have newcomer Cruz Ramirez to race for him after watching her performance in the Florida 500. He also purchases Rust-eze from Sterling and allows Lightning McQueen to continue racing.\n\n====Dinoco Transport Helicopter====\nThe '''Dinoco Transport Helicopter''' is based on a [[Bell 430]]. Without a speaking part, he has no voice actor and is not named in the closing credits. His name is '''Rotor Turbosky''' (in apparent reference to helicopter maker [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation|Sikorsky]]) in the die-cast ''Cars'' toy collection. He is seen on top of the Dinoco tent during the races. Mater gets a ride over Radiator Springs at the end of the film, a favor which Lightning had promised Mater earlier when dreaming of the big trophy and the big sponsor (Dinoco) with the fancy helicopter.\n\n===HTB team===\n====Chick Hicks====\n[[File:pit maneuver.svg|thumb|120px|right|The [[PIT maneuver]], long banned in racing, shown in use to end a police chase]]\n'''Chick Hicks''' (voiced by [[Michael Keaton]] in [[Cars (film)|Cars]], [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] in [[Cars 3]]) serves as Lightning McQueen's primary rival in the first film. He is \"a generic Pixar design, 'a stock 1980s American car'\" according to Pixar publicity coordinator Amanda Sorena,<ref name=\"MSNinsidescoop\">{{cite web|title=New movie rekindles love affair with cars |author=Ann Job |publisher=The Star-Ledger |date=May 7, 2006 |url=http://autos.ca.msn.com/editors-picks/article.aspx?cp-documentid=18737087 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615114304/http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4024001 |archivedate = June 15, 2006}}</ref> and strongly resembles a [[GM G platform (1969)|GM G-body]] with features from both the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Fourth Generation|Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] and the [[Buick Grand National]]. As the real-life [[General Motors]] wanted nothing to do with the character by rejecting an initial Pixar proposal to cast a [[Chevrolet]] stock car as the movie's villain, Chick is effectively an orphan.<ref name=\"MSNinsidescoop\"/> He has spent his entire career trailing Strip \"The King\" Weathers, and is bitter about this fact. One of his most notable quotes in the movie is \u201cKachigga\u201d which he uses as his version of Lightning McQueen's quote \u201cKachow\u201d. His racing sponsor is Hostile Takeover Bank ('''HTB''' for short).\n\nHis pit crew generally mock Guido as compared to them he is very small, however they are surprised when Guido shows off his extremely quick tyre changing capabilities. Hicks' racing number is 86, a reference to 1986, the year Pixar Animation Studios was founded; [[86 (term)|86 itself]] is also a [[slang]] term for destroying or getting rid of something. Since 86 is twice the number 43 (King's number), it could also be an allusion to his entire career in relation to King.\n\nHicks is extremely determined to win to the point that often he turns to [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] to do so. Hicks cheats his way through all of his races by [[Bump and run (auto racing)|ramming other cars]] or sideswiping them via the [[PIT maneuver]] in an attempt to cause [[The Big One (NASCAR)|racing incidents]] for his own benefit. He despises and mocks McQueen, adopting the nickname '''Thunder''' which McQueen previously used as a put-down (McQueen: \"Because thunder always comes after 'lightning'\"). Hicks is also equally antagonistic towards The King, having come 2nd or 3rd place to The King his entire career. While McQueen is presumed missing, Hicks tries to take away McQueen's fans and increase his fame.\n\nDuring the final lap of the tiebreaker race, Hicks (refusing to come in behind Strip Weathers again) PITs The King, sending him flying off the race track and into a rollover wreck on the in-field. He expects a huge ovation after McQueen deliberately gives up the Piston Cup in order to help Weathers, but nobody cheers Hicks on once he wins because they're fed up with his dirty tricks. Shortly afterwards, as Hicks gets on stage to claim his trophy and celebrate his victory, an angered crowd and media snub Hicks' victory by branding him a cheater. He is then pelted with discarded tires and booed off the stage with his trophy in humiliation. The immediate backlash is similar to backlash against [[Rusty Wallace]] after he spun out [[Darrell Waltrip]] in Turn 4 during Segment 3, Lap 9 of the [[NASCAR lore#Controversial races|Sprint All-Star Race V]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], sending Waltrip spinning into the grass. In the film, a lucrative corporate sponsorship is at stake. Hicks and McQueen both share the dream of being the new face of Dinoco Oil, a firm long represented by retiring champion #43 \"The King\". They race on the assumption that winning the championship cup will land them the big sponsor, however, Dinoco owner Tex offers the sponsorship to McQueen, stating that there's more to racing than winning.\n\nHe returns in ''[[Cars 3]]'', where he now hosts his own talk show, ''Chick's Picks''. He constantly boasts about his previous Piston Cup championship and cracks jokes at McQueen's expense as Jackson Storm takes over the sport. He also interviews him after he wins one of the races.\nThe film's co-writer [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] voices Chick in this film as Keaton was filming ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''. Due to his voice actor change, his voice seems to be identical to other characters Bob Peterson voiced such as Mr. Ray from ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and its [[Finding Dory|sequel]].\n\nChick returns in the ''[[Cars (video game)|Cars]]'' video game, which is written by Pixar and considered a continuation to the story started in the movie, once again as McQueen's rival and the main antagonist. In the game, he is less rude than he was in the movie. He is first seen spying on Lightning's practice sessions with Doc Hudson. In Palm Mile Speedway, he ineffectively taunts Lightning before the first race of the season until Doc warns him off, then falls in with a gang of New York-based greaser cars in Carburetor County to challenge McQueen. The DRH gang jumps Mack on the interstate to steal McQueen's racing gear, but finger Chick as the one who hired them when caught by the Sheriff. In the ''[[Cars Race-O-Rama]]'' video game, he seeks revenge by attempting to close down McQueen's racing academy to start his own in Radiator Springs, although he gets defeated at the end. His catchphrase is \"Ka-Chick-Ah!\", a blatant rip-off of McQueen's catchphrase \"KA-CHOW!\". {{Clarify|date=October 2019}}\n\nDespite the fact he did not appear in ''[[Cars 2]]'', he does show up in the film's [[Cars 2 (video game)|video game]] as a downloadable character for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] editions. He also appears in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]''.\n\nIn the [[Rioplatense Spanish]] version of ''Cars'', Hicks is voiced by Marcos di Palma, a racecar driver also known for his brash attitude.\n\nIn the Ukrainian dub of ''Cars'', Hicks is voiced by [[Komu Vnyz]] frontman Andrei Sereda.\n\nBesides him, there is a similar character named Ripslinger in the 2013 ''Cars'' spin-off movie ''[[Planes (film)|Planes]]'' and its 2014 sequel, produced by DisneyToon Studios.\n\n===IGNTR team===\n====Jackson Storm====\nJackson Storm, an arrogant blue-and-black 2017 custom built \"next generation\" Piston Cup racer, is one of the newer rookies that comes into the racing sport, and the main racing rival of Lightning McQueen in the third installment in the franchise. He set records and won many races, including the final race in Los Angeles and presumably achieved the goal of winning the Piston Cup in his rookie year, which McQueen almost did in the first film. Whenever someone intimidates him, he goes back to insult them and make them lose their focus so he can take back the lead.\n\nAt the Florida 500, he is overtaken by McQueen's former trainer Cruz Ramirez. He attempts to make her lose focus by telling her that she doesn't belong on a track. Cruz, however, regains her confidence and drives up next to  Storm, who rammed her into a wall but Cruz flips over him and lands, in exactly the same fashion as Doc Hudson was shown to do in an earlier scene.\n\nHe returns in ''Cars 3: Driven to Win'', as both the main antagonist and a playable character.\n\nJackson Storm is voiced by [[Armie Hammer]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|title=Sneak peek: 'Cars 3' zooms ahead with new character Cruz Ramirez|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/05/30/sneak-peek-exclusive-cars-3-new-character-cruz-ramirez/84981778/|accessdate=July 23, 2016|work=USA Today|date=May 30, 2016}}</ref> In the game, he is voiced by AJ Hamilton. He is based on the Peugeot Onyx Concept.\n\n====Ray Reverham====\nRay Reverham is Jackson Storm's crew chief. He is always supportive of Storm's performance, and when Cruz attempts to win, he reminds Jackson at any opportunity he can.  He is voiced by the real-life [[Ray Evernham]].\n\n==Radiator Springs==\nThese characters live in Radiator Springs with Lightning McQueen, his trainer Cruz Ramirez and their hauler, Mack.\n\n===Tow Mater===\n{{Main|Mater (Cars)}}\n[[File:G-Mater2.jpg|thumb|right]]\n'''Mater''' is a rusty but extremely smart [[tow truck]] and McQueen's best friend, and Holley Shiftwell's boyfriend. He is voiced by [[Larry the Cable Guy]]. He's the main character in ''Cars 2'' and a major character in the other films.\n\n===Sally Carrera===\n{{main|Sally Carrera}}\n'''Sally Carrera''' is the town's attorney and McQueen's girlfriend. She is voiced by [[Bonnie Hunt]], and she is a [[Porsche 996|Porsche 911]]. [[Image:Cars movie's car.jpg|thumb|[[Sally Carrera|Sally]] as Eddie Paul custom vehicle for [[Cars (film)|Cars]] promotional tour]]\n\n===Doc Hudson===\n{{main|Doc Hudson}}\n[[File:Hudson Hornet, 1951 - Flickr - granada turnier.jpg|thumb|right|1951 Hudson Hornet similar to Doc Hudson]]\n'''Doc Hudson''' is the town's medical doctor, a local judge, and Lightning McQueen's mentor, voiced by actor [[Paul Newman]] in the first film and its [[Cars (video game)|video game]] and [[Corey Burton]] in all other related media. He is based on the Hudson Hornet. He did not appear in [[Cars 2|the second film]], as it is implied that Doc died, and Newman died in September 2008 from lung cancer.\n\nHe won three consecutive Piston Cups in 1951, 1952, and 1953, with Smokey as his crew chief, corresponding to the first three of the real-life Hornet's production years.\n\n===Sheriff===\nThe '''Sheriff''' (voiced by Route 66 historian and author [[Michael Wallis]]) is a 1949 [[Mercury Eight]] Police Cruiser [[police car]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=13}}</ref> bearing Carburetor County license plate '''001'''. Sheriff is painted in the classic law enforcement black and white with a single red light dome, two [[siren (noisemaker)|sirens]], and [[curb feeler]]s. Sheriff was the first resident of Radiator Springs to appear in the original film and the first to meet [[Lightning McQueen]] during a police chase when McQueen was speeding through the town, attempting to locate [[#Mack|Mack]]. Upon catching McQueen, who had become ensnared in wires and fencing, Sheriff paraphrases a line used by actor Joe Higgins, who played a sheriff in early 1970s [[Dodge]] commercials, as \"Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.\".<ref>Joe Higgins (as a sheriff), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2UvBjNh58 1970 Dodge Challenger advertisement], uses the line \"you're in a lot of trouble, boy\".</ref>\n\nSheriff was known to distrust McQueen; at one point when Sally gives McQueen some gasoline, Sheriff notices McQueen smiling at the road as if he is planning to escape. In reply Sheriff with a glare turns on his [[Teardrop light|gumball]] in case. Lightning chooses to accompany Sally, rather than making an escape attempt, resulting in Sheriff switching off his emergency lighting. This marks the beginning of trust in Lightning by Sheriff. He later befriends Lightning McQueen, offering him a police escort to California and even giving a few sniffles when he thought Lightning had left after finishing fixing the road (though he denied it, claiming he was glad Lightning was gone), and joins his [[pit crew]] for the championship race. In the end credits, Sheriff arrests the Road Hazards (the same ones who separated McQueen from Mack) caught racing illegally (via speeding) to Radiator Springs and have them impounded. As punishment for their crimes, he forces them to repave the roads with Bessie.\n\nSheriff reappears in ''Cars 2'', seeing Lightning and his race crew off to the World Grand Prix. When Mater goes missing, Ramone mentions that Sheriff has [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] scouring London for Mater. During the climax of the film, Sheriff arrives with the other Radiator Springs residents as new members of McQueen's pit crew in England, and is informed by Mater of the Lemons cars' plot to kill McQueen in order to turn all vehicles in the world against [[alternate energy]] and rely on gasoline for profit. Sheriff then has Red the Firetruck squirt water on the Lemon cars during the final battle, and arrests most of the defeated ones with help from Sarge. Then the next day Sheriff cheers Mater on when he is knighted for foiling the evil plot led by surprisingly, the race and Allinol inventor Sir Miles Axlerod.\n\n===Luigi===\n[[File:1970 Fiat 500 L -- 2011 DC 1.jpg|thumb|[[Fiat 500]]]]\n'''Luigi''' (voiced by [[Tony Shalhoub]], Michael Shalhoub in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'') is a 1959 [[Fiat 500]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=12}}</ref> He is a [[Scuderia Ferrari]] fan, and has followed racing his entire life.

His assistant is an Italian [[forklift truck]] named [[#Guido|Guido]].\n\nInside his shop are many framed pictures of [[World Sportscar Championship]] [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] Ferraris from various points in history. At first, Luigi and Guido do not respect [[Lightning McQueen]] when he comes to [[Radiator Springs]] (owing to the substantial havoc that he inflicted upon the town when he first arrived), because he is not a Ferrari (\"Luigi follow only the Ferraris\"), but later on they learn to show courtesy to McQueen, fitting him with [[whitewall tires]], since Luigi is a fan of white tires (having a pair himself). During the final race, Luigi and Guido work as part of Lightning's pit crew, and Guido sets the Piston Cup record in changing tires, taking only 4 seconds to change all the tires, sending the other pit crew into shock. He later congratulates McQueen when he helps The King finish his last race. <span id=\"Maseratis\">After the race, a group of Italian sports cars \u2013 a Ferrari F430 (voiced by [[Michael Schumacher]]) and two [[Maserati Quattroporte]]s \u2013 arrive at his shop, explaining that \"Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires\" and requesting \"three or four sets each\".</span> The presence of a celebrity Ferrari in their store causes both Luigi and Guido to faint from shock and happiness.\n\nFor the Italian version of the film, Luigi was voiced by comedian Marco Della Noce; one of Della Noce's most popular characters was \"Oriano Ferrari\", a parody character meant to represent the leader of Ferrari's pit stop crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntmanagement.it/marco_della_noce.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216082952/http://www.ntmanagement.it/marco_della_noce.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 December 2004|title=Marco Della Noce|date=16 December 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Cars 2'', Luigi is a part of Lightning's pit crew, in charge of the racer's tires. In Japan, he is naturally overjoyed to see so many Ferraris at a party prior to the first race of the World Grand Prix. He also hesitantly begins to explain to Mater what a rendezvous is, but he and Guido do not believe Mater when he believes he has a date (\"Guido don't believe you!\" \"Guido still don't believe you!\") Luigi and Guido are overjoyed to be back in their home of Italy, and rejoin their large group of family and friends. A little more is discussed of Luigi's past with Guido: Luigi's Uncle Topolino mentions that Luigi and Guido often fought when they worked for him (over things like which Ferrari was the best, and which one of them looked more like a Ferrari, etc.) but they always made up after their fights. Luigi joins his friends in a m\u00eal\u00e9e against Professor Z\u00fcndapp's Lemons at the film's climax, and finally believes Mater's claims of a girlfriend when Holley Shiftwell confirms the fact in person at Radiator Springs.\n\n===Guido===\n'''Guido''' (voiced by [[Guido Quaroni]]) is a [[forklift truck]], who works at Luigi's Casa Della Tires, and is Luigi's best friend. The only language Guido can speak and understand fluently is Italian, though he appears to understand English, and even speaks a few phrases, including \"Pit stop\" but pronounced \"Peet stop!\". His dream is to perform a [[pit stop]] for a real racecar. Near the end of the movie, as a member of Lightning's new pit crew, he performs the fastest pit stop in Piston Cup history, speed-changing all four tires in only 4 seconds, shocking Chick Hicks' pit crew who had earlier made fun of him, and causing their moustaches/grills to fall off in the process.\n\nIn order to preserve the \"language barrier\" gags between Guido and the other characters in the Italian dub, his lines (and the other cars' lines in Italian) have been rendered with the [[Emiliano-Romagnolo]] accent spoken in the town of [[Modena]], Italy, home of the [[Ferrari]] car manufacturer and racing team. [[Alex Zanardi]], an Italian race driver who is a native of Bologna, the largest city in the Emilia-Romagna region (and thus presumably familiar with that dialect), voiced Guido for the Italian version. Coincidentally, or as a pun by the authors, the name \"Guido\" is a perfect [[homonym]] for the Italian inflected verb meaning \"I drive\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn ''Cars 2'', Guido serves the same purpose he served in the first film's climax in Lightning's pit crew throughout the film. He also removed all tires from some of the Lemons when the malicious cars surrounded Lightning and Mater, but is unable to remove the bomb from Mater's nose (engine). Guido does not believe Mater when he says he has a date (\"Non ci credo\"), but has a jaw-dropping moment when he sees that Mater was telling the truth about his new girlfriend Holley Shiftwell (Guido believe you now! - Luigi).\n\n===Ramone===\n\n'''Ramone''' (voiced by [[Cheech Marin]]) is a [[Chevrolet Impala]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=11}}</ref> [[Lowrider]] that owns the Ramone's House of Body Art store, where he paints himself and other cars, including [[Lightning McQueen]] later in the film. His garage employs the distinctive architecture of the Tower Station ([[U-Drop Inn]]) in [[Shamrock, Texas]]. His license plate reads \"L0WNSL0\", which is a reference to his catchphrase, \"Low and slow\". He is married to [[Flo (Cars)#Flo|Flo]], whose restaurant is next door to his store. Ramone is usually depicted as purple with a yellow and orange flame job, but throughout the film, he changes his paint job every morning (green, yellow, red in the first film, blue in ''Mater and the Ghostlight'') to keep his skills sharp, owing to a lack of customers. This situation changes after Radiator Springs becomes vibrant again. He also likes to drive slow and very low on the road, and is overjoyed when the road is asphalted, enjoying the smoothness of the road. However, he does seem to have a childish side in his personality, as in a scene after Lightning McQueen has destroyed the town's main road, Sally asked Flo what she had in her store, the latter responding \"I have gas, lots of gas!\", and Ramone and Mater burst out laughing.\n\nIn a deleted scene that told the story of how Ramone and Flo fell in love, the only customer Ramone has refused to paint was his future wife Flo. When she asked him, \"Whassamatta, you too good to paint me?\", he promptly and smoothly replies, \"No baby, you too good for me to paint,\" and saying that he could not touch a classic like Flo, which made her heart melt. The story took place in Radiator Springs in 1974. This part was shown in the info on Ramone in Cars Mater-National Championship.\n\nRamone reappears in ''Cars 2'', making a few appearances in the Radiator Springs scenes, though he joins everyone else to help McQueen in England. In the melee scene, Ramone disables one of the lemon cars by spray painting into the car's eyes, blinding him.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Planes (film)|Planes]]'', when Dusty cuts off the radios power when El Chupacabra was singing the song \"Love Machine\", he says Ramone's catchphrase \"Low and slow\" which causes Chupacabra to sing a romance version of the song.\n\n===Flo===\n'''Flo''' (based on Fran Hauser of Adrian's [[Midpoint Caf\u00e9]] and voiced by [[Jenifer Lewis]]) is the owner of Radiator Springs only gas diner, \"Flo's V-8 Caf\u00e9\", and is married to [[Ramone (Cars)|Ramone]], the town's body artist. Her license plate reads \"SHOGRL\", the same as the license plates applied to many [[Motorama]] show cars and an abbreviation of the term \"[[showgirl]]\". During the cruising scene, \"Motorama 1957\" appears above her license plate. According to a deleted scene, she is a Motorama showcar who came to Radiator Springs during a national tour (although there wasn't a Motorama show held in 1957). Ramone custom painted her crew all except her. She asks \"What's the matter, you too good to paint me?\", and Ramone said \"No baby, you're too good for me to paint.\". They immediately fell in love. She appears to be inspired by two early- to mid-1950s show cars: the 1951 [[Buick XP-300]] (side trim), and the 1956/57 Chrysler Dart (cockpit, deck lid, and tailfins).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweteran.gower.pl/concept_timeline.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040830230627/http://www.autoweteran.gower.pl/concept_timeline.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 30, 2004|title=Concept Cars \u2013 Timeline 1938 \u2013 1981|access-date=October 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFlo reappears in ''Cars 2'' to help Lightning and Mater battle the Lemons (who were sent to kill Lightning by Miles Axlerod).

He owns an [[biofuel|organic fuel]] shop (Fillmore's Organic Fuel) which features several flavors, and believes gasoline companies are lying to the public. He is implied to smoke [[marijuana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thekindland.com/12-pixar-characters-that-were-most-definitely-high-985|title=12 Pixar Characters That Were Most Definitely High - KINDLAND|author=|date=|work=TheKindland.com|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> as it is indirectly referenced when he speaks of his organic fuel use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stonerdays.com/stoner-references-in-kids-movies/|title=Stoner References In Kids Movies - Stoner Blog|author=|date=17 January 2014|work=StonerDays.com|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> In the morning, when next-door neighbor Sarge plays [[Reveille]] and raises the [[Flag of the United States]], Fillmore interrupts Sarge's bugle reveille with [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s rendition of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\". This is much to Sarge's irritation, as he yells at Fillmore:\n\n: '''Sarge''': \"Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!\"\n: '''Fillmore''': \"Respect the classics, man! It's Hendrix!\"\n\nDespite this, he is friends with Sarge, and the two can be seen chatting throughout the film.\n\nHe has a sticker on his rear that says \"I brake for Jackalopes\". The [[jackalope]] is a mythical creature which features in the theatrical short ''[[Boundin']]'', shown with ''[[The Incredibles]]''. Another sticker says \"Save [[Traditional animation|2D Animation]]\". He has appeared in every Disney ''Cars'' game so far. As voiced by George Carlin, Fillmore's voice is similar to \"Al Sleet, the hippy-dippy weatherman\", a part of Carlin's comedy routine in the 1970s.\n\nFillmore reappears in ''Cars 2'', joining McQueen's pit crew for the World Grand Prix. Fillmore was re-cast due to George Carlin's death, and was voiced by Lloyd Sherr. Fillmore initially supports Allinol as it ''supposedly'' does not use oil, even convincing McQueen it is safe after several accidents involving other cars using Allinol. However, for the final race, Sarge replaces McQueen's Allinol with Fillmore's organic fuel, which is what prevents Lightning from being killed in the race.\n\nFillmore was originally going to be named '''Waldmire''', after a [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] resident, but Waldmire, a vegan, didn't want his name to be used, because Fillmore toys would be featured in [[Happy Meal]]s at [[McDonald's]].\n\n===Sarge===\n\n[[File:Covered Willy's jeep Wings Over Wine Country 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Willys MB]] Jeep]]\n'''Sarge''' (voiced by [[Paul Dooley]]) is a 1941 [[Willys Jeep]]. A veteran with a military green paint job and a slightly stylized [[Command Sergeant Major|Sergeant Major]] (E-9) insignia on his sides, he appears to be a [[World War II]] era [[Willys MB]]. His license plate reads \"41WW2\", which indicates the date the Willys MB entered the service of the U.S. Army (1941 World War II). He runs a surplus store, named \"'''Sarge's Surplus Hut'''\", next door to Fillmore and acts as part of Lightning's pit crew, gassing him up during the race. Near the end of the film,  he operates a [[Recruit training|boot camp]] to train SUVs and 4\u00d74s (some of whom had never been off-road) in rugged and dirt terrain. His recruits include T.J. Hummer, Murphy, Frank \"Pinky\" Pinkerton, and Charlie Cargo.\n\nSarge reappears in ''Cars 2'', using assistance from the British Army to aid in the melee against the Lemons. Prior to the final leg of the World Grand Prix, he secretly switches McQueen's supply of Allinol (the alternative fuel developed by race founder Sir Miles Axlerod) for Fillmore's organic fuel blend. Like Fillmore he became suspicious of the fuel after the incidents in Japan and Italy. The change saves McQueen from being killed as part of Axlerod's plot to discredit alternative fuels.\n\n===Lizzie===\n[[File:1919 Ford Model T Highboy Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1919 Model T Coupe]]\n'''Lizzie''' (voiced by [[Katherine Helmond]]), a 1923 [[Ford Model T]] Coupe,<ref name=MeeetheCarspg15>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=15}}</ref> is the widow of Radiator Springs' founder, Stanley, and the elderly owner of a roadside souvenir and accessory shop (Radiator Springs Curios, which uses the \"HERE IT IS\" slogan and signage of the [[Jack Rabbit Trading Post]] on US&nbsp;66). Her license plate, \"MT23\", is a reference to her model and year. Her name is derived from [[Tin Lizzie]], one of the Model T's popular nicknames. She appears to have gone somewhat [[senile]], and has a crush on [[Lightning McQueen]]. When she is shown teasing Luigi and Guido in the film, stating \"The new road makes your place look like a dump.\", Luigi angrily says that she is a crazy, devilish old woman but despairs at the truth of her words and sets to work repainting the Casa della Tires garage to its original appearance. She appears extremely motherly.\n\nLizzie reappears in ''Cars 2'' with a minor role. In the beginning she greets Lightning when he returns, but didn't even know he was gone all this time. She isn't present at the airport but is seen in the end talking to Mack about how crazy Holley Shiftwell is for keeping a dent. She also appears in ''Cars 3'', which would be Helmond's final role before her death.\n\nShe appears in the ''[[Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales]]'' episode \"Time Travel Mater\", where her and Stanley's backstories are revealed.\n\nLizzie was originally going to be named '''Henry F. Ord''', after [[Henry Ford]]. She also, at one point, originally resembled a [[Ford Model T]] \"Center Door\" Sedan{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\n===Red===\n'''Red''' (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]] and later [[Jerome Ranft]]) is a [[Pumper|closed-cab pumper]] bearing Carburetor County license plate \"002\". He is shy and emotional which explains why he cries and drives away at the same time. He spends most of his time gardening and washing things, such as the statue of Stanley in front of his [[fire station]]. It was stated by Mater that Red \"hated\" [[Lightning McQueen]], because he accidentally killed his flowers. Later, it is clear that Red had forgiven Lightning McQueen and warmed up to him, especially when he burst into tears and fled when he mistakenly thought that Lightning McQueen left without saying goodbye. While he gasped and sobbed in the film, he didn't really talk. In the first film, he seems to know about tractor-tipping as he used his horn to try and stop a stampede of tractors out of trying to protect his flowers. He formerly dislikes Lightning McQueen and he also dislikes crying and feeling upset and people vandalizing his flowers.\n\nRed reappears in ''Cars 2'' as a non-speaking character. He only makes a small appearance at the airport crying as he sees Team McQueen taking off for Tokyo, also in the battle against the Lemons, where he arrives just in time to blast some of the [[Lemon (automobile)|Lemons]] away with his fire hose.\n\nRed appears in the ''Tales from Radiator Springs'' short film: ''Bugged''. He was voiced by [[Jerome Ranft]], who voiced Gamma in ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''.\n\n===Stanley===\n[[File:1912 Staney steam car.JPG|right|thumb|Stanley steam car]]\n'''Stanley''' (voiced by [[John Michael Higgins]]) is Lizzie's late husband who was the founder of Radiator Springs.<ref name=\"MeeetheCarspg15\" /> Stanley was probably based on and named after a [[Stanley Steamer]], a steam-powered automobile. Lizzie, reminiscing, describes him as having been \"an awfully persistent li'l bugger for a two-cylinder\". A statue of Stanley stands outside the town hall, and although it was broken off its pedestal and dragged through the streets on a wire by Lightning McQueen, it was fortunately undamaged, and another mishap placed the statue right back where it was. Although dead, Stanley continues to exert an influence on the town, particularly over Lizzie, who often talks to his statue in memory of him.\n\nStanley's statue reappears in ''Cars 2'' where he was shown to be less old and broken, possibly renovated.\n\nIn the ''[[Cars Toon]]'', Time Travel Mater, Stanley appears alive for the first time. In the [[Cars Land]] theme park, signage commemorating \"The Original Radiator Spring\"  claims that \"On this site in the summer of 1909 Stanley, exploring out west, overheated as his radiator water boiled away. Coasting into the shade, he happened upon a life-saving natural spring. Upon this most fortunate discovery, Stanley founded the first settlement in Ornament Valley, and in honor of the oasis, christened it Radiator Springs.\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Cars Land Test Drive: Radiator Springs Racers|author=Adrienne Vincent-Phoenix|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=June 2012|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/alliance/destinations/mouseplanet/post/2012/06/Cars-Land-Test-Drive-Radiator-Springs-Racers/716686/1 }}</ref>  Stanley's Oasis is listed as the first local business in Radiator Springs, although [[steam locomotive condensing apparatus|condensers]] only appeared on Stanley steam cars beginning in 1915. The revised Timeline of the toon shows Lightning and Mater travelling back to 1909, meeting Stanley, and pointing Lizzie out to Stanley, prompting him to approach her to make a sale. A quick stop on their way back to the present allows Lightning and Mater to witness Stanley and Lizzie's wedding.\n\nStanley makes a silent cameo in the [[Pixar]] short, ''[[Boundin']]''.\n\n===Bessie===\n'''Bessie''' is a non-anthropomorphic [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]]-laying machine that is used to fix roads in Radiator Springs.<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=16}}</ref> <span id=\"Big Al\"> She was often used by one of the citizens of Radiator Springs, referenced as \"Big Al\", before the citizen in question left fifteen years ago.</span> When [[Lightning McQueen]] accidentally destroys the road by dragging the statue of Stanley, Radiator Springs traffic court judge [[Doc Hudson]] sentences him to fix the road with her. While Doc insists \"this here is Bessie, finest road-paving machine ever built\", a construction [[trade publication]]'s August 2006 editorial describes her as a \"tar-spewing hybrid paver/compactor\" and \"an ecological disaster\" as sometimes Bessie boils over and splats tar onto the car(s) pulling her.\n\n{{quote|\"If she doesn\u2019t hit you with a stray spray of hot asphalt burbling in two tanks heated by open flames, the fumes emanating from every orifice would prompt an asthma attack. Aggregate jostles loose in a top hopper, and her black-smoke-extruding exhaust pipes are coated with the remains of decades of paving seasons...

Bessie is a non-living vehicle; she cannot move by herself and she has no voice actress in the film.\n\n===Frank and the Tractors===\n'''Frank''' is a generic red [[combine harvester]] that resembles a [[bull]], and the guardian of the tractors (which \"moo\" as [[cow]]s). After [[Lightning McQueen]]'s first encounter with Frank during a night of [[cow tipping|tractor tipping]] with Mater, Lightning starts dreaming that he, The King, and [[Chick Hicks]] (the last of whom does not survive, getting chopped up while The King and McQueen move out of the way) are beaten by Frank in the tie-breaker race. Frank wins the Piston Cup and gets kissed while Lightning is surrounded by the tractors who are licking him. Later, the tractors end up stampeding into Radiator Springs following a mishap with them on Mater's part. He is last seen with the tractors at the drive-in theatre scenes behind the fence far behind Mack, watching the movie as well. He is also seen in the short ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'' when Mater races past him, waking him up, but does not chase him. Frank seems to be the soothing and kind master of the tractors and the leader of the herd and also hates trespassers who step into his farm and bother the tractors. The tractors also appear in ''Planes'' and are shown to be sacred in India (India's residents believing they will be reincarnated as tractors).\n\n===Former residents===\nA flashback in the original film devotes a little over a minute to show Radiator Springs in a pre-[[freeway]] era when all cross-country traffic would by necessity pass through the town's busy main street. Various old cars appear very briefly in this segment with no names and no dialogue, only to vanish when the town is bypassed.\n\n<span id=\"Miles Malone\">'''Miles \"Meattruck\" Malone''' was a red-cab delivery truck serving the Ornament Valley region;</span> <span id=\"Dustin Mellows\">'''Dustin Mellows''', a yellow delivery truck, bore the logo and initials TS for Trophy Sparkplugs.<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=17|quote=Dustin Mellows was a delivery truck for Trophy Sparkplugs in the 1950s.}}</ref></span> Local cars included <span id=\"Mildred Bylane\">'''Mildred Bylane''' (a light-brown car leaving Luigi's),</span> <span id=\"Percy Hanbrakes\">'''Percy Hanbrakes''' (a brown car towed to Flo's by Mater),</span> <span id=\"Edwin Kranks\"></span>'''Edwin Kranks''' (a two-tone apple-green car), <span id=\"Hank Murphy\">'''Hank \"Halloween\" Murphy''' (a two-tone orange \"Rumbler\" with tail fins, named as a parody of the [[Nash Motors|Nash]]/[[AMC (automobile)|AMC]] [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]])</span> and <span id=\"Milton Calypeer\">'''Milton Calypeer''' (a blue car on Route 66 at the town limits).</span>\n\n===Bugs===\nIn Radiator Springs and the surrounding desert area of Carburetor County, insects are depicted as small, winged [[VW Bug]]s (or beetles). The bugs appear at least three times in the original film, hovering around [[fluorescent lighting]] at [[Midpoint Caf\u00e9|Flo's V8 Caf\u00e9]] on Lightning's initial arrival, swarming around the windows and the one missing fuel pump at the [[Wagon Wheel Motel|Wheel Well Motel]] before its historic restoration, and in the [[desert]] where Minny and Van are still quite clearly lost at the end of the film, after the closing credits. (One bumps on the camera lens, leaving a mark on it, and flies off eventually) One also appears in ''[[Mater and the Ghostlight]]'', which Mater had confused for the Ghostlight (despite the yellow headlights). The bugs are alive but do not speak (Vroomaroundus Bugus merely buzz with sped-up sounds of an air-cooled VW engine<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Cars\" Gets it Right |author=Damon Bell |publisher=Consumer Guide |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/cars-gets-it-right-cga.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513080833/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/cars-gets-it-right-cga.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-05-13 }}</ref>) so they are not named individually and they have no voice actors.\n\n==Piston Cup announcer and analyst==\n===Bob Cutlass===\n'''Bob Cutlass''' is an announcer for the Piston Cup races and friend of Darrell Cartrip.

Chuki has a very small appearance in Cars as she is shown as one of the news reporters who appear in the multi-clip footage of various TV news channels reporting [[Lightning McQueen|McQueen's]] sudden disappearance while being transported to the Los Angeles International Speedway for his tie-breaker final of the Piston Cup. In ''[[Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales]]'' episode \"Tokyo Mater\", Chuki is seen presenting a news broadcast on one of the large TVs installed in Tokyo. In ''Cars 2'', she is seen in the neon advertisement glowboards in Tokyo.\n\nChuki is based on hatchbacks designed according to Japan's [[Kei car]] specifications and is voiced by Sonoko Konishi, a senior Pixar animator who was also part of the animation team that won ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' (another [[Pixar]] film) an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].<ref>{{cite web|date=May 31, 2011|last=Rizvi|first=Samad.|title=Pixar Employee Sonoko Konishi Provides Cars 2 Voice|url=http://pixartimes.com/2011/05/31/pixar-employee-sonoko-konishi-provides-cars-2-voice|publisher=Pixar Times|access-date=}}</ref> Konishi is credited in the ''Cars 2'' cast for voicing the Japanese toilet assistant that appears in the computerized automated car toilets in Tokyo.\n\n===Jay Limo===\n'''Jay Limo''', like his voice actor [[Jay Leno]], is the talk show host of ''The Jay Limo Show'', which includes the same famous \"brightly-hued skyscrapers\" city-landscape in the background. He resembles the latest generation of the [[Lincoln Town Car]], with an extended front bumper to emulate Leno's famous big chin. He remarks \"I don't know what's going to be harder to find; [[Lightning McQueen]] or a crew chief who'll work with him!\"\n\n===News anchors===\n<span id=\"Chuck Manifold\">'''Chuck Manifold''' (voiced by [[Teddy Newton]]), a blue and somewhat-boxy 1980s-style car, is an [[news anchor|anchor]] for Racing Sports Network (RSN) who appears briefly at the end of the last of multiple media reports of McQueen's disappearance with the one line \"They are all asking the same question: Where is McQueen?\"</span>\n\n<span id=\"Dan Sclarkenberg\">'''Dan Sclarkenberg''' (voiced by [[Dan Scanlon]]), a green car and one of two \"braking news\" desk anchors on MPH 55 NEWS, is one of the announcers of the \"McQueen Missing\" segments.</span>\n\n===News helicopters===\nA pair of helicopters with searchlights (as the first of a large group of reporters in Radiator Springs) are not listed in the film's credits but identified elsewhere in the franchise.

After McQueen's disappearance, the twins are devastated that McQueen apparently will not make it to the race. [[Chick Hicks]] then swoops in and consoles them, loading them up with his own merchandise and a free Hostile Takeover Bank-sponsored green paint job. Mia and Tia accept the offer, not because they are Chick's fans, but because green complements their eyes. They soon return to being McQueen's fans, turning against Hicks after he deliberately causes [[Strip \"The King\" Weathers]] to wreck in the tie-breaker race.\n\nMia and Tia eventually move to Radiator Springs and are visible briefly as [[carhop|waitresses]] at Flo's V8 Caf\u00e9 during the end credits. Their characters are based on sisters Mary Lou and Christina Mendez at the [[Midpoint Caf\u00e9]] in [[Adrian, Texas]], where the caf\u00e9's (now semi-retired) owner Fran Houser is the basis for \"Flo\".<ref name=\"ocregister-carsland\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/houser-358737-caf-route.html|date=June 13, 2012|title=Life changed at her caf\u00e9 when Pixar dropped in: Fran Houser said her Route 66 Midpoint Caf\u00e9 in Texas was a sleepy spot \u2013 until the \"Cars\" movie premi\u00e8red.|author=Eric Carpenter|publisher=Orange County Register}}</ref>\n\nThey also appear in the video game of ''Cars'' where they challenge Sally to a race to determine who gets a date with Lightning Mcqueen.\n\nIn a deleted scene on the ''Cars'' DVD, the twins were fans who distract Lightning during a brief stop at the Top Down Truck Stop, a venue with \"all [[convertible]] [[waitress]]es\", causing Mack to inadvertently leave without him. The implicit reference to [[toplessness]] is largely removed from the final script, which has Mack driving straight through and separates the characters on I-40. Mia and Tia appear in every episode of ''Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales'' except Time Travel Mater and make a cameo appearance near the end of ''Cars 2'' as spectators at the new Radiator Springs Grand Prix.\n\nThey don't appear in ''Cars 3'' for unknown reasons, as they were replaced by a little red car named Maddy McGear.\n\n===Albert Hinkey===\n'''Albert Hinkey''' (voiced by A.J. Riebli, III) is an [[RV]] who proclaims himself as Lightning's \"biggest\" fan (\"biggest\" being a pun because he is such a large vehicle).<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=51|quote=Albert Hinkley is...Lightning McQueen's biggest fan...}}</ref> He is seen in the background of races. He is first seen shouting encouraging words to McQueen as he makes it through the big wreck Chick Hicks caused. He is later seen in the tie-breaker race, cheering for McQueen and is shocked when he notices Doc Hudson. When McQueen chooses to forfeit the win and help Strip Weathers finish his last race, he is shown sobbing when he sees what happens. He is later seen in ''Cars 3'', where shouts encouraging words to McQueen once again. His topside is decorated with rows of Lightning/Rust-eze flags. Hinkey also has a loud horn, which he uses while saying \"Ka-Chow!\" (McQueen's catchphrase) and the loud noise is a nuisance to fellow spectators. The Character is an obvious reference to [[John Hinckley Jr.|John Hinckley]], the stalker and attempted assassin of President Ronald Reagan who attempted such crimes to profess his love for actress Jodi Foster as her biggest fan.\n\n<span id=\"Larry Camper\">His friend '''Larry Camper''', voiced by Larry Benton, exclaims \"Dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It's the Hudson Hornet!\" when Lightning's Radiator Springs pit team arrives for the tiebreaker race. This is a joke on the old '''Harold Lloyd''' punch line, \"step right up and call me speedy!,\" which originated (mostly) in his hit '''silent film''' called '''The Freshman''' Lloyd also made another film called '''Speedy''', which may or may not have been a reference, as it was made three years after '''The Freshman'''.</span>\n\n===Fred===\n'''Fred''' (voiced by [[Andrew Stanton]]) is a starstruck, very rusty old car resembling a [[Lada Riva|Lada 2107]]. Everybody knows his name because his license plate holder and license plate read \"Hello, my name is\" and \"FRED\", respectively. He is the prop for the recurring gag in the film; when McQueen says his name, he shouts \"He knows my name!\" twice and, in his excitement, his front bumper (which happens to be his lower jaw) falls off. Later, when he is unable to gain access to the tie-breaker race and [[Mario Andretti]] (who would be waved through the gate on sight as a celebrity) likewise reads his license plate, Fred says, \"Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now!\" He is seen in Radiator Springs at the end of the film with [[bumper sticker]]s for the last three towns ([[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]], [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]) in [[Route 66 (song)]]; when he stops, his front bumper falls off again. He also shows up in [[Mater National]] and [[Cars Race-O-Rama|Race-O-Rama]].\n\nFred is one of the many rusty old cars at the Rust-eze sponsor tent for McQueen's personal appearance; others (listed in the \"Car Finder\" game but not named in the movie's credits) include <span id=\"Jonathan Wrenchworths\">'''Jonathan Wrenchworths''' (the rusted green car in Rust-eze advertisements)</span> and <span id=\"Donna Pits\">'''Donna Pits''' (a rusted 1970s car standing beside Fred)</span>.\n\n===Additional fans===\nA group of five transport lorries watch the race at a truck stop; two are identified in the \"Car Finder\" game as <span id=\"Gil\">'''Gil''' (a green Peterbilt)</span> and <span id=\"Paul Valdez\">'''Paul Valdez''' (an orange transport with a white stripe and 'PV' on his cap).</span>\n\nA group of RV's watching the tiebreaker at the speedway include <span id=\"Barry Diesel\">'''Barry Diesel''' (a thirsty RV with a blue Dinoco visor cap, sipping two kegs of Dinoco Light),</span> <span id=\"Bud\">'''Bud''' (a white RV with a jackalope painted on his back),</span> <span id=\"Clayton Gentlebreeze\">'''Clayton Gentlebreeze''' (a white RV with green stripes)</span> and <span id=\"Syd VanDerKamper\">'''Syd VanDerKamper''' (a camper van).</span>\n\nThe \"more than two hundred thousand cars\" watching the tiebreaker race include <span id=\"Coriander Widetrack\">'''Coriander Widetrack''' (a  small purple car holding a model aeroplane),</span> <span id=\"Marty Brakeburst\">'''Marty Brakeburst''' (a grey runabout wearing a Piston Cup antenna ball),</span> <span id=\"Mathew McCrew\">'''Mathew \"True Blue\" McCrew''' (a blue car behind a fence with \"the King\" flag on his antenna),</span> <span id=\"Milo\">'''Milo''' (a boxy green car beside McCrew),</span> <span id=\"Polly Puddlejumper\">'''Polly Puddlejumper''' (a small blue car with a blue \"the King\" crown on her antenna),</span> <span id=\"Swift Alternetter\">'''Swift Alternetter''' (a green SUV surrounded by RV's),</span> <span id=\"Timothy Twostroke\">'''Timothy Twostroke''' (a dark-red car displaying the #95 lightning bolt on his visor and antenna)</span> and <span id=\"Wilmar Flattz\">'''Wilmar Flattz''' (a small light-purple car with \"lightning\" on his antenna and \"95\" on his visor).</span>\n\n===Maddy McGear===\nMaddy McGear (voiced by Madeleine McGraw) is Lightning McQueen's biggest fan in ''Cars 3''.\n\n==Other race cars==\n===\"Junior\" No. #8===\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr car2006.jpg|thumb|[[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]]'s  #8 Budweiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo during a pit stop at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]] in 2006]]\n'''Dale Earnhardt Jr.''', often referred to as \"Junior\" is a red stock car similar to the Gen 4 cars that the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series used prior to 2007. He is voiced by [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.|the race car driver of the same name]], and closely resembles the #8 [[Budweiser]] [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS]] that he drove from his Sprint Cup debut in 1999 until his departure to the team his maternal grandfather Robert Gee, Sr. started, [[Hendrick Motorsports]], in [[2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2008]]. The car's Budweiser stickers are replaced by [[Dale Earnhardt Inc.]] stickers; these stickers refer to the same change made in NASCAR games as well as toys in order to avoid alcohol advertising. Junior is seen during the first race (Dinoco 400) and is involved in the wreck caused by Chick Hicks. When McQueen goes missing, Junior tells the Competition Racing Sports Network \"I sure hope that Lightning is okay. I would hate to see anything bad happen to him!\". At the tie-breaker, Junior wishes [[#Strip \"The King\" Weathers|The King]] good luck in his last race, as \"you've been an inspiration to me\". Junior is last seen at the Radiator Springs racing museum with The King and his wife Lynda, amazed by Doc Hudson's many season winnings during the 1950s. Junior does not appear in the video game nor the third film, due to his sponsor not returning in both, likely because it has gone out of business.  (The real-life Earnhardt Jr., his sister Kelley Miller, and their uncles Robert Gee, Jr. and Jimmy Gee, [[JR Motorsports|currently operate a second-tier NASCAR team]].)\nA replica of the red livery, with the Hendrick #88 on a Gen 6 [[Holden Commodore (VF)|Holden Commodore]] with Hendrick's current [[Axalta Coating Systems]] sponsor decals, was used for Earnhardt's final race as a full-time Cup driver in 2017.\n\n===Mario Andretti No. #11===\n[[Mario Andretti]] voices his eponymous character, who is a former racecar that believes every day is a great day for racing. He is based on the 1967 [[Holman Moody]] [[Ford Fairlane (North American)|Ford Fairlane]] that Andretti drove to victory lane in the [[1967 Daytona 500]]. In the Spanish edition of the movie, Andretti is voiced by Spanish [[Formula One]] champion [[Fernando Alonso]].\n\n<span id=\"Patty\">A small green car seen beside Andretti at the entrance to pit lane is identified in the \"Car Finder\" game as '''Patty''', Mario's personal assistant. She does not have a speaking role in the film.</span>\n\nThe actual Ford Fairlane that Andretti drove was rebuilt as a [[Mercury Cyclone]] by Robert Gee ([[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]]'s maternal grandfather), driven in 1971 by German F1 and sportscar driver [[Rolf Stommelen]] for his only NASCAR start at [[Talladega Superspeedway]], then sold to Darrell Waltrip for use his five races in 1972 and the first half of the 1973 season. It later became a Sportsman racer for Waltrip, but was crashed in 1975 at the [[DRIVE4COPD 300|Permatex 300 Sportsman]] race (now [[Xfinity Series]] race). Abandoned by Gee, it stayed there until a few NASCAR mechanics restored the car in its 1972 configuration as a 1971 Mercury Cyclone (brown #95) in the mid-1990s for a celebration of the 25th anniversary of Waltrip's first Cup start. It is displayed at Waltrip's museum in Harrisburg, North Carolina, and part of an Andretti exhibit at the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 2013. (A replica of the car as it looked in 1966 was also part of it.)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stockcarracing.com/featurestories/scrp_0610_darrell_waltrip_car_collection/index.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113093407/http://www.stockcarracing.com/featurestories/scrp_0610_darrell_waltrip_car_collection/index.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2007-11-13 | title=Darrell Waltrip's Car Collection | work=Stock Car Racing Magazine | date=June 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Michael Schumacher===\n'''[[Michael Schumacher]]''' is a 2004 [[Ferrari F430]] sports car voiced by Schumacher himself. He is a Ferrari in reference to five of his seven [[Formula One]] championships which were achieved with [[Ferrari F1]]. He appears at Luigi's shop at the end of the movie after being told by Lightning McQueen that \"this is the best place in the world to buy tires\", and asks to order a few sets of tires for himself and a pair of [[Maserati]] [[Maserati Quattroporte|Quattroportes]] who accompany him. After Luigi faints from the excitement of having \"a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in his store\", Schumacher speaks to Guido in Italian, and Guido subsequently faints. The Italian phrase he speaks is, \"I hope that your friend recovers, I was told that you are fantastic.\" Because of licensing issues, in the Cars toyline, his name is called Ferrari F430 instead of his name himself.\n\n===Darrell Cartrip===\n\n'''Darrell Cartrip''', a 1977 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, is a Piston Cup announcer in the first and the third film. A former Piston Cup racer, his character is based on his voice actor, [[1989 Daytona 500]] winner and ''[[Fox NASCAR]]'' commentator [[Darrell Waltrip]]. An enthusiastic Cartrip uses Waltrip's catchphrase \"Boogity boogity boogity! Let's go racing, boys!\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Disney Pixar's The World of Cars: Meet the Cars|date=2008|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=978-142311925-8|pages=44|quote=That is, until he shouts his signature \"Boogity boogity boogity!

The real-life car's original number (DiGard's #88) and green-and-white [[Gatorade]] livery do not appear on the character (the livery's design is now owned by [[PepsiCo]]). The film's credits list Darrell Waltrip Motorsports (his licensing arm) as the \"#17 Car\" (known for his Hendrick Motorsports and own efforts in winning three of NASCAR's four majors); Waltrip's various NASCAR entries have included a #17 (three times\u2014two of those he owned, the other belonging to [[Hendrick Motorsports]]) and a #95 (the one he drove in his 1972 debut was at one time the real-life former Mario Andretti #11 from 1967 seen in the Cars franchise, is one such).\n\nThe most famous of the real-life 1977 DiGard Monte Carlos was the infamous \"Bertha\", displayed at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in [[Talladega, Alabama|Talladega]], known for a weight-reduction scheme (devised by [[Gary Nelson (NASCAR)|Gary Nelson]] and [[Buddy Parrott]]) where up to {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of buckshot is dropped on-track on parade laps to lighten the car. A subsequent NASCAR rule change to weigh cars after the race now prevents this type of ruse.

In the first film, they are lost and pass through Radiator Springs while trying to find their way back to [[Interstate 40]]. Van refuses to ask directions, claiming not to need them due to having a [[Global positioning system|GPS]]. Minny mentions that Van did the same when they were heading up to the \"Crazy Days\" (a parody of Derby Days<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shakopeederbydays.com|title=First Full Weekend in August|publisher=Shakopee Derby Days|access-date=May 29, 2010}}</ref>) in [[Shakopee, Minnesota|Shakopee]]. [[U.S. Route 66]], [[decommissioned highway|taken off the map]] in 1985, is conspicuously absent from stored maps in automotive aftermarket GPS units \u2014 an omission also noted by Harv, Lightning's agent, and a minor running joke in the film.\n\nBoth are equipped with [[car alarm]]s, which they arm after their encounter with Lightning McQueen when he begs them to call for help (they dismissed his plea as madness). After the final credits, Van and Minny are shown dirty and lost somewhere in the desert, having never asked for directions, with Van almost driven to [[insanity]]. Their names combine as a pun on \"[[minivan]]\". Van is a 2003 [[Ford Windstar]] and Minny appears to be a 1996 [[Dodge Caravan]]. Minny speaks with a pronounced Minnesota accent.\n\nVan and Minny reappear near the end of the second film. While Minny is mesmerized by Mater's spy story, Van does not believe one word of it until British agent Holley Shiftwell arrives to confirm it, which surprises Van, leaving him mesmerized by her and annoying Minny. In the final scene, when a rocket-propelled Mater rushes past Van, maps that Van was carrying are sent flying.\n\n===Delinquent Road Hazards===\nThe '''Delinquent Road Hazards''' are a group of four modified [[car tuning|tuner cars]] that intentionally cause trouble on the highway: '''Boost''' (Purple Neon/Carbon fibre covered 1994 [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]]), '''DJ''' (Blue 2004 [[Scion xB]]), '''Wingo''' (Green and purple 2000 [[Nissan Silvia]]) and '''Snot Rod''' (Orange 1971 [[Plymouth Barracuda]]). They get their group name from what Sheriff called McQueen when he ordered Mater to tow him to traffic court. They catch Mack nodding off to sleep on the way to California and amuse themselves by nudging him onto the [[rumble strip]]s along the shoulder. The resulting vibration causes Mack's trailer door to open and a sleeping McQueen to roll out of the trailer. When the chronically sniffly Snot Rod sneezes, Mack is startled awake, and accelerates away, leaving the still-sleeping McQueen behind near Radiator Springs. During the end credits, the Hazards are caught speeding on the outskirts of Radiator Springs by the Sheriff, who gives chase and places them in the impound lot. Like McQueen before them, they are sentenced to messy roadwork towing Bessie.\n\nIn the Italian dub, three of the Hazards are voiced by F1 drivers: [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] (Boost), [[Emanuele Pirro]] (Wingo) and [[Jarno Trulli]] (DJ). Boost, DJ and Wingo make a cameo appearance at the start of ''Tokyo Mater'', drifting along the main road of Radiator Springs and shouting insults at the residents before Sheriff gives chase to them. D.J. was voiced by his inspirational actor, E.J. Holowicki. Wingo, Boost and Snot Rod were voiced by Adrian Ochoa, [[Jonas Rivera]] and Pixar actor [[Lou Romano]].\n\n===TJ Hummer===\n'''TJ Hummer''' (voiced by [[Jan Rabson]]) is a vain [[Hummer H1]] that Sarge teaches in his boot camp during the end of the movie. Unlike the other SUVs in the boot camp, TJ refuses to go off-road, fearing that he will get dirt on his rims, but Sarge forces him to do so. His name may be a play on the action character [[T.J. Hooker]]. The other three boot camp recruits (none of which have speaking parts) are <span id=\"Frank Pinkerton\">'''Frank \"Pinky\" Pinkerton''' (a pink SUV),</span> <span id=\"Murphy\">'''Murphy''' (an orange SUV)</span> and <span id=\"Charlie Cargo\">'''Charlie Cargo'''.</span>\n\n===Sven \"The Governator\"===\n'''Sven \"The Governator\"''' (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) is a [[Hummer]]. His only line is \"Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!\" The name and vehicle is a parody of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s then-current position as [[Governor of California|California governor]], the first three ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' films he starred on, and the fact that he was one of the first [[Hummer H1]] owners.\n\n===Jerry Recycled Batteries===\n'''Jerry''' (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]]) is a 1979 [[Peterbilt]] 352 that Lightning McQueen mistook for Mack. He has the words \"Recycled Batteries\" on his side. His only line in the movie is a response to McQueen: \"Mack?! I ain't no Mack, I'm a Peterbilt for dang sake! Turn on your lights, you moron!\" The deleted scene on the DVD has the words \"Jerry's Junk\" and his only line is shortened saying: \"Turn on your lights, you moron!\"\n\n===Interstate 40 vehicles===\nVarious cars and trucks in non-speaking roles are named in the \"Car Finder\" game but have only silent cameos in the film.\n\n<span id=\"Bertha Butterswagon\">'''Bertha Butterswagon''', a small green runabout, watches Mack admiring his own reflection in a metal tanker truck.</span> <span id=\"Leroy Traffik\">'''Leroy Traffik''', a minivan with a mattress on his roof and a [[spare tire|temporary spare]] as his right-rear wheel, passes a tired Mack just before the truck stop. He is seen with new tires from Luigi's during the film's epilogue.</span>\n\n<span id=\"Ben Crankleshaft\">'''Ben Crankleshaft''',</span> <span id=\"Chet Boxkaar\">'''Chet Boxkaar'''</span> and <span id=\"Oliver Lightload\">'''Oliver Lightload''' are sleeping trucks at the Top Down Truck Stop.</span>\n\n<span id=\"Duff Wrecks\">'''Duff Wrecks''' is a white pickup truck briefly seen one lane away from the Delinquent Road Hazard gang on I-40.</span>\n\n==''Cars 2''==\n\nThese are characters who have first or only appeared in the film ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011).\n\n===Secret agents and spies===\n\n====Finn McMissile====\n\n'''Finn McMissile''' (voiced by [[Michael Caine]], [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] in all video games) is a British secret agent who recruits [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]], whom he mistakes for a cleverly disguised American agent, to help in his mission. Caine depicted his character Finn based on his previous role [[Harry Palmer]] from ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The IPCRESS File]]'' and its sequels. He is also similar to [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], whom Michael Caine did not portray.\n\nOriginally, Finn was supposed to appear in the first ''Cars'' movie. In a sequence that never went beyond the storyboarding stage, [[Lightning McQueen|Lightning]] and [[Sally Carrera|Sally]] visited a drive-in theater where a ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]''-type film about a superspy car named \"Finn McMissile\" was playing. This scene was deleted.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rebecca Keegan|date=January 16, 2011|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-sneaks-june-cars-20110116,0,427784.story|title=2011 Movie Preview: 'Cars 2'|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> The design of Finn is inspired by several cars: the roofline and doors of the [[Volvo P1800]] (possibly inspired by [[Roger Moore]]'s [[Volvo P1800#The Saint's Volvo 1800|ownership of one]] while filming ''The Saint'' TV espionage series in the early 1960s, as Moore also portrayed Bond from 1973 to 1985), the grill and fenders of the [[BMW 507]], and some major elements of the iconic ''James Bond'' [[Aston Martin DB5]], debuting in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (including its sound, as clearly heard in the intro of ''[[GoldenEye]]''); he also resembles a 1970s [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]]. The look of the car has been slightly modified; Finn has a different grill that looks like a suave mustache, but like Bond, he does have plenty of gadgets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.movies.yahoo.com/blog/134-disney-pixar-getting-back-in-the-fast-lane-with-cars-2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119101159/http://blog.movies.yahoo.com/blog/134-disney-pixar-getting-back-in-the-fast-lane-with-cars-2|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 November 2010|title=Disney/Pixar Getting Back in the Fast Lane With Cars 2|work=Yahoo Movies|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> His small tailfins were inspired by a 1958 British sports car called the [[Peerless (UK car)|Peerless]]\u2014one of the few British cars with fins.<ref name=\"skfacts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-news/movies/cars-2-introduces-1000-characters-fun-facts-minor-spoilers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426070910/http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-news/movies/cars-2-introduces-1000-characters-fun-facts-minor-spoilers/|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 April 2011|title=\u2018Cars 2\u2032 Introduces Nearly 1,000 New Characters and More Fun Facts|work=Stitch Kingdom|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> Finn is fluent in many languages, most notably English, French and Italian. He is outfitted with a plethora of gadgets, including: two (front) bumperette grappling hooks, a right headlight spy camera, a left headlight missile launcher, side mirror digital readouts, a deployable glass cutter, front wheel hub magnetic explosives launchers, side vent deployable machine guns, rear wheel hub deployable surveillance probes, rear bumperette grappling hooks, a rear turn signal oil dispenser, a miniature car that he can deploy (called a \"skate jack\"), an undercarriage mounted quad harpoon gun, a hydrofoil for oversea travel, a roof-deployed holographic disguise emitter, magnet tires, and a submarine-mode for underwater escapes.<ref name=\"skfacts\"/> Finn made a cameo in ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' on a poster in Andy's room. His license plate is 314 FMCM, which includes a reference to his initials. The number 314 indicates Caine's birthday, March 14, the same day as [[Billy Crystal]], another actor for Pixar. His belief about the World Grand Prix turns out to be true, as it was all just a setup by Miles Axlerod to make alternate fuel seem dangerous and make cars run on his own fuel with no choice.\n\nFinn McMissile appears in ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure]]''. It was revealed that Finn was a spy who was on the biggest oil platform in the world before he met Mater. None of them knew that Mater was not a spy. He just answered the question correctly.\n\n====Holley Shiftwell====\n'''Holley Shiftwell''' (voiced by [[Emily Mortimer]]) is a British spy-in-training who is Mater's love interest/girlfriend in the film. She is a 2011 [[Jaguar C-X75]]\n\nHolley's name is a reference to [[Holley Performance Products]], Inc., a manufacturer of high-performance carburetors and fuel systems located in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]]. Her design was made from a [[Jaguar XJR-15]]. Her name is possibly also a reference to [[Bond Girl]] [[Holly Goodhead]]. Her license plate is HS1201, which includes her initials. The number 1201 is Emily Mortimer's birthday in American date order (December 1).\n\nHolley is equipped with gadgets including: (front) projection lamps above headlights that emit a heads-up display, headlight cameras; a (side) right wheel concealed gun and an electro-shock device, a telescoping utility arm, (undercarriage) mounted dual trackball platforms for controlling the heads-up display, and retractable wings for flight.<ref name=\"skfacts\"/>\n\nHolley Shiftwell appears in ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure]]''. She is a playable character in the [[Disney Infinity (series)|''Disney Infinity'' series]]. \n\n====Siddeley====\n'''Siddeley''' (voiced by [[Jason Isaacs]]) is a [[Gulfstream V]] spy jet. He is 176 feet long with a 157-foot wingspan (53 and 48 meters respectively) and is shown to possess afterburners, though no aspect of his airframe is suited to supersonic flight, In addition, he has [[VTOL]] (vertical-takeoff and landing) capabilities. His tail has [[A113]] painted on it, a recurring gag in the Pixar films. Siddeley is also seen once in the Mexican Airport in a spinoff movie [[Planes (film)|Planes]] as a background jet, and twice in its sequel [[Planes: Fire and Rescue]] as a visiting VIP ('''V'''ery '''I'''mportant '''P'''lane), and was mentioned to be the cause of the massive wildfire during the third-fourth of the movie.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/cars-2-characters-rod-torque-redline-siddeley|title=Meet Two New \u2018Cars 2\u2032 Characters: Rod \"Torque\" Redline and Siddeley|access-date=February 27, 2011|author=Han, Angie|date=February 24, 2011|work=[[/Film]]}}</ref> His name is a reference to the British aerospace company [[Hawker Siddeley]].\n\n====Stephenson====\n'''Stephenson''' is a spy train, who first appeared in ''Cars 2'' working with Finn McMissile. Stephenson brings Finn, Holley, and Mater to Porto Corsa, Italy. Stephenson is a state-of-the-art bullet train, who scrambles switchboards, hops international rail lines, and can make it from Dover to Porto Corsa in five hours. He has no dining car and no spare compartment because he's filled with the finest in high-tech, classified spy gear and probably has a few secret agents aboard. One of his carriages contains high-tech equipment that modifies and adds gadgets to cars. His only line in ''Cars 2'' is \"Finn, one hour to Porta Corsa\". Stephenson is named after the \"father of railways\", namely [[George Stephenson]].\n\n====Leland Turbo====\n'''Leland Turbo''' (voiced by [[Jason Isaacs]]) was a British agent who appeared in the film's beginning. He sends a video message to Finn McMissile about what he sees in Professor Z\u00fcndapp's oil rig. However, by the time Finn arrives at the rig, the lemons have found Leland and crushed him into a cube. He appears to be based on a [[Jaguar E-Type]]. His name is most likely based on [[Leyland Motors]], a now-defunct British vehicle manufacturer.\n\n====Rod Redline====\n'''Rod Redline''' (voiced by [[Bruce Campbell]]) was considered by many as America's greatest spy. He is the agent McMissile and Shiftwell were supposed to meet before he ran into Mater, which leads to the mistake of the spy cars thinking Mater is Rod Redline. He is a crossover between a 2005 [[Mustang GT]] and a [[Dodge Challenger]] R/T. His license plate suggests that he is from Michigan, which is where Bruce is from.\n\nIn the beginning of the film, he is seen by McMissile (disguised as a lemon) talking to Professor Z\u00fcndapp about the camera. In the bathroom, Rod takes off his disguise so Finn and Holley can recognize him. Unfortunately, lemons Grem and Acer follow him in the bathroom and his plan backfires when they recognize him before Holley can meet him. Rod tries to fight them off, but the two lemons dodge his tactics and severely damage him. Cornered by the villains, he turns his information over to a rusty American tow truck named Mater before being captured. He is later filled with Allinol at the lemons' hideout. Rod thanks them due to the fact that Allinol is good for cars, but Professor Z\u00fcndapp reveals to the agent that Allinol explodes when it is hit with an electromagnetic pulse. As it turned out, the Lemons were going to torture him until he told them who the information was passed to. Despite the torture, Rod refuses to reveal the info, but the lemons realize that Redline passed the info to Mater. Redline is killed afterwards.\n\n====Tomber====\n'''Tomber''' (voiced by Michel Michelis) is Finn McMissile's underground informant. Having been saved from a long sentence in a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] impound lot (20 years to life) by McMissile, Tomber has since become an auto-parts dealer. He specializes in rare parts, such as the ones needed to keep a certain [[Sir Miles Axlerod|Rover V8]] going. Mater and Tomber get along from their first meeting, both respecting the other's knowledge of cars and specific parts. Tomber (French for \"to tumble\") is a [[Reliant Regal]] threewheeler, a car notorious for its poor handling and tendency to roll over in even gentle turns. His license plate reads \"PCS NO1R\". He may be based on [[Del Boy]] from [[Only Fools and Horses|Only Fools & Horses]]\n\n===Crabby the Boat===\n'''Crabby the Boat''' (voiced by [[Sig Hansen]]) is a [[fishing vessel]] that is based on the [[FV Northwestern|F/V ''Northwestern'']], a boat captained by Hansen and featured in the American reality TV series ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. Crabby is painted and designed like the ''Northwestern''. He is seen in the beginning of the film with [[Finn McMissile]] aboard him. Finn has paid Crabby to bring him to a certain location in the ocean so he can look for a car, a request that greatly puzzles Crabby. Once they reach the spot, Tony Trihull (see below) intercepts Crabby and threatens him with a [[RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile|missile launcher]], forcing him to turn back. Crabby apologizes to Finn as he heads home, not knowing that Finn has already slipped off board and hitched onto Tony to continue his mission.\n\n===Sir Miles Axlerod and his minions===\n\n====Sir Miles Axlerod====\n'''Sir Miles Axlerod''' (voiced by [[Eddie Izzard]]) is a former oil baron who has sold off his fortune after he supposedly converted himself into an electric vehicle. He is revealed to be the main antagonist at the end of  ''Cars 2''. He was the first car to circumnavigate the globe without any GPS which is similar to explorer, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] who circulated the globe. Axlerod created the World Grand Prix to promote his new wonder-fuel, Allinol. Axlerod later reveals that he owns the largest untapped oil reserves in the world. His \"alternative fuel\" is actually ordinary gasoline engineered to ignite if hit with [[electromagnetic pulse]]s from weapons disguised as television cameras. Axlerod's plans to use oil for world domination are eventually exposed. Axlerod plans to use Professor Z\u00fcndapp and the [[Lemon (automobile)|Lemon Cars]] to kill McQueen in the final race, but the EMP weapon fails to finish him off because Sarge switched McQueen's Allinol for Fillmore's organic fuel. As a backup, Axlerod has Z\u00fcndapp and the lemon cars implant a bomb on Mater's air filter which was not seen in the climax. Mater confronts Axlerod about the conspiracy and forces him to deactivate the bomb with a voice command, proving that he was the one who set it. Axlerod's engine turns out to be the [[Rover V8]] in the photo obtained by McMissile and Shiftwell after Mater opened his front hood (described by Mater and Tomber as \"the worst engine/motor ever made\"), and he is exposed as a fraud and a liar and is arrested by the British police, wondering how Mater figured out Axlerod was behind the whole scheme. He is based on a [[Range Rover L322]].\n\n====Professor Z\u00fcndapp====\n\n'''Professor Z\u00fcndapp''' (voiced by [[Thomas Kretschmann]]), often referred to as '''\"Professor Z\"''' (by his henchmen), is an internationally wanted weapons designer who is modelled after a [[Z\u00fcndapp Janus|Z\u00fcndapp Janus 250]] with a broken [[roof rack]] that evokes the look of a [[comb over]]. Though at first Professor Z\u00fcndapp appears to be the main villain, he is eventually revealed to be a subordinate to Miles Axlerod. According to Lego.com, it is revealed that his full name is '''Wolfgang Otto Zundapp'''. Z\u00fcndapp also appears in ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure]]''.\n\n====Grem and Acer====\n\n'''Grem''' (voiced by [[Joe Mantegna]]) is a dented, rusty orange [[AMC Gremlin]]. '''Acer''' (voiced by [[Peter Jacobson]]) is a beat-up green [[AMC Pacer]]. Both of these \"[[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]]\" cars are henchmen for Professor Z\u00fcndapp, Grem and Acer mistake Mater for an American agent with top-secret information, chasing him around the globe. Even though they don't have all the spy weapons and gadgets they are still tough and will do anything and everything to stop secret agents.\n\n====Tony Trihull====\n'''Tony Trihull''' (voiced by [[Lloyd Sherr]]) is a combat ship (modelled after {{USS|Independence|LCS-2}}) who works for Professor Z\u00fcndapp. He first appears in the beginning when he notices Crabby and Finn in the oil reserve, ordering Crabby to leave. When Crabby refuses, Tony threatens him with a missile battery (based on the [[RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile]]). As a result, Crabby leaves but Finn hitches a ride on the back of Tony without him knowing. He later appears again near the end of the film in London when Professor Z tries to escape from being caught by Finn McMissile, yelling for the Professor to hurry and get aboard him. When Finn McMissile stops the Professor, Tony uses a magnetic device to pull the Professor towards him. McMissile shoots several mine-bombs out of his wheels which cling to Tony's big magnet, resulting in a huge explosion killing Tony.\n\n===Hugos===\n\n====Victor Hugo====\n'''Victor Hugo''' (voiced by [[Stanley Townsend]]) is the head [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] of the Hugo family, being referred to as '''\"the boss\"''' by fellow Hugos. He and his Hugos work with Professor Z\u00fcndapp. During the film, Victor uses Ivan, a blue tow truck (which Mater masquerades as to infiltrate the lemons' meeting), as his own personal transportation that tows him place to place instead of having to drive on his own. Hugo and the other main heads of the three lemon families (Gremlin, Pacer, Trunkov) attend a meeting with Professor Z in Porto Corsa.\n\n====Alexander Hugo====\n'''Alexander Hugo''' (voiced by [[Velibor Topic]]) is part of the Hugo family that works for Professor Z and Miles Axlerod. He is the only black bodyguard lemon in the entire movie to talk, making him and Victor the only Hugo family members that talk. Despite his young age, he does dirty work (like Victor and Ivan) and attends the lemon meeting. He also is one of the lemons attempting to round up Mater so that the bomb would explode, killing both Mater and Lightning. Near the end of the film, Alexander is arrested in London with his fellow lemons.\n\n====Ivan====\n'''Ivan''' (voiced by [[Stanley Townsend]])  is a blue tow truck who serves as Victor Hugo's mode of transportation, towing him around. He resembles Mater greatly, in fact, Mater disguises as Ivan in order to infiltrate a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] crime meeting. The ''real'' Ivan was previously tazed by Holley. He later awoke and captured Holley and even intercepted Mater before he can warn Lightning McQueen about the truth of Allinol. In the end, he is defeated by Mater and arrested alongside the other lemons. His name is pronounced ee-van instead of eye-van.\n\n===Pacers===\n\n====Tubbs Pacer====\n'''Tubbs Pacer''' (portrayed by [[Brad Lewis]]) is the head [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] of the Pacer family. He and his Pacers work with Professor Z\u00fcndapp. During the film, Tubbs and the other main heads of the three lemon families (Gremlin, Trunkov, Hugo) attend a meeting with Professor Z in Porto Corsa to discuss their evil plans about discrediting the Allinol by using the radiation disguised camera to crash out the racers in the World Grand Prix that use the gas, and ensure that all cars keep using conventional fuel to secure the profits of their \"lemon\" organization who managed to secure the largest unexplored oil resources in the world. Tubbs is seen smiling at the idea and cannot wait.\n\n====Petey Pacer====\n'''Petey Pacer''' is a blue AMC Pacer member of the [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] organization. He can be recognized as one of the cars equipped with flamethrowers who attack Finn McMissile on the oil rigs' helipad.\n\n====Fred Pacer====\n'''Fred Pacer''' is a light yellow AMC Pacer.\n\n===Trunkovs===\n\n====Vladimir Trunkov====\n'''Vladimir Trunkov''' (voiced by [[Stanley Townsend]]) is the head [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]] of the Trunkov family.
