During '''Operation Primrose''' [[Royal Navy]] convoy escorts {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|6}}, [[USS Hunt (DD-194)|''Broadway'']] and {{HMS|Aubrietia|K96|2}} captured {{GS|U-110|1940|2}} with an intact [[Enigma machine]] and a wealth of signals intelligence, which led to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|breakthrough]] into cracking the German naval Enigma code.<ref>Blair pp.278-285</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nBy the Spring of 1941 the battle of the Atlantic was starting to have an increase in German U-boat losses. This forced ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] to change his strategy and he now moved his wolf packs further west, in order to catch the convoys without their anti-submarine escort.  OB 318 was a west-bound convoy of 38 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from [[Liverpool]] on 2 May 1941 bound for ports in [[North America]]. The convoy commodore was R.Adm. WB MacKenzie in SS ''Colonial''.<ref>Hague</ref>  It was escorted by 7 EG, an escort group led by {{HMS|Westcott|D47|6}} (Cdr. Bockett-Pugh) and comprising ten warships; these were joined in mid-ocean by 3 EG, a force of eight warships led by HMS ''Bulldog'' (Cdr J Baker-Cresswell). Opposing them was a force of nineteen U-boats, though in the event only six were in a position to pose a threat.<ref name=\"Blair p278\">Blair p278</ref>  One of those was ''U-110'' under the command of ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' [[Fritz-Julius Lemp]].  Lemp notoriously had been in command of {{GS|U-30|1936|2}} in 1939 which had controversially sunk the 13,581 ton [[passenger ship]] {{SS|Athenia|1922|2}}.<ref>Blair pp.66-69&248-260</ref>\n\n==Action==\nOB 318 was sighted on 7 May 1941 by {{GS|U-94|1940|2}}, which reported its position and commenced shadowing while U-boat Command ([[BdU]]) alerted other U-boats in the area.\nThere were six U-boats within striking distance, and these were ordered to close with ''U-94''{{'}}s position.\nMeanwhile, during 7 May the escort force was joined by five ships from [[Iceland]] and the destroyers of 3 EG, which were to take over escort duties from the [[Western Approaches]] to a dispersal point at 34 West, a location south of [[Greenland]]. Three ships and the destroyers of 7 EG left for Iceland during 7 May, leaving the escort force still at ten warships.<ref name=\"Blair p278\"/>\n\n===''U-94''===\nAt nightfall on 7 May ''U-94'' attacked the convoy, sinking two ships. Her skipper, [[Herbert Kuppisch]], was able to enter the convoy by submerging ahead of the convoy and letting the lead escorts pass. he was then able to fire at close range on the ships in the centre of the convoy, hitting ''Ixion'' and ''Eastern Star''. However ''U-94'' was found by the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Rochester|L50|2}} and counter-attacked by her, {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|2}} and {{HMS|Amazon|D39|2}} for four hours. ''U-94'' was damaged and forced to retire, though she was able to effect repairs later and continue her patrol.\n\nOn 8 May the remaining vessels of 3 EG, three [[corvette]]s and two [[Naval Trawler|trawlers]], with the [[armed merchant cruiser]] ''Ranpura'' in company, joined the convoy, and the remaining ships of 7 EG departed.\n\n===''U-110''===\nOn the evening of 8 May ''U-110'' and {{GS|U-201||2}} also made contact, tracking the convoy until morning. In an unusual move, the two skippers made rendezvous in order to co-ordinate their attack; Lemp in ''U-110'' would make a submerged attack from ahead, while [[Adalbert Schnee]] in ''U-201'' would do the same from the rear. It was expected that the escort would have departed by this time, leaving the convoy vulnerable to their assault.  During the morning of 9 May ''U-110'' moved into position and commenced her attack. Lemp was surprised to encounter the escort still in place, but succeeded in penetrating the convoy, sinking two ships. Lemp was targeting a [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] with his fourth torpedo tube when ''Aubrietia'' spotted the periscope and then located ''U-110'' with [[ASDIC]].<ref>Blair pp.278&279</ref>  ''Aubrietia'' gave the alert to other ships while she unloaded and dropped a pattern of depth charges. ''U-110'' performed a deep dive and managed to survive the initial onslaught. ''Aubrietia'' was joined by the destroyers ''Bulldog'' and ''Broadway'', and the attack was delivered with such force that Lemp was forced to surface. As he came up a dozen men on ''U-110'' rushed to man the guns but were shot by the waiting British ships. Lemp also saw that ''Bulldog'' was preparing to ram so Lemp gave the hurried order to abandon ship. Commander Joe Baker-Cresswell decided to try to capture the U-boat instead and hove to.<ref name=odnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/65205 ''Addison Joe Baker-Cresswell (1901\u20131997), naval officer''] by John Winton in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' online (orig. published by Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref> The survivors went over the side including Lemp. It turned out that Lemp realising that ''Bulldog'' was not going to ram had decided to go back and try to destroy the equipment along with the code books but he failed and died in the attempt. ''U-110'' itself survived the attack, but was seriously damaged and was taking on water.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\">{{cite web\n |url= http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-15B-Bulldog.htm\n |title=HMS ''Bulldog'', destroyer\n |work=naval-history.net\n |accessdate=17 January 2011\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110113183919/http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-15B-Bulldog.htm| archivedate= 13 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n''Bulldog'' soon had pulled alongside and Sub-Lieutenant [[David Balme]] led a boarding party, and began stripping her of what they could find. Balme's team soon began to take off the valuables and these turned out to be codebooks, charts, ciphers and most significantly, a complete and undamaged Enigma machine. The crew hadn't any idea what it was they had captured. Before they transferred the equipment ''Bulldog'' had to depart, leaving the U-boat with the [[prize crew]] as it had received a message of another submarine in the area. Balme and his men were left onboard U-110 for over an hour before ''Bulldog'' returned.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n===''U-201''===\nMeanwhile, Schnee in ''U-201'' made his attack, sinking one ship and damaging another. He was also counter-attacked, by ''Amazon'', ''Nigella'' and ''St Apollo'', and forced to retire. He was left damaged.<ref>Blair p281</ref>\n\n===''U-556''===\nIn the early hours of 10 May OB 318 was found by {{GS|U-556||2}} which attacked immediately, resulting in one ship damaged. As OB 318 was at its dispersal point, the convoy separated during the night, while the escorts departed to meet their next charge. However ''U-556'' was able to keep in touch with a group of ships heading south-west, and during the day sank two more.<ref>Blair p283</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and significance==\nU-boats sank five ships from convoy OB 318; and three, including the convoy commodore's ship ''Colonial'', were sunk before arriving by U-boats patrolling near their destinations. Thirty-three ships arrived safely at their destinations over the next two weeks.\n\nBaker-Cresswell took ''U-110'' in tow, but she sank within hours due to the damage she had sustained. Lemp was lost with 14 members of his crew but a war correspondent, 4 officers and 28 men were rescued and sent to [[Scapa Flow]] as [[prisoners of war]]. At Scapa Flow experts from [[Bletchley Park]] were waiting and were exceptionally surprised with what they collected and took back with them.<ref>Roskill ''The Secret Capture'' pg 107</ref>\nThe capture of the Enigma machine was highly secret at the time and none of the crew knew of the significance. The machine itself significantly assisted the work in hand at Bletchley Park in breaking German naval codes. This was the first fully functioning machine and the first one used to break the naval codes along with the capture of codes from a number of German [[weather ship]]s during the same year.<ref name=\"sebag\">Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, ''Enigma: Battle for the Code'', 2000, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> Thanks to this Enigma machine though; Bletchley were able to inform the Royal Navy and thus steered convoys away from where most groups of U-boat packs were present. The difference made was substantial; from when the information began to pour through in June 1941 Allied shipping losses were around 432,000 tons but by August it had dropped to less than 80,000 tons.<ref>[http://rapidttp.co.za/milhist/vol093db.html ''OPERATION PRIMROSE: The Story of the Capture of the Enigma Cypher Machine from U11O'' Balme ]</ref>\n\nThe most important find as well being the ''[[Reservehandverfahren]]'' cipher which was first solved at Bletchley Park in June 1941 by means of documents captured from ''U-110'' and then later on with the important capture of code-books and other important documents from {{GS|U-559||2}} on 30 October 1942. Thereafter it was solved using [[cryptanalysis]] led by [[Alan Turing]] for over three years. Some 1,400 signals were read during that period.<ref name=\"sebag\"/> Baker-Cresswell was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and promoted captain. [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] told him the capture of the ''U-110'' cipher material had been \"the most important single event in the whole war at sea\".<ref name=\"odnb\"/>\n\n==Tables==\n===Allied merchant ships===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"150px\"|Name<ref name=\"hag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/ob2/index.html|title=OB convoys|publisher=Andrew Hague Convoy Database|accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>\n! width=\"150px\"|Flag<ref name=\"hag\"/>\n! width=\"25px\" |Dead<ref name=\"h155\">Hague 2000 p.155</ref>\n! width=\"25px\" |Tonnage [[gross register tons|(GRT)]]<ref name=\"hag\"/>\n! width=\"150px\"|Cargo<ref name=\"h155\"/>\n! width=\"150px\"|Notes<ref name=\"hag\"/>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[List of shipwrecks in May 1941#7 May|''Ixion'']] (1912)\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagcountry|United Kingdom|civil}}\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|10,263\n|align=\"left\"|2,900 tons General cargo\n|align=\"left\"|Sunk on 7 May by {{GS|U-94|1940|2}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[List of shipwrecks in May 1941#7 May|''Eastern Star'']] (1920)\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagcountry|Norway}}\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|5,658\n|align=\"left\"|General cargo incl. 16 aircraft\n|align=\"left\"|Sunk on 7 May by ''U-94''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[List of shipwrecks in May 1941#9 May|''Bengore Head'']] (1922)\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagcountry|United Kingdom|civil}}\n|align=\"right\"|1\n|align=\"right\"|2,609\n|align=\"left\"|1,200 tons coal\n|align=\"left\"|Sunk on 9 May by {{GS|U-110|1940|2}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[List of shipwrecks in May 1941#9 May|''Esmond'']] (1930)\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagcountry|United Kingdom|civil}}\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|4,976\n|align=\"left\"|In ballast\n|align=\"left\"|Sunk on 9 May by ''U-110''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[List of shipwrecks in May 1941#9 May|''Gregalia'']] (1929)\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagcountry|United Kingdom|civil}}\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|5,802\n|align=\"left\"|In ballast\n|align=\"left\"|Sunk on 9 May by {{GS|U-201||2}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{SS|Empire Cloud||2}} (1941)\n|align=\"left\"|{{flagcountry|United Kingdom|civil}}\n|align=\"right\"|0\n|align=\"right\"|5,969\n|align=\"left\"|In ballast\n|align=\"left\"|Damaged on 9 May by ''U-201''.

This forced ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] to change his strategy and he now moved his wolf packs further west, in order to catch the convoys without their anti-submarine escort.  OB 318 was a west-bound convoy of 38 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from [[Liverpool]] on 2 May 1941 bound for ports in [[North America]]. The convoy commodore was R.Adm. WB MacKenzie in SS ''Colonial''.<ref>Hague</ref>  It was escorted by 7 EG, an escort group led by {{HMS|Westcott|D47|6}} (Cdr. Bockett-Pugh) and comprising ten warships; these were joined in mid-ocean by 3 EG, a force of eight warships led by HMS ''Bulldog'' (Cdr J Baker-Cresswell). Opposing them was a force of nineteen U-boats, though in the event only six were in a position to pose a threat.<ref name=\"Blair p278\">Blair p278</ref>  One of those was ''U-110'' under the command of ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' [[Fritz-Julius Lemp]].  Lemp notoriously had been in command of {{GS|U-30|1936|2}} in 1939 which had controversially sunk the 13,581 ton [[passenger ship]] {{SS|Athenia|1922|2}}.<ref>Blair pp.66-69&248-260</ref>\n\n==Action==\nOB 318 was sighted on 7 May 1941 by {{GS|U-94|1940|2}}, which reported its position and commenced shadowing while U-boat Command ([[BdU]]) alerted other U-boats in the area.\nThere were six U-boats within striking distance, and these were ordered to close with ''U-94''{{'}}s position.\nMeanwhile, during 7 May the escort force was joined by five ships from [[Iceland]] and the destroyers of 3 EG, which were to take over escort duties from the [[Western Approaches]] to a dispersal point at 34 West, a location south of [[Greenland]]. Three ships and the destroyers of 7 EG left for Iceland during 7 May, leaving the escort force still at ten warships.<ref name=\"Blair p278\"/>\n\n===''U-94''===\nAt nightfall on 7 May ''U-94'' attacked the convoy, sinking two ships. Her skipper, [[Herbert Kuppisch]], was able to enter the convoy by submerging ahead of the convoy and letting the lead escorts pass. he was then able to fire at close range on the ships in the centre of the convoy, hitting ''Ixion'' and ''Eastern Star''. However ''U-94'' was found by the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Rochester|L50|2}} and counter-attacked by her, {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|2}} and {{HMS|Amazon|D39|2}} for four hours. ''U-94'' was damaged and forced to retire, though she was able to effect repairs later and continue her patrol.\n\nOn 8 May the remaining vessels of 3 EG, three [[corvette]]s and two [[Naval Trawler|trawlers]], with the [[armed merchant cruiser]] ''Ranpura'' in company, joined the convoy, and the remaining ships of 7 EG departed.\n\n===''U-110''===\nOn the evening of 8 May ''U-110'' and {{GS|U-201||2}} also made contact, tracking the convoy until morning. In an unusual move, the two skippers made rendezvous in order to co-ordinate their attack; Lemp in ''U-110'' would make a submerged attack from ahead, while [[Adalbert Schnee]] in ''U-201'' would do the same from the rear. It was expected that the escort would have departed by this time, leaving the convoy vulnerable to their assault.  During the morning of 9 May ''U-110'' moved into position and commenced her attack. Lemp was surprised to encounter the escort still in place, but succeeded in penetrating the convoy, sinking two ships. Lemp was targeting a [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] with his fourth torpedo tube when ''Aubrietia'' spotted the periscope and then located ''U-110'' with [[ASDIC]].<ref>Blair pp.278&279</ref>  ''Aubrietia'' gave the alert to other ships while she unloaded and dropped a pattern of depth charges. ''U-110'' performed a deep dive and managed to survive the initial onslaught. ''Aubrietia'' was joined by the destroyers ''Bulldog'' and ''Broadway'', and the attack was delivered with such force that Lemp was forced to surface. As he came up a dozen men on ''U-110'' rushed to man the guns but were shot by the waiting British ships. Lemp also saw that ''Bulldog'' was preparing to ram so Lemp gave the hurried order to abandon ship. Commander Joe Baker-Cresswell decided to try to capture the U-boat instead and hove to.<ref name=odnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/65205 ''Addison Joe Baker-Cresswell (1901\u20131997), naval officer''] by John Winton in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' online (orig. published by Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref> The survivors went over the side including Lemp. It turned out that Lemp realising that ''Bulldog'' was not going to ram had decided to go back and try to destroy the equipment along with the code books but he failed and died in the attempt. ''U-110'' itself survived the attack, but was seriously damaged and was taking on water.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\">{{cite web\n |url= http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-15B-Bulldog.htm\n |title=HMS ''Bulldog'', destroyer\n |work=naval-history.net\n |accessdate=17 January 2011\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110113183919/http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-15B-Bulldog.htm| archivedate= 13 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n''Bulldog'' soon had pulled alongside and Sub-Lieutenant [[David Balme]] led a boarding party, and began stripping her of what they could find. Balme's team soon began to take off the valuables and these turned out to be codebooks, charts, ciphers and most significantly, a complete and undamaged Enigma machine. The crew hadn't any idea what it was they had captured. Before they transferred the equipment ''Bulldog'' had to depart, leaving the U-boat with the prize crew as it had received a message of another submarine in the area. Balme and his men were left onboard U-110 for over an hour before ''Bulldog'' returned.<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/>\n\n===''U-201''===\nMeanwhile, Schnee in ''U-201'' made his attack, sinking one ship and damaging another. He was also counter-attacked, by ''Amazon'', ''Nigella'' and ''St Apollo'', and forced to retire. He was left damaged.<ref>Blair p281</ref>\n\n===''U-556''===\nIn the early hours of 10 May OB 318 was found by {{GS|U-556||2}} which attacked immediately, resulting in one ship damaged. As OB 318 was at its dispersal point, the convoy separated during the night, while the escorts departed to meet their next charge. However ''U-556'' was able to keep in touch with a group of ships heading south-west, and during the day sank two more.<ref>Blair p283</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and significance==\nU-boats sank five ships from convoy OB 318; and three, including the convoy commodore's ship ''Colonial'', were sunk before arriving by U-boats patrolling near their destinations. Thirty-three ships arrived safely at their destinations over the next two weeks.\n\nBaker-Cresswell took ''U-110'' in tow, but she sank within hours due to the damage she had sustained. Lemp was lost with 14 members of his crew but a war correspondent, 4 officers and 28 men were rescued and sent to [[Scapa Flow]] as [[prisoners of war]]. At Scapa Flow experts from [[Bletchley Park]] were waiting and were exceptionally surprised with what they collected and took back with them.<ref>Roskill ''The Secret Capture'' pg 107</ref>\nThe capture of the Enigma machine was highly secret at the time and none of the crew knew of the significance. The machine itself significantly assisted the work in hand at Bletchley Park in breaking German naval codes. This was the first fully functioning machine and the first one used to break the naval codes along with the capture of codes from a number of German [[weather ship]]s during the same year.<ref name=\"sebag\">Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, ''Enigma: Battle for the Code'', 2000, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> Thanks to this Enigma machine though; Bletchley were able to inform the Royal Navy and thus steered convoys away from where most groups of U-boat packs were present. The difference made was substantial; from when the information began to pour through in June 1941 Allied shipping losses were around 432,000 tons but by August it had dropped to less than 80,000 tons.<ref>[http://rapidttp.co.za/milhist/vol093db.html ''OPERATION PRIMROSE: The Story of the Capture of the Enigma Cypher Machine from U11O'' Balme ]</ref>\n\nThe most important find as well being the ''[[Reservehandverfahren]]'' cipher which was first solved at Bletchley Park in June 1941 by means of documents captured from ''U-110'' and then later on with the important capture of code-books and other important documents from {{GS|U-559||2}} on 30 October 1942. Thereafter it was solved using [[cryptanalysis]] led by [[Alan Turing]] for over three years. Some 1,400 signals were read during that period.<ref name=\"sebag\"/> Baker-Cresswell was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and promoted captain.

Following the introduction of modernity in sculpture in Bangladesh in the 1950s by [[Novera Ahmed]], Khan was instrumental in the popularization of sculpture in the country through his distinctive form of modernity. Influenced by [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Henry Moore]], his works manifest expressionism, minimalism, and a constant exploration of purity of material. He worked on both figurative as well as abstract genres.  \n\nIn addition to sculpture, Khan is notable as a painter. Even before becoming a sculptor, he gained recognition for his watercolor and acrylic paintings in the late 1960s. [[Zainul Abedin]], the founding father of Bangladeshi modern art, acclaimed and encouraged Khan for his watercolors. His watercolors are characterized by abstract expressionism and predominantly on the subjects of natural landscape and human figure. \n\nFor his contribution to sculpture, Khan was awarded [[Ekushey Padak]], the second-highest civilian award in [[Bangladesh]], in 2006. In a career spanning over five decades, his works have been exhibited and installed in Bangladesh, [[South Korea]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].       \n\n==Early life and education==\nKhan was born in 1946 in the village Sahasram in [[Kishoreganj District| Kishoreganj]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/exhibition/hamiduzzaman-khan-retrospective-opens-bnm-1482982|title=Hamiduzzaman Khan Retrospective opens at BNM|date=2017-10-29|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> Indian artist [[Hemen Majumdar]] hailed from Gachihata, a neighboring village of Sahasram. Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on [[Operation Searchlight|25th March]], he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities of the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever National Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976.

For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet.

Following the introduction of modernity in sculpture in Bangladesh in the 1950s by [[Novera Ahmed]], Khan was instrumental in the popularization of sculpture in the country through his distinctive form of modernity. Influenced by [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Henry Moore]], his works manifest expressionism, minimalism, and a constant exploration of purity of material. He worked on both figurative as well as abstract genres.  \n\nIn addition to sculpture, Khan is notable as a painter. Even before becoming a sculptor, he gained recognition for his watercolor and acrylic paintings in the late 1960s. [[Zainul Abedin]], the founding father of Bangladeshi modern art, acclaimed and encouraged Khan for his watercolors. His watercolors are characterized by abstract expressionism and predominantly on the subjects of natural landscape and human figure. \n\nFor his contribution to sculpture, Khan was awarded [[Ekushey Padak]], the second-highest civilian award in [[Bangladesh]], in 2006. In a career spanning over five decades, his works have been exhibited and installed in Bangladesh, [[South Korea]], [[India]], and the [[United States]].       \n\n==Early life and education==\nKhan was born in 1946 in the village Sahasram in [[Kishoreganj District| Kishoreganj]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/exhibition/hamiduzzaman-khan-retrospective-opens-bnm-1482982|title=Hamiduzzaman Khan Retrospective opens at BNM|date=2017-10-29|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> Indian artist [[Hemen Majumdar]] hailed from Gachihata, a neighboring village of Sahasram. Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on [[Operation Searchlight|25th March]], he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities of the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever National Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976.

For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla (Onslaught)'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]].

In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2018 a community group of volunteers, [https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com '''''<u>The Friends of Hull General Cemetery</u>'''''], was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life it has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nIn September 2018 a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from its slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquillity almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deteriorated to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flora and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city environment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council.

That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the marvellous input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.

2009)]]\n'''Hull General Cemetery''' was established by a private company in 1847 on Spring Bank, in the west of [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England. In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2018 a community group of volunteers, [https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com '''''<u>The Friends of Hull General Cemetery</u>'''''], was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life it has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nIn September 2018 a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from it's slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquility almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deterioted to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flauna and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city envrionment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council.

That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the marvelous input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.
