It is the seventh film in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film series]], and brings together cast members from the 1960s television show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' and the 1987 spin-off show ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''. In the film, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] joins forces with Captain [[James T. Kirk]] to stop a villain from destroying a solar system.\n\n''Generations'' was conceived as a handoff from the original television series cast and their movies to ''The Next Generation''. [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[Brannon Braga]] wrote the script concurrently with their work on the final season of ''The Next Generation''; production of the film began while the television series was still being made. Parts of the film were shot at the [[Valley of Fire State Park]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]], and [[Lone Pine, California]]. The film uses a mix of [[Practical effect|traditional optical effects]] alongside [[computer-generated imagery]]. The film was scored by regular ''Star Trek'' composer [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]].\n\n''Generations'' opened on November 18 in the United States. Paramount promoted the film with a number of merchandising tie-ins, including toys, books, games, and a [[website]]\u2014a first for a major motion picture. Grossing $118&nbsp;million, it was a box office success despite receiving a mixed critical reception. ''Generations'' was followed by 1996's ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'', exclusively featuring the ''Next Generation'' cast.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2293, retired Starfleet officers [[James T. Kirk]], [[Montgomery Scott]], and [[Pavel Chekov]] attend the [[maiden voyage]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-B)|USS ''Enterprise''-B]]. During the [[shakedown cruise]], the ''Enterprise'' is pressed into a rescue mission to save two [[El-Aurian]] refugee ships that have been snared by a massive, unknown energy ribbon. ''Enterprise'' is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but itself becomes trapped by the ribbon. Kirk goes to engineering to help ''Enterprise'' escape, and is presumed dead after the trailing end of the ribbon hits the ship's hull where he was working.\n\nIn 2371, the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] is celebrating the promotion of shipmate [[Worf]] to Lieutenant Commander on the holodeck when Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] learns his brother and nephew were killed in a fire. Picard is distraught that the Picard family line will end with him. ''Enterprise'' receives a distress call from an observatory where an El-Aurian, Dr. Tolian Soran, launches a trilithium probe at a star. The probe causes the star to implode, creating a shockwave that destroys its solar system. Soran kidnaps ''Enterprise'' engineer [[Geordi La Forge]] and is transported off the station by a [[Klingon Bird of Prey]] belonging to the [[Duras sisters]].\n\n''Enterprise'' crewman [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] tells Picard that she and Soran were among the El-Aurians rescued in 2293 and that Soran is obsessed with reentering the ribbon to reach the \"Nexus\", an extra-dimensional realm that exists outside of normal space-time. Picard and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] determine that Soran, unable to fly a ship directly into the ribbon, is altering the path of the ribbon by removing the gravitational effects from nearby stars. He plans to destroy another star to bring the ribbon to him on the planet Veridian III, killing millions on a nearby inhabited planet in the process.\n\nUpon entering the Veridian system, Picard offers himself to the Duras sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran directly. La Forge is returned to ''Enterprise'', but unwittingly transmits ''Enterprise''{{'}}s defense details to the Klingons. The Duras sisters attack, and ''Enterprise'' sustains critical damage before destroying the Bird of Prey. Commander [[William Riker]] evacuates the crew to the forward saucer section of the ship, which separates from the engineering section and crashes onto the surface of Veridian III.\n\nPicard fails to stop Soran from launching another probe and both men enter the Nexus. Picard finds himself surrounded by an idealized family, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an \"echo\" of Guinan, and after being told that he may go \"wherever and whenever\" he wishes within the Nexus, Guinan sends him to meet Kirk, also safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is at first entranced by the opportunity to make up for past regrets in the Nexus, he likewise realizes that nothing there is real. Picard convinces Kirk to leave the Nexus and return to Veridian III shortly before Soran launches the probe.\n\nWorking together, Kirk and Picard distract Soran long enough for Picard to lock the probe in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill Soran. Kirk is fatally injured in the effort, and Picard buries him in a makeshift grave on the mountain. Three Federation starships arrive to retrieve ''Enterprise''{{'}}s survivors from Veridian III. With ''Enterprise'' declared un-salvageable, Picard muses that given the name's legacy, the ship will not be the last to carry the name ''Enterprise''.\n\n==Cast==\nThe starring cast of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' reprise their roles in ''Generations''. [[Patrick Stewart]] plays Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]], [[Jonathan Frakes]] plays Commander [[William Riker|William T. Riker]], [[LeVar Burton]] plays Lieutenant Commander [[Geordi La Forge]], [[Brent Spiner]] plays Lieutenant Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], [[Gates McFadden]] plays Chief Medical Officer Commander [[Beverly Crusher]], [[Michael Dorn]] plays Lieutenant Commander [[Worf]], and [[Marina Sirtis]] plays ship's counselor Commander [[Deanna Troi]].

Other requests included a [[Khan Noonien Singh]]-like antagonist, Klingons, and a humorous Data plot.<ref name=\"braga-moore\"/> At one point, the writers toyed with the idea of pitting the two crews against each other. \"We were obsessed with the poster image of the two ''Enterprises'' locked in combat: {{smallcaps|Kirk vs. Picard, One Must Die!}}\" said Moore.<ref name=\"housley-1994\"/>\n\nIn the initial draft of the screenplay, the original series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations.

Mortality tops the list.\" After the idea of killing off a ''Next Generation'' cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. Moore recalled that \"we all sorta looked around and said, 'That might be it.' \" The studio and Shatner himself had few concerns about the plot point.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}}\n\nRefining the script also meant facing the realities of budget constraints. The initial proposal included location shooting in Hawaii, Idaho and the Midwestern United States and the total budget was over $30&nbsp;million. After negotiations, the budget was reduced to $25&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}} A revised version of the script from March 1994 included feedback from the producers, studio, actors and director; the writers changed a sequence where Harriman trained his predecessors in the ''Enterprise''-B's operation after Shatner felt the scene's joke went too far. Picard's personal tragedy was written as his brother Robert's heart attack, but Stewart suggested the loss of his entire family in a fire to add emotional impact.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|310}} The draft script's opening sequence took place on the solar observatory with two [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]-influenced characters talking shortly before the Romulans' attack; ''Next Generation'' writer [[Jeri Taylor]] suggested that the opening should be something \"fun\", leading to the switch to a holodeck promotion-at-sea.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|311}}\n\nNimoy turned down the chance to direct the feature as well as reprise the role of Spock.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}} The producers chose [[David Carson (director)|David Carson]].

Zimmerman collaborated with illustrator [[John Eaves]] for many designs.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|312}} Zimmerman's approach to realizing a vision of the future was to take existing and familiar designs and use them in a different manner to express living in the future. Taking cues from director [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s approach to ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', Zimmerman noted that even in the future humanity will still need life support and have the same furniture needs, so a logical approach was to start with what would remain the same and work from there.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\">{{cite journal|author1=Edgerly, Philip Thomas |author2=Herman Zimmerman |date=December 1994|title=Architrek: Designing Generations|journal=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]|volume=|issue=|issn=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|52}}\n\nTransitioning from a television screen to a movie meant that sets and designs needed to be more detailed, with a higher level of polish to stand up on the big screen. Zimmerman felt obliged to improve on the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\"/>{{rp|52\u201353}} Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; Zimmerman had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked but had never had the time or money to rework it previously.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\"/>{{rp|53}}\n\nThe script called for an entirely new location on the ''Enterprise'', stellar cartography. According to Zimmerman, the script characterized the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a circular set with three stories to give the impression the actors are inside a star map. Zimmerman's previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design, dominated by video screens.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\"/>{{rp|54}} Before the rise of large-format inkjet printers and computer graphics software in the few years before the film was made, the backlit starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> These starmaps were removed and replaced with a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] for scenes where the static images would be replaced by computer-animated star maps by Santa Barbara Studios.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The set's size made it one of the largest sets ever constructed on a Paramount lot.<ref name=\"beeler-1995\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe film marked the first appearance of the ''Enterprise''-B.

Dwyer reused previous ''Star Trek'' props or made new ones out of premade materials where possible rather than spend more money on entirely new items: a chair used to torture LaForge was created using a birthing chair, nosehair clippers and flashlights for accents; packing materials formed the shapes of set walls for the Bird of Prey bridge; and Soran's missile used a bird feeder and other garden store supplies for its interior elements.<ref name=\"okuda\"/><ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|316}} The Amargosa stellar observatory set was filled with reused props from ''The Next Generation'', with others added in deliberate nods to past episodes.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|317}}  In addition to sets used on ''The Next Generation'', other reused sets included the Klingon bridge built for ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', and ribbed plastic walls in the [[Jefferies tube]]s were repurposed from the sets of ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Other set pieces and props were original; these included paintings of Picard's ancestors and a cowboy for the locations in the Nexus.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|317}}\n\n[[Robert Blackman]], ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s long serving [[costume designer]] re-designed the Starfleet uniforms which the ''Enterprise''-D crew would wear in the film. Blackman designed militaristic-looking uniforms with rank sleeves inspired by ''The Original Series'', high collars, and jackets reminiscent of the uniforms developed for ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. Ultimately the redesign was abandoned, and the cast wore combinations of uniforms seen on the later episodes of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and the uniforms from the early episodes of ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' and throughout ''Star Trek: Voyager''; the only new addition was an Eaves-designed angular com badge that replaced the previous oval shape. Time was so short that Jonathan Frakes and Levar Burton had to borrow [[Avery Brooks]] and [[Colm Meaney]]'s costumes respectively for filming. [[Playmates Toys]] released a number of action figures depicting the Next Generation crew wearing the abandoned uniforms prior to the film's release.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Also created by Blackman was a skydiving outfit worn by Shatner; though the scene was cut from the film, the costume was eventually reused in the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Extreme Risk (Star Trek: Voyager)|Extreme Risk]]\".<ref name=collectingtrek>{{cite web|last1=Jose|first1=Maria|last2=Tenuto|first2=John|title=Collecting Trek: Toys, Cards & More Depicting Deleted Scenes|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/collecting-trek-toys-cards-more-depicting-deleted-scenes|website=StarTrek.com|publisher=CBS|date=December 23, 2013|accessdate=December 25, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217223810/http://www.startrek.com/article/collecting-trek-toys-cards-more-depicting-deleted-scenes|archivedate=February 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Lady Washington 2007.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Lady Washington}} stood in as a [[holodeck]] recreation of a sailing ship ''Enterprise''.|alt=A white and gold antique wooden sailing ship sits in a body of water, with land behind it.]]\n[[File:Valley of Fire White Domes area 3.jpg|thumb|High cliffs and areas like this in [[Valley of Fire State Park]] served as the alien planet Veridian III.|alt=A view of worn, red, orange, and white rocks clustered together, with a few small outgrowths of vegetation scattered among them.]]\nBerman backed Carson's choice to hire [[John A.

After the end of ''The Next Generation'', there was only six months before the film was scheduled to be released in theaters.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|307}} Scenes that did not feature the television series regulars were filmed first,<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|307}} starting with those in the ''Enterprise''-B deflector room.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The scenes of Harriman, Chekov and Scott reacting to Kirk's apparent death were filmed a week later, to allow time for the deflector room to be suitably distressed to visualize the damage.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nStage 7 was where the ''Enterprise''-B's bridge, deflector room and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent [[1994 Northridge earthquake]]; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elicit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the ''Enterprise''-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout. Control panels styled after those in the original ''Star Trek'' series helped suggest the age of the station.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nThe cast of ''The Next Generation'' started filming their scenes for ''Generations'' four days after wrapping on the show.<ref name=\"EW-generation x\">{{cite journal|author=Svetkey, Benjamin|date=May 6, 1994|title='Generation' Ex|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue=221|page=16}}</ref> The ''Enterprise''-D crash scenes were filmed mid-May 1994, and were among the last remaining shots before the existing ''Next Generation'' sets were demolished to make way for ''Voyager''.

The rise's height and sloped sides required cast and crew to climb {{convert|160|ft|m}} using safety ropes and carry all provisions and equipment with them. The {{convert|110|F}} heat was difficult for all involved, especially Shatner, whose character wore an all-wool uniform.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|315}} Safety harnesses and wires were used to keep performers safe from tumbling off a precipice, and were removed digitally in postproduction.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nPicard's house in the Nexus was a private home in [[Pasadena, California]]; almost all the furnishings were custom props or outside items. Portions of the scene were shot in May 1994, followed by new shoots five months later. The revisions included adding Picard's nephew Ren\u00e9 to his imagined Christmas celebration with his family.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The house of Kirk's Nexus recollections was located in Lone Pine, California, with the cabin filled with props to represent Kirk's career, from a Klingon bat'leth to a painting of ''Enterprise''.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nAs originally filmed, Kirk was shot in the back and killed by Soran.

For ''Generations'', the effects artists began using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and models for certain shots.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|78}} No physical shooting models were ever built for the refugee ships, although George recalled that he found it easier to create a quick physical miniature for CG modeler Rob Coleman to iterate from, rather than try to articulate his feedback without it.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|84}} Other CGI elements included the solar collapses, and the Veridian III planet.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|319}} Knoll also used a digital version of the ''Enterprise''-D for the warp effect; the limitations of the motion-control programming and [[slitscan]] effect for the original meant that the effect \"barely holds up\", Knoll said, whereas the CG recreation could keep consistent lighting throughout.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|88}} While digital techniques were used for many sequences and ships, a few new models were physically built, including the observatory, built by model shop foreman John Goodson.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|320}}\n\nThe climactic battle between ''Enterprise'' and the Klingons over Veridian III was accomplished using traditional motion control, but without the budget for practical explosions and special breakaway models, the impacts and battle damage were simulated with practical compositing tricks and computer-generated effects, while the final destruction of the Bird of Prey was a reuse of footage from ''The Undiscovered Country''.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|80}} The weapons fire and energy bolts were hand-animated, but Knoll had a different idea for the [[photon torpedoes]]. A fan of the impressive, arcing look of the torpedoes from ''The Motion Picture'', Knoll scanned in footage from the film and turned to computer-generated effects.

Critic Jeff Bond wrote that while McCarthy's score was \"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. The film's opening music is a choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the ''Enterprise''-B, McCarthy used low brass chords. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a sound not used on ''The Next Generation''), while the scene ends with dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.<ref name=\"bond-1999\">{{cite book |author=Bond, Jeff |year=1999 |title=The Music of Star Trek |publisher=Lone Eagle Publishing Company |isbn=1580650120}}</ref>{{rp|152}}\n\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the ''Enterprise''. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. A broad fanfare\u2014the film's only distinct theme\u2014first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. This theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s first season, notes from the theme for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', and [[Alexander Courage]]'s [[Theme from Star Trek|''Star Trek'' theme]].<ref name=\"bond-1999\"/>{{rp|152}} For the final battle of Kirk and Picard against Soran, McCarthy used staccato music to accentuate the fistfight. For Kirk's death, McCarthy mated lyrical strings with another statement of the Courage theme, while a shot of Picard standing over Kirk's grave is scored with more pomp. The Courage theme plays again at the film's close.<ref name=\"bond-1999\"/>{{rp|152\u20133}}\n\nThe soundtrack was released in 1994 in a two-disc format on [[GNP Crescendo Records]].

It is the seventh film in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film series]], and brings together cast members from the 1960s television show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' and the 1987 spin-off show ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''. In the film, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] joins forces with Captain [[James T. Kirk]] to stop a villain from destroying a solar system.\n\n''Generations'' was conceived as a handoff from the original television series cast and their movies to ''The Next Generation''. [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[Brannon Braga]] wrote the script concurrently with their work on the final season of ''The Next Generation''; production of the film began while the television series was still being made. Parts of the film were shot at the [[Valley of Fire State Park]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]], and [[Lone Pine, California]]. The film uses a mix of [[Practical effect|traditional optical effects]] alongside [[computer-generated imagery]]. The film was scored by regular ''Star Trek'' composer [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]].\n\n''Generations'' opened on November 18 in the United States. Paramount promoted the film with a number of merchandising tie-ins, including toys, books, games, and a [[website]]\u2014a first for a major motion picture. Grossing $118&nbsp;million, it was a box office success despite receiving a mixed critical reception. ''Generations'' was followed by 1996's ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'', exclusively featuring the ''Next Generation'' cast.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2293, retired Starfleet officers [[James T. Kirk]], [[Montgomery Scott]], and [[Pavel Chekov]] attend the [[maiden voyage]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-B)|USS ''Enterprise''-B]]. During the [[shakedown cruise]], the ''Enterprise'' is pressed into a rescue mission to save two [[El-Aurian]] refugee ships that have been snared by a massive, unknown energy ribbon. ''Enterprise'' is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but itself becomes trapped by the ribbon. Kirk goes to engineering to help ''Enterprise'' escape, and is presumed dead after the trailing end of the ribbon hits the ship's hull where he was working.\n\nIn 2371, the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] is celebrating the promotion of shipmate [[Worf]] to Lieutenant Commander on the holodeck when Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] learns his brother and nephew were killed in a fire. Picard is distraught that the Picard family line will end with him. ''Enterprise'' receives a distress call from an observatory where an El-Aurian, Dr. Tolian Soran, launches a trilithium probe at a star. The probe causes the star to implode, creating a shockwave that destroys its solar system. Soran kidnaps ''Enterprise'' engineer [[Geordi La Forge]] and is transported off the station by a [[Klingon Bird of Prey]] belonging to the [[Duras sisters]].\n\n''Enterprise'' crewman [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] tells Picard that she and Soran were among the El-Aurians rescued in 2293 and that Soran is obsessed with reentering the ribbon to reach the \"Nexus\", an extra-dimensional realm that exists outside of normal space-time. Picard and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] determine that Soran, unable to fly a ship directly into the ribbon, is altering the path of the ribbon by removing the gravitational effects from nearby stars. He plans to destroy another star to bring the ribbon to him on the planet Veridian III, killing millions on a nearby inhabited planet in the process.\n\nUpon entering the Veridian system, Picard offers himself to the Duras sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran directly. La Forge is returned to ''Enterprise'', but unwittingly transmits ''Enterprise''{{'}}s defense details to the Klingons. The Duras sisters attack, and ''Enterprise'' sustains critical damage before destroying the Bird of Prey. Commander [[William Riker]] evacuates the crew to the forward saucer section of the ship, which separates from the engineering section and crashes onto the surface of Veridian III.\n\nPicard fails to stop Soran from launching another probe and both men enter the Nexus. Picard finds himself surrounded by an idealized family, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an \"echo\" of Guinan, and after being told that he may go \"wherever and whenever\" he wishes within the Nexus, Guinan sends him to meet Kirk, also safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is at first entranced by the opportunity to make up for past regrets in the Nexus, he likewise realizes that nothing there is real. Picard convinces Kirk to leave the Nexus and return to Veridian III shortly before Soran launches the probe.\n\nWorking together, Kirk and Picard distract Soran long enough for Picard to lock the probe in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill Soran. Kirk is fatally injured in the effort, and Picard buries him in a makeshift grave on the mountain. Three Federation starships arrive to retrieve ''Enterprise''{{'}}s survivors from Veridian III. With ''Enterprise'' declared un-salvageable, Picard muses that given the name's legacy, the ship will not be the last to carry the name ''Enterprise''.\n\n==Cast==\nThe starring cast of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' reprise their roles in ''Generations''. [[Patrick Stewart]] plays Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]], [[Jonathan Frakes]] plays Commander [[William Riker|William T. Riker]], [[LeVar Burton]] plays Lieutenant Commander [[Geordi La Forge]], [[Brent Spiner]] plays Lieutenant Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], [[Gates McFadden]] plays Chief Medical Officer Commander [[Beverly Crusher]], [[Michael Dorn]] plays Lieutenant Commander [[Worf]], and [[Marina Sirtis]] plays ship's counselor Commander [[Deanna Troi]].

Other requests included a [[Khan Noonien Singh]]-like antagonist, Klingons, and a humorous Data plot.<ref name=\"braga-moore\"/> At one point, the writers toyed with the idea of pitting the two crews against each other. \"We were obsessed with the poster image of the two ''Enterprises'' locked in combat: {{smallcaps|Kirk vs. Picard, One Must Die!}}\" said Moore.<ref name=\"housley-1994\"/>\n\nIn the initial draft of the screenplay, the original series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations. The opening shot would have been the entire original series cast crammed into an elevator aboard the ''Enterprise''-B, happy to be back together.<ref name=\"braga-moore\"/> The ''Enterprise''-D's end also appeared\u2014the saucer crash had first been proposed as the cliffhanger for Moore's original seventh-season finale \"All Good Things...\", which eventually became the series finale.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}} Kirk's death was initially developed in Braga, Moore, and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that \"we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list.\" After the idea of killing off a ''Next Generation'' cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. Moore recalled that \"we all sorta looked around and said, 'That might be it.' \" The studio and Shatner himself had few concerns about the plot point.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}}\n\nRefining the script also meant facing the realities of budget constraints. The initial proposal included location shooting in Hawaii, Idaho and the Midwestern United States and the total budget was over $30&nbsp;million. After negotiations, the budget was reduced to $25&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}} A revised version of the script from March 1994 included feedback from the producers, studio, actors and director; the writers changed a sequence where Harriman trained his predecessors in the ''Enterprise''-B's operation after Shatner felt the scene's joke went too far. Picard's personal tragedy was written as his brother Robert's heart attack, but Stewart suggested the loss of his entire family in a fire to add emotional impact.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|310}} The draft script's opening sequence took place on the solar observatory with two [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]-influenced characters talking shortly before the Romulans' attack; ''Next Generation'' writer [[Jeri Taylor]] suggested that the opening should be something \"fun\", leading to the switch to a holodeck promotion-at-sea.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|311}}\n\nNimoy turned down the chance to direct the feature as well as reprise the role of Spock.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}} The producers chose [[David Carson (director)|David Carson]]. The British director had no feature film experience, but had directed several episodes of ''Star Trek'', including the popular ''Next Generation'' episode \"[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]\" and the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' double-length pilot episode \"[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]\".<ref>{{cite news |title=David Carson: Director |author=Marc Shapiro |work=Star Trek Generations: Official Movie Souvenir Magazine |publisher=Titan Magazines |date=January 1995}}</ref>\n\n===Design and costumes===\n''Generations''{{'}}s [[production designer]] was ''Star Trek'' veteran [[Herman Zimmerman]], who had worked on previous ''Star Trek'' films, ''The Next Generation'' and ''Deep Space Nine''. Zimmerman collaborated with illustrator [[John Eaves]] for many designs.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|312}} Zimmerman's approach to realizing a vision of the future was to take existing and familiar designs and use them in a different manner to express living in the future. Taking cues from director [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s approach to ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', Zimmerman noted that even in the future humanity will still need life support and have the same furniture needs, so a logical approach was to start with what would remain the same and work from there.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\">{{cite journal|author1=Edgerly, Philip Thomas |author2=Herman Zimmerman |date=December 1994|title=Architrek: Designing Generations|journal=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]|volume=|issue=|issn=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|52}}\n\nTransitioning from a television screen to a movie meant that sets and designs needed to be more detailed, with a higher level of polish to stand up on the big screen. Zimmerman felt obliged to improve on the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\"/>{{rp|52\u201353}} Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; Zimmerman had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked but had never had the time or money to rework it previously.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\"/>{{rp|53}}\n\nThe script called for an entirely new location on the ''Enterprise'', stellar cartography. According to Zimmerman, the script characterized the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a circular set with three stories to give the impression the actors are inside a star map. Zimmerman's previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design, dominated by video screens.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\"/>{{rp|54}} Before the rise of large-format inkjet printers and computer graphics software in the few years before the film was made, the backlit starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> These starmaps were removed and replaced with a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] for scenes where the static images would be replaced by computer-animated star maps by Santa Barbara Studios.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The set's size made it one of the largest sets ever constructed on a Paramount lot.<ref name=\"beeler-1995\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe film marked the first appearance of the ''Enterprise''-B. The ship model was a modification of the ''Excelsior'' vessel, designed and built by Bill George and effects house [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) for ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' a decade earlier.<ref name=\"okuda\">{{cite AV media |people=[[Michael Okuda|Okuda, Michael]] |date=September 28, 2004 |title=Star Trek Generations; Text commentary |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |medium=DVD; Disc 1/2}}</ref> Coproducer Peter Lauritson, illustrator John Eaves, and Zimmerman designed the ''Enterprise''-B with additions to its hull, some of which were added so that they could depict damage to the ship without harming the underlying model's surface, and to improve the look of the ship when it was filmed from angles called for in the script.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|319}} The ship's bridge was based on previous designs for the ''Enterprise''-A and ''Excelsior'' sets he had created for ''The Undiscovered Country'', using pieces from each.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The surrounding spacedock for ''Enterprise''{{'}}s maiden voyage was a modification of the model created for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979),<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|319}} refurbished and modified by removing a row of lights to fit better into the anamorphic screen frame.<ref name=\"magid-1995\">{{cite journal|author=Magid, Ron|date=April 1995|title=ILM Creates New Universe of Effects for 'Star Trek: Generations' |journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=1|issue=76|pages=77\u201388|issn=0002-7928}}</ref>{{rp|79}}\n\nLike Zimmerman, George also took the opportunity for the ''Enterprise''-D's screen debut to touch up its exterior.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|79}} Because ''Generations'' featured the ''Enterprise''-D separating into its saucer and engineering sections, the original {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} model built by ILM for the television series was hauled out of storage.

The paint scheme was shifted towards a \"battleship grey\", with glossy tiled areas reminiscent of the original feature film ''Enterprise''.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|79}}\n\nWhile the feature film made use of new sets and props, set decorator John M. Dwyer reused previous ''Star Trek'' props or made new ones out of premade materials where possible rather than spend more money on entirely new items: a chair used to torture LaForge was created using a birthing chair, nosehair clippers and flashlights for accents; packing materials formed the shapes of set walls for the Bird of Prey bridge; and Soran's missile used a bird feeder and other garden store supplies for its interior elements.<ref name=\"okuda\"/><ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|316}} The Amargosa stellar observatory set was filled with reused props from ''The Next Generation'', with others added in deliberate nods to past episodes.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|317}}  In addition to sets used on ''The Next Generation'', other reused sets included the Klingon bridge built for ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', and ribbed plastic walls in the [[Jefferies tube]]s were repurposed from the sets of ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Other set pieces and props were original; these included paintings of Picard's ancestors and a cowboy for the locations in the Nexus.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|317}}\n\n[[Robert Blackman]], ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s long serving [[costume designer]] re-designed the Starfleet uniforms which the ''Enterprise''-D crew would wear in the film. Blackman designed militaristic-looking uniforms with rank sleeves inspired by ''The Original Series'', high collars, and jackets reminiscent of the uniforms developed for ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. Ultimately the redesign was abandoned, and the cast wore combinations of uniforms seen on the later episodes of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and the uniforms from the early episodes of ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' and throughout ''Star Trek: Voyager''; the only new addition was an Eaves-designed angular com badge that replaced the previous oval shape.

He wrote that the production moved at a \"TV-like\" pace, and principal photography wrapped after 51 days.<ref name=\"bluray-commentary\"/>{{rp|7'10\"\u20137'45\"}}<!-- add details from strange new worlds featurette from dvd -->\n\nFilming commenced Monday, March 28, 1994; ''Generations'' and ''The Next Generation'' were filmed simultaneously on different soundstages on Paramount Studio's lot. After the end of ''The Next Generation'', there was only six months before the film was scheduled to be released in theaters.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|307}} Scenes that did not feature the television series regulars were filmed first,<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|307}} starting with those in the ''Enterprise''-B deflector room.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The scenes of Harriman, Chekov and Scott reacting to Kirk's apparent death were filmed a week later, to allow time for the deflector room to be suitably distressed to visualize the damage.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nStage 7 was where the ''Enterprise''-B's bridge, deflector room and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent [[1994 Northridge earthquake]]; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elicit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the ''Enterprise''-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout. Control panels styled after those in the original ''Star Trek'' series helped suggest the age of the station.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nThe cast of ''The Next Generation'' started filming their scenes for ''Generations'' four days after wrapping on the show.<ref name=\"EW-generation x\">{{cite journal|author=Svetkey, Benjamin|date=May 6, 1994|title='Generation' Ex|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue=221|page=16}}</ref> The ''Enterprise''-D crash scenes were filmed mid-May 1994, and were among the last remaining shots before the existing ''Next Generation'' sets were demolished to make way for ''Voyager''. As a result, the crew distressed and damaged the sets for the end result of the crash more than would have been normal during the series' run.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nDespite the budget cuts, ''Generations'' shot many scenes on location. The ''Enterprise''-D promotion ceremony on the holodeck was filmed on {{ship||Lady Washington}}, a full-scale replica of the first American sailing ship to visit Japan.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|316}} Carson had fought hard to keep the shoot during budget trims, deciding to sacrifice other days in the schedule to keep the holodeck scene.<ref name=\"bluray-commentary\"/>{{rp|19'00\"\u201320'00\"}} ''Lady Washington'' was anchored at [[Marina del Rey]] and sailed out a few miles from shore over five days of shooting.

The rise's height and sloped sides required cast and crew to climb {{convert|160|ft|m}} using safety ropes and carry all provisions and equipment with them. The {{convert|110|F}} heat was difficult for all involved, especially Shatner, whose character wore an all-wool uniform.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|315}} Safety harnesses and wires were used to keep performers safe from tumbling off a precipice, and were removed digitally in postproduction.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nPicard's house in the Nexus was a private home in [[Pasadena, California]]; almost all the furnishings were custom props or outside items. Portions of the scene were shot in May 1994, followed by new shoots five months later. The revisions included adding Picard's nephew Ren\u00e9 to his imagined Christmas celebration with his family.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The house of Kirk's Nexus recollections was located in Lone Pine, California, with the cabin filled with props to represent Kirk's career, from a Klingon bat'leth to a painting of ''Enterprise''.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nAs originally filmed, Kirk was shot in the back and killed by Soran. Test audiences reacted negatively to the death, so the scene was rewritten and reshot over two weeks so that instead, Kirk sacrifices himself by leaping across a broken walkway to retrieve Soran's control pad and de-cloak the trilithium warhead. The re-shoot finale caused the film to go over budget, costing $35 million.<ref name=\"Star Trek FAQ 2.0\"/> As the production crew had already spent weeks removing traces of their shoot from the Valley of Fire, the set had to be rebuilt under a very tight schedule, followed by effects work to remove wires and rigging in time for the footage to be included in the final cut.<ref name=\"okuda\"/><ref name=\"trekmovie-carson on kirk\">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=May 12, 2011|url=http://trekmovie.com/2011/05/12/star-trek-generations-director-carson-on-reshooting-death-of-kirk/|title=Star Trek Generations Director Carson on Reshooting Death of Kirk|website=[[TrekMovie.com|Trekmovie]]|publisher=SciFanatic Network|accessdate=November 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Effects===\n''Generations''{{'}} special effects tasks were split between the television series' effects vendors and ILM.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|313}} ILM CG Supervisor John Schlag recalled that it was easy to recruit staff who wanted to work on ''Star Trek''; working on the film \"gave me a chance to be a part of the whole ''Trek'' thing [...] ILM is practically an entire company filled with ''Trek'' geeks.\"<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|88}} Effects supervisor [[John Knoll]] recalled that ''Generations''{{'}} screenwriters filled the initial drafts with exciting\u2014and expensive\u2014effects.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|78}} Knolls's team then storyboarded the effects sequences, figuring out how to best service the script as cheaply as possible. When even those estimates proved too costly, ILM continued cutting shots. \"[We had] nothing left to cut, and we still had to cut stuff out,\" Knoll recalled.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|79}}\n\nThe previous ''Star Trek'' films had used conventional [[motion control]] techniques to record multiple passes of the starship models and miniatures. For ''Generations'', the effects artists began using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and models for certain shots.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|78}} No physical shooting models were ever built for the refugee ships, although George recalled that he found it easier to create a quick physical miniature for CG modeler Rob Coleman to iterate from, rather than try to articulate his feedback without it.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|84}} Other CGI elements included the solar collapses, and the Veridian III planet.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|319}} Knoll also used a digital version of the ''Enterprise''-D for the warp effect; the limitations of the motion-control programming and [[slitscan]] effect for the original meant that the effect \"barely holds up\", Knoll said, whereas the CG recreation could keep consistent lighting throughout.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|88}} While digital techniques were used for many sequences and ships, a few new models were physically built, including the observatory, built by model shop foreman John Goodson.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|320}}\n\nThe climactic battle between ''Enterprise'' and the Klingons over Veridian III was accomplished using traditional motion control, but without the budget for practical explosions and special breakaway models, the impacts and battle damage were simulated with practical compositing tricks and computer-generated effects, while the final destruction of the Bird of Prey was a reuse of footage from ''The Undiscovered Country''.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|80}} The weapons fire and energy bolts were hand-animated, but Knoll had a different idea for the [[photon torpedoes]]. A fan of the impressive, arcing look of the torpedoes from ''The Motion Picture'', Knoll scanned in footage from the film and turned to computer-generated effects. A simulator program created a similar look that could be animated from any point the effects artists wanted, without the expense and tedium required to replicate the original effect, produced by shining lasers through a crystal in a smoky environment.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|81}}\n\n[[File:Startrek generationshd0192 nexusribbon.png|thumb|right|The USS ''Enterprise''-B enters the Nexus energy ribbon. The ribbon and ''Enterprise'' in this scene are computer-generated; because the camera is following ''Enterprise'' so closely, the effects artists had to do substantial work making sure the modeling held up to the scrutiny of the big screen.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|86}}|alt=A close-up view of the hull of a Starship surrounded by a ribbonlike vortex of reddish-purple electric energy.]]\nCarson described the Nexus energy ribbon as the true villain of the film; ILM was responsible for conceiving what the ribbon would look like with no natural analog.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|81\u201382}} \"When creating something from scratch, it's always important to rough out the whole thing [...] because there are so many paths you can explore, it's easy to get bogged down,\" recalled effects co-supervisor Alex Seiden, who had worked as a technical director on the [[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country#Effects|planetary explosion of Praxis]] from ''The Undiscovered Country''.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|83}} Knoll decided the ribbon was a rip through universes, filled with chaotic energy, taking inspiration from images he had seen of magnetic fields around Uranus from a [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] simulation. The airfoil-shaped core of the undulating ribbon was enhanced with electrical tendrils.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|82}} To sell the ribbon's vastness in space shots where no sense of scale would be available, Seiden and George created a debris field of embers that trailed the ribbon.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|83}} The inside of the ribbon was conceptualized as similar to a dense electrical storm, with tendrils of electricity fogging the screen.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|83}} Because of the complex interplay of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and ''Enterprise''-B should be CG models.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|85}} To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the physical model appear seamless, ILM created a [[wire-frame model|wireframe]] of the physical model, with the computer-generated model's textures taken from photos of the physical model, shot in flat light with a long lens.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|85}} The tendril strike that sends Kirk into the Nexus was simulated with the layering of multiple pieces of animation, including CG explosions Knoll rendered on his personal computer and a recycled explosion effect from ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|86}}\n\nThe ''Enterprise''-D crash sequence was filmed in a {{convert|40|by|80|ft||adj=on}} forest floor set extended by matte paintings,<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|320}} built outside so ILM could use natural light. A {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} model ''Enterprise'' saucer was constructed specifically for the shots; the model's size gave it the right sense of scale for flying dirt and debris, an illusion enhanced by shooting with a high-speed camera to give the saucer the expected slow movement of a massive object.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> ILM shot its crew members walking about their parking lot and matted the footage onto the top of the saucer to represent the Starfleet personnel evacuating the saucer section.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|320}}\n\n===Music===\n[[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], the principal composer for ''The Next Generation'', was given the task of writing ''Generations''{{'}} score. Critic Jeff Bond wrote that while McCarthy's score was \"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. The film's opening music is a choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the ''Enterprise''-B, McCarthy used low brass chords. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a sound not used on ''The Next Generation''), while the scene ends with dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.<ref name=\"bond-1999\">{{cite book |author=Bond, Jeff |year=1999 |title=The Music of Star Trek |publisher=Lone Eagle Publishing Company |isbn=1580650120}}</ref>{{rp|152}}\n\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the ''Enterprise''. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. A broad fanfare\u2014the film's only distinct theme\u2014first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. This theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s first season, notes from the theme for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', and [[Alexander Courage]]'s [[Theme from Star Trek|''Star Trek'' theme]].<ref name=\"bond-1999\"/>{{rp|152}} For the final battle of Kirk and Picard against Soran, McCarthy used staccato music to accentuate the fistfight. For Kirk's death, McCarthy mated lyrical strings with another statement of the Courage theme, while a shot of Picard standing over Kirk's grave is scored with more pomp. The Courage theme plays again at the film's close.<ref name=\"bond-1999\"/>{{rp|152\u20133}}\n\nThe soundtrack was released in 1994 in a two-disc format on [[GNP Crescendo Records]].

He has lectured in the United States, Europe, Africa, and Australia on his ideas about the central influence on human history of various misconceptions and metaphors about sex that form the basis of ''Eve's Seed''.
