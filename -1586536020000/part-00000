{"title_page": "The Wolves (play)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n\n'''''The Wolves''''' is a 2016 play by Sarah DeLappe. It premiered [[Off-Broadway]] at [[The Duke at 42nd Street]] in September 2016 and centers on the experiences of high school girls through their weekly Saturday morning pre-game soccer warmups. The play was a finalist for the 2017 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\n''The Wolves'' is set in an indoor soccer facility.  Each scene depicts the nine teenage girls who make up the Wolves, a soccer team, warming up before their game each week.  \n\nThe first scene opens with discussion of a murderous Cambodian dictator, and conversations stem from there.  Overlapping dialogue illustrates an atmosphere where each group of girls have their own, specific conversations while still chiming in on the main topic.  These spin-offs include period gossip, talk of boyfriends, their coach's obvious hangovers, and speculations about the new girl, #46, who is said to live in a \u201cyogurt\u201d (a [[yurt]]) and repeatedly burst in conversations at the most inappropriate times such as mentioning how the team's striker, #7, had an abortion. \n \nIn every scene, the girls are going through a stretching routine led by #25.  This is one of the only repetitive actions, besides #7's constant use of the word \u201cfuck\u201d and the goalie, #00, suffering from social anxiety attacks and consequently running outside to vomit. The girls sometimes continue their gossip from the previous week, bringing new drama and topics of conversation.  #46 slowly begins to fit in and most girls seem to grow more comfortable with each other as the season progresses.\n\nA ski trip taken by #7 and #14 before the second-to-last game leaves the team suffering from injuries and internal drama.  #7 suffers a season-ending injury, which forces #46 to step up.  She excels, and is even scouted along with two other girls while the rest watch enviously from the sidelines.  #7 and #14 bring their ski trip squabble back to the field as well.  #14 expresses her anger towards her friend about her neglect during the trip and being left with a strange guy (#7's boyfriend's friend).  They fight, and end the day on a terrible note.\n\nTragedy strikes before the final game, which causes #00 to break down in the stadium at night, but also overcome her anxiety.  The others are grieving, and assume among themselves that the others will ditch the game. With a possible forfeit looming, it feels as though the Wolves\u2019 season will end on the lowest possible note, until all of the other girls come to the stadium one by one, allowing them to play. As they rally together, Soccer Mom suddenly approaches them, giving them a delirious speech about how they have banded together in spite of everything, leaving everyone speechless.\n\n==Production history==\nThe play had a workshop at [[Playwrights Horizons]] Theater School in 2015 in association with Clubbed Thumb, where the play had been developed.<ref name=black/>\n\nThe play was originally produced Off-Broadway at The Duke on 42nd Street by The Playwrights Realm in association with New York Stage & Film and Vassar's Powerhouse Theatre season.

The ingredients for common dishes were obtained from locally raised livestock. These ranged from [[water buffalo]]s/[[carabao]]s, [[chicken]], and [[pigs]] to various kinds of fish and other [[seafood]]. In 3200 BCE, Austronesians from southern [[China]] ([[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]]) and [[Taiwan]] settled in the region that is now called the Philippines. They brought with them knowledge of [[rice]] cultivation and other farming practices which increased the number and variety of edible dish ingredients available for cooking.<ref>Knuuttila, Kyle.

Many of these food items and dishes retained their original Hokkien names, such as  ''[[pancit]]'' ({{zh|c=\u4fbf\u00ea\u98df|poj=pi\u0101n-\u00ea-si\u030dt}})({{zh|c=\u6241\u98df|p=bi\u01cen sh\u00ed}}), and ''[[lumpia]]'' ({{zh|t=\u6f64\u9905|poj=j\u016bn-pi\u00e1\u207f, l\u016bn-pi\u00e1\u207f}}).<ref name=\"dw\" />  The [[Chinese food]] introduced during this period were food of the workers and traders, which became a staple of the noodle shops (''[[panciteria]]s''), and can be seen in dishes like ''[[arroz caldo]]'' (congee), ''sinangag'' ([[fried rice]]).\n\nThe [[China|Chinese]] had been trading with the Philippines since the early 9th or 10th centuries. Soon after the Chinese began to immigrate there in the 16th century. Chinese influence is best seen in [[pancit]] noodles and [[lumpia]] spring rolls. There are also many ingredients such as [[soy sauce]], black beans, [[tofu]], pork, etc., that are seen in Filipino cooking. \n\nTrade and shared cultures with various neighboring kingdoms of [[Malacca]] and [[Srivijaya]] in [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], and [[Java]] meant shared if not adopted foods and cooking methods, which remain central to Filipino cuisine today. Some of these are the use of fish or shrimp-based ingredients such as  ''[[bagoong]]'' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''[[belacan]]'') and [[patis (sauce)|''patis'']] and variants. The most known Philippine variant of the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''[[ketupat]]'', or rice packed in banana leaves, is the ''[[puso]]'' of [[Cebu]] (also called ''bugnoy'' in other parts of [[Visayas|the Visayas]]), ''piyoso'' in [[Moro people|Moro]] cultures (e.g. [[Maranao people|Meranao]], [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]], [[Iranun people|Iranun]]), and ''patupat'' in northern Luzon. [[Moro people|Moro cuisine]] in particular is known for [[kuning]],  ''[[sambal]]'', and the ''[[rendang]]'' dish, although is more popularly associated with [[Indonesian cuisine]] or [[Malaysian cuisine]]. A [[tamarind]]-based Malay dish called ''singgang'' is also analogous to the more widely-popular Filipino ''[[sinigang]]''.\n\nRice and coconuts as staples throughout the archipelago as in the rest of Southeast Asia meant similar or adopted dishes and methods based on these crops. Some of these are evident in the infusion of [[coconut milk]] particularly in the renowned ''[[laing (food)|laing]]'' and ''sinilihan'' (popularized as [[Bicol Express]]) of Bikol. Other regional variants of stews or soups commonly tagged as ''[[ginataan]](g)'' or \"with coconut milk\" also abound Filipino kitchens and food establishments. A dish from the [[Visayas]] simmered in coconut water, ideally in bamboo, is the ''[[binakol]]'' usually with chicken as the main ingredient.\n\nThrough the trade with the [[Malaysia|Malay]]-[[Indonesia]]n kingdoms, cuisine from as far away as [[India]] and [[Arabia]] further enriched the palettes of the local Austronesians. Particularly in the southern regions of [[Mindanao]] where there is more direct contact with cultures of Malaysia and Indonesia, popular dishes include ''[[korma|kurmah]]'', ''[[satay|satti]]'' (local satay), and ''[[biryani]]''. Indian influences can also be noted in rice-based delicacies such as ''[[bibingka]]'' (analogous to the Indonesian ''[[Bibingka#Bibingka in Indonesia|bingka]]''), ''[[puto]]'', and ''[[puto bumbong]]'', where the latter two are plausibly derived from the [[South Indian cuisine|south Indian]] ''[[puttu]]'', which also has variants throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] (e.g. ''[[kue putu]]'', ''[[putu mangkok]]''). The ''[[kare-kare]]'', more popular in Luzon, on the other hand could trace its origins from the [[Seven Years' War]] when the [[British occupation of Manila|British occupied Manila]] for 2 years mostly with [[sepoys]] (Indian conscripts), who had to improvise Indian dishes given the lack of spices in the Philippines to make [[curry]]. This is said to explain the name and its supposed thick, yellow-to-orange [[annatto]] and peanut-based sauce, which alludes to a type of curry.\n\nThe [[Spain|Spanish]] came to the [[Philippines]] in 1521 and controlled its islands by 1565. The Spanish ruled until 1898. Filipinos began using the Spanish ''[[sofrito]]'' of [[Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Onion|onions,]] and [[garlic]] cooked in oil for their dishes. Many [[Spanish cuisine|cooking customs and techniques]] were adapted as well as various dishes. \n\nSince the Spanish ruled both Mexico and the Philippines, the two were inevitably connected. During the years of 1565-1815 the Spanish transported various goods between the two colonies. New crops were brought from the New World to the Philippines such as [[chocolate]], [[Maize|corn]], [[Potato|potatoes]], tomatoes, [[Pineapple|pineapples,]] [[Bell pepper|bell peppers]], [[Pachyrhizus erosus|jicama,]] [[chayote]], [[avocado]], [[Peanut|peanuts]], and [[annatto]]. The Mexicans received [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[tamarind]], [[Coconut|coconuts]], and [[Mango|mangoes]] from Philippine soil. \n\n[[File:1146Bibingka Puto bumbong making Philippines 14.jpg|thumb|Traditionally prepared ''bibingka'' in [[Baliuag, Bulacan]]]]\n[[Spain|Spanish]] colonizers and friars in the 16th century brought with them produce from the [[Americas]] like [[chili pepper]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[corn]], [[potato]]es, and the method of [[saut\u00e9ing]] with [[garlic]] and [[onion]]s. Chili leaves are frequently used as a cooking green. Hispanic dishes were eventually incorporated into Filipino cuisine with the more complex dishes usually being prepared for special occasions. Some dishes such as ''[[arroz a la valenciana]]'' remain largely the same in the Philippine context.  Some have been adapted or have come to take on a slightly or significantly different meaning.  ''[[Arroz a la cubana]]'' served in the Philippines usually includes ground beef [[picadillo]].  Philippine ''longganisa'' despite its name is more akin to ''[[chorizo]]'' than Spanish ''[[longaniza]]'' (in [[Visayan]] regions, it is still known as ''chorizo''). ''Morcon'' is likely to refer to a beef roulade dish not the bulbous specialty Spanish [[sausage]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish\u2013American War|Spanish-American War]] in 1898, the United States controlled the Philippines due to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]]. The soldiers of the US introduced Filipinos to [[Hot dog|hot dogs]], [[Hamburger|hamburgers]], [[fried chicken]], and [[ice cream]]. They also introduced convenient foods such as [[Spam (food)|spam,]] [[corned beef]], [[instant coffee]]. and [[Evaporated milk|evaporated milk.]]\n\nToday, Filipino cuisine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinoyrecipe.net/|title=Filipino Recipes Collection by Pinoy Recipe at iba pa. (2007) |publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref> continues to evolve as new techniques and styles of cooking, and ingredients find their way into the country. Traditional dishes both simple and elaborate, indigenous and foreign-influenced, are seen as are more current popular international dishes and [[fast food]] fare. However, the Filipino diet is higher in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol than other Asian diets.<ref>{{cite book |title=Food and Culture |last=Goyan Kittler |first=Pamela |last2=Sucher |first2=Kathryn |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location= |isbn= |page=384 |accessdate=July 18, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKdbaMY5AHEC&lpg=PA385&ots=kObWpXTawg&dq=%22Filipino%20Americans%22%20Texas&pg=PA384#v=onepage&q=%22Filipino%20Americans%22%20Texas&f=false }}</ref>\n\nFilipino food is widely shaped by individual traditions and customs. The same dish may and will differ between households. One dished prepared by your mother for example, may be completely different from your aunts. \n\nFilipino cuisine may be confusing to some people due to it being hard to determine what is actually Filipino. Confusion occurs due to the consistent growing phases of Filipino culture. Filipino culture has been constantly changing throughout history, gaining influence from various cultures and inevitably has evolved. Filipino food today has been shaped by history and society of many unique and affluent cultures. Influences from [[China]], [[India]], [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], and many other countries are seen throughout Filipino food and culture due to the agricultural trading of the times. Influences from [[Spain]] and [[United States|America]] are seen through past colonization of the country. The rest of the world has influenced Filipinos due to global communication which is the basis of connecting societies internationally. Filipino food can be studied and given a definition through the process of indigenizing its people throughout centuries. Instead of fighting its adaptations to specific cultures, they allowed its submersion which in turn, influenced their cuisines, foods, and ingredients. \u00a0.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Pakbetjf9853.JPG|thumb|''[[Pinakbet]]'']]\nFilipino cuisine centres around the combination of sweet (''tamis''), sour (''asim''), and salty (''alat''),<ref name=\"philstar.com 2015-1\" /> although in Bicol, the Cordilleras and among Muslim Filipinos, spicy (''anghang'') is a base of cooking flavor.\n\nCounterpoint is a feature in Filipino cuisine which normally comes in a pairing of something sweet with something salty, and results in surprisingly pleasing combinations. Examples include: ''[[champorado]]'' (a sweet cocoa rice porridge), being paired with ''[[Daing|tuyo]]'' (salted, sun-dried fish); ''[[dinuguan]]'' (a savory stew made of pig's blood and innards), paired with ''[[puto]]'' (sweet, steamed rice cakes); unripe fruits such as green [[mango]]es (which are only slightly sweet but very sour), are eaten dipped in salt or ''bagoong''; the use of [[cheese]] (which is salty-sweet) in sweetcakes (such as ''[[bibingka]]'' and ''puto''), as well as an [[ice cream]] flavoring.\n\n[[Vinegar]] is a common ingredient. ''[[Philippine adobo|Adobo]]'' is popular<ref name=\"philstar.com 2015-1\" /> not solely for its simplicity and ease of preparation, but also for its ability to be stored for days without spoiling, and even improve in flavor with a day or two of storage.  ''[[Tinapa]]'' is a smoke-cured fish while ''tuyo'', ''daing'', and ''dangit'' are corned, sun-dried fish popular because they can last for weeks without spoiling, even without refrigeration.\n\nCooking and eating in the Philippines has traditionally been an informal and communal affair centered around the family kitchen. Filipinos traditionally eat three main meals a day: ''agahan'' or ''almusal'' (breakfast), ''tanghal\u00edan'' (lunch), and ''hapunan'' (dinner) plus an afternoon snack called ''[[meri\u00e9nda]]'' (also called ''minand\u00e1l'' or ''minind\u00e1l''). Snacking is normal. Dinner, while still the main meal, is smaller than other countries.  Usually, either breakfast or lunch is the largest meal.  Food tends to be served all at once and not in courses.  Unlike many of their Asian counterparts Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks. Due to Western influence, food is often eaten using flatware\u2014forks, knives, spoons\u2014but the primary pairing of utensils used at a Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork. The traditional way of eating is with the hands, especially dry dishes such as ''inihaw'' or ''prito''. The diner will take a bite of the main dish, then eat rice pressed together with his fingers. This practice, known as ''kamayan'', is rarely seen in urbanized areas.  However, Filipinos tend to feel the spirit of ''kamayan'' when eating amidst nature during out-of-town trips, beach vacations, and town fiestas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/philippines/phileat.html |title=Philippines \u2013 Eating Habits & Hospitality |accessdate=2006-11-21 |publisher=The Global Gourmet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624024611/http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/philippines/phileat.html |archive-date=2011-06-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Common dishes==\n{{see also|List of Philippine dishes}}\nAs in most Asian countries, the staple food in the Philippines is [[rice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice in the Philippines|url=http://www.irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=10718:rice-in-the-philippines&lang=en|publisher=International Rice Research Institute|access-date=2013-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204104318/http://irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=10718:rice-in-the-philippines&lang=en|archive-date=2013-02-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is most often steamed and always served with meat, fish and vegetable dishes. Leftover rice is often fried with garlic to make ''[[sinangag]]'', which is usually served at breakfast together with a fried egg and [[Curing (food preservation)|cured meat]] or sausages. Rice is often enjoyed with the sauce or broth from the main dishes.  In some regions, rice is mixed with salt, condensed milk, cocoa, or coffee. Rice flour is used in making sweets, cakes and other pastries. Sticky rice with cocoa, also called ''champorado'' is also a common dish served with [[Daing|''tuyo'' or dried herring]].\n[[File:Philippine Chicken curry.jpg|thumb|Philippine Chicken curry with its popular coconut milk sauce]]\nA variety of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are often used in cooking. [[Cooking banana|Plantain]]s (also called ''[[Saba Banana|saba]]'' in Filipino),  [[kalamansi]], [[guava]]s (''bayabas''), [[mango]]es, [[papaya]]s, and [[pineapple]]s lend a distinctly tropical flair in many dishes, but mainstay green leafy vegetables like water spinach (''kangkong''), Chinese cabbage (''petsay''), Napa cabbage (''petsay wombok''), cabbage (''repolyo'') and other vegetables like eggplants (''talong'') and yard-long beans (''sitaw'') are just as commonly used. [[Coconut]]s are ubiquitous. Coconut meat is often used in desserts, [[coconut milk]] (''kakang gata'') in sauces, and [[coconut oil]] for frying. Abundant harvests of root crops like potatoes, carrots, [[taro]] (''gabi''), [[cassava]] (''kamoteng kahoy''), purple yam (''[[Purple yam|ube]]''), and [[sweet potato]] (''kamote'') make them readily available.  The combination of tomatoes (''kamatis''), garlic (''bawang''), and onions (''sibuyas'') is found in many dishes.\n[[File:Mushroom sisig.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sisig]]]]\nMeat staples include [[chicken]], [[pork]], [[beef]], and [[fish]]. [[Seafood]] is popular as a result of the bodies of water surrounding the archipelago.  Popular catches include [[tilapia]], [[catfish]] (''hito''), [[milkfish]] (''bangus''), [[grouper]] (''lapu-lapu''), [[shrimp]] (''hipon''), prawns (''sugpo''), [[mackerel]] (''galunggong'', ''hasa-hasa''), swordfish (''isdang-ispada''), oysters (''talaba''), [[mussel]]s (''tahong''), [[clam]]s (''halaan'' and ''tulya''), large and small [[crab]]s (''alimango'' and ''alimasag'' respectively), [[game fish]], sablefish, tuna, [[cod]] (''bakalaw''), [[Indo-Pacific blue marlin|blue marlin]], and [[squid]]/[[cuttlefish]] (both called ''pusit''). Also popular are [[seaweed]]s (''damong dagat''), [[abalone]], and [[eel]] (''igat'').\n\nThe most common way of having fish is to have it salted, pan-fried or deep-fried, and then eaten as a simple meal with rice and vegetables. It may also be cooked in a sour broth of tomatoes or [[tamarind]] as in ''pangat'', prepared with vegetables and a souring agent to make ''[[sinigang]]'', simmered in vinegar and peppers to make ''paksiw'', or roasted over hot charcoal[[File:Leche flan Filipinas.jpg|thumbnail|[[Cr\u00e8me caramel|Leche flan]]]]or wood (''[[grilling|inihaw]]''). Other preparations include ''[[escabeche]]'' (sweet and sour), ''relleno'' (deboned and stuffed), or \"[[kinilaw]]\" (similar to ceviche; marinated in vinegar or [[kalamansi]]). Fish can be preserved by being smoked (''[[tinapa]]'') or sun-dried (''tuyo'' or ''daing'').\n\nFood is often served with various [[dipping sauce]]s. Fried food is often dipped either in [[vinegar]] with onions, [[soy sauce]] with juice squeezed from ''[[Calamansi|Kalamansi]]'' (Philippine lime or ''calamansi''). ''Patis'' ([[fish sauce]]) may be mixed with ''kalamansi'' as dipping sauce for most seafood or mixed with a stew called [[nilaga]]. [[Fish sauce]], fish paste (''[[Bagoong terong|bagoong]]''), [[shrimp paste]] (''bagoong alamang'') and crushed [[ginger]] root (''luya'') are [[condiment]]s that are often added to dishes during the cooking process or when served.\n\n==Breakfast==\n[[File:Tapsilog in saudi arabia.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tapsilog]]'']]\nA traditional Filipino breakfast might include ''[[pandesal]]'' (small bread rolls), ''[[kesong puti]]'' (fresh, unripened, white Filipino cheese, traditionally made from carabao's milk)  ''[[champorado]]'' (chocolate rice porridge), ''[[Silog (dish)|silog]]'' which is ''sinangag'' ([[fried rice|garlic fried rice]]) or sinaing, with [[fried egg]] and meat\u2014such as ''[[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|tapa]]'', ''[[Longganisa#Philippines|longganisa]]'', ''[[tocino]]'', ''[[corned beef|karne norte]]'' (corned beef), or fish such as ''daing na bangus'' <!--(/d\u0259-\u012dN-n\u0259-b\u0259-Ngus/)--> (salted and dried [[milkfish]])\u2014or ''itlog na pula'' ([[salted duck egg]]s).  Coffee is also commonly served particularly ''[[kape Barako|kapeng barako]]'', a variety of coffee produced in the mountains of Batangas noted for having a strong flavor.\n\nCertain [[portmanteau]]s in Filipino have come into use to describe popular combinations of items in a Filipino breakfast.  An example of such a combination order is ''kankamtuy'':  an order of '''''kan'''in'' (rice), '''''kam'''atis'' (tomatoes) and '''''tuy'''o'' (dried fish).  Another is ''tapsi'': an order of '''''tap'''a'' and '''''si'''nang\u00e1g'' or '''''si'''naing''. Other examples include variations using a ''[[Silog (dish)|silog]]'' suffix, usually some kind of meat served with '''''si'''nang\u00e1g'' or '''''si'''naing'', and ''it'''log''''' (egg). The three most commonly seen ''silogs'' are ''[[tapsilog]]'' (having ''tapa'' as the meat portion), ''tocilog'' (having tocino as the meat portion), and ''longsilog'' (having longganisa as the meat portion). Other ''silogs'' include ''hotsilog'' (with a [[hot dog]]), ''bangsilog'' (with [[milkfish|''bangus'' (milkfish)]]), ''dangsilog'' (with [[rabbitfish|''danggit'' (rabbitfish)]]), ''spamsilog'' (with [[spam (food)|spam]]), ''adosilog'' (with adobo), ''chosilog'' (with [[chorizo]]), ''chiksilog'' (with chicken), ''cornsilog'' (with [[corned beef]]), and ''litsilog'' (with [[lechon|lechon/litson]]). ''Pankaplog'' is slang for a breakfast consisting of ''[[pandesal]]'', ''[[Kape Barako|kape]]'' (coffee), and ''itlog'' (egg), it is also a double entendre meaning to fondle breasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pinoyslang.com/define/pakaplog |title=Pakaplog |publisher=Pinoy Slang |accessdate=2008-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205172847/http://pinoyslang.com/define/pakaplog/ |archivedate=2008-12-05 }}</ref> An establishment that specializes in such meals is called a ''tapsihan'' or ''tapsilugan''.\n\n==Merienda==\n[[File:Putoricecakes.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Puto]]'' in banana leaf liners]]\n[[File:0999jfPistang Bayan Pasalubong Philippine delicacies Bustos Bulacanfvf 18.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ube halaya]]'', ''[[sapin-sapin]]'', ''[[kalamay]]'', ''[[Suman (food)|suman]]'', and various other ''[[kakanin]]'']]\n''[[Merienda]]'' is taken from the Spanish, and is a light meal or snack especially in the afternoon, similar to the concept of afternoon [[tea (meal)|tea]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Francia | first=L. | title=Passport Philippines: Your Pocket Guide to Filipino Business, Customs & Etiquette | publisher=World Trade Press | series=Passport to the world | year=1997 | isbn=978-1-885073-40-2 | url=https://archive.org/details/passportphilippi00fran | url-access=registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/passportphilippi00fran/page/86 86]}}</ref> If the meal is taken close to dinner, it is called ''merienda cena'', and may be served instead of dinner.<ref>{{cite book | last=Davidson | first=A. | last2=Jaine | first2=T. | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=OUP Oxford | series=Oxford Companions | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-19-104072-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA514 | page=514}}</ref>\n\nFilipinos have a number of options to take with ''kap\u00e9'', which is the Filipino pronunciation of caf\u00e9 ([[coffee]]): breads and pastries like ''[[pandesal]]'', ''[[Ensaimada|ensaymada]]'' (buttery ''[[brioche]]'' covered in grated cheese and sugar), ''[[Bakpia|hopia]]'' (pastries similar to [[mooncake]]s filled with [[mung bean paste]]) and [[empanada]] (savoury, meat-filled [[pasty|pasties]]).

''[[Leche Flan|Leche flan]]'' is a type of caramel custard made with eggs and milk similar to the French [[creme caramel]]. ''Leche flan'' (the local term for the original Spanish ''flan de leche'', literally \"milk flan\")  is a heavier version of the Spanish flan made with condensed milk and more egg yolks. ''Leche flan'' is usually steamed over an open flame or stove top, although on rare occasions it can also be seen baked. ''Leche flan'' is a staple in celebratory feasts.\n\nA heavier version of ''leche flan'', ''[[Cr\u00e8me caramel|tocino del cielo]]'', is similar, but has significantly more egg yolks and sugar.\n\n[[File:Bag of pandesal (rotated).jpg|thumb|left|Bag of [[pandesal]]]]\nThe ''egg pie'' with a very rich egg custard filling is a mainstay in local bakeries.  It is typically baked so that the exposed custard on top is browned. [[Buko pie|''Buko'' pie]] is made with a filling made from young coconut meat and dairy. Mini pastries like ''[[Turrones de cas\u00fay|turrones de casuy]]'' are made up of cashew [[marzipan]] wrapped with a wafer made to resemble a candy wrapper but take on a miniature look of a pie in a size of about a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]. There is also ''[[napoleones]]'' \u2013 again with all the vowels pronounced \u2013 a [[mille-feuille]] pastry stuffed with a sweet milk-based filling.\n\nThere are hard pastries like ''[[biskotso]]'' a crunchy, sweet, twice-baked bread.  Another baked goody is ''sinipit'' which is a sweet pastry covered in a crunchy sugar glaze, made to resemble a length of rope.  Similar to ''sinipit'' is a snack eaten on roadsides colloquially called ''shingaling''. It is hollow but crunchy with a salty flavor.\n\n[[File:Mango float, a Filipino icebox cake version of Crema de Fruta 01.jpg|thumb|An [[icebox cake]] version of ''[[crema de fruta]]'' made with cream, graham crackers, condensed milk, and ripe mangoes.]]\nFor a softer treat there is ''[[Mam\u00f3n|mamon]]'' a chiffon-type cake sprinkled with sugar, its name derived from a slang Spanish term for breast. There's also ''[[crema de fruta]]'', which is an elaborate sponge cake topped in succeeding layers of cream, custard, candied fruit, and gelatin. Similar to a sponge cake is ''mamoncillo'' which generally refers to slices taken from a large ''mamon cake'', but it is unrelated to the [[Mamoncillo|fruit]] of the same name. Sandwich pastries like ''[[inipit]]'' are made with two thin layers of chiffon sandwiching a filling of custard that is topped with butter and sugar. Another ''mamon'' variant is ''mamon tostada'', basically ''mamoncillo'' toasted to a crunchy texture.\n\nStuffed pastries that reflect both Western and Eastern influence are common. One can find [[empanada]]s, a turnover-type pastry filled with a savory-sweet meat filling. Typically filled with ground meat and raisins, it can be deep fried or baked.  ''[[Siopao]]'' is the local version of Chinese [[baozi]]. ''Buchi'' is another snack that is likely of Chinese origin.  Bite-sized, ''buchi'' is made of deep-fried dough balls (often from rice flour) filled with a sweet mung bean paste, and coated on the outside with sesame seeds; some variants also have ''[[Purple yam|ube]]'' as the filling. There are also many varieties of the mooncake-like ''[[Bakpia|hopia]]'', which come in different shapes (from a flat, circular stuffed form, to cubes), and have different textures (predominantly using flaky pastry, but sometimes like the ones in [[Mooncake|mooncakes]]) and fillings.\n\n==Fiesta food==\n[[File:Lechon.jpg|thumb|right|Lech\u00f3n being roasted in [[Cadiz, Negros Occidental]], Philippines.]]\n\nFor festive occasions, people band together and prepare more sophisticated dishes. Tables are often laden with expensive and labor-intensive treats requiring hours of preparation.

It is usually a whole roasted pig, but suckling pigs (''lechonillo'', or ''lechon de leche'') or cattle calves (''lechong baka'') can also be prepared in place of the popular adult pig.  It is typically served with ''lechon'' sauce, which is traditionally made from the roasted pig's liver.  Other dishes include ''hamonado'' (honey-cured beef, pork or chicken), ''relleno'' (stuffed chicken or milkfish), ''[[mechado]]'', ''afritada'', ''caldereta'', ''puchero'', [[paella]], ''menudo'', ''morcon'', ''embutido'' (referring to a meatloaf dish, not a sausage as understood elsewhere), ''suman'' (a savory rice and [[coconut milk]] concoction steamed in leaves such as banana), and ''[[pancit]] canton''.  The table may also be have various sweets and pastries such as ''[[Leche Flan|leche flan]]'', ''[[Purple yam|ube]]'', ''sapin-sapin'', ''sorbetes'' (ice creams), ''totong'' or ''sinukmani'' (a rice, coconut milk and mongo bean pudding), ''ginataan'' (a coconut milk pudding with various root vegetables and [[tapioca pearls]]), and ''[[gulaman]]'' (an [[agar]] [[Gelatin dessert|jello-like ingredient or dessert]]).\n\nChristmas Eve, known as ''[[Nochebuena|Noche Buena]]'', is the most important feast. During this evening, the star of the table is the Christmas [[ham]] and [[Edam cheese]] (''queso de bola'').  Supermarkets are laden with these treats during the Christmas season and are popular giveaways by Filipino companies in addition to red wine, brandy, groceries, or pastries. Available mostly during the Christmas season and sold in front of churches along with ''[[bibingka]]'', ''puto bumbong'' is purple colored ground sticky rice steamed vertically in small bamboo tubes.\n\nMore common at celebrations than in everyday home meals, ''[[Lumpia#Lumpiang Sariwa|lumpiang sariwa]]'', or ''fresh lumpia'', is a fresh spring roll that consists of a soft crepe wrapped around a filling that can include strips of ''kamote'' (sweet potato), ''singkamas'' ([[jicama]]), bean sprouts, green beans, cabbage, carrots and meat (often pork). It can be served warm or cold and typically with a sweet peanut and garlic sauce. ''Ukoy'' is shredded papaya combined with small shrimp (and occasionally bean sprouts) and fried to make shrimp patties. It is often eaten with vinegar seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper. Both ''lumpiang sariwa'' and ''ukoy'' are often served together in Filipino parties. ''Lumpiang sariwa'' has [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] origins, having been derived from [[popiah]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Lumpiang Shanghai (Filipino Spring Rolls) | work = Manila Spoon | author = Abby | url = http://www.manilaspoon.com/2012/11/lumpiang-shanghai-filipino-spring-rolls.html}}</ref>\n\n==Regional specialties==\n[[File:Sapin-sapin with sprinkled with crumbs.jpg|right|thumb|''Sapin-sapin'', a sweet Filipino rice-based delicacy similar to [[mochi]]]]\n[[File:Lafamilia22jf.JPG|thumb|Filipino cuisine prepared in [[Baliuag, Bulacan]].]]\n\nThe Philippine islands are home to various ethnic groups resulting in varied regional cuisines.\n\n===Luzonese cuisine===\n[[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]], from the rugged [[Ilocos Region]], boast of a diet heavy in boiled or steamed vegetables and freshwater fish, but they are particularly fond of dishes flavored with ''[[Bagoong terong|bagoong]]'', fermented fish that is often used instead of salt. Ilocanos often season boiled vegetables with ''[[bagoong monamon]]'' (fermented anchovy paste) to produce ''[[pinakbet]]''. Local specialties include the soft white larvae of ants and \"jumping salad\" of tiny live shrimp.\n\nThe [[Igorot]] prefer roasted meats, particularly [[carabao]] meat, goat meat, and [[venison]].\n\nDue to its mild, sub-tropical climate, [[Baguio]], along with the outlying mountainous regions, is renowned for its produce. Temperate-zone fruits and vegetables ([[Strawberry|strawberries]] being a notable example) which would otherwise wilt in lower regions are grown there. It is also known for a snack called ''sundot-kulangot'' which literally means \"poke the booger.\" It's actually a sticky kind of sweet made from milled glutinous rice flour mixed with molasses, and served inside ''pitogo'' shells, and with a stick to \"poke\" its sticky substance with.\n\n[[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] is known for Pancit Cabagan of [[Cabagan]], Inatata & Binallay of [[Ilagan City]] are rice cakes prepared year-round in the city and both famous delicacies specially during the lenten season.

Among the treats produced in [[Pampanga]] are ''[[Longanisa#Philippines|longganisa]]'' (original sweet and spicy sausages), ''calderetang kambing'' (savory goat stew), and ''[[tocino]]'' (sweetened cured pork).  Combining pork cheeks and offal, Kapampangans make ''[[sisig]]''.\n\nThe cuisine of the [[Tagalog people]] varies by province. [[Bulacan]] is popular for [[Chicharr\u00f3n]] ([[pork rind]]s) and steamed rice and tuber cakes like ''puto''. It is a center for ''panghimagas'' or desserts, like brown [[rice cake]] or ''kutsinta'', ''sapin-sapin'', ''[[suman (food)|suman]]'', [[cassava]] cake, ''halaya ube'' and the king of sweets, in [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]], [[Bulacan]], the famous [[carabao]] milk [[candy]] ''pastillas de leche'', with its ''pabalat'' wrapper.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/video/25212/-100-Pinoy--Pinoy-Panghimagas \"100% Pinoy: Pinoy Panghimagas\"].

These are usually topped with ''latik'', a mixture of coconut milk and brown sugar, reduced to a dry crumbly texture. A more modern, and time saving alternative to ''latik'' are coconut flakes toasted in a frying pan. [[Antipolo City]], straddled mid-level in the mountainous regions of the Philippine [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]], is a town known for its ''suman'' and cashew products. [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] is known for ''buko pie'' (coconut pie) and ''panutsa'' (peanut brittle). [[Batangas]] is home to [[Taal Lake]], a body of water that surrounds [[Taal Volcano]].  The lake is home to 75 species of freshwater fish, including landlocked marine species that have since adapted to the Taal lake environment. Eight of these species are of high commercial value. These include a population of [[giant trevally]] locally known as ''maliputo'' which is distinguished from their marine counterparts which are known as ''talakitok''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alaira |first1=Sofia A. |last2=Rebancos |first2=Carmelita M. |title=Maliputo (''Caranx ignobilis'' Foorskal) fish cage farming practices among selected operators in Taal Lake, Batangas, Philippines |journal=Journal of Nature Studies |date=2014 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=25\u201340 |url=http://www.journalofnaturestudies.org/files/JNS13-2/13(2)%2025-40%20Alaira-fullpaper.pdf}}</ref> Another commercially important species is the ''[[tawilis]]'', the only known freshwater [[sardine]] and [[endemic]] to the lake.

The \"chicken ''inasal''\" is a local version of chicken barbecue. It is cooked with red achuete or annatto seeds giving it a reddish color, and brushed with oil and cooked over the fire. The city is also famous for various delicacies such as ''[[Piaya (food)|piaya]]'', ''[[mille foglie|napoleones]]'' and ''pinasugbo'' (deep-fried and caramelled banana sprinkled with sesame seeds).\n\n\n[[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] is home to the famous ''[[Binagol]]'', [[Pastillas|Carabao Milk ''Pastillas'']], ''Suman Latik'' and ''Tsoko Moron''. [[Tacloban|Taclobanon]] cuisine is made unique by the wide use of kinagod(grated coconut) and ''hatok''(coconut milk). It is common to find ''hinatokan'' dishes in the city. ''[[Humba]]'' is said to have originated from the province since the cuisine in the region's cuisine distinctly has a slightly sweeter taste than the rest of the country. Leyte is inclined to the sea, thus, it is common to find multiple seafood dishes in the province. ''Masag''(crab) and   ''pasayan''(shrimp) are common sea food in the region. In an analysis of Waray food it is known that the Waray taste is mild. Other native delicacies from the province are ''Roskas''(hard cookies made from lard, anise, flour, sugar, butter and eggs) and ''Bukayo''(coconut strip  candies).  \n\n[[Aklan]] is synonymous with ''[[inubarang manok]]'', chicken cooked with ''ubad'' (banana [[pith]]), as well as ''[[Binakol|binakol na manok]]'', chicken cooked in [[coconut water]] with lemongrass.

Numerous seafood dishes are served in the city's Baybay area such as mussels, oysters, scallops, prawns, seaweeds, clams, fishes and many more.\n\n[[Cebu]] is known for its [[lechon|lech\u00f3n]] variant. Lechon prepared \"Cebu style\" is characterized by a crisp outer skin and a moist juicy meat with a unique taste given by a blend of spices. Cebu is also known for sweets like dried [[mango]]es and caramel tarts.\n\nIn [[Bohol]], ''[[kalamay]]'' is popular. In [[Palawan]], crocodile meat is boiled, cured, and turned into ''[[tocino]]s''.

The cuisine of the indigenous ethnolinguistic nations who are either [[Christians|Christian]], [[Muslim]] or [[Lumad]] peoples of [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu archipelago]] has much in common with the rich and spicy [[Malay cuisine]] of [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]], as well as [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] and [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] cuisine, and from other countries cuisines.\n\nWell-known dishes from the region include ''[[Satay|Satti]]'' (satay) and ''ginataang manok'' (chicken cooked in spiced coconut milk). Certain parts of Mindanao are predominantly [[Muslim]], where pork is rarely consumed.\n\n''[[Rendang]]'', is an often spicy beef curry whose origins derive from the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people of [[Sumatra]]; ''[[biryani]]'' and ''[[pilaf|kiyoning]]'' (pilaf) are dishes originally from the [[Middle East]], that were given a Mindanaoan touch and served on special occasions.\n\n''[[Piyanggang manok]]'' is a Tausug dish made from barbecued chicken marinated in spices, and served with coconut milk infused with toasted coconut meat.\n\n''Chup\u00e1 Culo'' & ''Curacha con Gat\u00e2'' are examples of a Zamboangue\u00f1o dishes made from shells cooked with coconut milk and crab with sauce blended in coconut milk with spices, respectively.

It usually consists of pork or chicken, sometimes both, stewed or braised in a sauce usually made from vinegar, cooking oil, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns, and soy sauce. It can also be prepared \"dry\" by cooking out the liquid and concentrating the flavor. ''[[Bistek]]'', also known as \"Filipino beef steak,\" consists of thinly sliced beef marinated in [[soy sauce]] and calamansi and then fried in a skillet that is typically served with onions.\n\nSome well-known stews are ''[[kare-kare]]'' and ''[[dinuguan]]''. In ''kare-kare'', also known as \"peanut stew\", [[oxtail]] or ox [[tripe]] is the main ingredient and is cooked with vegetables in a peanut-based preparation. It is typically served with ''bagoong'' (fermented [[shrimp paste]]). In ''[[dinuguan]]'', pig's blood, entrails, and meat are cooked with vinegar and seasoned with chili peppers, usually ''[[siling mahaba]]''.\n\n[[File:Crispy pata.jpg|left|thumb|Crispy Pata]]\n[[File:Jochi Resto Grill Pork Adobo.jpg|thumb|Pork ''[[Philippine adobo|adobo]]'']]\n''[[Paksiw]]'' refers to different vinegar-based stews that differ greatly from one another based on the type of meat used. ''Paksiw na isda'' uses fish and usually includes the addition of ginger, fish sauce, and maybe ''siling mahaba'' and vegetables. ''Paksiw na baboy'' is a ''paksiw'' using pork, usually pork hocks, and often sees the addition of sugar, banana blossoms, and water so that the meat is stewed in a sweet sauce.  A similar Visayan dish called ''[[humba]]'' adds fermented black beans.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Both dishes are probably related to ''pata tim'' which is of Chinese origin. ''Paksiw na lechon'' is made from ''lechon'' meat and features the addition of ground liver or liver spread.  This adds flavor and thickens the sauce so that it starts to caramelize around the meat by the time dish is finished cooking. Although some versions of ''paksiw'' dishes are made using the same basic ingredients as ''adobo'', they are prepared differently, with other ingredients added and the proportions of ingredients and water being different.\n\nIn ''crispy pata'', [[pork]] knuckles (the ''pata'') are marinated in garlic-flavored vinegar then deep fried until crisp and golden brown, with other parts of the pork leg prepared in the same way. ''Lechon manok'' is the Filipino take on [[rotisserie]] chicken. Available in many hole-in-the-wall stands or restaurant chains (e.g. Andok's, Baliwag, Toto's, Sr. Pedro's, G.S. Pagtakhan's), it is typically a specially seasoned chicken roasted over a charcoal flame served with \"''sarsa''\" or ''lechon'' sauce made from mashed pork liver, starch, sugar, and spices.\n\n[[File:0001jfPhilippine cuisine dishes Baliuag Bulacafvf 30.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Dinuguan]]'', a pork blood stew with ''[[siling haba]]''.]]\n[[File:Bistek Tagalog-02.jpg|thumbnail|[[Bistek|Bistek Tagalog]], strips of sirloin beef slowly cooked in soy sauce, calamansi juice, and onions.]]\n[[File:9031Foods of Bulacan 05.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Sinigang|Sinigang na hipon]]'' with ''[[siling labuyo]]'' (wild chili).]]\n[[File:Tinolalunch.jpg|thumb|[[Tinola]], a chicken soup notable as the dish mentioned in [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s novel ''[[Noli Me T\u00e1ngere (novel)|Noli Me T\u00e1ngere]].]]\n[[File:Ensaladang Lato (Seaweed Salad) - Philippines 1.jpg|thumb|''Ensaladang Lato'' or \"Seaweed Salad\" (also known as ''Kinilaw na Guso'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]), a Filipino salad made from the edible green algae ''[[Caulerpa lentillifera]]''.]]\n''[[Mechado]]'', ''[[kaldereta]]'', and ''afritada'' are Spanish influenced tomato sauce-based dishes that are somewhat similar to one another. In these dishes meat is cooked in tomato sauce, minced garlic, and onions. ''Mechado'' gets its name from the pork fat that is inserted in a slab of beef making it look like a wick (''mitsa'') coming out of a beef \"candle\". The larded meat is then cooked in a seasoned tomato sauce and later sliced and served with the sauce it was cooked in. ''[[Kaldereta]]'' can be beef but is also associated with goat.  Chunks of meat are cooked in tomato sauce, minced garlic, chopped onions, peas, carrots, bell peppers and potatoes to make a stew with some recipes calling for the addition of soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar, chilies, ground liver or some combination thereof. ''Afritada'' tends to be the name given to the dish when chicken and pork is used.   Another similar dish said to originate from the Rizal area is ''waknatoy''. Pork or beef sirloin is combined with potatoes and cut sausages and cooked in a tomato-based sauce sweetened with pickles. ''[[Puchero]]'' is derived from the Spanish ''[[cozido|cocido]]''; it is a sweeter stew that has beef and banana or plantain slices simmered in tomato sauce.\n\nFilipinos also eat ''[[tocino]]'' and ''[[longganisa]]''. ''[[Tocino]]'' is a sweetened cured meat made with either chicken or pork and is marinated and cured for a number of days before being fried. ''[[Longanisa#Philippines|Longganisa]]'' is a sweet or spicy sausage, typically made from pork though other meats can also be used, and are often colored red traditionally through the use of the [[anatto]] seed but also artificial food coloring.\n\nFilipino soups tend to be very hearty and stew-like containing large chunks of meat and vegetables or noodles. They are usually intended to be filling and not meant to be a light preparatory introduction for the main course. They tend to be served with the rest of the meal and eaten with rice when they are not meals unto themselves. They are often referred to on local menus under the heading ''sabaw'' (broth). ''[[Sinigang]]'' is a popular dish in this category distinguished by its sourness that often vies with ''adobo'' for consideration as the national dish. It is typically made with either pork, beef, chicken or seafood and made sour with tamarind or other suitable souring ingredients. Some seafood variants for example can be made sour by the use of [[guava]] fruit or [[miso]]. Another dish is ''[[tinola]]''. It has large chicken pieces and green [[papaya]]/[[Chayote|sayote]] slices cooked with chili, spinach, and [[moringa]] leaves in a ginger-flavored broth. ''Nilagang baka'' is a beef stew made with cabbages and other vegetables. ''Binacol'' is a warm chicken soup cooked with coconut water and served with strips of coconut meat. ''La Paz [[batchoy]]'' is a noodle soup garnished with pork innards, crushed pork [[Pork rind|cracklings]], chopped vegetables, and topped with a raw egg.  Another dish with the same name uses [[misua]], beef heart, kidneys and intestines, but does not contain eggs or vegetables.  ''[[Mami Soup|Mami]]'' is a [[noodle soup]] made from chicken, beef, pork, wonton dumplings, or intestines (called ''laman-loob'').  [[Ma Mon Luk]] was known for it.

''[[Pancit]]'' recipes primarily consist of noodles, vegetables, and slices of meat or shrimp with variations often distinguished by the type of noodles used. Some ''pancit'', such as ''mami'' and La Paz-styled ''batchoy'', are noodle soups while the \"dry\" varieties are comparable to ''[[chow mein]]'' in preparation. Then there is spaghetti or ''ispageti'' in the local parlance that is a modified version of [[Spaghetti Bolognese|spaghetti bolognese]]. It is sometimes made with banana ketchup instead of tomato sauce, sweetened with sugar and topped with hot dog slices.\n\nThere are several rice porridges that are popular in the Philippines. One is ''[[arroz caldo]]'', which is a rice porridge cooked with chicken, ginger and sometimes saffron, garnished with spring onions (chives), toasted garlic, and coconut milk to make a type of [[gruel]]. Another variant is ''goto'' which is an ''arroz caldo'' made with ox [[tripe]].

One often seen dessert is ''[[bibingka]]'', a hot [[rice cake]] optionally topped with a pat of butter, slices of ''[[kesong puti]]'' (white cheese), ''itlog na maalat'' (salted duck eggs), and sometimes grated coconut. There are also glutinous rice sweets called ''[[Kalamay|biko]]'' made with sugar, butter, and coconut milk. In addition, there is a dessert known as ''bitsu-bitsu,'' also known as a Pinoy donut, made with fried rice flour which is then coated with Muscovado sugar syrup. There is also Karioka, made from glutinous rice flour, coconut, and coconut milk, fried and skewered and slathered with a brown sugar glaze. Another brown [[rice cake]] is ''[[kutsinta]]''.\n\n''[[Puto]]'' is another well-known example of sweet steamed rice cakes prepared in many different sizes and colors.

Fresh ''lumpia'' (''lumpiang sariwa'') is usually made for fiestas or special occasions as it can be labor-intensive to prepare, while one version of fried ''lumpia'' (''lumpiang prito''), ''lumpiang shanghai'' is usually filled with ground pork and a combination of vegetables, and served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce.<ref>{{cite book |title=Memories of Philippine Kitchens |author1=Besa, Amy  |author2=Romy Dorotan.  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Stewart, Tabori & Chang |year=2006 |isbn=1-58479-451-8}}</ref>  Other variations are filled with minced pork and shrimp and accompanied by a vinegar-based dipping sauce. ''Lumpia'' has been commercialized in [[frozen food]] form. Also, one of the common street food would be the [[Pares (food)|Beef Pares]] in Manila. While Middle-Eastern food such as the [[Shawarma]] became popular in the Philippines in the late 1980s.\n\nThere's a distinct range of [[street food]]s available in the Philippines. Some of these are skewered on sticks in the manner of a [[kebab]]. One such example is ''banana-cue'' which is a whole [[banana]] or [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] skewered on a short thin bamboo stick, rolled in brown sugar, and pan-fried. ''Kamote-cue'' is a peeled [[sweet potato]] skewered on a stick, covered in brown sugar and then pan-fried. [[Fish ball]]s or [[Fishballs|squid balls]] including [[Calamares]] are also pan-fried, then skewered on bamboo sticks and given to the customer, who then has a choice of dipping in a sweet or savory sauce. These are commonly sold frozen in markets and peddled by [[Hawker (trade)|street vendors]].\n\n''[[Turon (food)|Turon]]'', a kind of ''[[lumpia]]'' consisting of an eggroll or [[phyllo]] wrapper commonly filled with sliced [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] and occasionally [[jackfruit]], is fried and sprinkled with sugar.\n\n[[File:Taho.JPG|thumb|left|A ''magtataho'' (taho vendor) in [[Vigan]]]]\n''[[Taho]]'' is a warm treat made of soft [[beancurd]] which is the ''taho'' itself, dark caramel syrup called ''arnibal'', and [[tapioca]] pearls.  It is often sold in neighborhoods by street vendors who yell out \"''taho''\" in a manner like that of vendors in the stands at sporting events yelling out \"hotdogs\" or \"peanuts\". Sometimes, ''taho'' is served chilled, and flavors have recently been added, such as chocolate or strawberry. ''Taho'' is derived from the original [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] snack food known as ''[[douhua]]''.\n\nThere is also ''iskrambol'' (from the English \"to scramble\"), a kind of iced-based treat similar to a sorbet. The shaved ice is combined with various flavorings and usually topped with chocolate syrup. It is eaten by \"scrambling\" the contents or mixing them, then drinking with a large straw. It was later modified into ''ice scramble'', or simply ''scramble'', but with added skim milk, chocolate or strawberry syrup, and a choice of toppings such as [[marshmallows]], chocolate or candy sprinkles, rice crispies, or tapioca pearls.\n\n[[File:06749jfCuisine Foods Takoyaki cooking Balut Penoy Baliuag Bulacanfvf 22.jpg|thumb|''[[Balut (food)|Balut]]'']]\nStreet food featuring eggs include ''[[kwek-kwek]]'' which are hard-boiled quail eggs dipped in orange-dyed batter and then deep fried similar to [[tempura]]. ''Tokneneng'' is a larger version of ''kwek-kwek'' using chicken or duck eggs.  Another Filipino egg snack is ''[[Balut (egg)|balut]]'', essentially a boiled pre-hatched poultry egg, usually duck or chicken. These fertilized eggs are allowed to develop until the embryo reaches a pre-determined size and are then boiled. There is also another egg item called ''penoy,'' which is basically hard-boiled unfertilized duck eggs that does not contain embryo. Like ''taho'', ''balut'' is advertised by street hawkers calling out their product.\n\n''Okoy,'' also spelled as ''ukoy,'' is another batter-covered, deep-fried street food in the Philippines. Along with the batter, it normally includes bean sprouts, shredded pumpkin and very small shrimps, shells and all. It is commonly dipped in a combination of vinegar and chilli.\n\nAmong other street food are already mentioned [[#Pulutan|pulutan]] like ''[[isaw]]'', seasoned hog or chicken intestines skewered onto a stick and grilled; ''betamax'', roasted dried chicken blood cut into and served as small cubes, from which it received its name due to its crude resemblance to a [[Betamax]] tape; ''[[Adidas]]'', grilled chicken feet named after the popular shoe brand; and ''[[Proven (food)|proven]]'', the [[proventriculus]] of a chicken coated in cornstarch and deep-fried. Fries made from [[sweet potatoes]] have also been dubbed \"Pinoy fries\".\n\nIn addition to the Availability of the 24/7 burgers stands such as [[Burger Machine]] (nicknamed \"the burger that never sleeps\"), Angel's Burger, Franks N' Burgers and Minute Burger across the country.\n\n==Exotic dishes==\n[[File:0681jfRestaurants Rare Attractions San Miguel Bulacanfvf 23.JPG|thumb|A Tata Itong restaurant in [[San Miguel, Bulacan]] known for serving Filipino exotic dishes including Soup No. 5 and ''papaitan''.]]\nSome exotic dishes in the Filipino diet are ''camaro'', which are field crickets cooked in [[soy sauce]], salt, and vinegar, and is popular in [[Pampanga]]; ''papaitan,'' which is a stew made of goat or beef innards flavored with bile that gives it its characteristic bitter (''pait'') taste; ''[[Soup Number Five|Soup No. 5]]'' (Also spelled as \"Soup #5\") which is a soup made out of [[bull]]'s [[testes]],<ref>{{cite web | title =Bizarre food with Andrew Zimmern \u2013 Philippines| url=http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Bizarre_food/Episodes_Travel_Guides/Episode_Philippines | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref><ref>Sutherland, Matthew.

The biota that developed yielded a particular landscape and in turn gave the place local ingredients that enhanced flavors to the dishes.

It is mostly used due to the sourness it gives to a dish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ititropicals.com/calamansi-fruit-fact-tidbits |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620182204/http://www.ititropicals.com/calamansi-fruit-fact-tidbits |archive-date=2015-06-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n[[File:06999jfCitrus \u00d7 microcarpafvf.jpg|thumb|185px|left|[[Calamondin|Kalamansi]]]]\nAnother is the tabon-tabon, a tropical fruit which were used by pre-colonial Filipinos as anti-bacterial ingredient especially in [[Kinilaw]] dishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinilawmix.com/about_tabon-tabon.php|title=History of Kinilaw|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> The country also cultivates different type of nuts and one of them is the [[pili nut]], of which the Philippines is the only known exporter of edible varieties.

The salt is an assortment of reeds, twigs and small pieces of bamboo carried to the shore by the sea tide where they have been soaked in seawater for some time and is then burned in large quantities while continually being doused with salt water on a daily basis. The ashes then is strained continuously by kaings and are then cooked in pans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themeltedice-manggahan.blogspot.com/2008/05/tultul-production.html|title=Tultul Production: Tultul production|date=May 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn Visayas, another souring agent in dishes in the form of ''batuan'' (''Garcinia binucao'') is used. It is a fruit that is greenish, yellowish, somewhat rounded, and four centimeters or more in diameter.

Stands selling cold fruit drinks and fruit shakes are common in many of the city areas, where some are based on [[Mandarin orange|green mandarin orange]] (''dalandan'' or ''dalanghita''), [[pomelo]] (''suha''), [[pineapple]] (''pinya''), [[banana]] (''saging''), and [[soursop]] (''guyabano''). The shakes usually contain crushed ice, evaporated or condensed milk, and fruits like the perennially popular [[mango]].  Other fruits are [[avocado]], [[cantaloupe]], [[durian]], [[papaya]], [[strawberry]] and [[watermelon]], to name a few.\n\nOther chilled drinks include ''sago't gulaman,'' a flavored ice drink of pre-Hispanic [[Malay race|Malay]] origin (Malay: ''[[gula melaka]]'') with [[sago]] and [[agar]] [[gelatin]] with banana extract sometimes added to the accompanying syrup; fresh ''buko'' or [[coconut juice]], the water or juice straight out of a young [[coconut]] via an inserted straw, a less fresh variation of which is from bottled coconut juice, scraped coconut flesh, sugar, and water; and kalamansi juice, the juice of [[kalamansi]] or Philippine limes usually sweetened with honey, syrup or sugar.\n\n====Brewed beverages====\nThe Philippines is a predominantly coffee-drinking nation. One of the most popular variants of coffee coming from the mountains of [[Batangas]] is known as ''[[Kape Barako|kapeng barako]]''. Another well-known variant of coffee is the ''[[kopi luwak|civet coffee]]''. It is called ''kape motit'' in the Cordilleras, ''kape alamid'' in Tagalog region, and ''kape musang'' in Mindanao. The Kalinga coffee known for its organic production is also rapidly gaining popularity.

Pandan iced tea is one of these, made with [[Pandanus|pandan]] leaves and [[lemongrass]] (locally known as ''tanglad''). [[Ginger tea|''Salabat'']], sometimes called ginger tea, is brewed from [[ginger]] root and usually served during the cold months, and when illnesses such as flu or sore throat strikes.\n\nThe late 2010s saw the opening of teahouses in major cities, and with a glass of milk tea being more affordable than the usual cold designer coffee, it paved the way into making tea a well-known food trend. Notable teahouse chains in the Philippins are [[Chatime]] and [[Serenitea]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Consunji|first=Bianca|title=The Mad Tea Party|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/1300/the-mad-tea-party|publisher=Inquirer}}</ref>\n\n''[[Tsokolate]]'' is the Filipino style of hot chocolate.

Asia Brewery also produces under license and distributes a number of other mass market beers such as Colt 45, Asahi Super Dry, Heineken and Tiger Beer. Other beer labels include Red Horse Beer, Lone Star, Lone Star Light, Lone Star Ultra, Carlsberg, Coors Light, San Miguel Superdry, San Mig Strong Ice, and just recently, Manila Beer. Echoing trends in international markets, bars in urban areas have also begun to serve locally produced and imported craft beers in a variety of styles.\n\n[[Rum]] is often associated with [[Tanduay]].\n\nSeveral [[gin]]s, both local varieties like [[Ginebra San Miguel]] (as well as GSM Blue and GSM Premium Gin) and imported brands like [[Gilbey's]], are commonly found.  Some people refer to gin by the shape of the bottle: ''bilog'' for a circular bottle and ''kwatro kantos'' (literally meaning four corners) for a square or rectangular bottle.  Gin is sometimes combined with other ingredients to come up with variations.\n\n''[[Palm wine|Tuba]]'' (toddy) is a type of hard liquor made from fresh drippings extracted from a cut young stem of palm.  The cutting of the palm stem usually done early in the morning by a ''mananguete'', a person who climbs palm trees and extracts the ''tuba'' to supply to customers later in the day.  The morning's accumulated palm juice or drippings are then harvested by noon, and brought to buyers then prepared for consumption.  Sometimes this is done twice a day so that there are two harvests of ''tuba'' occurring first at noon-time and then in the late-afternoon.  Normally, ''tuba'' has to be consumed right after the ''mananguete'' brings it over, or it becomes too sour to be consumed as a drink.  Any remaining unconsumed ''tuba'' is then often stored in jars to ferment for several days and become palm vinegar. ''Tuba'' can be distilled to produce ''[[lambanog]]'' (arrack), a neutral liquor often noted for its relatively high alcohol content.\n\nLambanog is an alcoholic beverage commonly described as coconut wine or coconut vodka. The drink is distilled from the sap of the unopened coconut flower, and is known for its potency and high alcohol content (80 and 90 proof). Most of the Lambanog distilleries are in the Quezon province of Luzon, Philippines. Constant efforts at standardizing lambanog production has led to its better quality. Presently, lambanog is being exported to other countries and continues to win foreign customers over due to its natural ingredients as well as its potency.\n\n''[[Tapuy]]'' is a traditional Philippine alcoholic drink made from fermented ''[[glutinous rice]]''.  It is a clear wine of luxurious alcoholic taste, moderate sweetness and lingering finish. Its average alcohol content is 14% or 28 proof, and it does not contain any preservatives or sugar. To increase the awareness of ''tapuy'', the [[Philippine Rice Research Institute]] has created a cookbook containing recipes and cocktails from famous Filipino chefs and bartenders, featuring ''tapuy'' as one of the ingredients.\n\n==Eating methods==\n{{Unreliable sources|section|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:Boodle Fight (Baler, Aurora).jpg|thumb|[[Boodle fight]] in [[Baler, Aurora]].]]\n\nDuring the Spanish occupation, which yielded Western influences, Filipinos ate with the paired utensils of spoon and fork. The knife was not used as in other countries, because Spain prohibited them to have knives. Filipinos use the side of the spoon, to \"cut\" the food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://askthepinoy.blogspot.com/2011/01/why-do-filipinos-eat-with-spoon-and.html |title=Ask A Filipino!: Why do Filipinos eat with a spoon and a fork? |publisher=Askthepinoy.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}{{User-generated inline|certain=y|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\nNowadays, the use of hands during eating, known as \"kamayan\" (using the washed left hand for picking the centralized food and the right hand for bringing food to the mouth), has become a trend. ''Kamayan'' generally means \"eating with your hands\", which was how Filipinos ate before the colonial era. It is further becoming more popular due to the incorporation of the \"[[boodle fight]]\" concept, a style of dining popularized by the Philippine Army, which utilizes banana leaves spread out on the table as the main serving platter, upon which is laid out portions of rice and a variety of Filipino dishes for friendly, filial or communal feasting. The use of spoons and forks, however, is still the norm.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Philippine desserts]]\n* [[List of Philippine dishes]]\n* [[List of Philippine restaurant chains]]\n* [[Philippine condiments]]\n* [[Filipino-American cuisine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"philstar.com 2015-1\">{{cite web | title=CNN poll: Philippines has world\u2019s 2nd best food | website=[[The Philippine Star]] | date=June 16, 2015 | url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/06/16/1466440/cnn-poll-philippines-has-worlds-2nd-best-food | accessdate=April 7, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040608/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/06/16/1466440/cnn-poll-philippines-has-worlds-2nd-best-food | archive-date=October 6, 2016 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<div style=\"font-size:97%\">\n* {{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1r49TUuMFTEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n|title=Banana Leaves: Filipino Cooking and Much More\n|author=Alcuaz, N.T.\n|publisher=Trafford\n|location=Victoria\n|year=2005\n|isbn=1-4120-5378-1\n|accessdate=2009-12-12}}\n* {{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUaDoUF0tRwC&pg=PA13&dq=filipino+cuisine#v=onepage&q=filipino%20cuisine&f=false\n|title=The Philippine Cookbook\n|author=Alejandro, Reynaldo.\n|publisher=Perigee Books\n|location=New York\n|year=1985\n|page=13\n|isbn=0-399-51144-X\n|accessdate=2009-12-10}}\n* {{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4RMvoLQ5KQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n|title=Cocina Filipina\n|author=Aleson, Susana, Alice Gratil, Lota Ignacio, Mhila Baiyon, Gladys Moya, and Virginia Zarate.\n|publisher=Icaria\n|location=Barcelona\n|language=Spanish\n|year=1998\n|isbn=84-7426-358-1\n|accessdate=2009-12-12}}\n* Arroyo, Patricia T.

The ingredients for common dishes were obtained from locally raised livestock. These ranged from [[water buffalo]]s/[[carabao]]s, [[chicken]], and [[pigs]] to various kinds of fish and other [[seafood]]. In 3200 BCE, Austronesians from southern [[China]] ([[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]]) and [[Taiwan]] settled in the region that is now called the Philippines. They brought with them knowledge of [[rice]] cultivation and other farming practices which increased the number and variety of edible dish ingredients available for cooking.<ref>Knuuttila, Kyle.

Many of these food items and dishes retained their original Hokkien names, such as  ''[[pancit]]'' ({{zh|c=\u4fbf\u00ea\u98df|poj=pi\u0101n-\u00ea-si\u030dt}})({{zh|c=\u6241\u98df|p=bi\u01cen sh\u00ed}}), and ''[[lumpia]]'' ({{zh|t=\u6f64\u9905|poj=j\u016bn-pi\u00e1\u207f, l\u016bn-pi\u00e1\u207f}}).<ref name=\"dw\" />  The [[Chinese food]] introduced during this period were food of the workers and traders, which became a staple of the noodle shops (''[[panciteria]]s''), and can be seen in dishes like ''[[arroz caldo]]'' (congee), ''sinangag'' ([[fried rice]]).\n\nThe [[China|Chinese]] had been trading with the Philippines since the early 9th or 10th centuries. Soon after the Chinese began to immigrate there in the 16th century. Chinese influence is best seen in [[pancit]] noodles and [[lumpia]] spring rolls. There are also many ingredients such as [[soy sauce]], black beans, [[tofu]], pork, etc., that are seen in Filipino cooking. \n\nTrade and shared cultures with various neighboring kingdoms of [[Malacca]] and [[Srivijaya]] in [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], and [[Java]] meant shared if not adopted foods and cooking methods, which remain central to Filipino cuisine today. Some of these are the use of fish or shrimp-based ingredients such as  ''[[bagoong]]'' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''[[belacan]]'') and [[patis (sauce)|''patis'']] and variants. The most known Philippine variant of the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''[[ketupat]]'', or rice packed in banana leaves, is the ''[[puso]]'' of [[Cebu]] (also called ''bugnoy'' in other parts of [[Visayas|the Visayas]]), ''piyoso'' in [[Moro people|Moro]] cultures (e.g. [[Maranao people|Meranao]], [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]], [[Iranun people|Iranun]]), and ''patupat'' in northern Luzon. [[Moro people|Moro cuisine]] in particular is known for [[kuning]],  ''[[sambal]]'', and the ''[[rendang]]'' dish, although is more popularly associated with [[Indonesian cuisine]] or [[Malaysian cuisine]]. A [[tamarind]]-based Malay dish called ''singgang'' is also analogous to the more widely-popular Filipino ''[[sinigang]]''.\n\nRice and coconuts as staples throughout the archipelago as in the rest of Southeast Asia meant similar or adopted dishes and methods based on these crops. Some of these are evident in the infusion of [[coconut milk]] particularly in the renowned ''[[laing (food)|laing]]'' and ''sinilihan'' (popularized as [[Bicol Express]]) of Bikol. Other regional variants of stews or soups commonly tagged as ''[[ginataan]](g)'' or \"with coconut milk\" also abound Filipino kitchens and food establishments. A dish from the [[Visayas]] simmered in coconut water, ideally in bamboo, is the ''[[binakol]]'' usually with chicken as the main ingredient.\n\nThrough the trade with the [[Malaysia|Malay]]-[[Indonesia]]n kingdoms, cuisine from as far away as [[India]] and [[Arabia]] further enriched the palettes of the local Austronesians. Particularly in the southern regions of [[Mindanao]] where there is more direct contact with cultures of Malaysia and Indonesia, popular dishes include ''[[korma|kurmah]]'', ''[[satay|satti]]'' (local satay), and ''[[biryani]]''. Indian influences can also be noted in rice-based delicacies such as ''[[bibingka]]'' (analogous to the Indonesian ''[[Bibingka#Bibingka in Indonesia|bingka]]''), ''[[puto]]'', and ''[[puto bumbong]]'', where the latter two are plausibly derived from the [[South Indian cuisine|south Indian]] ''[[puttu]]'', which also has variants throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] (e.g. ''[[kue putu]]'', ''[[putu mangkok]]''). The ''[[kare-kare]]'', more popular in Luzon, on the other hand could trace its origins from the [[Seven Years' War]] when the [[British occupation of Manila|British occupied Manila]] for 2 years mostly with [[sepoys]] (Indian conscripts), who had to improvise Indian dishes given the lack of spices in the Philippines to make [[curry]]. This is said to explain the name and its supposed thick, yellow-to-orange [[annatto]] and peanut-based sauce, which alludes to a type of curry.\n\nThe [[Spain|Spanish]] came to the [[Philippines]] in 1521 and controlled its islands by 1565. The Spanish ruled until 1898. Filipinos began using the Spanish ''[[sofrito]]'' of [[Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Onion|onions,]] and [[garlic]] cooked in oil for their dishes. Many [[Spanish cuisine|cooking customs and techniques]] were adapted as well as various dishes. \n\nSince the Spanish ruled both Mexico and the Philippines, the two were inevitably connected. During the years of 1565-1815 the Spanish transported various goods between the two colonies. New crops were brought from the New World to the Philippines such as [[chocolate]], [[Maize|corn]], [[Potato|potatoes]], tomatoes, [[Pineapple|pineapples,]] [[Bell pepper|bell peppers]], [[Pachyrhizus erosus|jicama,]] [[chayote]], [[avocado]], [[Peanut|peanuts]], and [[annatto]]. The Mexicans received [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[tamarind]], [[Coconut|coconuts]], and [[Mango|mangoes]] from Philippine soil. \n\n[[File:1146Bibingka Puto bumbong making Philippines 14.jpg|thumb|Traditionally prepared ''bibingka'' in [[Baliuag, Bulacan]]]]\n[[Spain|Spanish]] colonizers and friars in the 16th century brought with them produce from the [[Americas]] like [[chili pepper]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[corn]], [[potato]]es, and the method of [[saut\u00e9ing]] with [[garlic]] and [[onion]]s. Chili leaves are frequently used as a cooking green. Hispanic dishes were eventually incorporated into Filipino cuisine with the more complex dishes usually being prepared for special occasions. Some dishes such as ''[[arroz a la valenciana]]'' remain largely the same in the Philippine context.  Some have been adapted or have come to take on a slightly or significantly different meaning.  ''[[Arroz a la cubana]]'' served in the Philippines usually includes ground beef [[picadillo]].  Philippine ''longganisa'' despite its name is more akin to ''[[chorizo]]'' than Spanish ''[[longaniza]]'' (in [[Visayan]] regions, it is still known as ''chorizo''). ''Morcon'' is likely to refer to a beef roulade dish not the bulbous specialty Spanish [[sausage]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish\u2013American War|Spanish-American War]] in 1898, the United States controlled the Philippines due to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]].

The same dish may and will differ between households. One dished prepared by your mother for example, may be completely different from your aunts. \n\nFilipino cuisine may be confusing to some people due to it being hard to determine what is actually Filipino. Confusion occurs due to the consistent growing phases of Filipino culture. Filipino culture has been constantly changing throughout history, gaining influence from various cultures and inevitably has evolved. Filipino food today has been shaped by history and society of many unique and affluent cultures. Influences from [[China]], [[India]], [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], and many other countries are seen throughout Filipino food and culture due to the agricultural trading of the times. Influences from [[Spain]] and [[United States|America]] are seen through past colonization of the country. The rest of the world has influenced Filipinos due to global communication which is the basis of connecting societies internationally. Filipino food can be studied and given a definition through the process of indigenizing its people throughout centuries. Instead of fighting its adaptations to specific cultures, they allowed its submersion which in turn, influenced their cuisines, foods, and ingredients. \u00a0.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Pakbetjf9853.JPG|thumb|''[[Pinakbet]]'']]\nFilipino cuisine centres around the combination of sweet (''tamis''), sour (''asim''), and salty (''alat''),<ref name=\"philstar.com 2015-1\" /> although in Bicol, the Cordilleras and among Muslim Filipinos, spicy (''anghang'') is a base of cooking flavor.\n\nCounterpoint is a feature in Filipino cuisine which normally comes in a pairing of something sweet with something salty, and results in surprisingly pleasing combinations. Examples include: ''[[champorado]]'' (a sweet cocoa rice porridge), being paired with ''[[Daing|tuyo]]'' (salted, sun-dried fish); ''[[dinuguan]]'' (a savory stew made of pig's blood and innards), paired with ''[[puto]]'' (sweet, steamed rice cakes); unripe fruits such as green [[mango]]es (which are only slightly sweet but very sour), are eaten dipped in salt or ''bagoong''; the use of [[cheese]] (which is salty-sweet) in sweetcakes (such as ''[[bibingka]]'' and ''puto''), as well as an [[ice cream]] flavoring.\n\n[[Vinegar]] is a common ingredient. ''[[Philippine adobo|Adobo]]'' is popular<ref name=\"philstar.com 2015-1\" /> not solely for its simplicity and ease of preparation, but also for its ability to be stored for days without spoiling, and even improve in flavor with a day or two of storage.  ''[[Tinapa]]'' is a smoke-cured fish while ''tuyo'', ''daing'', and ''dangit'' are corned, sun-dried fish popular because they can last for weeks without spoiling, even without refrigeration.\n\nCooking and eating in the Philippines has traditionally been an informal and communal affair centered around the family kitchen. Filipinos traditionally eat three main meals a day: ''agahan'' or ''almusal'' (breakfast), ''tanghal\u00edan'' (lunch), and ''hapunan'' (dinner) plus an afternoon snack called ''[[meri\u00e9nda]]'' (also called ''minand\u00e1l'' or ''minind\u00e1l''). Snacking is normal. Dinner, while still the main meal, is smaller than other countries.  Usually, either breakfast or lunch is the largest meal.  Food tends to be served all at once and not in courses.  Unlike many of their Asian counterparts Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks. Due to Western influence, food is often eaten using flatware\u2014forks, knives, spoons\u2014but the primary pairing of utensils used at a Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork. The traditional way of eating is with the hands, especially dry dishes such as ''inihaw'' or ''prito''. The diner will take a bite of the main dish, then eat rice pressed together with his fingers. This practice, known as ''kamayan'', is rarely seen in urbanized areas.  However, Filipinos tend to feel the spirit of ''kamayan'' when eating amidst nature during out-of-town trips, beach vacations, and town fiestas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/philippines/phileat.html |title=Philippines \u2013 Eating Habits & Hospitality |accessdate=2006-11-21 |publisher=The Global Gourmet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624024611/http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/philippines/phileat.html |archive-date=2011-06-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Common dishes==\n{{see also|List of Philippine dishes}}\nAs in most Asian countries, the staple food in the Philippines is [[rice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice in the Philippines|url=http://www.irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=10718:rice-in-the-philippines&lang=en|publisher=International Rice Research Institute|access-date=2013-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204104318/http://irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=10718:rice-in-the-philippines&lang=en|archive-date=2013-02-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is most often steamed and always served with meat, fish and vegetable dishes. Leftover rice is often fried with garlic to make ''[[sinangag]]'', which is usually served at breakfast together with a fried egg and [[Curing (food preservation)|cured meat]] or sausages. Rice is often enjoyed with the sauce or broth from the main dishes.  In some regions, rice is mixed with salt, condensed milk, cocoa, or coffee. Rice flour is used in making sweets, cakes and other pastries. Sticky rice with cocoa, also called ''champorado'' is also a common dish served with [[Daing|''tuyo'' or dried herring]].\n[[File:Philippine Chicken curry.jpg|thumb|Philippine Chicken curry with its popular coconut milk sauce]]\nA variety of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are often used in cooking. [[Cooking banana|Plantain]]s (also called ''[[Saba Banana|saba]]'' in Filipino),  [[kalamansi]], [[guava]]s (''bayabas''), [[mango]]es, [[papaya]]s, and [[pineapple]]s lend a distinctly tropical flair in many dishes, but mainstay green leafy vegetables like water spinach (''kangkong''), Chinese cabbage (''petsay''), Napa cabbage (''petsay wombok''), cabbage (''repolyo'') and other vegetables like eggplants (''talong'') and yard-long beans (''sitaw'') are just as commonly used. [[Coconut]]s are ubiquitous. Coconut meat is often used in desserts, [[coconut milk]] (''kakang gata'') in sauces, and [[coconut oil]] for frying. Abundant harvests of root crops like potatoes, carrots, [[taro]] (''gabi''), [[cassava]] (''kamoteng kahoy''), purple yam (''[[Purple yam|ube]]''), and [[sweet potato]] (''kamote'') make them readily available.  The combination of tomatoes (''kamatis''), garlic (''bawang''), and onions (''sibuyas'') is found in many dishes.\n[[File:Mushroom sisig.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sisig]]]]\nMeat staples include [[chicken]], [[pork]], [[beef]], and [[fish]]. [[Seafood]] is popular as a result of the bodies of water surrounding the archipelago.  Popular catches include [[tilapia]], [[catfish]] (''hito''), [[milkfish]] (''bangus''), [[grouper]] (''lapu-lapu''), [[shrimp]] (''hipon''), prawns (''sugpo''), [[mackerel]] (''galunggong'', ''hasa-hasa''), swordfish (''isdang-ispada''), oysters (''talaba''), [[mussel]]s (''tahong''), [[clam]]s (''halaan'' and ''tulya''), large and small [[crab]]s (''alimango'' and ''alimasag'' respectively), [[game fish]], sablefish, tuna, [[cod]] (''bakalaw''), [[Indo-Pacific blue marlin|blue marlin]], and [[squid]]/[[cuttlefish]] (both called ''pusit''). Also popular are [[seaweed]]s (''damong dagat''), [[abalone]], and [[eel]] (''igat'').\n\nThe most common way of having fish is to have it salted, pan-fried or deep-fried, and then eaten as a simple meal with rice and vegetables. It may also be cooked in a sour broth of tomatoes or [[tamarind]] as in ''pangat'', prepared with vegetables and a souring agent to make ''[[sinigang]]'', simmered in vinegar and peppers to make ''paksiw'', or roasted over hot charcoal[[File:Leche flan Filipinas.jpg|thumbnail|[[Cr\u00e8me caramel|Leche flan]]]]or wood (''[[grilling|inihaw]]''). Other preparations include ''[[escabeche]]'' (sweet and sour), ''relleno'' (deboned and stuffed), or \"[[kinilaw]]\" (similar to ceviche; marinated in vinegar or [[kalamansi]]). Fish can be preserved by being smoked (''[[tinapa]]'') or sun-dried (''tuyo'' or ''daing'').\n\nFood is often served with various [[dipping sauce]]s. Fried food is often dipped either in [[vinegar]] with onions, [[soy sauce]] with juice squeezed from ''[[Calamansi|Kalamansi]]'' (Philippine lime or ''calamansi''). ''Patis'' ([[fish sauce]]) may be mixed with ''kalamansi'' as dipping sauce for most seafood or mixed with a stew called [[nilaga]]. [[Fish sauce]], fish paste (''[[Bagoong terong|bagoong]]''), [[shrimp paste]] (''bagoong alamang'') and crushed [[ginger]] root (''luya'') are [[condiment]]s that are often added to dishes during the cooking process or when served.\n\n==Breakfast==\n[[File:Tapsilog in saudi arabia.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tapsilog]]'']]\nA traditional Filipino breakfast might include ''[[pandesal]]'' (small bread rolls), ''[[kesong puti]]'' (fresh, unripened, white Filipino cheese, traditionally made from carabao's milk)  ''[[champorado]]'' (chocolate rice porridge), ''[[Silog (dish)|silog]]'' which is ''sinangag'' ([[fried rice|garlic fried rice]]) or sinaing, with [[fried egg]] and meat\u2014such as ''[[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|tapa]]'', ''[[Longganisa#Philippines|longganisa]]'', ''[[tocino]]'', ''[[corned beef|karne norte]]'' (corned beef), or fish such as ''daing na bangus'' <!--(/d\u0259-\u012dN-n\u0259-b\u0259-Ngus/)--> (salted and dried [[milkfish]])\u2014or ''itlog na pula'' ([[salted duck egg]]s).  Coffee is also commonly served particularly ''[[kape Barako|kapeng barako]]'', a variety of coffee produced in the mountains of Batangas noted for having a strong flavor.\n\nCertain [[portmanteau]]s in Filipino have come into use to describe popular combinations of items in a Filipino breakfast.  An example of such a combination order is ''kankamtuy'':  an order of '''''kan'''in'' (rice), '''''kam'''atis'' (tomatoes) and '''''tuy'''o'' (dried fish).  Another is ''tapsi'': an order of '''''tap'''a'' and '''''si'''nang\u00e1g'' or '''''si'''naing''. Other examples include variations using a ''[[Silog (dish)|silog]]'' suffix, usually some kind of meat served with '''''si'''nang\u00e1g'' or '''''si'''naing'', and ''it'''log''''' (egg). The three most commonly seen ''silogs'' are ''[[tapsilog]]'' (having ''tapa'' as the meat portion), ''tocilog'' (having tocino as the meat portion), and ''longsilog'' (having longganisa as the meat portion). Other ''silogs'' include ''hotsilog'' (with a [[hot dog]]), ''bangsilog'' (with [[milkfish|''bangus'' (milkfish)]]), ''dangsilog'' (with [[rabbitfish|''danggit'' (rabbitfish)]]), ''spamsilog'' (with [[spam (food)|spam]]), ''adosilog'' (with adobo), ''chosilog'' (with [[chorizo]]), ''chiksilog'' (with chicken), ''cornsilog'' (with [[corned beef]]), and ''litsilog'' (with [[lechon|lechon/litson]]). ''Pankaplog'' is slang for a breakfast consisting of ''[[pandesal]]'', ''[[Kape Barako|kape]]'' (coffee), and ''itlog'' (egg), it is also a double entendre meaning to fondle breasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pinoyslang.com/define/pakaplog |title=Pakaplog |publisher=Pinoy Slang |accessdate=2008-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205172847/http://pinoyslang.com/define/pakaplog/ |archivedate=2008-12-05 }}</ref> An establishment that specializes in such meals is called a ''tapsihan'' or ''tapsilugan''.\n\n==Merienda==\n[[File:Putoricecakes.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Puto]]'' in banana leaf liners]]\n[[File:0999jfPistang Bayan Pasalubong Philippine delicacies Bustos Bulacanfvf 18.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ube halaya]]'', ''[[sapin-sapin]]'', ''[[kalamay]]'', ''[[Suman (food)|suman]]'', and various other ''[[kakanin]]'']]\n''[[Merienda]]'' is taken from the Spanish, and is a light meal or snack especially in the afternoon, similar to the concept of afternoon [[tea (meal)|tea]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Francia | first=L. | title=Passport Philippines: Your Pocket Guide to Filipino Business, Customs & Etiquette | publisher=World Trade Press | series=Passport to the world | year=1997 | isbn=978-1-885073-40-2 | url=https://archive.org/details/passportphilippi00fran | url-access=registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/passportphilippi00fran/page/86 86]}}</ref> If the meal is taken close to dinner, it is called ''merienda cena'', and may be served instead of dinner.<ref>{{cite book | last=Davidson | first=A. | last2=Jaine | first2=T. | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=OUP Oxford | series=Oxford Companions | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-19-104072-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA514 | page=514}}</ref>\n\nFilipinos have a number of options to take with ''kap\u00e9'', which is the Filipino pronunciation of caf\u00e9 ([[coffee]]): breads and pastries like ''[[pandesal]]'', ''[[Ensaimada|ensaymada]]'' (buttery ''[[brioche]]'' covered in grated cheese and sugar), ''[[Bakpia|hopia]]'' (pastries similar to [[mooncake]]s filled with [[mung bean paste]]) and [[empanada]] (savoury, meat-filled [[pasty|pasties]]).

Mini pastries like ''[[Turrones de cas\u00fay|turrones de casuy]]'' are made up of cashew [[marzipan]] wrapped with a wafer made to resemble a candy wrapper but take on a miniature look of a pie in a size of about a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]. There is also ''[[napoleones]]'' \u2013 again with all the vowels pronounced \u2013 a [[mille-feuille]] pastry stuffed with a sweet milk-based filling.\n\nThere are hard pastries like ''[[biskotso]]'' a crunchy, sweet, twice-baked bread.  Another baked goody is ''sinipit'' which is a sweet pastry covered in a crunchy sugar glaze, made to resemble a length of rope.  Similar to ''sinipit'' is a snack eaten on roadsides colloquially called ''shingaling''. It is hollow but crunchy with a salty flavor.\n\n[[File:Mango float, a Filipino icebox cake version of Crema de Fruta 01.jpg|thumb|An [[icebox cake]] version of ''[[crema de fruta]]'' made with cream, graham crackers, condensed milk, and ripe mangoes.]]\nFor a softer treat there is ''[[Mam\u00f3n|mamon]]'' a chiffon-type cake sprinkled with sugar, its name derived from a slang Spanish term for breast. There's also ''[[crema de fruta]]'', which is an elaborate sponge cake topped in succeeding layers of cream, custard, candied fruit, and gelatin. Similar to a sponge cake is ''mamoncillo'' which generally refers to slices taken from a large ''mamon cake'', but it is unrelated to the [[Mamoncillo|fruit]] of the same name. Sandwich pastries like ''[[inipit]]'' are made with two thin layers of chiffon sandwiching a filling of custard that is topped with butter and sugar. Another ''mamon'' variant is ''mamon tostada'', basically ''mamoncillo'' toasted to a crunchy texture.\n\nStuffed pastries that reflect both Western and Eastern influence are common. One can find [[empanada]]s, a turnover-type pastry filled with a savory-sweet meat filling. Typically filled with ground meat and raisins, it can be deep fried or baked.  ''[[Siopao]]'' is the local version of Chinese [[baozi]]. ''Buchi'' is another snack that is likely of Chinese origin.  Bite-sized, ''buchi'' is made of deep-fried dough balls (often from rice flour) filled with a sweet mung bean paste, and coated on the outside with sesame seeds; some variants also have ''[[Purple yam|ube]]'' as the filling. There are also many varieties of the mooncake-like ''[[Bakpia|hopia]]'', which come in different shapes (from a flat, circular stuffed form, to cubes), and have different textures (predominantly using flaky pastry, but sometimes like the ones in [[Mooncake|mooncakes]]) and fillings.\n\n==Fiesta food==\n[[File:Lechon.jpg|thumb|right|Lech\u00f3n being roasted in [[Cadiz, Negros Occidental]], Philippines.]]\n\nFor festive occasions, people band together and prepare more sophisticated dishes. Tables are often laden with expensive and labor-intensive treats requiring hours of preparation.  In Filipino celebrations, ''[[lechon|lech\u00f3n]]'' (also spelled ''litson'')<ref>{{cite news |title=Palmonas: Make 'buko' juice as national drink |author=Vicky B.

It is usually a whole roasted pig, but suckling pigs (''lechonillo'', or ''lechon de leche'') or cattle calves (''lechong baka'') can also be prepared in place of the popular adult pig.  It is typically served with ''lechon'' sauce, which is traditionally made from the roasted pig's liver.  Other dishes include ''hamonado'' (honey-cured beef, pork or chicken), ''relleno'' (stuffed chicken or milkfish), ''[[mechado]]'', ''afritada'', ''caldereta'', ''puchero'', [[paella]], ''menudo'', ''morcon'', ''embutido'' (referring to a meatloaf dish, not a sausage as understood elsewhere), ''suman'' (a savory rice and [[coconut milk]] concoction steamed in leaves such as banana), and ''[[pancit]] canton''.  The table may also be have various sweets and pastries such as ''[[Leche Flan|leche flan]]'', ''[[Purple yam|ube]]'', ''sapin-sapin'', ''sorbetes'' (ice creams), ''totong'' or ''sinukmani'' (a rice, coconut milk and mongo bean pudding), ''ginataan'' (a coconut milk pudding with various root vegetables and [[tapioca pearls]]), and ''[[gulaman]]'' (an [[agar]] [[Gelatin dessert|jello-like ingredient or dessert]]).\n\nChristmas Eve, known as ''[[Nochebuena|Noche Buena]]'', is the most important feast. During this evening, the star of the table is the Christmas [[ham]] and [[Edam cheese]] (''queso de bola'').  Supermarkets are laden with these treats during the Christmas season and are popular giveaways by Filipino companies in addition to red wine, brandy, groceries, or pastries. Available mostly during the Christmas season and sold in front of churches along with ''[[bibingka]]'', ''puto bumbong'' is purple colored ground sticky rice steamed vertically in small bamboo tubes.\n\nMore common at celebrations than in everyday home meals, ''[[Lumpia#Lumpiang Sariwa|lumpiang sariwa]]'', or ''fresh lumpia'', is a fresh spring roll that consists of a soft crepe wrapped around a filling that can include strips of ''kamote'' (sweet potato), ''singkamas'' ([[jicama]]), bean sprouts, green beans, cabbage, carrots and meat (often pork). It can be served warm or cold and typically with a sweet peanut and garlic sauce. ''Ukoy'' is shredded papaya combined with small shrimp (and occasionally bean sprouts) and fried to make shrimp patties. It is often eaten with vinegar seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper. Both ''lumpiang sariwa'' and ''ukoy'' are often served together in Filipino parties. ''Lumpiang sariwa'' has [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] origins, having been derived from [[popiah]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Lumpiang Shanghai (Filipino Spring Rolls) | work = Manila Spoon | author = Abby | url = http://www.manilaspoon.com/2012/11/lumpiang-shanghai-filipino-spring-rolls.html}}</ref>\n\n==Regional specialties==\n[[File:Sapin-sapin with sprinkled with crumbs.jpg|right|thumb|''Sapin-sapin'', a sweet Filipino rice-based delicacy similar to [[mochi]]]]\n[[File:Lafamilia22jf.JPG|thumb|Filipino cuisine prepared in [[Baliuag, Bulacan]].]]\n\nThe Philippine islands are home to various ethnic groups resulting in varied regional cuisines.\n\n===Luzonese cuisine===\n[[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]], from the rugged [[Ilocos Region]], boast of a diet heavy in boiled or steamed vegetables and freshwater fish, but they are particularly fond of dishes flavored with ''[[Bagoong terong|bagoong]]'', fermented fish that is often used instead of salt. Ilocanos often season boiled vegetables with ''[[bagoong monamon]]'' (fermented anchovy paste) to produce ''[[pinakbet]]''. Local specialties include the soft white larvae of ants and \"jumping salad\" of tiny live shrimp.\n\nThe [[Igorot]] prefer roasted meats, particularly [[carabao]] meat, goat meat, and [[venison]].\n\nDue to its mild, sub-tropical climate, [[Baguio]], along with the outlying mountainous regions, is renowned for its produce. Temperate-zone fruits and vegetables ([[Strawberry|strawberries]] being a notable example) which would otherwise wilt in lower regions are grown there. It is also known for a snack called ''sundot-kulangot'' which literally means \"poke the booger.\" It's actually a sticky kind of sweet made from milled glutinous rice flour mixed with molasses, and served inside ''pitogo'' shells, and with a stick to \"poke\" its sticky substance with.\n\n[[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] is known for Pancit Cabagan of [[Cabagan]], Inatata & Binallay of [[Ilagan City]] are rice cakes prepared year-round in the city and both famous delicacies specially during the lenten season.

Among the treats produced in [[Pampanga]] are ''[[Longanisa#Philippines|longganisa]]'' (original sweet and spicy sausages), ''calderetang kambing'' (savory goat stew), and ''[[tocino]]'' (sweetened cured pork).  Combining pork cheeks and offal, Kapampangans make ''[[sisig]]''.\n\nThe cuisine of the [[Tagalog people]] varies by province. [[Bulacan]] is popular for [[Chicharr\u00f3n]] ([[pork rind]]s) and steamed rice and tuber cakes like ''puto''. It is a center for ''panghimagas'' or desserts, like brown [[rice cake]] or ''kutsinta'', ''sapin-sapin'', ''[[suman (food)|suman]]'', [[cassava]] cake, ''halaya ube'' and the king of sweets, in [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]], [[Bulacan]], the famous [[carabao]] milk [[candy]] ''pastillas de leche'', with its ''pabalat'' wrapper.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/video/25212/-100-Pinoy--Pinoy-Panghimagas \"100% Pinoy: Pinoy Panghimagas\"].

These are usually topped with ''latik'', a mixture of coconut milk and brown sugar, reduced to a dry crumbly texture. A more modern, and time saving alternative to ''latik'' are coconut flakes toasted in a frying pan. [[Antipolo City]], straddled mid-level in the mountainous regions of the Philippine [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]], is a town known for its ''suman'' and cashew products. [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] is known for ''buko pie'' (coconut pie) and ''panutsa'' (peanut brittle). [[Batangas]] is home to [[Taal Lake]], a body of water that surrounds [[Taal Volcano]].  The lake is home to 75 species of freshwater fish, including landlocked marine species that have since adapted to the Taal lake environment. Eight of these species are of high commercial value. These include a population of [[giant trevally]] locally known as ''maliputo'' which is distinguished from their marine counterparts which are known as ''talakitok''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alaira |first1=Sofia A. |last2=Rebancos |first2=Carmelita M. |title=Maliputo (''Caranx ignobilis'' Foorskal) fish cage farming practices among selected operators in Taal Lake, Batangas, Philippines |journal=Journal of Nature Studies |date=2014 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=25\u201340 |url=http://www.journalofnaturestudies.org/files/JNS13-2/13(2)%2025-40%20Alaira-fullpaper.pdf}}</ref> Another commercially important species is the ''[[tawilis]]'', the only known freshwater [[sardine]] and [[endemic]] to the lake.

The \"chicken ''inasal''\" is a local version of chicken barbecue. It is cooked with red achuete or annatto seeds giving it a reddish color, and brushed with oil and cooked over the fire. The city is also famous for various delicacies such as ''[[Piaya (food)|piaya]]'', ''[[mille foglie|napoleones]]'' and ''pinasugbo'' (deep-fried and caramelled banana sprinkled with sesame seeds).\n\n\n[[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] is home to the famous ''[[Binagol]]'', [[Pastillas|Carabao Milk ''Pastillas'']], ''Suman Latik'' and ''Tsoko Moron''. [[Tacloban|Taclobanon]] cuisine is made unique by the wide use of kinagod(grated coconut) and ''hatok''(coconut milk). It is common to find ''hinatokan'' dishes in the city. ''[[Humba]]'' is said to have originated from the province since the cuisine in the region's cuisine distinctly has a slightly sweeter taste than the rest of the country. Leyte is inclined to the sea, thus, it is common to find multiple seafood dishes in the province. ''Masag''(crab) and   ''pasayan''(shrimp) are common sea food in the region. In an analysis of Waray food it is known that the Waray taste is mild. Other native delicacies from the province are ''Roskas''(hard cookies made from lard, anise, flour, sugar, butter and eggs) and ''Bukayo''(coconut strip  candies). \n\n[[Aklan]] is synonymous with ''[[inubarang manok]]'', chicken cooked with ''ubad'' (banana [[pith]]), as well as ''[[Binakol|binakol na manok]]'', chicken cooked in [[coconut water]] with lemongrass.

The cuisine of the indigenous ethnolinguistic nations who are either [[Christians|Christian]], [[Muslim]] or [[Lumad]] peoples of [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu archipelago]] has much in common with the rich and spicy [[Malay cuisine]] of [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]], as well as [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] and [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] cuisine, and from other countries cuisines.\n\nWell-known dishes from the region include ''[[Satay|Satti]]'' (satay) and ''ginataang manok'' (chicken cooked in spiced coconut milk). Certain parts of Mindanao are predominantly [[Muslim]], where pork is rarely consumed.\n\n''[[Rendang]]'', is an often spicy beef curry whose origins derive from the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people of [[Sumatra]]; ''[[biryani]]'' and ''[[pilaf|kiyoning]]'' (pilaf) are dishes originally from the [[Middle East]], that were given a Mindanaoan touch and served on special occasions.\n\n''[[Piyanggang manok]]'' is a Tausug dish made from barbecued chicken marinated in spices, and served with coconut milk infused with toasted coconut meat.\n\n''Chup\u00e1 Culo'' & ''Curacha con Gat\u00e2'' are examples of a Zamboangue\u00f1o dishes made from shells cooked with coconut milk and crab with sauce blended in coconut milk with spices, respectively.

It usually consists of pork or chicken, sometimes both, stewed or braised in a sauce usually made from vinegar, cooking oil, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns, and soy sauce. It can also be prepared \"dry\" by cooking out the liquid and concentrating the flavor. ''[[Bistek]]'', also known as \"Filipino beef steak,\" consists of thinly sliced beef marinated in [[soy sauce]] and calamansi and then fried in a skillet that is typically served with onions.\n\nSome well-known stews are ''[[kare-kare]]'' and ''[[dinuguan]]''. In ''kare-kare'', also known as \"peanut stew\", [[oxtail]] or ox [[tripe]] is the main ingredient and is cooked with vegetables in a peanut-based preparation. It is typically served with ''bagoong'' (fermented [[shrimp paste]]). In ''[[dinuguan]]'', pig's blood, entrails, and meat are cooked with vinegar and seasoned with chili peppers, usually ''[[siling mahaba]]''.\n\n[[File:Crispy pata.jpg|left|thumb|Crispy Pata]]\n[[File:Jochi Resto Grill Pork Adobo.jpg|thumb|Pork ''[[Philippine adobo|adobo]]'']]\n''[[Paksiw]]'' refers to different vinegar-based stews that differ greatly from one another based on the type of meat used. ''Paksiw na isda'' uses fish and usually includes the addition of ginger, fish sauce, and maybe ''siling mahaba'' and vegetables. ''Paksiw na baboy'' is a ''paksiw'' using pork, usually pork hocks, and often sees the addition of sugar, banana blossoms, and water so that the meat is stewed in a sweet sauce.  A similar Visayan dish called ''[[humba]]'' adds fermented black beans.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Both dishes are probably related to ''pata tim'' which is of Chinese origin. ''Paksiw na lechon'' is made from ''lechon'' meat and features the addition of ground liver or liver spread.  This adds flavor and thickens the sauce so that it starts to caramelize around the meat by the time dish is finished cooking. Although some versions of ''paksiw'' dishes are made using the same basic ingredients as ''adobo'', they are prepared differently, with other ingredients added and the proportions of ingredients and water being different.\n\nIn ''crispy pata'', [[pork]] knuckles (the ''pata'') are marinated in garlic-flavored vinegar then deep fried until crisp and golden brown, with other parts of the pork leg prepared in the same way. ''Lechon manok'' is the Filipino take on [[rotisserie]] chicken. Available in many hole-in-the-wall stands or restaurant chains (e.g. Andok's, Baliwag, Toto's, Sr. Pedro's, G.S. Pagtakhan's), it is typically a specially seasoned chicken roasted over a charcoal flame served with \"''sarsa''\" or ''lechon'' sauce made from mashed pork liver, starch, sugar, and spices.\n\n[[File:0001jfPhilippine cuisine dishes Baliuag Bulacafvf 30.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Dinuguan]]'', a pork blood stew with ''[[siling haba]]''.]]\n[[File:Bistek Tagalog-02.jpg|thumbnail|[[Bistek|Bistek Tagalog]], strips of sirloin beef slowly cooked in soy sauce, calamansi juice, and onions.]]\n[[File:9031Foods of Bulacan 05.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Sinigang|Sinigang na hipon]]'' with ''[[siling labuyo]]'' (wild chili).]]\n[[File:Tinolalunch.jpg|thumb|[[Tinola]], a chicken soup notable as the dish mentioned in [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s novel ''[[Noli Me T\u00e1ngere (novel)|Noli Me T\u00e1ngere]].]]\n[[File:Ensaladang Lato (Seaweed Salad) - Philippines 1.jpg|thumb|''Ensaladang Lato'' or \"Seaweed Salad\" (also known as ''Kinilaw na Guso'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]), a Filipino salad made from the edible green algae ''[[Caulerpa lentillifera]]''.]]\n''[[Mechado]]'', ''[[kaldereta]]'', and ''afritada'' are Spanish influenced tomato sauce-based dishes that are somewhat similar to one another. In these dishes meat is cooked in tomato sauce, minced garlic, and onions. ''Mechado'' gets its name from the pork fat that is inserted in a slab of beef making it look like a wick (''mitsa'') coming out of a beef \"candle\". The larded meat is then cooked in a seasoned tomato sauce and later sliced and served with the sauce it was cooked in. ''[[Kaldereta]]'' can be beef but is also associated with goat.  Chunks of meat are cooked in tomato sauce, minced garlic, chopped onions, peas, carrots, bell peppers and potatoes to make a stew with some recipes calling for the addition of soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar, chilies, ground liver or some combination thereof. ''Afritada'' tends to be the name given to the dish when chicken and pork is used.   Another similar dish said to originate from the Rizal area is ''waknatoy''. Pork or beef sirloin is combined with potatoes and cut sausages and cooked in a tomato-based sauce sweetened with pickles. ''[[Puchero]]'' is derived from the Spanish ''[[cozido|cocido]]''; it is a sweeter stew that has beef and banana or plantain slices simmered in tomato sauce.\n\nFilipinos also eat ''[[tocino]]'' and ''[[longganisa]]''. ''[[Tocino]]'' is a sweetened cured meat made with either chicken or pork and is marinated and cured for a number of days before being fried. ''[[Longanisa#Philippines|Longganisa]]'' is a sweet or spicy sausage, typically made from pork though other meats can also be used, and are often colored red traditionally through the use of the [[anatto]] seed but also artificial food coloring.\n\nFilipino soups tend to be very hearty and stew-like containing large chunks of meat and vegetables or noodles. They are usually intended to be filling and not meant to be a light preparatory introduction for the main course. They tend to be served with the rest of the meal and eaten with rice when they are not meals unto themselves. They are often referred to on local menus under the heading ''sabaw'' (broth). ''[[Sinigang]]'' is a popular dish in this category distinguished by its sourness that often vies with ''adobo'' for consideration as the national dish. It is typically made with either pork, beef, chicken or seafood and made sour with tamarind or other suitable souring ingredients. Some seafood variants for example can be made sour by the use of [[guava]] fruit or [[miso]]. Another dish is ''[[tinola]]''.

''[[Pancit]]'' recipes primarily consist of noodles, vegetables, and slices of meat or shrimp with variations often distinguished by the type of noodles used. Some ''pancit'', such as ''mami'' and La Paz-styled ''batchoy'', are noodle soups while the \"dry\" varieties are comparable to ''[[chow mein]]'' in preparation. Then there is spaghetti or ''ispageti'' in the local parlance that is a modified version of [[Spaghetti Bolognese|spaghetti bolognese]]. It is sometimes made with banana ketchup instead of tomato sauce, sweetened with sugar and topped with hot dog slices.\n\nThere are several rice porridges that are popular in the Philippines. One is ''[[arroz caldo]]'', which is a rice porridge cooked with chicken, ginger and sometimes saffron, garnished with spring onions (chives), toasted garlic, and coconut milk to make a type of [[gruel]]. Another variant is ''goto'' which is an ''arroz caldo'' made with ox [[tripe]]. There is also another much different rice porridge called ''[[champorado]]'' which is sweet and flavored with chocolate and often served at breakfast paired with ''tuyo'' or ''daing''.\n\nAnother rice-based dish is ''arroz a la valenciana'',<ref>{{cite book | last=Ku | first=R.J.S. | title=Eating Asian America: A Food Studies Reader | publisher=NYU Press | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4798-1023-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t34TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA150 | page=150}}</ref> a Spanish [[paella]] named after the Spanish region [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] that has been incorporated into the local cuisine.

A type of seafood salad known as ''[[kinilaw]]'' is made up of raw seafood such as fish or shrimp cooked only by steeping in local vinegar, sometimes with coconut milk, onions, spices and other local ingredients. It is comparable to the Peruvian [[ceviche]].\n\n==Side dishes and complements==\n[[File:Atchara - pickled papaya (Philippines) 02.jpg|right|thumb|Atchara]]\n\n''Itlog na pula'' (red eggs) are duck eggs that have been cured in brine or a mixture of clay-and-salt for a few weeks, making them salty. They are later hard boiled and dyed with red food coloring (hence the name) to distinguish them from chicken eggs before they are sold over the shelves. They are often served mixed in with diced tomatoes. ''[[Atchara]]'' is a side dish of pickled papaya strips similar to [[sauerkraut]].

One often seen dessert is ''[[bibingka]]'', a hot [[rice cake]] optionally topped with a pat of butter, slices of ''[[kesong puti]]'' (white cheese), ''itlog na maalat'' (salted duck eggs), and sometimes grated coconut. There are also glutinous rice sweets called ''[[Kalamay|biko]]'' made with sugar, butter, and coconut milk. In addition, there is a dessert known as ''bitsu-bitsu,'' also known as a Pinoy donut, made with fried rice flour which is then coated with Muscovado sugar syrup. There is also Karioka, made from glutinous rice flour, coconut, and coconut milk, fried and skewered and slathered with a brown sugar glaze. Another brown [[rice cake]] is ''[[kutsinta]]''.\n\n''[[Puto]]'' is another well-known example of sweet steamed rice cakes prepared in many different sizes and colors. ''[[Sapin-sapin]]'' (sapin means layer) are three-layered, tri-colored sweets made with rice flour, purple yam, and coconut milk characterized by its gelatinous appearance. ''[[Palitaw]]'' are rice patties that are covered with sesame seeds, sugar, and coconut; ''[[Pitsi-pits\u00ee|pisti-pisti]]'' which are [[cassava]] patties coated with cheese or coconut; and ''tibok-tibok'' is based on carabao milk as a de leche (similar to [[maja blanca]]).  As a snack, ''binatog'' is created with corn kernels with shredded coconut. Packaged snacks wrapped in banana or palm leaves then steamed, ''[[Suman (food)|suman]]'' are made from sticky rice.\nFor cold desserts there is ''[[halo-halo]]'' which can be described as a dessert made with shaved ice, milk, and sugar with additional ingredients like coconut, ''[[ube halaya]]'' (mashed purple yam) or [[ube ice cream]], \"leche flan\" or caramel custard, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[jackfruit]], red beans, [[tapioca]] and ''[[pinipig]]'' being typical.\n\nOther similar treats made with shaved ice include ''[[saba con yelo]]'' which is shaved ice served with milk and ''[[minatamis na saging]]'' (ripe plantains chopped and caramelized with brown sugar); ''mais con yelo'' which is shaved ice served with steamed corn kernels, sugar, and milk; and ''buko pandan'' sweetened grated strips of coconut with gulaman, milk, and the juice or extract from pandan leaves.  ''[[Sorbetes]]'' (ice cream) is popular, as well, with some local versions utilizing coconut milk instead of cow milk.  [[Freezie|Ice candy]], are popular frozen snacks usually made from [[fruit juice]], [[chocolate]] or local ingredients such as [[mung beans]] and [[Dioscorea alata|ube]].  It can be any kind of flavor depending on the maker; chocolate and ''buko'' (coconut) flavored ice candy are two of the most popular. Another dessert, often served during Christmas and New Year's Eve, is [[mango float]],<ref>{{cite news |author=\nElizabeth Ann Quirino |title=Have Filipino food, will travel |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/115686/have-filipino-food-will-travel/ |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}</ref> a dessert composed of [[Graham cracker]], mangoes, cream and milk, and created by layering them together in a dish and then refrigerating or blast chilling.\n\n==Street food and other snacks==\n[[File:06906jfBarangays Figueras Sampaloc Earnshaw Legarda Streets Manilafvf 14.jpg|thumb|An example of street foods in [[Manila]]]]\n[[File:Fishball Vending.jpg|thumb|A [[hawker (trade)|hawker]] selling fish balls in [[Angeles City]], [[Pampanga]]]]\nAside from pastries and desserts, there are heartier snacks for ''merienda'' that can also serve as either an appetizer or side dish for a meal. ''Siomai'' is the local version'' of Chinese [[shaomai]].''\n''[[Lumpia]]'' are spring rolls that can be either fresh or fried.  Fresh ''lumpia'' (''lumpiang sariwa'') is usually made for fiestas or special occasions as it can be labor-intensive to prepare, while one version of fried ''lumpia'' (''lumpiang prito''), ''lumpiang shanghai'' is usually filled with ground pork and a combination of vegetables, and served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce.<ref>{{cite book |title=Memories of Philippine Kitchens |author1=Besa, Amy  |author2=Romy Dorotan.  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Stewart, Tabori & Chang |year=2006 |isbn=1-58479-451-8}}</ref>  Other variations are filled with minced pork and shrimp and accompanied by a vinegar-based dipping sauce. ''Lumpia'' has been commercialized in [[frozen food]] form. Also, one of the common street food would be the [[Pares (food)|Beef Pares]] in Manila. While Middle-Eastern food such as the [[Shawarma]] became popular in the Philippines in the late 1980s.\n\nThere's a distinct range of [[street food]]s available in the Philippines. Some of these are skewered on sticks in the manner of a [[kebab]]. One such example is ''banana-cue'' which is a whole [[banana]] or [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] skewered on a short thin bamboo stick, rolled in brown sugar, and pan-fried. ''Kamote-cue'' is a peeled [[sweet potato]] skewered on a stick, covered in brown sugar and then pan-fried. [[Fish ball]]s or [[Fishballs|squid balls]] including [[Calamares]] are also pan-fried, then skewered on bamboo sticks and given to the customer, who then has a choice of dipping in a sweet or savory sauce. These are commonly sold frozen in markets and peddled by [[Hawker (trade)|street vendors]].\n\n''[[Turon (food)|Turon]]'', a kind of ''[[lumpia]]'' consisting of an eggroll or [[phyllo]] wrapper commonly filled with sliced [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] and occasionally [[jackfruit]], is fried and sprinkled with sugar.\n\n[[File:Taho.JPG|thumb|left|A ''magtataho'' (taho vendor) in [[Vigan]]]]\n''[[Taho]]'' is a warm treat made of soft [[beancurd]] which is the ''taho'' itself, dark caramel syrup called ''arnibal'', and [[tapioca]] pearls.  It is often sold in neighborhoods by street vendors who yell out \"''taho''\" in a manner like that of vendors in the stands at sporting events yelling out \"hotdogs\" or \"peanuts\". Sometimes, ''taho'' is served chilled, and flavors have recently been added, such as chocolate or strawberry. ''Taho'' is derived from the original [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] snack food known as ''[[douhua]]''.\n\nThere is also ''iskrambol'' (from the English \"to scramble\"), a kind of iced-based treat similar to a sorbet. The shaved ice is combined with various flavorings and usually topped with chocolate syrup. It is eaten by \"scrambling\" the contents or mixing them, then drinking with a large straw. It was later modified into ''ice scramble'', or simply ''scramble'', but with added skim milk, chocolate or strawberry syrup, and a choice of toppings such as [[marshmallows]], chocolate or candy sprinkles, rice crispies, or tapioca pearls.\n\n[[File:06749jfCuisine Foods Takoyaki cooking Balut Penoy Baliuag Bulacanfvf 22.jpg|thumb|''[[Balut (food)|Balut]]'']]\nStreet food featuring eggs include ''[[kwek-kwek]]'' which are hard-boiled quail eggs dipped in orange-dyed batter and then deep fried similar to [[tempura]]. ''Tokneneng'' is a larger version of ''kwek-kwek'' using chicken or duck eggs.  Another Filipino egg snack is ''[[Balut (egg)|balut]]'', essentially a boiled pre-hatched poultry egg, usually duck or chicken. These fertilized eggs are allowed to develop until the embryo reaches a pre-determined size and are then boiled. There is also another egg item called ''penoy,'' which is basically hard-boiled unfertilized duck eggs that does not contain embryo. Like ''taho'', ''balut'' is advertised by street hawkers calling out their product.\n\n''Okoy,'' also spelled as ''ukoy,'' is another batter-covered, deep-fried street food in the Philippines. Along with the batter, it normally includes bean sprouts, shredded pumpkin and very small shrimps, shells and all. It is commonly dipped in a combination of vinegar and chilli.\n\nAmong other street food are already mentioned [[#Pulutan|pulutan]] like ''[[isaw]]'', seasoned hog or chicken intestines skewered onto a stick and grilled; ''betamax'', roasted dried chicken blood cut into and served as small cubes, from which it received its name due to its crude resemblance to a [[Betamax]] tape; ''[[Adidas]]'', grilled chicken feet named after the popular shoe brand; and ''[[Proven (food)|proven]]'', the [[proventriculus]] of a chicken coated in cornstarch and deep-fried. Fries made from [[sweet potatoes]] have also been dubbed \"Pinoy fries\".\n\nIn addition to the Availability of the 24/7 burgers stands such as [[Burger Machine]] (nicknamed \"the burger that never sleeps\"), Angel's Burger, Franks N' Burgers and Minute Burger across the country.\n\n==Exotic dishes==\n[[File:0681jfRestaurants Rare Attractions San Miguel Bulacanfvf 23.JPG|thumb|A Tata Itong restaurant in [[San Miguel, Bulacan]] known for serving Filipino exotic dishes including Soup No. 5 and ''papaitan''.]]\nSome exotic dishes in the Filipino diet are ''camaro'', which are field crickets cooked in [[soy sauce]], salt, and vinegar, and is popular in [[Pampanga]]; ''papaitan,'' which is a stew made of goat or beef innards flavored with bile that gives it its characteristic bitter (''pait'') taste; ''[[Soup Number Five|Soup No. 5]]'' (Also spelled as \"Soup #5\") which is a soup made out of [[bull]]'s [[testes]],<ref>{{cite web | title =Bizarre food with Andrew Zimmern \u2013 Philippines| url=http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Bizarre_food/Episodes_Travel_Guides/Episode_Philippines | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref><ref>Sutherland, Matthew.

Other fruits are [[avocado]], [[cantaloupe]], [[durian]], [[papaya]], [[strawberry]] and [[watermelon]], to name a few.\n\nOther chilled drinks include ''sago't gulaman,'' a flavored ice drink of pre-Hispanic [[Malay race|Malay]] origin (Malay: ''[[gula melaka]]'') with [[sago]] and [[agar]] [[gelatin]] with banana extract sometimes added to the accompanying syrup; fresh ''buko'' or [[coconut juice]], the water or juice straight out of a young [[coconut]] via an inserted straw, a less fresh variation of which is from bottled coconut juice, scraped coconut flesh, sugar, and water; and kalamansi juice, the juice of [[kalamansi]] or Philippine limes usually sweetened with honey, syrup or sugar.\n\n====Brewed beverages====\nThe Philippines is a predominantly coffee-drinking nation. One of the most popular variants of coffee coming from the mountains of [[Batangas]] is known as ''[[Kape Barako|kapeng barako]]''. Another well-known variant of coffee is the ''[[kopi luwak|civet coffee]]''. It is called ''kape motit'' in the Cordilleras, ''kape alamid'' in Tagalog region, and ''kape musang'' in Mindanao. The Kalinga coffee known for its organic production is also rapidly gaining popularity. Highlands coffee, or Benguet coffee, is a blend of Robusta and Excelsa beans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Garcia's Pure Coffee|url=http://www.garciacoffee.com/typesofcoffee.html|publisher=Garcia's Kape, Tinapay Atbp.|accessdate=March 21, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502012525/http://www.garciacoffee.com/typesofcoffee.html|archivedate=May 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEven before the establishment of coffeehouses in the Philippines, coffee has been part of the Filipino meal. Carinderias would often serve them along with meals. The opening of [[Starbucks]] in 1997 paved the way for other [[coffee shops]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.starbucks.ph/|title=Home|website=Starbucks Coffee Company}}</ref>\n\n[[Tea]] consumption in the Philippines is driven primarily by growing health consciousness amongst middle- to high-income consumers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tea in the Philippines|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/tea-in-the-philippines/report|publisher=euromonitor.com}}</ref> Tea is commonly prepared using [[Carmona retusa|Philippine wild tea]] or [[Thea sinensis|tea tree]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Philippine Medicinal Plants - Tsaang Gubat|url=http://www.stuartxchange.com/Tsaang.html|publisher=www.stuartexchange.com}}</ref> There are several known variations of tea using different additives. Pandan iced tea is one of these, made with [[Pandanus|pandan]] leaves and [[lemongrass]] (locally known as ''tanglad''). [[Ginger tea|''Salabat'']], sometimes called ginger tea, is brewed from [[ginger]] root and usually served during the cold months, and when illnesses such as flu or sore throat strikes.\n\nThe late 2010s saw the opening of teahouses in major cities, and with a glass of milk tea being more affordable than the usual cold designer coffee, it paved the way into making tea a well-known food trend. Notable teahouse chains in the Philippins are [[Chatime]] and [[Serenitea]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Consunji|first=Bianca|title=The Mad Tea Party|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/1300/the-mad-tea-party|publisher=Inquirer}}</ref>\n\n''[[Tsokolate]]'' is the Filipino style of hot chocolate.  It is traditionally made with ''tablea'', which are pure cacao beans that are dried, roasted, ground and then formed into tablets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tablea Chocolate Cafe|url=http://tablea.com.ph/}}</ref> It is also popular during [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]], particularly among children.\n\n===Alcoholic beverages===\n{{See also|Beer in the Philippines}} {{See also|Philippine wine}}\n[[File:Lambanog.jpg|thumb|right|65px|A bubblegum-flavored [[lambanog]].]]\n[[File:05410jfFoods Cuisine Desserts of the Philippinesfvf 16.jpg|thumb|A bottle of [[Tapuy]] rice wine.]]\nThere are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks in the Philippines manufactured by local breweries and distilleries.\n\n[[Beer]] or ''serbesa'' (from the Spanish \"cerveza\") is the most widely available alcoholic drink in the Philippines. [[San Miguel Beer|San Miguel Pale Pilsen]] is the most popular and widely sold brand. Together with associated San Miguel beer brands such as San Mig Light and Gold Eagle Beer the company holds an aggregate market share of 92.7%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ong |first1=Henry |title=Financial Advisor |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com.ph/news-and-events/financial-adviser-5-things-to-know-about-the-san-Miguel-food-and-beverage-s-follow-on-offering-and-how-to-profit-from-it-a23-20180911-1frm |accessdate=6 October 2018 |publisher=Entrepreneur Philippines |date=11 September 2018}}</ref> Beer na Beer produced by local conglomerate [[Asia Brewery]] is another widely sold pale Pilsner style beer. Asia Brewery also produces under license and distributes a number of other mass market beers such as Colt 45, Asahi Super Dry, Heineken and Tiger Beer. Other beer labels include Red Horse Beer, Lone Star, Lone Star Light, Lone Star Ultra, Carlsberg, Coors Light, San Miguel Superdry, San Mig Strong Ice, and just recently, Manila Beer. Echoing trends in international markets, bars in urban areas have also begun to serve locally produced and imported craft beers in a variety of styles.\n\n[[Rum]] is often associated with [[Tanduay]].\n\nSeveral [[gin]]s, both local varieties like [[Ginebra San Miguel]] (as well as GSM Blue and GSM Premium Gin) and imported brands like [[Gilbey's]], are commonly found.  Some people refer to gin by the shape of the bottle: ''bilog'' for a circular bottle and ''kwatro kantos'' (literally meaning four corners) for a square or rectangular bottle.  Gin is sometimes combined with other ingredients to come up with variations.\n\n''[[Palm wine|Tuba]]'' (toddy) is a type of hard liquor made from fresh drippings extracted from a cut young stem of palm.  The cutting of the palm stem usually done early in the morning by a ''mananguete'', a person who climbs palm trees and extracts the ''tuba'' to supply to customers later in the day.  The morning's accumulated palm juice or drippings are then harvested by noon, and brought to buyers then prepared for consumption.  Sometimes this is done twice a day so that there are two harvests of ''tuba'' occurring first at noon-time and then in the late-afternoon.  Normally, ''tuba'' has to be consumed right after the ''mananguete'' brings it over, or it becomes too sour to be consumed as a drink.  Any remaining unconsumed ''tuba'' is then often stored in jars to ferment for several days and become palm vinegar. ''Tuba'' can be distilled to produce ''[[lambanog]]'' (arrack), a neutral liquor often noted for its relatively high alcohol content.\n\nLambanog is an alcoholic beverage commonly described as coconut wine or coconut vodka. The drink is distilled from the sap of the unopened coconut flower, and is known for its potency and high alcohol content (80 and 90 proof). Most of the Lambanog distilleries are in the Quezon province of Luzon, Philippines. Constant efforts at standardizing lambanog production has led to its better quality. Presently, lambanog is being exported to other countries and continues to win foreign customers over due to its natural ingredients as well as its potency.\n\n''[[Tapuy]]'' is a traditional Philippine alcoholic drink made from fermented ''[[glutinous rice]]''.  It is a clear wine of luxurious alcoholic taste, moderate sweetness and lingering finish. Its average alcohol content is 14% or 28 proof, and it does not contain any preservatives or sugar. To increase the awareness of ''tapuy'', the [[Philippine Rice Research Institute]] has created a cookbook containing recipes and cocktails from famous Filipino chefs and bartenders, featuring ''tapuy'' as one of the ingredients.\n\n==Eating methods==\n{{Unreliable sources|section|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:Boodle Fight (Baler, Aurora).jpg|thumb|[[Boodle fight]] in [[Baler, Aurora]].]]\n\nDuring the Spanish occupation, which yielded Western influences, Filipinos ate with the paired utensils of spoon and fork. The knife was not used as in other countries, because Spain prohibited them to have knives. Filipinos use the side of the spoon, to \"cut\" the food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://askthepinoy.blogspot.com/2011/01/why-do-filipinos-eat-with-spoon-and.html |title=Ask A Filipino!: Why do Filipinos eat with a spoon and a fork? |publisher=Askthepinoy.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}{{User-generated inline|certain=y|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\nNowadays, the use of hands during eating, known as \"kamayan\" (using the washed left hand for picking the centralized food and the right hand for bringing food to the mouth), has become a trend. ''Kamayan'' generally means \"eating with your hands\", which was how Filipinos ate before the colonial era. It is further becoming more popular due to the incorporation of the \"[[boodle fight]]\" concept, a style of dining popularized by the Philippine Army, which utilizes banana leaves spread out on the table as the main serving platter, upon which is laid out portions of rice and a variety of Filipino dishes for friendly, filial or communal feasting. The use of spoons and forks, however, is still the norm.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Philippine desserts]]\n* [[List of Philippine dishes]]\n* [[List of Philippine restaurant chains]]\n* [[Philippine condiments]]\n* [[Filipino-American cuisine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"philstar.com 2015-1\">{{cite web | title=CNN poll: Philippines has world\u2019s 2nd best food | website=[[The Philippine Star]] | date=June 16, 2015 | url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/06/16/1466440/cnn-poll-philippines-has-worlds-2nd-best-food | accessdate=April 7, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040608/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/06/16/1466440/cnn-poll-philippines-has-worlds-2nd-best-food | archive-date=October 6, 2016 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<div style=\"font-size:97%\">\n* {{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1r49TUuMFTEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n|title=Banana Leaves: Filipino Cooking and Much More\n|author=Alcuaz, N.T.\n|publisher=Trafford\n|location=Victoria\n|year=2005\n|isbn=1-4120-5378-1\n|accessdate=2009-12-12}}\n* {{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUaDoUF0tRwC&pg=PA13&dq=filipino+cuisine#v=onepage&q=filipino%20cuisine&f=false\n|title=The Philippine Cookbook\n|author=Alejandro, Reynaldo.\n|publisher=Perigee Books\n|location=New York\n|year=1985\n|page=13\n|isbn=0-399-51144-X\n|accessdate=2009-12-10}}\n* {{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4RMvoLQ5KQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n|title=Cocina Filipina\n|author=Aleson, Susana, Alice Gratil, Lota Ignacio, Mhila Baiyon, Gladys Moya, and Virginia Zarate.\n|publisher=Icaria\n|location=Barcelona\n|language=Spanish\n|year=1998\n|isbn=84-7426-358-1\n|accessdate=2009-12-12}}\n* Arroyo, Patricia T.

The campaign can be divided into 3 stages: the White offensive (June 6 \u2013 July 3), trench warfare around the Kakhovka Brigdehead (August 20 \u2013 October 27) and the counterattack of the Red Army (October 28 \u2013 November 3).\n\n== Prelude ==\nOn April 4, the defeated [[Anton Denikin]] transferred the post of the commander of the AFSR to General [[Pyotr Wrangel]]. Having reformed the remnants of the AFSR into a 25,000-strong army, Wrangel gave her the name ''Russian Army''.\n\nThe operational action plan for the [[Southwestern Front (RSFSR)|South Western Front]] of the Red Army in the second half of June 1920 was as follows: \n* the [[13th Army (RSFSR)|13th Army]], located on the right bank of the Dnieper was to develop an offensive from the area Berislav in the general direction [[Kakhovka]] - [[Perekop]]. \n* [[Ivan Fedko]]'s group (30th, 46th and 15th divisions, 2nd infantry brigade and two brigades of the 23rd Infantry Division), deployed at the Sherebets-Orekhov-Pogoly front, was to strike in the direction of [[Melitopol]]. The actions of these two groups had to bind the enemy's main forces.\n\nAt this time, the mounted group under command of [[Dmitry Zhloba]], concentrated on June 27 in the area of the Husark \u2013 Popovka \u2013 Belmanka \u2013 Tsarekonstantinovka, aimed at Melitopol. The group was composed of the 1st Cavalry Corps (3800 sabers under [[Dmitry Zhloba]]), the 2nd Stavropol Cavalry Division (1340 sabers under [[Pavel Dybenko]]) and two cavalry brigades of the 40th Division (1,500 sabers).\n\n== Destruction of the Red 1st Cavalry Corps (29 June \u2013 3 July) == \n\nOn June 28, the cavalry group Zhloba breaks through the front of the Don Corps and takes Chernigovka. On the next day, they advance further in the general direction of Pragenau-Astrakhanka. At the same time, the White Army pulls large infantry forces into the area to surround the cavalry group Zhloba from the north and the south.\nThe total number of forces allocated to the encirclement of the Red cavalry reached 10,000\u201311,000.\n\nOn the dawn of July 3, the white units went on the offensive to encircle and finally eliminate the red cavalry of Zhloba. The aviation of the Russian Army also inflicted heavy losses on the Zhloba corps. On July 3, 1920, General Morozov dealt the final blow to the already smashed corps of Zhloba.\n\nAs a result of this brilliant victory, the Russian Army of Wrangel was able to seize the strategic initiative and continue the offensive against [[Yekaterinoslav]] and Southern Little Russia. The large losses of the Red Army troops forced them to retreat.

The campaign can be divided into 3 stages: the White offensive (June 6 \u2013 July 3), trench warfare around the Kakhovka Brigdehead (August 20 \u2013 October 27) and the counterattack of the Red Army (October 28 \u2013 November 3).\n\n== Prelude ==\nOn April 4, the defeated [[Anton Denikin]] transferred the post of the commander of the AFSR to General [[Pyotr Wrangel]]. Having reformed the remnants of the AFSR into a 25,000-strong army, Wrangel gave her the name ''Russian Army''.\n\nThe operational action plan for the [[Southwestern Front (RSFSR)|South Western Front]] of the Red Army in the second half of June 1920 was as follows: \n* the [[13th Army (RSFSR)|13th Army]], located on the right bank of the Dnieper was to develop an offensive from the area Berislav in the general direction [[Kakhovka]] - [[Perekop]]. \n* [[Ivan Fedko]]'s group (30th, 46th and 15th divisions, 2nd infantry brigade and two brigades of the 23rd Infantry Division), deployed at the Sherebets-Orekhov-Pogoly front, was to strike in the direction of [[Melitopol]]. The actions of these two groups had to bind the enemy's main forces.\n\nAt this time, the mounted group under command of [[Dmitry Zhloba]], concentrated on June 27 in the area of the Husark \u2013 Popovka \u2013 Belmanka \u2013 Tsarekonstantinovka, aimed at Melitopol. The group was composed of the 1st Cavalry Corps (3800 sabers under [[Dmitry Zhloba]]), the 2nd Stavropol Cavalry Division (1340 sabers under [[Pavel Dybenko]]) and two cavalry brigades of the 40th Division (1,500 sabers).\n\n== Destruction of the Red 1st Cavalry Corps (29 June \u2013 3 July) == \n\nOn June 28, the cavalry group Zhloba breaks through the front of the Don Corps and takes Chernigovka. On the next day, they advance further in the general direction of Pragenau-Astrakhanka. At the same time, the White Army pulls large infantry forces into the area to surround the cavalry group Zhloba from the north and the south.\nThe total number of forces allocated to the encirclement of the Red cavalry reached 10,000\u201311,000.\n\nOn the dawn of July 3, the white units went on the offensive to encircle and finally eliminate the red cavalry of Zhloba. The aviation of the Russian Army also inflicted heavy losses on the Zhloba corps. On July 3, 1920, General Morozov dealt the final blow to the already smashed corps of Zhloba.\n\nAs a result of this brilliant victory, the Russian Army of Wrangel was able to seize the strategic initiative and continue the offensive against [[Yekaterinoslav]] and Southern Little Russia. The large losses of the Red Army troops forced them to retreat. The supporters of the White movement had regained the hope of winning the war.\nBy the mid-July the White Army had seized Northern Taurida.\n\n== Kakhovka Bridgehead ==\n\nTo stop the Whites, the [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the RSFSR issued an order to establish the [[Southern Front (RSFSR)|Southern Front]] under the command of [[Mikhail Frunze]].

Following this successful start, however, the team's performance went downhill and they only won another 2 matches that season, which were against Kings XI Punjab and [[Deccan Chargers]], both away.

The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj.

It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]].

But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain.

The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar.

Known as ''Cheer Queens'', these cheerleaders were dressed up in traditional Indian attire designed by famous [[Bollywood]] designer [[Neeta Lulla]] and performed traditional Indian dances choreographed by ace choreographers [[Ganesh Hegde]] and [[Tanusree Shankar]], not the traditional gymnastic routines which are usually associated with cheerleading.<ref name=\"cheerleaders\">[http://www.infrawindow.com/weekends/ipl-cheerleaders_10_13/ IPL cheerleaders]</ref> In the words of Subrata Roy-\n\n{{quote|With Pune Warriors India's ''Cheer Queens'', we intend to showcase and bring recognition to the rich and diverse culture of India at an international platform.

The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj. Yuvraj was set to miss the whole [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]] as he was undergoing treatment for [[germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]].<ref name=\"withdraw\"/> On 6 February 2012, [[Subrata Roy]], the chairman of Sahara India Pariwar, said that Sourav Ganguly will take a call on reconciliation.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/sourav-ganguly-to-take-call-on-reconciliation-subroto-roy/|title=Sourav Ganguly to take call on reconciliation: Subroto Roy}}</ref> A week later, the BCCI announced that they have allowed Yuvraj Singh's replacement for Pune Warriors India for the 2012 season, though a deadlock still persisted between the two parties on long-term sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/bcci-sahara-feud-unresolved-board-refuses-to-make-any-exceptions/articleshow/11872185.cms |title=BCCI-Sahara feud unresolved, Board refuses to make any exceptions \u2013 Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2012, the BCCI and Sahara ended their differences and announced that Pune Warriors India will play in IPL 5.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pune Warriors India to play in IPL 5|date=4 February 2012|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/pune-warriors-india-to-play-in-ipl-5/}}</ref> The BCCI agreed to give Sahara a total purse of $3.4 million, $1.6 million from the money that they had for the auction and $1.8 million as compensation due to the absence of Yuvraj. It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]]. They also signed Indian players including [[Raiphi Gomez]], [[Ali Murtaza]], [[Ashok Dinda]], [[Anustup Majumdar]] and [[Mahesh Rawat]].

But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain.

The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

In ''Lowery v Insurance Australia Ltd'', the NSW Court of Appeal held that where documents requested in the schedule of a subpoena are deemed to have no relevance to the proceedings in dispute, the subpoena may be set aside as it has no legitimate forensic purpose. It was also held that it was not the role of the Court to redraft the subpoena and narrow its scope to those issues in dispute.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2015/303.html ''Lowery v Insurance Australia Ltd'' [2015&#93;] NSWCA 303</ref> In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] a subpoena is usually issued by a court registry officer, and does not require leave of the court.\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn New Zealand, subpoenas are governed under the rules of the court in which the subpoena is issued.\n\n=== United States ===\nSubpoenas are usually issued by the clerk of the court in the name of the judge presiding over the case. Additionally, court rules may permit lawyers to issue subpoenas themselves in their capacity as officers of the court. Typically subpoenas are issued \"in blank\" and it is the responsibility of the lawyer representing the [[plaintiff]] or [[defendant]] on whose behalf the testimony is to be given to [[Service of process|serve]] the subpoena on the witness. If a witness is reluctant to testify, then the personal service of subpoena is usually required with proof of service by non-party server.\n\nThe subpoena will usually be on the letterhead of the court where the case is filed, name the parties to the case, and be addressed by name to the person whose testimony is being sought. It will contain the language \"You are hereby commanded to report in person to the clerk of this court\" or similar, describing the specific location, scheduled date and time of the appearance. Some issuing jurisdictions include an admonishment advising the subject of the criminal penalty for failure to comply with a subpoena, and reminding him or her not to leave the court facilities until excused by a competent authority. In some situations the person having to testify or produce documents is paid.\n\n''[[Pro se]]'' litigants who represent themselves, unlike lawyers, must ask a court clerk to officially issue them subpoena forms when they need to call witnesses by phone or in person, or when they need to officially request documents to be sent to them or directly to court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/general/prose-litigants.htm|title=Pro Se Litigants / Representing Yourself}}</ref> Any documents that have not been subpoenaed to court or verified by a witness may be dismissed by the opposite party as [[hearsay]], unless excepted by [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay rules]] or permitted by the judge. If the witness is called via long-distance phone call, then the requesting party is responsible for initiating the call and providing a payment with a prepaid phone card. Most states (including California) have further restrictions on subpoena use in criminal cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spolinlaw.com/blog/2016/10/05/los-angeles-criminal-court-subpoenas/|title=Los Angeles Criminal Court Subpoenas / Rules and Regulations}}</ref>\n\nSome states (as is the case in Florida) require the subpoenaing party to first file a Notice of Intent to Serve Subpoena, or a Notice of Production from Non-Party ten days prior to issuing the subpoena, so that the other party may have ample time to file any objections.\n\nAlso, the party being subpoenaed has the right to object to the issuance of the subpoena, if it is for an improper purpose, such as subpoenaing records that have no relevance to the proceedings, or subpoenaing persons who would have no evidence to present, or subpoenaing records or testimony that is confidential or privileged.\n\nStanding committees in both houses of the [[United States Congress]] have the authority to send out subpoenas for legitimate lawmaking and investigation purposes. This compels the production of testimony or records, and failure to respond constitutes [[contempt of Congress]].<ref>{{cite court |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/365/399/case.html|litigants=Wilkinson v. United States 365 U.S. 399 (1961) |reporter=justia.com|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n\nThere are several exceptions to being required to testify in court. Such examples include;\n\n[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] - Under the Fifth Amendment to the American constitution, no person shall be compelled to be a witness against themselves. Witnesses can't be forced to testify if the testimony will incriminate them. This right can, however, be denied if the witness is granted immunity by the jury. This immunity allows them to testify, and makes them immune to prosecution for any crimes they confess to. \n\n\n\n[[Spousal privilege]] - In most cases, a person cannot be compelled to testify against their spouse. This rule exists as a consequence of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and the \"One flesh\" concept of Marriage. Under this rule, since married spouses are joined together in one flesh, they shouldn't be forced to testify against each other. Exceptions to this rule include domestic violence or sexual abuse cases.\n\n\nCounselors or Priests - Communication with a counselor or priest is considered privileged, because both jobs involve clients being completely honest, without having to fear the consequences. \n\nLawyers - In order to get the best legal advice, clients must tell all details to their lawyer without fear of consequences, so therefore communication with a lawyer is protected, and a lawyer can't be forced to testify against a client.\n\n\nDoctors - Doctors are forbidden from disclosing patient documents without the patient's permission, under the law of [[Patient Confidentiality]]. Therefore, a doctor's testimony against a patient is a violation of their oath. As a result, doctors can never be forced to disclose medical records.\n\nDiplomats - Foreign diplomats can never be forced to testify in court, under [[Diplomatic Immunity]]. \n\nDefendants - Defendants can not be forced to testify against themselves, or others involved in the crime. This is protected under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].\n\nIncompetent Witness or Evidence - A witness may have memory issues, which can affect their ability to truthfully recall events. They also may not be physically fit to appear in court.\n\nInadmissible Evidence - If the evidence is illegally obtained, it is not admissible in court. For example, someone who sneaks onto private property and overhears a private conversation between 2 spouses will not be allowed to testify in court. The same goes for illegally recorded conversations, illegally taken photos, or eavesdropped conversations. For example, if a burglar broke into a home and discovered drugs inside, their evidence would not be allowed in court, as it was illegally obtained.\n\n== \"Friendly Subpoena\" ==\nA \"friendly subpoena\" is a subpoena that is issued to an individual or entity who might otherwise testify or submit evidence willingly without a subpoena, but is prevented from doing so due to a higher order legal, ethical or regulatory loyalty or fiduciary responsibility, which can only be superseded by a subpoena.
