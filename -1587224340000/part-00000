Tafur's book is dedicated to a member of the de Guzm\u00e1n family.</ref> Dominic's mother, [[Jane of Aza]], was beatified by [[Pope Leo XII]] in 1828.\n\n===Education and early career===\n[[File:Daniel van den Dyck - St Dominic accompanied by Simon de Montfort raising the crucifix against the Albigensians.JPG|thumb|240px|''A picture of St Dominic accompanied by Simon de Montfort raising the crucifix against the Cathars'' by [[Daniel van den Dyck]]]]\nDominic was educated in the schools of Palencia (they became a university soon afterward) where he devoted six years to the [[arts]] and four to [[theology]]. In 1191, when Spain was desolated by famine,{{sfn|Guiraud|1913|p=7}} young Dominic gave away his money and sold his clothes, furniture, and even precious manuscripts to feed the hungry. Dominic reportedly told his astonished fellow students, \"Would you have me study off these dead skins when men are dying of hunger?\"<ref>Thomsett, Michael C., ''The Inquisition: A History'',(McFarland, 2010), p. 54</ref> In 1194, around age twenty-five, Dominic joined the [[Canons Regular]] in the [[canonry]] in the [[Burgo de Osma Cathedral|Cathedral of Osma]], following the rule of Saint Augustine.\n \nIn 1203 or 1204 he accompanied [[Diego de Acebo]], the [[Bishop of Osma]], on a diplomatic mission for [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]], [[King of Castile]], to secure a bride in [[Denmark]] for crown prince Ferdinand.<ref>[[Jordan of Saxony]], ''Libellus de principiis'' pp. 14\u201320; G\u00e9rard de Frachet, ''Chronica prima'' [MOPH 1.321].</ref> The envoys traveled to Denmark via [[Aragon]] and the south of [[France]]. The marriage negotiations ended successfully, but the princess died before leaving for Castile.<ref name=3op/>\n\nAround 1205, Dominic, along with Diego de Acebo, began a program in the south of [[France]], to convert the [[Cathar]]s, a Christian religious sect with gnostic and dualistic beliefs, which the Roman Catholic Church deemed heretical. As part of this, Catholic-Cathar public debates were held at [[Verfeil, Haute-Garonne|Verfeil]], [[Servian (commune)|Servian]], [[Pamiers]], [[Montr\u00e9al, Aude|Montr\u00e9al]] and elsewhere. Dominic concluded that only preachers who displayed real sanctity, humility and asceticism could win over convinced Cathar believers. However, even Dominic managed only a few converts among the Cathars.\n\n===Foundation of the Dominicans===\n[[File:7, 8 place du Parlement Chapelle, Toulouse.jpg|thumb|Saint Dominic's House in [[Toulouse]]]]\n\nIn 1215, Dominic established himself, with six followers, in a house given by Peter Seila, a rich resident of [[Toulouse]].{{sfn|Guiraud|1913|pp=65\u201366}} Dominic saw the need for a new type of organization to address the spiritual needs of the growing cities of the era, one that would combine dedication and systematic education, with more organizational flexibility than either monastic orders or the secular clergy. He subjected himself and his companions to the [[monastic]] rules of [[prayer]] and [[penance]]; and meanwhile [[Folquet de Marselha|Bishop Foulques]] gave them written authority to preach throughout the territory of Toulouse.<ref>[http://www.dominicains.ca/francais/Documents/documents_gen/approbation2.htm French translation of Foulques' 1215 letter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111153214/http://www.dominicains.ca/francais/Documents/documents_gen/approbation2.htm |date=11 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1215, the year of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], Dominic and Foulques went to Rome to secure the approval of the Pope, [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]]. Dominic returned to Rome a year later, and was finally granted written authority in December 1216 and January 1217 by the new pope, [[Honorius III]] for an order to be named ''\"The Order of Preachers\"'' (''\"Ordo Praedicatorum\"'', or ''\"O.P.,\"'' popularly known as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or Order of Preachers)\n\nIn the winter of 1216\u20131217, at the house of [[Gregory IX|Ugolino de' Conti]], Dominic first met [[William of Montferrat (monk)|William of Montferrat]], who joined Dominic as a friar in the Order of Preachers and remained a close friend.{{sfn|Guiraud|1913|p=137}}\n\n===Later life===\nBlessed Cecilia Caesarini, who was received by Dominic into his new order, in her old age described him as \"...thin and of middle height.

Before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of [[San Sisto Vecchio]], which Honorius III had given to Dominic circa 1218, intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at Rome under Dominic's guidance. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at [[Santa Sabina]] with its ''studium conventuale'', the first Dominican ''studium'' in Rome, occurred with the legal transfer of property from Pope [[Honorius III]] to the [[Dominican Order|Order of Preachers]] on 5 June 1222, though the brethren had taken up residence there already in 1220.<ref>[http://www.domcentral.org/trad/domwork/domwork03.htm Pierre Mandonnet, O.P.

Herder Book Co., St. Louis/London, Chapt. III, note 50: \"If the installation at Santa Sabina does not date from 1220, at least it is from 1221. The official grant was made only in June 1222 (Bullarium O.P., I, 15). But the terms of the bull show that there had been a concession earlier. Before that concession the Pope said that the friars had no hospitium in Rome.

As part of this, Catholic-Cathar public debates were held at [[Verfeil, Haute-Garonne|Verfeil]], [[Servian (commune)|Servian]], [[Pamiers]], [[Montr\u00e9al, Aude|Montr\u00e9al]] and elsewhere.

Before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of [[San Sisto Vecchio]], which Honorius III had given to Dominic circa 1218, intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at Rome under Dominic's guidance. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at [[Santa Sabina]] with its ''studium conventuale'', the first Dominican ''studium'' in Rome, occurred with the legal transfer of property from Pope [[Honorius III]] to the [[Dominican Order|Order of Preachers]] on 5 June 1222, though the brethren had taken up residence there already in 1220.<ref>[http://www.domcentral.org/trad/domwork/domwork03.htm Pierre Mandonnet, O.P.

She received her PhD from the [[University of London]] in 1986. Since 1992, Lipscombe has spent her career teaching graduate students and researching at [[Brown University]]. Some of her current research experiments range from creating new and improved ways of using [[Bioluminescence]], to looking at voltage-gated calcium channels and how they are affected by normal cell behavior, as well as abnormal cell behavior caused by a disease. Throughout her scientific career she has accumulated numerous awards not only from Brown University, but from several research projects as well as the [[American Heart Association]]. She is also on several committee boards, has been editors of many magazines and articles, and served as the president of the [[Society for Neuroscience]] from 2018\u20132019.\n\n== Education and research ==\nLipscombe attended the University of London and graduated with a bachelors of science in 1982.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dlipscom|title=Lipscombe, Diane|website=vivo.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> She stayed at the University of London to receive a PhD in [[pharmacology]] and graduated in 1986. From there she went on to [[Yale University]] to study with [[Richard W. Tsien]] as a postdoctoral associate. From Yale University, she then went on to [[Stanford University Medical School]]. Lipscombe joined the Department of Neuroscience at Brown in 1992. Her studies focus on expression, regulation and function of voltage-gated calcium ion channels. She went on to write upwards of seventy scientific articles ranging from finding more about RNA and DNA binding proteins to articles dealing with chronic pain and psychiatric disorders. She is currently a graduate student professor at Brown University working on projects. She has taught within the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the Marine Biology Lab. She trains students in whole cell and single channel patch recording methods, mostly with voltage-gated calcium ion channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dlipscom#Teaching|title=Lipscombe, Diane|website=vivo.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n[[File:Quiet Green - Brown University.jpg|thumb|This is where Dr. Lipscombe is currently working with Graduate students in her lab.

Lipscombe has spent time studying [[alternative splicing]] variants of different channels, and how variants cause varied biophysical properties and expression in the tissue.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example of a biophysical property of calcium channels include if the channel is fast or slow when the channel uses voltage gated inactivation or activation.<ref>{{Citation|last=An|first=Mary T.|chapter=Voltage-Dependent Inactivation of Voltage Gated Calcium Channels|pages=194\u2013204|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-306-47840-6|last2=Zamponi|first2=Gerald W.|title=Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels|series=Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit|year=2005|doi=10.1007/0-387-27526-6_12}}</ref> \n\nCa<sub>V</sub>s are made up of multiple subunits and have many genes that code for them. These subunits are then subdivided into various channels. Dr. Lipscombe has studied many of these channels. An example of one of these channels is known as the Ca<sub>V</sub> 3.3 channel. The variations T797M and R1346H are two [[Missense mutation|missense]] variations of the gene encoding the Ca<sub>V</sub> 3.3 channel, and is associated with patients with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Arturo|last2=Brennecke|first2=Ashton|last3=Mallat|first3=Shayna|last4=Brown|first4=Julian|last5=Gomez-Rivadeneira|first5=Juan|last6=Czepiel|first6=Natalie|last7=Londrigan|first7=Laura|date=2019-07-19|title=Genetic Associations between Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels and Psychiatric Disorders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=20|issue=14|pages=3537|doi=10.3390/ijms20143537|issn=1422-0067|pmc=6679227|pmid=31331039}}</ref> Her contributions show that R1346H lessens the calcium current.\n\nCalcium channels are crucial to whether or not there is [[neurotransmitter]] release. The alteration of neurons and their functions have been found to lead to neurodevelopmental disorders/diseases. Presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals in neurons are found to be very important in calcium channels. Lipscombe specifically demonstrated that when Neurexin (NRX-1) and Neuroligin (NLG-1), or presynaptic cell adhesion proteins, adhere to the synaptic cleft, it is linked to autism in humans.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Avazzadeh|first=Sahar|last2=McDonagh|first2=Katya|last3=Reilly|first3=Jamie|last4=Wang|first4=Yanqin|last5=Boomkamp|first5=Stephanie D.|last6=McInerney|first6=Veronica|last7=Krawczyk|first7=Janusz|last8=Fitzgerald|first8=Jacqueline|last9=Feerick|first9=Niamh|last10=O\u2019Sullivan|first10=Matthew|last11=Jalali|first11=Amirhossein|date=December 2019|title=Increased Ca2+ signaling in NRXN1\u03b1+/\u2212 neurons derived from ASD induced pluripotent stem cells|journal=Molecular Autism|volume=10|issue=1|pages=52|doi=10.1186/s13229-019-0303-3|issn=2040-2392|pmc=6937972|pmid=31893021}}</ref> Lipscombe has studied the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release through coupling methods. Coupling method occurs when two things come together to form a common intermediate that will serve another purpose. This intermediate will either inhibit a function or excite something to carry out a function. This excitatory response found in Lipscombe\u2019s studies allow calcium channels to open and neurotransmitters to be released again. The deletion of the NRXN1 gene, which is linked to Neurexin, does not allow for neurotransmitters to be released.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Current research ==\nLipscombe is currently researching cell mechanisms and how they affect Ca<sub>V</sub>s when normal functioning is occurring, as well as when normal function is not occurring.

Voltage gated calcium channels are\u00a0 made up of various sub-units which make it a multi-complex protein. The N-type channels are a major pain target that take part in excitability which leads to neurotransmitter release in [[nociceptor]]. In order to understand the voltage gated calcium channel sub-types, Lipscombe works on various channel inhibitors that specifically target the inhibitor essential in decreasing pain.\n\nCurrently Lipscombe is working in her lab on a project that looks at the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and its origin and underlying cellular defects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Held|first=Aaron|last2=Major|first2=Paxton|last3=Sahin|first3=Asli|last4=Reenan|first4=Robert A.|last5=Lipscombe|first5=Diane|last6=Wharton|first6=Kristi A.|date=2019-03-20|title=Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=39|issue=12|pages=2347\u20132364|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1771-18.2019|issn=0270-6474|pmc=6433758|pmid=30659087}}</ref> They used a Drosophila Sod1G85R knock-in model, which is an ideal specimen for looking at this disease.

She received her PhD from the [[University of London]] in 1986. Since 1992, Lipscombe has spent her career teaching graduate students and researching at [[Brown University]]. Some of her current research experiments range from creating new and improved ways of using [[Bioluminescence]], to looking at voltage-gated calcium channels and how they are affected by normal cell behavior, as well as abnormal cell behavior caused by a disease. Throughout her scientific career she has accumulated numerous awards not only from Brown University, but from several research projects as well as the [[American Heart Association]]. She is also on several committee boards, has been editors of many magazines and articles, and served as the president of the [[Society for Neuroscience]] from 2018\u20132019.\n\n== Education and research ==\nLipscombe attended the University of London and graduated with a bachelors of science in 1982.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dlipscom|title=Lipscombe, Diane|website=vivo.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> She stayed at the University of London to receive a PhD in [[pharmacology]] and graduated in 1986. From there she went on to [[Yale University]] to study with [[Richard W. Tsien]] as a postdoctoral associate. From Yale University, she then went on to [[Stanford University Medical School]]. Lipscombe joined the Department of Neuroscience at Brown in 1992. Her studies focus on expression, regulation and function of voltage-gated calcium ion channels. She went on to write upwards of seventy scientific articles ranging from finding more about RNA and DNA binding proteins to articles dealing with chronic pain and psychiatric disorders. She is currently a graduate student professor at Brown University working on projects. She has taught within the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the Marine Biology Lab. She trains students in whole cell and single channel patch recording methods, mostly with voltage-gated calcium ion channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dlipscom#Teaching|title=Lipscombe, Diane|website=vivo.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n== Overall research focus ==\nLipscombe has spent her career researching voltage-gated calcium ion channels within different parts of the nervous system.<ref name=\":1\" />  These voltage-gated calcium ion channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>s) have a link to certain psychiatric disorders, which is what Lipscombe is interested in. Lipscombe has spent time studying [[alternative splicing]] variants of different channels, and how variants cause varied biophysical properties and expression in the tissue.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example of a biophysical property of calcium channels include if the channel is fast or slow when the channel uses voltage gated inactivation or activation.<ref>{{Citation|last=An|first=Mary T.|chapter=Voltage-Dependent Inactivation of Voltage Gated Calcium Channels|pages=194\u2013204|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-306-47840-6|last2=Zamponi|first2=Gerald W.|title=Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels|series=Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit|year=2005|doi=10.1007/0-387-27526-6_12}}</ref> \n\nCa<sub>V</sub>s are made up of multiple subunits and have many genes that code for them. These subunits are then subdivided into various channels. Dr. Lipscombe has studied many of these channels. An example of one of these channels is known as the Ca<sub>V</sub> 3.3 channel. The variations T797M and R1346H are two [[Missense mutation|missense]] variations of the gene encoding the Ca<sub>V</sub> 3.3 channel, and is associated with patients with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Arturo|last2=Brennecke|first2=Ashton|last3=Mallat|first3=Shayna|last4=Brown|first4=Julian|last5=Gomez-Rivadeneira|first5=Juan|last6=Czepiel|first6=Natalie|last7=Londrigan|first7=Laura|date=2019-07-19|title=Genetic Associations between Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels and Psychiatric Disorders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=20|issue=14|pages=3537|doi=10.3390/ijms20143537|issn=1422-0067|pmc=6679227|pmid=31331039}}</ref> Her contributions show that R1346H lessens the calcium current.\n\nCalcium channels are crucial to whether or not there is [[neurotransmitter]] release. The alteration of neurons and their functions have been found to lead to neurodevelopmental disorders/diseases. Presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals in neurons are found to be very important in calcium channels. Lipscombe specifically demonstrated that when Neurexin (NRX-1) and Neuroligin (NLG-1), or presynaptic cell adhesion proteins, adhere to the synaptic cleft, it is linked to autism in humans.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Avazzadeh|first=Sahar|last2=McDonagh|first2=Katya|last3=Reilly|first3=Jamie|last4=Wang|first4=Yanqin|last5=Boomkamp|first5=Stephanie D.|last6=McInerney|first6=Veronica|last7=Krawczyk|first7=Janusz|last8=Fitzgerald|first8=Jacqueline|last9=Feerick|first9=Niamh|last10=O\u2019Sullivan|first10=Matthew|last11=Jalali|first11=Amirhossein|date=December 2019|title=Increased Ca2+ signaling in NRXN1\u03b1+/\u2212 neurons derived from ASD induced pluripotent stem cells|journal=Molecular Autism|volume=10|issue=1|pages=52|doi=10.1186/s13229-019-0303-3|issn=2040-2392|pmc=6937972|pmid=31893021}}</ref> Lipscombe has studied the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release through coupling methods. Coupling method occurs when two things come together to form a common intermediate that will serve another purpose. This intermediate will either inhibit a function or excite something to carry out a function. This excitatory response found in Lipscombe\u2019s studies allow calcium channels to open and neurotransmitters to be released again. The deletion of the NRXN1 gene, which is linked to Neurexin, does not allow for neurotransmitters to be released.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Current research ==\nLipscombe is currently researching cell mechanisms and how they affect Ca<sub>V</sub>s when normal functioning is occurring, as well as when normal function is not occurring. Calcium voltage 2.2 channels or Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 N-type calcium ion channels are linked to pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Pharmacological Inhibition of Voltage-gated Ca2+ Channels for Chronic Pain Relief|last=Lee|first=Seungkyu|date=2013-11-30|journal=Current Neuropharmacology|volume=11|issue=6|pages=606\u2013620|doi=10.2174/1570159x11311060005|pmc=3849787|pmid=24396337}}</ref> Research in pain is important because chronic pain is a very current therapeutic issue that has poor treatment options that are not very effective and have serious harmful side effects. Voltage gated calcium channels are\u00a0 made up of various sub-units which make it a multi-complex protein. The N-type channels are a major pain target that take part in excitability which leads to neurotransmitter release in [[nociceptor]]. In order to understand the voltage gated calcium channel sub-types, Lipscombe works on various channel inhibitors that specifically target the inhibitor essential in decreasing pain.\n\nCurrently Lipscombe is working in her lab on a project that looks at the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and its origin and underlying cellular defects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Held|first=Aaron|last2=Major|first2=Paxton|last3=Sahin|first3=Asli|last4=Reenan|first4=Robert A.|last5=Lipscombe|first5=Diane|last6=Wharton|first6=Kristi A.|date=2019-03-20|title=Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=39|issue=12|pages=2347\u20132364|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1771-18.2019|issn=0270-6474|pmc=6433758|pmid=30659087}}</ref> They used a Drosophila Sod1G85R knock-in model, which is an ideal specimen for looking at this disease.

These laws were extended to Romani as Nazi policy towards Roma and Sinti was complicated by pseudo-historic racialist theories, which could be contradictory, namely that the Romani were of Egyptian ancestry. While they considered Romani grossly inferior, they believed the Roma people had some distant \"Aryan\" roots that had been corrupted. The Romani are actually a distinctly European people of considerable Northwestern Indian descent, or what is literally considered to be Aryan. Similarly to European Jews, specifically the Ashkenazi, the Romani people quickly acquired European genetics via enslavement and intermarriage upon their arrival in Europe 1,000 years ago.\n\nIn the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], the Nazi genocide of the Romani was so thorough that it exterminated the majority of [[Bohemian Romani]] speakers, eventually leading to the language's extinction in 1970 with the death of its last known speaker, Hana \u0160ebkov\u00e1. In Denmark, Greece and a small number of other countries, resistance by the native population thwarted planned Nazi deportations and extermination of the Romani. In most conquered countries (e.g., the Baltic states), local cooperation with the Nazis expediated the murder of almost all local Romani. In [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], the Croatian collaborators of the [[Usta\u0161e]], were so vicious only a minor remnant of Croatian Romani (and Jews) survived the killings.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-044-08, Stein-Pfalz, Eva Justin bei Sch\u00e4delmessung.jpg|thumb|[[Eva Justin]] checking the facial characteristics of a Romani woman as part of her \"racial studies\"]]\n\nIn 1982, [[West Germany]] formally recognized that genocide had been committed against the Romani.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barany |first=Zoltan D. |year=2002 |title=The East European gypsies: regime change, marginality, and ethnopolitics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=265\u20136 |isbn=978-0-521-00910-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTylND961ZMC&q=Herzog#v=snippet&q=Herzog&f=false }}</ref> Before this they had often claimed that, unlike Jews, Roma and Sinti were not targeted for racial reasons, but for \"criminal\" reasons, invoking antiziganist stereotype.

Roma children are segregated in school and do not receive the level of education as other Slovakian children. Some are sent to schools for children with mild mental disabilities. As a result, their attainment level is far below average. Amnesty International\u2019s report \"Unfulfilled promises: Failing to end segregation of Roma pupils in Slovakia\" describes the failure of the Slovak authorities to end the discrimination of Roma children on the grounds of their ethnicity in education. According to a 2012 United Nations Development Programme survey, around 43 per cent of Roma in mainstream schools attended ethnically segregated classes.\n\nRoma people are the victims of ethnically driven violence and crime in Slovakia. According to monitoring and reports provided by the European Roma Rights Center (ERRC), racist violence, evictions, threats, and more subtle forms of discrimination have increased over the past years in Slovakia. Although today the situation is a little better as of now (2020), the ERRC considers the situation in Slovakia to be one of the worst in Europe. The 2019 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research]] poll found that 76% of Slovaks held unfavorable views of Roma.\n\nRomani people receive new housing from municipalities and regional administrations for free every year, however people complain that some of them end up being destroyed by Romani people themselves. After the destruction, in some cases it has happened that the residents receive new housing, without being criminally prosecuted for destroying state property.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; Claims follow typical antiziganism stereotypes without evidence or research.

One of the mothers alleged that she was allowed visitation with her newborn baby only in an empty room; as there was no furniture, she was forced to change her baby's dirty nappies on the floor, which was reflected negatively in a social workers' report. Then, when she would not change the diapers on a subsequent occasion following this experience, failure to change them was reflected negatively in the report as well.

This might have had the inadvertent result of importing the prejudices which were prevalent in Czech society to America.\n\n=====Present Situation=====\nAt the present time, because the Roma population in the [[United States]] has quickly assimilated and Roma people are not often portrayed in US popular culture, the term \"Gypsy\" is typically associated with a trade or lifestyle instead of being associated with the Romani ethnic group.

As of 1993, [[Hungary]] has been identified as one country where this issue exists: \"While the economic restructuring of a command economy into a western style market economy created hardships for most Hungarians, with the national unemployment rate heading toward 14 percent and per capita real income falling, the burdens which are imposed on Romanis are disproportionately great.\"<ref name=\"Feher, 1993\">Feher, Gyorgy. 1993.

Consequently, Roma are often unable to access clean water or sanitation facilities, rendering the Roma people more vulnerable to health problems, such as [[disease]]s. Based in [[Belgium]], the Health & Environment Alliance has included a statement with regard to the Roma on one of its pamphlets: \"Denied environmental benefits such as water, sewage treatment facilities, sanitation and access to natural resources, and suffer from exposure to environmental hazards due to their proximity to hazardous waste sites, incinerators, factories, and other sources of pollution.\"<ref name=\"Environmental Health\">{{cite web|title= Environmental Justice: Listening to Women and Children|publisher=Environmental Health|url= http://www.env-health.org/IMG/pdf/cepl_final-2.pdf}}</ref> Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] and the privatisation of the formerly state owned water-supply companies in many areas of central and eastern Europe, the provision of decent running water to illegal buildings which are often occupied by Roma became a particularly sensitive issue, because the new international owners of the water-supply companies are unwilling to make contracts with the Roma population and as a result, \"water-borne diseases, such as [[diarrhoea]] and [[dysentery]]\" became \"an almost constant feature of daily life, especially for children\".\n\nAccording to a study that was conducted by the [[United Nations Development Program]], the percentage of Roma with access to running water and sewage treatment within Romania and the Czech Republic is well below the national average in those countries. Consequently, a proliferation of skin diseases among these populations, due to the low quality of housing standards, including [[scabies]], [[pediculosis]], [[pyoderma]], [[mycosis]] and [[ascariasis]], has occurred; respiratory health problems also affect the majority of the inhabitants of these areas, in addition to increasing rates of [[hepatitis]] and [[tuberculosis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAdditionally, the permanent settlement of Roma in residential areas is often met with hostility by non-Roma or the exodus of non-Roma, a reaction which is similar to [[white flight]] in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Harper, 2009\">{{cite web|title=Environmental Justice and Roma Communities in Central and Eastern Europe|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=krista_harper|work=Environmental Justice and Roma Communities in Central and Eastern Europe|publisher=University of Massachusetts \u2013 Amherst|accessdate=26 December 2012|author=Krista M.

While they considered Romani grossly inferior, they believed the Roma people had some distant \"Aryan\" roots that had been corrupted. The Romani are actually a distinctly European people of considerable Northwestern Indian descent, or what is literally considered to be Aryan.

Most often, the traditional nomadic lifestyle of the Roma causes them to settle on the outskirts of towns and cities, where amenities, employment and educational opportunities are often inaccessible. As of 1993, [[Hungary]] has been identified as one country where this issue exists: \"While the economic restructuring of a command economy into a western style market economy created hardships for most Hungarians, with the national unemployment rate heading toward 14 percent and per capita real income falling, the burdens which are imposed on Romanis are disproportionately great.\"<ref name=\"Feher, 1993\">Feher, Gyorgy. 1993.

Other flats were assigned to families of military and law-enforcement personnel. However, the military and police families gradually moved out of the residences and the living conditions for the Roma population deteriorated. Ongoing failures to pay bills led to the disconnection of the water supply and an emergency plan was eventually created to provide running water for two hours per day to mitigate against the bill payment issue.

Consequently, Roma are often unable to access clean water or sanitation facilities, rendering the Roma people more vulnerable to health problems, such as [[disease]]s. Based in [[Belgium]], the Health & Environment Alliance has included a statement with regard to the Roma on one of its pamphlets: \"Denied environmental benefits such as water, sewage treatment facilities, sanitation and access to natural resources, and suffer from exposure to environmental hazards due to their proximity to hazardous waste sites, incinerators, factories, and other sources of pollution.\"<ref name=\"Environmental Health\">{{cite web|title= Environmental Justice: Listening to Women and Children|publisher=Environmental Health|url= http://www.env-health.org/IMG/pdf/cepl_final-2.pdf}}</ref> Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] and the privatisation of the formerly state owned water-supply companies in many areas of central and eastern Europe, the provision of decent running water to illegal buildings which are often occupied by Roma became a particularly sensitive issue, because the new international owners of the water-supply companies are unwilling to make contracts with the Roma population and as a result, \"water-borne diseases, such as [[diarrhoea]] and [[dysentery]]\" became \"an almost constant feature of daily life, especially for children\".\n\nAccording to a study that was conducted by the [[United Nations Development Program]], the percentage of Roma with access to running water and sewage treatment within Romania and the Czech Republic is well below the national average in those countries. Consequently, a proliferation of skin diseases among these populations, due to the low quality of housing standards, including [[scabies]], [[pediculosis]], [[pyoderma]], [[mycosis]] and [[ascariasis]], has occurred; respiratory health problems also affect the majority of the inhabitants of these areas, in addition to increasing rates of [[hepatitis]] and [[tuberculosis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAdditionally, the permanent settlement of Roma in residential areas is often met with hostility by non-Roma or the exodus of non-Roma, a reaction which is similar to [[white flight]] in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Harper, 2009\">{{cite web|title=Environmental Justice and Roma Communities in Central and Eastern Europe|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=krista_harper|work=Environmental Justice and Roma Communities in Central and Eastern Europe|publisher=University of Massachusetts \u2013 Amherst|accessdate=26 December 2012|author=Krista M.
