In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that \"religious duty\" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration \u2014|od|1}}</ref> Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from \"[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]\" groups still practicing polygamy.<ref>{{citation |quote= If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].\n\n==Teachings and practices==\n\n===Authorized texts===\n[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]\nThe theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the \"[[standard works]]\". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as \"the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion\".<ref>{{citation |title= History of the Church |volume= 4 |page= 461|title-link= History of the Church (Joseph Smith) }}</ref>\n\nThe Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be \"the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nAnother source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]].

Additionally, Joseph Smith taught that the [[Song of Songs|Songs of Solomon]] \"are not inspired writings\".</ref> the divinity of Jesus, and his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and [[resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrection]].

The practices of [[baptism#Submersion|baptism by immersion]] and the [[eucharist]] (referred to as ''the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]]'') are also held in common. However, the [[Catholic Church]] considers doctrinal differences between the two groups to be so great that it will not accept a prior LDS baptism as evidence of Christian initiation, as it will baptism by other Christian groups, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm|title=The Question of the Validity of Baptism Conferred in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|author=Fr.

LDS Church theology includes the belief in a \"[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]\" composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead.

The largest of these smaller groups is the [[Community of Christ]] (previously known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), based in [[Independence, Missouri]], followed by [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]], based in [[Monongahela, Pennsylvania]]. Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.\n\nThe main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith.

In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.\n\nIn the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.\n[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]\n\nAs the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.\n\nAcademic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.\n\n[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.\n\nDuring the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199358229|pages=132\u2013137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Religion Journal; Spiritual Issues Lead Many to the Net | author = Sink, Mindy |work=The New York Times\n | date = September 6, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DB1F38F935A3575AC0A9659C8B63 | accessdate =February 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/some-mormons-search-the-web-and-find-doubt.html|title=Some Mormons Search the Web and Find Doubt|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=20 Jul 2013|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe church's support in 2008 of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] sparked heated debate and protest by gay-rights organizations and others.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Mormons Tipped Scale in Ban on Gay Marriage | author = Jesse McKinley and Kirk Johnson |work=The New York Times | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate =February 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |title=San Diego march for marriage equality draws 20,000 protesters |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |work=Gay & Lesbian Times |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090214121324/http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/california-and-same-sex-marriage |title= Commentary: California and Same-Sex Marriage |date= June 30, 2008 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}</ref> The church expressed support for a Salt Lake City ordinance protecting members of the [[gay community|LGBT community]] against discrimination in employment and housing while allowing religious institutions to consider lifestyles in actions such as hiring or providing university accommodations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705343558/Mormon-Church-backs-protection-of-gay-rights-in-Salt-Lake-City.html |title= Mormon Church Backs Gay Protecting City Ordinances |newspaper= Deseret News |first= Scott |last= Taylor |date= November 10, 2009}}</ref> Further controversy resulted in late 2015, when the church changed its guidance to lay leaders about same-sex unions and about minor children living in the home of a parent in a same-sex relationship, whether natural or adopted.<ref name=SaltLakeTrib>{{cite news|last=Dobner|first=Jennifer|title=New Mormon policy makes apostates of married same-sex couples, bars children from rites|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3144035&itype=CMSID|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=November 6, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref> The policy said that these children should only be baptized after reaching legal age, and only if they did not live with parents who were in a same-sex cohabitation or marriage.

In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v.

Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].\n\n==Teachings and practices==\n\n===Authorized texts===\n[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]\nThe theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the \"[[standard works]]\". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as \"the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion\".<ref>{{citation |title= History of the Church |volume= 4 |page= 461|title-link= History of the Church (Joseph Smith) }}</ref>\n\nThe Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be \"the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nAnother source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the church's president and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets<ref name=\"oct12_conference\">{{Citation |title= The Sustaining of Church Officers |first= Henry B. |last= Eyring |authorlink= Henry B.

LDS Church theology includes the belief in a \"[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]\" composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead.

Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.\n\nThe main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith. Other branches may be considered later offshoots of the LDS Church branch, mainly due to disagreements about plural marriage.\n\n==Organization and structure==\n\n===Name and legal entities===\n{{main|Name of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}\nThe church teaches that it is a continuation of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] established in 1830 by Joseph Smith.

In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.\n\nIn the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.\n[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]\n\nAs the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.\n\nAcademic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.\n\n[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.\n\nDuring the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199358229|pages=132\u2013137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Religion Journal; Spiritual Issues Lead Many to the Net | author = Sink, Mindy |work=The New York Times\n | date = September 6, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DB1F38F935A3575AC0A9659C8B63 | accessdate =February 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/some-mormons-search-the-web-and-find-doubt.html|title=Some Mormons Search the Web and Find Doubt|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=20 Jul 2013|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe church's support in 2008 of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] sparked heated debate and protest by gay-rights organizations and others.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Mormons Tipped Scale in Ban on Gay Marriage | author = Jesse McKinley and Kirk Johnson |work=The New York Times | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate =February 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |title=San Diego march for marriage equality draws 20,000 protesters |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |work=Gay & Lesbian Times |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090214121324/http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/california-and-same-sex-marriage |title= Commentary: California and Same-Sex Marriage |date= June 30, 2008 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}</ref> The church expressed support for a Salt Lake City ordinance protecting members of the [[gay community|LGBT community]] against discrimination in employment and housing while allowing religious institutions to consider lifestyles in actions such as hiring or providing university accommodations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705343558/Mormon-Church-backs-protection-of-gay-rights-in-Salt-Lake-City.html |title= Mormon Church Backs Gay Protecting City Ordinances |newspaper= Deseret News |first= Scott |last= Taylor |date= November 10, 2009}}</ref> Further controversy resulted in late 2015, when the church changed its guidance to lay leaders about same-sex unions and about minor children living in the home of a parent in a same-sex relationship, whether natural or adopted.<ref name=SaltLakeTrib>{{cite news|last=Dobner|first=Jennifer|title=New Mormon policy makes apostates of married same-sex couples, bars children from rites|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3144035&itype=CMSID|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=November 6, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref> The policy said that these children should only be baptized after reaching legal age, and only if they did not live with parents who were in a same-sex cohabitation or marriage.
