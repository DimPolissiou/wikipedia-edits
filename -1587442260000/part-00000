Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussel had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\" <ref>https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/midnight-gospel-netflix-duncan-trussell-pendleton-ward</ref> In the fist meeting with Ward, Trussell declined to join to a new project claiming he was too busy to turn his podcast into a animated show. In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion. <ref>https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/midnight-gospel-netflix-duncan-trussell-pendleton-ward</ref>\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the serie. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|first2=Denise|last2=Petski|date=December 20, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like Johnny Pemberton, Brendon Walsh, Weird Al Yankovic and Emo Philips were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\nMike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and write for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\nFor Ward, the new serie was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel.Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. \n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by Netflix, was released on April 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/04/the-midnight-gospel-review-1202224481/|title=\u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 Review: \u2018Adventure Time\u2019 Creator\u2019s Astonishing New Netflix Show|first1=Eric|last1=Kohn|first2=Eric|last2=Kohn|date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = Pendleton Ward\n| creator                  = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Pendleton Ward]]\n* [[Duncan Trussell]]\n}}\n| voices                   = {{Plainlist|\n* Duncan Trussell\n* [[Phil Hendrie]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = [[Joe Wong (musician)|Joe Wong]]\n| country                  = United States\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 8\n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Duncan Trussell\n* Antonio Canobbio\n* Ben Kalina\n* Chris Prynoski\n}}\n| producer                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Shannon Prynoski\n* Tony Salama\n}}\n| editor                   = Megan Love\n| cinematography           = \n| runtime                  = 20-36 minutes\n| company                  = [[Titmouse, Inc.]]\n| distributor              = \n| channel                  = [[Netflix]]\n| picture_format           = [[4K resolution|4K]] ([[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]])<br>[[High-dynamic-range video|High dynamic range]]\n| audio_format             = [[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]]\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| website                  = https://www.netflix.com/title/80987903\n}}\n\n'''''The Midnight Gospel''''' is an [[American]] [[adult animated]] web television series created by ''[[Adventure Time]]''{{'s}} [[Pendleton Ward]] and comedian [[Duncan Trussell]].

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussel had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\" <ref>https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/midnight-gospel-netflix-duncan-trussell-pendleton-ward</ref> In the fist meeting with Ward, Trussell declined to join to a new project claiming he was too busy to turn his podcast into a animated show. In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion. <ref>https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/midnight-gospel-netflix-duncan-trussell-pendleton-ward</ref>\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the serie. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|first2=Denise|last2=Petski|date=December 20, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like Johnny Pemberton, Brendon Walsh, Weird Al Yankovic and Emo Philips were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\nMike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and write for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\nFor Ward, the new serie was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel.Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. \n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by Netflix, was released on April 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/04/the-midnight-gospel-review-1202224481/|title=\u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 Review: \u2018Adventure Time\u2019 Creator\u2019s Astonishing New Netflix Show|first1=Eric|last1=Kohn|first2=Eric|last2=Kohn|date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Prince Silversaddle", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

Vallejo is geographically the closest North Bay city to the inner [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], so it is sometimes associated with that region. Its population was 115,942 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the tenth most populous city in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the largest in [[Solano County, California|Solano County]].\n\nVallejo sits on the northeastern shore of [[San Pablo Bay]], 30 miles north of San Francisco, the northwestern shore of the [[Carquinez Strait]] and the southern end of the [[Napa River]], 15 miles south of Napa. The city is named after General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], a native [[Californio]], leading proponent of California's statehood, and one of the first members of the [[California State Senate]]; the neighboring city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named for his wife, Francisca Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo.\n\nVallejo is home to the [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] theme park, the now-defunct [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], and the regional office for Region 5 of the [[United States Forest Service]]. The colleges and universities in Vallejo are [[California Maritime Academy]], the Vallejo Center campus of [[Solano Community College]], and [[Touro University California]].\n\nVallejo's public transit includes the [[San Francisco Bay Ferry]], which regularly runs from [[Vallejo Station|downtown Vallejo]] to the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]]. [[SolTrans]] buses carry passengers around the cities of Vallejo and Benicia, as well as offer express services to [[Fairfield, California]], and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] stations in [[El Cerrito, California]] and [[Walnut Creek, California]]. Evans Transportation buses provide daily service to [[Oakland International Airport]] from a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] hotel adjacent to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evanstransportation.com/|title=Bus and limousine transportation to San Francisco and Oakland airports, charter services, and Napa and Sonoma winery tours from Evans Transportation|website=www.evanstransportation.com|access-date=July 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810233442/http://www.evanstransportation.com/|archive-date=August 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVallejo has twice served as the capital of the state of California: once in 1852 and again in 1853, both periods being brief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo|title=Vallejo, California - City Information, Fast Facts, Schools, Colleges, and More|website=www.citytowninfo.com|access-date=January 17, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65WMnzMdd?url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo|archive-date=February 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVallejo is also known for its naval and wartime history, the [[Zodiac Killer]] mystery, and as the hometown of [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] rappers [[E-40]] and [[Mac Dre]].\n\n== Geography and environment ==\nAccording to [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|49.5|sqmi|km2}}. Land area is {{convert|30.7|sqmi|km2}}, and {{convert|18.9|sqmi|km2}} (38.09%) is water. The [[Napa River]] flows until it changes into the Mare Island Strait in Vallejo which then flows into [[San Pablo Bay]], in the northeastern part of [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nVallejo is located on the southwestern edge of [[Solano County, California]] in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in Northern California. Vallejo is accessible by [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and is the location for the northern half of the [[Carquinez Bridge]]. It is also accessible by [[Interstate 780 (California)|Interstate 780]] from neighboring [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, and by [[California State Route 37|Route 37]] from [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to the west. [[California State Route 29|Route 29]] (former [[U.S. Route 40 (California)|U.S. Route 40]]) begins in the city near the Carquinez Bridge and travels north through the heart of the city and beyond into [[Napa County, California|Napa County]], entering neighboring [[American Canyon, California|American Canyon]] and eventually [[Napa, California|Napa]].\n\nSeveral faults have been mapped in the vicinity of Vallejo. The [[San Andreas Fault]] and [[Hayward Fault]]s are the most [[active fault]]s, although the San Andreas is at some distance. Locally, the Sulphur Springs Valley Thrust Fault and Southampton Fault are found. No quaternary seismic activity along these minor faults has been observed with the possible exception of a slight offset revealed by trenching. The Sulphur Mountain and Green Valley faults have been associated with the [[Concord Fault]] to the south. The Concord Fault is considered active. Historically there have been local [[cinnabar]] mines in the Vallejo area.<ref>C.Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al., ''Environmental Assessment of the Columbus Parkway Widening between Ascot Parkway and the Northgate Development, Vallejo'', Earth Metrics Inc. Report 7853, California State Clearinghouse, Sept, 1989</ref>  The [[Hastings Mine]] and [[St. John's Mine]] contribute ongoing water contamination for [[mercury (element)|mercury]]; furthermore, mine shaft development has depleted much of this area's spring water. Both [[Rindler Creek]] and [[Blue Rock Springs Creek]] have been affected.\n\nThe city of Vallejo is located 30 miles northeast of San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Vallejo_US_and_San_Francisco_US.html|title=Distance between Vallejo united states and San Francisco united states|website=www.mapcrow.info|access-date=September 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220448/http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Vallejo_US_and_San_Francisco_US.html|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> 22 miles north of Oakland, 56 miles north of San Jose and 52 miles south of Sacramento. Vallejo borders the city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, American Canyon and the Napa county line to the north, the [[Carquinez Strait]] to the south and the [[San Pablo Bay]] to the west.\n\n== Climate ==\nVallejo has a mild, coastal [[Mediterranean climate]] and can be an average of 10 degrees cooler than nearby inland cities. Vallejo is influenced by its position on the northeastern shore of San Pablo Bay, but is less sheltered from heatwaves than areas directly on or nearer the Pacific Ocean/Golden Gate such as [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland]].

The California Archaeological Inventory has indicated that the three Indian sites are located on Sulphur Springs Mountain.\n\n[[File:Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mariano Vallejo, ca. 1880\u201385, founder and city namesake]]\n\nThe city of Vallejo was once part of the {{convert|84000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} [[Rancho Suscol]] Mexican land grant of 1843 by Governor [[Manuel Micheltorena]] to General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]]. The city was named after this Mexican military officer and title holder who was appointed in settling and overseeing the north bay region. General Vallejo was responsible for military peace in the region and founded the pueblo of Sonoma in 1836. In 1846 independence-minded Anglo immigrants rose up against the Mexican government of California in what would be known as the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] which resulted in his imprisonment in [[Sutter's Fort]]. This was subsequently followed by the annexation of the California Republic to the United States. General Vallejo, though a Mexican army officer, generally acquiesced in the annexation of California to the United States, recognizing the greater resources of the United States and benefits that would bring to California. He was a proponent of reconciliation and statehood after the [[Bear Flag Revolt]], and has a U.S. Navy submarine, the {{USS|Mariano G. Vallejo|SSBN-658}}, named after him.\n\nIn 1850, Vallejo proposed plans for a new city, to be called ''Eureka'', with the capitol, university, botanical garden and other features. After a statewide referendum, his proposal was accepted, although a new name was decided upon: ''Vallejo''. In 1851, a commission appointed by the Senate found a site on a hill that overlooked the bay and could see San Francisco on a clear day, and it was approved for its symbolic strategic value. In 1851, Vallejo was the official state capitol, with the government prepared to meet for the first time the following year. In 1852, the legislature convened for the first time. Unfortunately, Vallejo didn't follow through with building a capitol for them to meet in. After being forced to meet in a leaky building, sitting on barrels, they motioned to move sessions to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and served there for the remainder of the session after only 11 days. In 1853, it was again the meeting place for the legislature, solely for the purpose of moving the capitol officially to [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], which occurred on February 4, 1853, after only a month. [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named after Vallejo's wife, Francisca Benicia Carrillo. After legislature left, the government established a [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|naval shipyard]] on [[Mare Island]], which helped the town overcome the loss. Due to the presence of the shipyard, Filipinos began to immigrate to Vallejo beginning in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Juanita Tamayo Lott|title=Common Destiny: Filipino American Generations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yD8ND6gMUsC&pg=PA2|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4651-6|page=2}}</ref> The yard functioned for over a hundred years, finally closing in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm|title=Vallejo Naval & Historic Museum - Welcome!|website=www.vallejomuseum.org|access-date=June 28, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627095107/http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm|archive-date=June 27, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. government appointed the influential Vallejo as Indian agent for Northern California. He also served on the state constitutional convention in 1849. Afterward, Vallejo remained active in state politics, but challenges to his land titles around Sonoma eventually left him impoverished and reduced his ranch from 250,000 acres to a mere 300. He eventually retired from public life, questioning the wisdom of his having welcomed the American acquisition of California in the first place. Vallejo died in 1890, a symbol of the eclipse of Californio wealth, power, and prestige.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/mariano_guadalupe_vallejo.html|title=The U.S.-Mexican War .

Vallejo is geographically the closest North Bay city to the inner [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], so it is sometimes associated with that region. Its population was 115,942 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the tenth most populous city in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the largest in [[Solano County, California|Solano County]].\n\nVallejo sits on the northeastern shore of [[San Pablo Bay]], 30 miles north of San Francisco, the northwestern shore of the [[Carquinez Strait]] and the southern end of the [[Napa River]], 15 miles south of Napa. The city is named after General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], a native [[Californio]], leading proponent of California's statehood, and one of the first members of the [[California State Senate]]; the neighboring city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named for his wife, Francisca Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo.\n\nVallejo is home to the [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] theme park, the now-defunct [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], and the regional office for Region 5 of the [[United States Forest Service]]. The colleges and universities in Vallejo are [[California Maritime Academy]], the Vallejo Center campus of [[Solano Community College]], and [[Touro University California]].\n\nVallejo's public transit includes the [[San Francisco Bay Ferry]], which regularly runs from [[Vallejo Station|downtown Vallejo]] to the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]]. [[SolTrans]] buses carry passengers around the cities of Vallejo and Benicia, as well as offer express services to [[Fairfield, California]], and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] stations in [[El Cerrito, California]] and [[Walnut Creek, California]]. Evans Transportation buses provide daily service to [[Oakland International Airport]] from a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] hotel adjacent to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evanstransportation.com/|title=Bus and limousine transportation to San Francisco and Oakland airports, charter services, and Napa and Sonoma winery tours from Evans Transportation|website=www.evanstransportation.com|access-date=July 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810233442/http://www.evanstransportation.com/|archive-date=August 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVallejo has twice served as the capital of the state of California: once in 1852 and again in 1853, both periods being brief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo|title=Vallejo, California - City Information, Fast Facts, Schools, Colleges, and More|website=www.citytowninfo.com|access-date=January 17, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65WMnzMdd?url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo|archive-date=February 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVallejo is also known for its naval and wartime history, the [[Zodiac Killer]] mystery, and as the hometown of [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] rappers [[E-40]] and [[Mac Dre]].\n\n== Geography and environment ==\nAccording to [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|49.5|sqmi|km2}}. Land area is {{convert|30.7|sqmi|km2}}, and {{convert|18.9|sqmi|km2}} (38.09%) is water. The [[Napa River]] flows until it changes into the Mare Island Strait in Vallejo which then flows into [[San Pablo Bay]], in the northeastern part of [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nVallejo is located on the southwestern edge of [[Solano County, California]] in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in Northern California. Vallejo is accessible by [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and is the location for the northern half of the [[Carquinez Bridge]]. It is also accessible by [[Interstate 780 (California)|Interstate 780]] from neighboring [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, and by [[California State Route 37|Route 37]] from [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to the west. [[California State Route 29|Route 29]] (former [[U.S. Route 40 (California)|U.S. Route 40]]) begins in the city near the Carquinez Bridge and travels north through the heart of the city and beyond into [[Napa County, California|Napa County]], entering neighboring [[American Canyon, California|American Canyon]] and eventually [[Napa, California|Napa]].\n\nSeveral faults have been mapped in the vicinity of Vallejo. The [[San Andreas Fault]] and [[Hayward Fault]]s are the most [[active fault]]s, although the San Andreas is at some distance. Locally, the Sulphur Springs Valley Thrust Fault and Southampton Fault are found. No quaternary seismic activity along these minor faults has been observed with the possible exception of a slight offset revealed by trenching. The Sulphur Mountain and Green Valley faults have been associated with the [[Concord Fault]] to the south. The Concord Fault is considered active. Historically there have been local [[cinnabar]] mines in the Vallejo area.<ref>C.Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al., ''Environmental Assessment of the Columbus Parkway Widening between Ascot Parkway and the Northgate Development, Vallejo'', Earth Metrics Inc. Report 7853, California State Clearinghouse, Sept, 1989</ref>  The [[Hastings Mine]] and [[St. John's Mine]] contribute ongoing water contamination for [[mercury (element)|mercury]]; furthermore, mine shaft development has depleted much of this area's spring water. Both [[Rindler Creek]] and [[Blue Rock Springs Creek]] have been affected.\n\nThe city of Vallejo is located 30 miles northeast of San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Vallejo_US_and_San_Francisco_US.html|title=Distance between Vallejo united states and San Francisco united states|website=www.mapcrow.info|access-date=September 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220448/http://www.mapcrow.info/Distance_between_Vallejo_US_and_San_Francisco_US.html|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> 22 miles north of Oakland, 56 miles north of San Jose and 52 miles south of Sacramento. Vallejo borders the city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, American Canyon and the Napa county line to the north, the [[Carquinez Strait]] to the south and the [[San Pablo Bay]] to the west.\n\n== Climate ==\nVallejo has a mild, coastal [[Mediterranean climate]] and can be an average of 10 degrees cooler than nearby inland cities. Vallejo is influenced by its position on the northeastern shore of San Pablo Bay, but is less sheltered from heatwaves than areas directly on or nearer the Pacific Ocean/Golden Gate such as [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland]]. Although slightly less marine, average temperatures range between {{convert|8|C|F}} in January and {{convert|19.8|C|F}} in July.<ref name=\"Weatherbase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=470640&cityname=Vallejo-California-United-States-of-America|title=Vallejo, California Temperature Averages|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=March 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091549/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=470640&cityname=Vallejo-California-United-States-of-America|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> However, summer is very long with July\u2013September being almost equal in historical average temperatures.

The city was named after this Mexican military officer and title holder who was appointed in settling and overseeing the north bay region. General Vallejo was responsible for military peace in the region and founded the pueblo of Sonoma in 1836. In 1846 independence-minded Anglo immigrants rose up against the Mexican government of California in what would be known as the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] which resulted in his imprisonment in [[Sutter's Fort]]. This was subsequently followed by the annexation of the California Republic to the United States. General Vallejo, though a Mexican army officer, generally acquiesced in the annexation of California to the United States, recognizing the greater resources of the United States and benefits that would bring to California. He was a proponent of reconciliation and statehood after the [[Bear Flag Revolt]], and has a U.S. Navy submarine, the {{USS|Mariano G. Vallejo|SSBN-658}}, named after him.\n\nIn 1850, Vallejo proposed plans for a new city, to be called ''Eureka'', with the capitol, university, botanical garden and other features. After a statewide referendum, his proposal was accepted, although a new name was decided upon: ''Vallejo''. In 1851, a commission appointed by the Senate found a site on a hill that overlooked the bay and could see San Francisco on a clear day, and it was approved for its symbolic strategic value. In 1851, Vallejo was the official state capitol, with the government prepared to meet for the first time the following year. In 1852, the legislature convened for the first time. Unfortunately, Vallejo didn't follow through with building a capitol for them to meet in. After being forced to meet in a leaky building, sitting on barrels, they motioned to move sessions to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and served there for the remainder of the session after only 11 days. In 1853, it was again the meeting place for the legislature, solely for the purpose of moving the capitol officially to [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], which occurred on February 4, 1853, after only a month. [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named after Vallejo's wife, Francisca Benicia Carrillo. After legislature left, the government established a [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|naval shipyard]] on [[Mare Island]], which helped the town overcome the loss. Due to the presence of the shipyard, Filipinos began to immigrate to Vallejo beginning in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Juanita Tamayo Lott|title=Common Destiny: Filipino American Generations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yD8ND6gMUsC&pg=PA2|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4651-6|page=2}}</ref> The yard functioned for over a hundred years, finally closing in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm|title=Vallejo Naval & Historic Museum - Welcome!|website=www.vallejomuseum.org|access-date=June 28, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627095107/http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm|archive-date=June 27, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. government appointed the influential Vallejo as Indian agent for Northern California. He also served on the state constitutional convention in 1849. Afterward, Vallejo remained active in state politics, but challenges to his land titles around Sonoma eventually left him impoverished and reduced his ranch from 250,000 acres to a mere 300. He eventually retired from public life, questioning the wisdom of his having welcomed the American acquisition of California in the first place. Vallejo died in 1890, a symbol of the eclipse of Californio wealth, power, and prestige.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/mariano_guadalupe_vallejo.html|title=The U.S.-Mexican War .

It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter [[Robert Pollard]]. The most well-known lineup of the band consisted of Pollard (lead vocals), his brother Jim (guitar, bass), [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]] (lead guitars), [[Tobin Sprout]] (vocals, rhythm guitars), [[Kevin Fennell]] (drums), and bassist [[Greg Demos]]. Noted at first for their [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic and typically [[Portastudio]] four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music was influenced by early post\u2013[[British Invasion]] [[garage rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]]. Due to their prolific output, releasing 30 full-length albums along with [[Guided By Voices discography|many other releases]], they have garnered a dedicated cult following with songs are in the two-minute range, many are even shorter. Their songs are also known for ending abruptly or intertwining with odd and homemade [[sound effect]]s.\n\nGuided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the \"classic\" lineup reunited to perform at [[Matador Records]] 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1983\u20131991)===\nFormed in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene.  As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation.  Guided by Voices' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. ''[[Forever Since Breakfast]]'' and followed by the albums ''[[Devil Between My Toes]]'', ''[[Sandbox (Guided by Voices album)|Sandbox]]'', ''[[Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia]]'', and ''[[Same Place The Fly Got Smashed]]''.  With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members' family and friends.\n\n===Lo-fi (1992\u20131996)===\nWith the release of the ultra-limited album ''[[Propeller (Guided by Voices album)|Propeller]]'' in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the [[college rock]] circuit and bands such as [[Sonic Youth]], [[R.E.M.]] and [[The Breeders]].  New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993.  At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists [[Tobin Sprout]] and [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]] (not to be confused with [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s drummer), bassist [[Greg Demos]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]].  Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa ''Propeller'' and soon became Pollard's primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band's catalog. 1993 also saw the release of ''[[Vampire on Titus]]'', as well as the ''[[Fast Japanese Spin Cycle]]'' and ''[[Static Airplane Jive]]'' EPs.  Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV's history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark ''[[Bee Thousand]]'' via [[Scat Records]], with a distribution deal through indie label [[Matador Records]].  Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time.  The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard's homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, [[Roger Daltrey]]-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands<ref>{{Citation|last=Tim Krings|title=Bob Pollard throwing empty beer can at band|date=2010-07-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnb4GuuR2Lw&list=LLzjuRvUk5CF_p8rBConuR8g&index=15|accessdate=2017-11-07}}</ref>), [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]]'s [[Guitar showmanship|windmilling]] and [[chain smoking]], sometime bassist [[Greg Demos]]' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.\n\nTheir true Matador debut came in 1995 with ''[[Alien Lanes]]'', which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap.  The band's underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as [[MTV]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  Guided by Voices is frequently referenced by novelist and poet, Dennis Cooper, in his George Miles cycle and the group's lyrics appear in ''Guide'', the fourth of the five novels which make up the cycle. The first chapter of ''Guide'' is titled \"Guided by Voices\". After sessions for a concept album entitled ''[[The Power of Suck]]'' were aborted, the band assembled ''[[Under the Bushes Under the Stars]]'' out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with [[Kim Deal]] and [[Steve Albini]] among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \"classic lineup\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career.  Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout's ''[[Carnival Boy]]'' and Pollard's ''[[Not in My Airforce]]'', with each making a guest appearance on the other's album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band's existence.  These records were primarily self-released. Because GBV alumni were regularly featured, and songs from these albums were frequently included in GBV setlists, they are informally considered to be part of the GBV canon. Also in 1995, the band contributed the song \"Sensational Gravity Boy\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n===Major label (1997\u20132001)===\nPollard created a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with [[Cleveland]] [[glam rock]]ers [[Cobra Verde (band)|Cobra Verde]] in 1997. The following album ''[[Mag Earwhig!]]'', combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \"[[Jane of the Waking Universe]]\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time.  However, after another year of rigorous touring, the \"Guided by Verde\" lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project.\n\nCobra Verde's [[Doug Gillard]] was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \"classic\"-era bassist [[Greg Demos]], former [[The Breeders|Breeders]] drummer [[Jim Macpherson]], and eventually, former [[The Amps|Amps]]/Breeders guitarist [[The Amps|Nate Farley]]. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer [[Ric Ocasek]] to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices' [[major label]] debut.  Initially produced for [[Capitol Records]], ''[[Do the Collapse]]'' was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label [[TVT Records|TVT]].  (In the UK it was released on [[Creation Records]]). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, ''Do the Collapse'' failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews.\n\nThrough touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of [[The Who]], [[David Bowie]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption.  In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band's first and only visits to Australia and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive ''[[Suitcase: Failed Experiments and Trashed Aircraft|Suitcase]]'', a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard's enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Three more box sets of unreleased songs, ''[[Suitcase 2: American Superdream Wow|Suitcase 2]]'', ''[[Suitcase 3: Up We Go Now|Suitcase 3]]'' and  ''[[Suitcase 4: Captain Kangaroo Won The War|Suitcase 4]]'' released in October 2005, November 2009 and November 2015 respectively.)\n\n2001's ''[[Isolation Drills]]'' was recorded with [[Rob Schnapf]],<ref name=BOMB-IsolationDrills-2001>{{cite journal|last1=McGonigal|first1=Mike|title=Robert Pollard|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB]]|date=Summer 2001|issue=76|page=32\u201337|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/robert-pollard/|publisher=New Art Publications}}</ref> who aimed to capture the band's live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in ''Billboard'''s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough.\n\n===Later years (2002\u20132004)===\n[[File:Robert pollard 0001.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Robert Pollard]] performing with Guided By Voices in 2014|255x255px]]\nAfter departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released ''[[Universal Truths and Cycles]]'', a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band's mid-90s, mid-fi aesthetic. ''Universal Truths'' producer [[Todd Tobias]] would also record the band's final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled ''[[Earthquake Glue]]'', followed by the anthology box set ''[[Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere]]'' and the [[greatest hits]] compilation ''[[Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates]]''.\n\nIn 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |title=Special Announcement From Guided By Voices |publisher=Gbv.com |accessdate=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315062433/http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |archivedate=2012-03-15 }}</ref> following the release of the ''[[Half-Smiles of the Decomposed]]'' LP, and a final farewell tour. Pollard stated:\n\n:\"This feels like the last album for Guided by Voices. I've always said that when I make a record that I'm totally satisfied with as befitting a final album, then that will be it. And this is it.\"\n\nGuided by Voices would go on to release no less than 15 more studio albums (since ''[[Surrender Your Poppy Field]]''')'''''.\n\nOn November 9, 2004, Guided by Voices performed on the stage of [[Austin City Limits]], broadcast by [[PBS]] on January 22, 2005.

In 2007 he told [[Magnet (magazine)|''MAGNET'']]: \"To me, it\u2019s just cashing in. If you\u2019re gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That\u2019s like doing the county-fair circuit. I don\u2019t see Guided By Voices reforming.

It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter [[Robert Pollard]], who founded the group with his brother Jim Pollard, guitarist [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]], [[Tobin Sprout]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]]. The \"classic\" lineup included these musicians along with  bassist [[Greg Demos]]. Noted at first for their [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic and typically [[Portastudio]] four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music was influenced by early post\u2013[[British Invasion]] [[garage rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]]. The band has had a prolific output, releasing 30 full-length albums along with [[Guided By Voices discography|many other releases]]. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade [[sound effect]]s.\n\nGuided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the \"classic\" lineup reunited to perform at [[Matador Records]] 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1983\u20131991)===\nFormed in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene.  As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation.  Guided by Voices' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. ''[[Forever Since Breakfast]]'' and followed by the albums ''[[Devil Between My Toes]]'', ''[[Sandbox (Guided by Voices album)|Sandbox]]'', ''[[Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia]]'', and ''[[Same Place The Fly Got Smashed]]''.  With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members' family and friends.\n\n===Lo-fi (1992\u20131996)===\nWith the release of the ultra-limited album ''[[Propeller (Guided by Voices album)|Propeller]]'' in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the [[college rock]] circuit and bands such as [[Sonic Youth]], [[R.E.M.]] and [[The Breeders]].  New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993.  At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists [[Tobin Sprout]] and [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]] (not to be confused with [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s drummer), bassist [[Greg Demos]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]].  Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa ''Propeller'' and soon became Pollard's primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band's catalog. 1993 also saw the release of ''[[Vampire on Titus]]'', as well as the ''[[Fast Japanese Spin Cycle]]'' and ''[[Static Airplane Jive]]'' EPs.  Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV's history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark ''[[Bee Thousand]]'' via [[Scat Records]], with a distribution deal through indie label [[Matador Records]].  Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time.  The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard's homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, [[Roger Daltrey]]-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands<ref>{{Citation|last=Tim Krings|title=Bob Pollard throwing empty beer can at band|date=2010-07-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnb4GuuR2Lw&list=LLzjuRvUk5CF_p8rBConuR8g&index=15|accessdate=2017-11-07}}</ref>), [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]]'s [[Guitar showmanship|windmilling]] and [[chain smoking]], sometime bassist [[Greg Demos]]' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.\n\nTheir true Matador debut came in 1995 with ''[[Alien Lanes]]'', which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap.  The band's underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as [[MTV]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  Guided by Voices is frequently referenced by novelist and poet, Dennis Cooper, in his George Miles cycle and the group's lyrics appear in ''Guide'', the fourth of the five novels which make up the cycle. The first chapter of ''Guide'' is titled \"Guided by Voices\". After sessions for a concept album entitled ''[[The Power of Suck]]'' were aborted, the band assembled ''[[Under the Bushes Under the Stars]]'' out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with [[Kim Deal]] and [[Steve Albini]] among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \"classic lineup\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career.  Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout's ''[[Carnival Boy]]'' and Pollard's ''[[Not in My Airforce]]'', with each making a guest appearance on the other's album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band's existence.  These records were primarily self-released. Because GBV alumni were regularly featured, and songs from these albums were frequently included in GBV setlists, they are informally considered to be part of the GBV canon. Also in 1995, the band contributed the song \"Sensational Gravity Boy\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n===Major label (1997\u20132001)===\nPollard created a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with [[Cleveland]] [[glam rock]]ers [[Cobra Verde (band)|Cobra Verde]] in 1997. The following album ''[[Mag Earwhig!]]'', combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \"[[Jane of the Waking Universe]]\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time.  However, after another year of rigorous touring, the \"Guided by Verde\" lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project.\n\nCobra Verde's [[Doug Gillard]] was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \"classic\"-era bassist [[Greg Demos]], former [[The Breeders|Breeders]] drummer [[Jim Macpherson]], and eventually, former [[The Amps|Amps]]/Breeders guitarist [[The Amps|Nate Farley]]. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer [[Ric Ocasek]] to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices' [[major label]] debut.  Initially produced for [[Capitol Records]], ''[[Do the Collapse]]'' was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label [[TVT Records|TVT]].  (In the UK it was released on [[Creation Records]]). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, ''Do the Collapse'' failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews.\n\nThrough touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of [[The Who]], [[David Bowie]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption.  In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band's first and only visits to Australia and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive ''[[Suitcase: Failed Experiments and Trashed Aircraft|Suitcase]]'', a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard's enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Three more box sets of unreleased songs, ''[[Suitcase 2: American Superdream Wow|Suitcase 2]]'', ''[[Suitcase 3: Up We Go Now|Suitcase 3]]'' and  ''[[Suitcase 4: Captain Kangaroo Won The War|Suitcase 4]]'' released in October 2005, November 2009 and November 2015 respectively.)\n\n2001's ''[[Isolation Drills]]'' was recorded with [[Rob Schnapf]],<ref name=BOMB-IsolationDrills-2001>{{cite journal|last1=McGonigal|first1=Mike|title=Robert Pollard|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB]]|date=Summer 2001|issue=76|page=32\u201337|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/robert-pollard/|publisher=New Art Publications}}</ref> who aimed to capture the band's live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in ''Billboard'''s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough.\n\n===Later years (2002\u20132004)===\n[[File:Robert pollard 0001.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Robert Pollard]] performing with Guided By Voices in 2014|255x255px]]\nAfter departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released ''[[Universal Truths and Cycles]]'', a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band's mid-90s, mid-fi aesthetic. ''Universal Truths'' producer [[Todd Tobias]] would also record the band's final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled ''[[Earthquake Glue]]'', followed by the anthology box set ''[[Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere]]'' and the [[greatest hits]] compilation ''[[Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates]]''.\n\nIn 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |title=Special Announcement From Guided By Voices |publisher=Gbv.com |accessdate=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315062433/http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |archivedate=2012-03-15 }}</ref> following the release of the ''[[Half-Smiles of the Decomposed]]'' LP, and a final farewell tour. Pollard stated:\n\n:\"This feels like the last album for Guided by Voices. I've always said that when I make a record that I'm totally satisfied with as befitting a final album, then that will be it. And this is it.\"\n\nGuided by Voices would go on to release no less than 15 more studio albums (since ''[[Surrender Your Poppy Field]]''')'''''.\n\nOn November 9, 2004, Guided by Voices performed on the stage of [[Austin City Limits]], broadcast by [[PBS]] on January 22, 2005. Their last television appearance was on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on December 2, 2004. They played the single, \"Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)\".  After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004.  The four-hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD ''The Electrifying Conclusion''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gbvdb.com/album.asp?albumid=2184 |title=The Electrifying Conclusion |publisher=Gbvdb.com |date=1994-01-15 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Post-GBV (2005\u20132009)===\nPollard released his first post-GBV album in 2006 on [[Merge Records]].  The album, titled ''[[From a Compound Eye]]'' was a double LP produced by [[Todd Tobias]]. Later Pollard albums have been released on Merge and Pollard's own label, Guided by Voices Inc.\n\nFollowing GBV's demise, Pollard was frequently asked about band reunions. In 2007 he told [[Magnet (magazine)|''MAGNET'']]: \"To me, it\u2019s just cashing in. If you\u2019re gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That\u2019s like doing the county-fair circuit. I don\u2019t see Guided By Voices reforming. For one thing, there were 50 or 60 people in Guided By Voices over time.\"<ref>[http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/rpollard.html Magnetmagazine.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827212250/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/rpollard.html |date=August 27, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nPollard also commented on the fact that GBV and his solo output are basicially the same, when he told [[Harp Magazine|''Harp'']] magazine, in 2005, \"You know, a lot of people try to distinguish things between what is Robert Pollard and what is Guided By Voices.

Hutchence was the lead singer and lyricist of INXS from 1977 until his death.\n\nHutchence was a member of the short-lived pop rock group [[Max Q (Australian band)|Max Q]]. He also recorded some solo material and acted in feature films, including ''[[Dogs in Space]]'' (1986), ''[[Frankenstein Unbound]]'' (1990), and ''Limp'' (1997).\n\nHutchence had a string of love affairs with prominent actresses, models and singers, and his private life was often reported in the Australian and international press. In July 1996, Hutchence and English television presenter [[Paula Yates]] had a daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.\n\nOn the morning of 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in his hotel room in Sydney. His death was reported by the New South Wales Coroner to be the result of [[suicide by hanging]].\n\n==Early life==\nMichael Kelland John Hutchence was born on 22 January 1960, to Sydney businessman Kelland (\"Kell\") Frank Hutchence (1924-2002) and make-up artist [[Patricia Glassop]] (n\u00e9e Kennedy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelhutchenceinfo.com/archives_part7.htm|title=Kelland Frank Hutchence|first=Tina|last=Hutchence|date=July 21, 1924|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> Kelland's parents were [[sea captain]] Frank Hutchence and Mabs from England who settled in Sydney in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://michaelhutchence.org/michaels-story/|title=Michael\u2019s story|first=Kelland|last=Hutchence|date=2010|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dxNhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT21&dq=michael+hutchence+captain+frank+hutchence+england&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj9cPb9-_nAhW0RxUIHe8ICqsQ6AEINjAC|title=Michael: My brother, lost boy of INXS|first=Tina|last=Hutchence|date=2018|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> Michael joined elder half-sister Tina; both siblings were of Irish ancestry from their mother's side,<ref name=\"PatriciaGlassop\"/> as Patricia's father was from [[County Cork]] in Ireland. \n\nFollowing Kell's business interests, the Hutchence family moved to [[Brisbane]] (where younger brother Rhett was born) and later to [[Hong Kong]]. During the early years in Hong Kong, both boys attended [[Beacon Hill School, Hong Kong|Beacon Hill School]] in [[Kowloon Tong]]. While in Hong Kong, Michael showed promise as a swimmer before breaking his arm badly. He then began to show interest in [[poetry]] and performed his first song in a local toy store commercial. Michael attended [[King George V School (Hong Kong)|King George V School]] during his early teens.<ref name=\"Official\" />\n\nThe family returned to Sydney in 1972, buying a house in [[Belrose, New South Wales|Belrose]] near the [[Northern Beaches]]. Hutchence attended [[Davidson High School (New South Wales)|Davidson High School]], where he met and befriended [[Andrew Farriss]]. Around this time, Hutchence and Farriss spent a lot of time jamming in the garage with Andrew's brothers. Farriss then convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside classmates Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. Bass guitarist [[Garry Gary Beers|Garry Beers]] and drummer Geoff Kennelly from nearby [[Forest High School (New South Wales)|Forest High School]] filled out the line-up.<ref name=\"StJohn\" /> Hutchence's parents separated when he was 15; for a short time in 1976, he lived with his mother and half-sister Tina in [[California]].<ref name=\"Official\" /><ref name=\"Creswell\" /> Hutchence later returned to Sydney with his mother.<ref name=\"Official\" />\n\nIn 1977, a new band, The Farriss Brothers, was formed with [[Tim Farriss]] on [[lead guitar]], his younger brother Andrew as [[keyboardist]], and youngest brother [[Jon Farriss|Jon]] on drums. Andrew brought Hutchence on board as a vocalist and Beers on [[bass guitar]], and Tim brought in his former bandmate [[Kirk Pengilly]] to play guitar and [[saxophone]].<ref name=\"McF\" /><ref name=\"ARDb\" /> The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at [[Whale Beach, New South Wales|Whale Beach]], 40&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) north of Sydney.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" />\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nHutchence, the Farriss brothers, Kerny, Sanders, Beers and Kennelly briefly performed as The Vegetables, singing \"We Are the Vegetables\".<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> Ten months later, they returned to Sydney and recorded a set of demos.<ref name=\"StJohn\" /> The Farriss Brothers regularly supported [[hard rock]]ers [[Midnight Oil]] on the [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] circuit, and were renamed as INXS in 1979.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> Their first performance under the new name was on 1 September at the Oceanview Hotel in [[Toukley, New South Wales|Toukley]].<ref name=\"StJohn\" /> In May 1980, the group released their first single, \"Simple Simon\"/\"We Are the Vegetables\" which was followed by the debut album ''[[INXS (album)|INXS]]'' in October.<ref name=\"McF\" /> Their first Top&nbsp;40 Australian hit on the [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart, \"Just Keep Walking\", was released in September 1980.<ref name=\"Kent\" />\n\nHutchence became the main spokesperson for the band.<ref name=\"McF\" /> He co-wrote almost all of INXS's songs with Andrew Farriss.<ref name=\"Creswell\" />\n\nAccording to Hutchence, most of the songs on the band's second album, ''Underneath the Colours'', were written within a fairly short space of time: \"Most bands shudder at the prospect of having 20 years to write their first album and four days to write their second. For us, though, it was good. It left less room for us to go off on all sorts of tangents\".<ref name=\"StJohn\" /> Soon after [[recording sessions]] for ''[[Underneath the Colours]]'' \u2013 produced by [[Richard Clapton]] \u2013 had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Hutchence recorded \"Speed Kills\", written by [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]] of hard rockers [[Cold Chisel]], for the ''Freedom'' (1982) film [[soundtrack]], directed by [[Scott Hicks]]. It was Hutchence's first solo single and was released by [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] in early 1982.<ref name=\"StJohn\" />\n\n===Stardom and acting career===\nIn March 1985, after Hutchence and INXS recorded their album ''[[The Swing (INXS album)|The Swing]]'' (1984), WEA released the Australian version of ''[[Dekadance]]'', as a limited edition [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] only [[Extended Play|EP]] of six tracks including [[remixes]] from the album. The cassette also included a [[cover version]] of [[Nancy Sinatra]] and [[Lee Hazlewood]]'s hit \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]\", which Hutchence sang as a [[duet]] with [[Jenny Morris (musician)|Jenny Morris]], a backing singer for ''The Swing'' sessions.<ref name=\"McF\" /> The EP reached No&nbsp;2 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart.<ref name=\"Kent\" /> Hutchence provided vocals for new wave band [[Beargarden (band)|Beargarden]]'s 1985 single release.<ref name=\"ARDbMH\" />\n\nOn 19 May, INXS won seven awards at the 1984 ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' Music and Video Awards ceremony, including 'Best Songwriter' for Hutchence and Andrew, and 'Most Popular Male' for Hutchence.<ref name=\"McF\" /><ref name=\"Count1984\" /> They performed \"[[Burn for You (INXS song)|Burn for You]]\", dressed in [[Akubra]]s (a brand of hats) and [[Driza-Bone|Drizabones]] (a brand of outdoor coats/oilskin jackets) followed by Hutchence and Morris singing \"Jackson\" to close.<ref name=\"Count1984\" />\n\nIn 1986, Hutchence played Sam, the lead male role, in the Australian film ''[[Dogs in Space]]'', directed by long-time INXS music video collaborator [[Richard Lowenstein]]. Sam's girlfriend, Anna, was portrayed by [[Saskia Post]] as a \"fragile [[peroxide blonde]] in op-shop clothes\".<ref name=\"Cockington\" /><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490031/ ''We're Livin' on Dog Food'' (2009)], documentary by Ghost Pictures</ref> Hutchence provided four songs on the film's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|magazine=Filmink|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/australian-singers-turned-actors/|title=Australian Singers Turned Actors|date=July 14, 2019}}</ref> \n\nLate in 1986, before commencing work on a new INXS album and while supposedly taking an eight-month break, the band's management decided to stage the [[Australian Made]] tour as a series of major outdoor concerts across the country. The roster featured INXS, [[Jimmy Barnes]] (Cold Chisel), [[Models (band)|Models]], [[Divinyls]], [[Mental as Anything]], [[The Triffids]] and [[I'm Talking]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> To promote the tour, Hutchence and Barnes shared vocals on [[The Easybeats]] cover \"[[Good Times (Easybeats song)|Good Times]]\" and \"Laying Down the Law\", which Barnes cowrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly.<ref name=\"ASCAP\" /> \"Good Times\" was used as the theme for the concert series of 1986\u20131987.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> It peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the Australian charts,<ref name=\"Kent\" /> and months later was featured in the [[Joel Schumacher]] film ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' and its [[The Lost Boys (soundtrack)|soundtrack]],<ref name=\"LostBoys\" /> allowing it to peak at No.&nbsp;47 in the U.S. on 1 August 1987.<ref name=AMGSingles /> Divinyls' lead singer [[Chrissie Amphlett]] enjoyed the tour and reconnected with Hutchence, stating that \"[he] was a sweet man, who said in one interview that he wanted me to have his baby.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\" />\n\nIn 1987, Hutchence provided vocals for Richard Clapton's album ''Glory Road'', which was produced by Jon Farriss.<ref name=\"ARDbMH\" />\n\nINXS released ''[[Kick (INXS album)|Kick]]'' in October 1987, and the album provided the band with worldwide popularity. ''Kick'' peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in Australia,<ref name=\"Kent\" /> No.&nbsp;3 on the US ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name=AMGAlbums /> No.&nbsp;9 in UK,<ref name=\"UKCharts\" /> and No.&nbsp;15 in Austria.<ref name=\"AUTCharts\" /> The band's most successful studio album, ''Kick'' has been certified six times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and spawned four US top 10 singles (\"[[New Sensation]]\", \"[[Never Tear Us Apart]]\", \"[[Devil Inside (INXS song)|Devil Inside]]\" and \"[[Need You Tonight]]\", the last of which reached the top of the US ''Billboard'' singles charts).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/inxs-kick-10-things-you-didnt-know-127082/|title=INXS' 'Kick': 10 Things You Didn't Know|first1=Van|last1=Sias|first2=Van|last2=Sias|date=19 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonherald.com/2018/01/05/inxs-kicks-through-genres/|title=INXS\u2019 \"Kick\"s through genres|date=5 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref> According to ''1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them'', the single \"Need You Tonight\" is not lyrically complex; it is Hutchence's performance where \"he sings in kittenish whisper, gently drawing back with the incredible lust of a tiger hunting in the night\" that makes the song \"as sexy and funky as any white rock group has ever been\".<ref name=\"Creswell1001\" /> In September 1988, the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for \"Need You Tonight/Mediate\" winning in five categories.<ref name=BandRoadChronology2 />\n\nIn 1989, Hutchence collaborated further with Olsen for the [[Max Q (Australian band)|Max Q]] project, and was joined by members of Olsen's previous groups including Whirlywirld, [[No (band)|No]] and [[Orchestra of Skin and Bone]]. They released a [[Max Q (album)|self-titled album]] and three singles, \"[[Way of the World (Max Q song)|Way of the World]]\", \"[[Sometimes (Max Q song)|Sometimes]]\" and \"Monday Night by Satellite\". Max Q disbanded in 1990.<ref name=\"McFIOO\" /> ''Max Q'' showed Hutchence exploring the darker side of his music and, with Olsen, he created \"one of the most innovative dance music albums of the decade\". Hutchence wrote most of the music and provided \"an extraordinary performance&nbsp;... it was one of the most significant statements Hutchence was to make\".<ref name=\"Creswell1001\" /> In 1990, Hutchence portrayed nineteenth-century Romantic poet [[Percy Shelley]] in [[Roger Corman]]'s film version of ''[[Frankenstein Unbound]]'', which was based on a science fiction time travel story of the same name written by [[Brian Aldiss]].<ref name=\"Frankenstein\" />\n\nIn 1990, INXS released ''[[X (INXS album)|X]]'', which spawned more international hits such as \"[[Suicide Blonde]]\" and \"[[Disappear (INXS song)|Disappear]]\" (both Top 10 in the US).<ref name=AMGSingles /> \"Suicide Blonde\" peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in Australia and No.&nbsp;11 in the UK.<ref name=\"UKCharts\" /> Hutchence, with Andrew Farriss, wrote the song after Hutchence's then-girlfriend, [[Kylie Minogue]], used the phrase \"suicide blonde\" to describe her look during her 1989 film, ''[[The Delinquents (1989 film)|The Delinquents]]''; the film depicted Minogue in a platinum blonde wig.<ref name=\"MSNKylie\" /> Hutchence won the 'Best International Artist' at the [[1991 BRIT Awards]] with INXS winning the related group award.<ref name=\"McF\" /> Hutchence provided vocals for pub rockers [[Noiseworks]]' album, ''[[Love Versus Money (Noiseworks album)|Love Versus Money]]'' (1991).<ref name=\"ARDbMH\" />\n[[File:Michael_Hutchence_on_stage.jpg|thumb|right|January 1994, on stage during the Dirty Honeymoon world tour]]\n\n''[[Welcome to Wherever You Are]]'' was released by INXS in August 1992. It received good critical reviews and went to No.&nbsp;1 in the UK.<ref name=\"UKCharts\" />\n\n===Later career===\nHutchence and INXS faced reduced commercial success with ''Full Moon, Dirty Hearts'', especially in the U.S. The band took time off to rest and be with their families, while Hutchence remained in the public eye through his romances.<ref name=\"McF\" /><ref name=\"Simmonds\" /> He commenced work on a self-titled solo album in the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"McF\" />\n\nAfter a period of inactivity and releases that received lukewarm reviews, INXS recorded the band's 10th official album, ''[[Elegantly Wasted]]'', in 1996.\n\n===Artistry===\nHutchence was a baritone.<ref>{{Cite

According to INXS bandmate Beers, Hutchence pulled a knife and threatened to kill him during the 1993 recording of ''[[Full Moon, Dirty Hearts]]'' on the isle of [[Capri]]. Beers said: \"Over those six weeks, Michael threatened or physically confronted nearly every member of the band.\"<ref name=\"Bozza\" />\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Hutchence became romantically involved with [[Paula Yates]].<ref name=\"MSNChristensen\" /> He had met her in 1985, during an interview for her program, ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]''. Yates interviewed him again in 1994 for her ''[[Big Breakfast]]'' show, and their affair was soon uncovered by the British press.<ref name=\"Simmonds\" /> At the time, Yates was married to [[The Boomtown Rats]]' lead singer and [[Live Aid]] organiser [[Bob Geldof]]. Media scrutiny was intense, and Hutchence assaulted a photographer who had followed them. Yates' separation from Geldof in February 1995 sparked a public and at times bitter [[custody battle]] over their daughters. Yates and Geldof divorced in May 1996.<ref name=\"BBCSep2000\" /> On 22 July 1996, Yates gave birth to Hutchence's daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence.<ref name=\"HutchenceGlossop\" />\n\nIn September 1996, Yates and Hutchence made headlines when they were arrested for suspicion of [[drug possession]] after the family nanny reportedly found a small amount of [[opium]] in a shoebox underneath their bed.

Yates's statement on 26 November indicated that she had informed Hutchence of the Geldof girls' custody hearing being adjourned until 17 December, which meant that Yates would not be able to bring Tiger and the Geldof girls to Australia for a visit as previously intended. According to Yates, Hutchence \"was frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby... [he] was terribly upset and he said, 'I don't know how I'll live without seeing Tiger'\". Yates indicated that Hutchence said he was going to phone Geldof \"to let the girls come to Australia\".<ref name=\"Hand\" /><ref name=\"HandInquestReport\" /> \n\nGeldof's police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated that Geldof did receive a call from Hutchence, who was \"hectoring and abusive and threatening\" during their phone conversation. The occupant in the room next to Hutchence's heard a loud male voice and swearing at about 5 am; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.<ref name=\"Hand\" /><ref name=\"HandInquestReport\" />\n\nAt 9:54 am on 22 November, Hutchence spoke with a former girlfriend, Mich\u00e8le Bennett; according to Bennett, Hutchence was crying, sounded upset, and told her he needed to see her. Bennett arrived at his hotel room door at about 10:40 am, but there was no response. Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11:50 am.

His casket was carried out of the cathedral by members of [[INXS]] and by his younger brother, Rhett; \"Never Tear Us Apart\" was played in the background. [[Nick Cave]], a friend of Hutchence, performed his 1997 song \"[[Into My Arms]]\" during the funeral and requested that television cameras be switched off.

During the early years in Hong Kong, both boys attended [[Beacon Hill School, Hong Kong|Beacon Hill School]] in [[Kowloon Tong]].

Hutchence attended [[Davidson High School (New South Wales)|Davidson High School]], where he met and befriended [[Andrew Farriss]]. Around this time, Hutchence and Farriss spent a lot of time jamming in the garage with Andrew's brothers. Farriss then convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside classmates Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. Bass guitarist [[Garry Gary Beers|Garry Beers]] and drummer Geoff Kennelly from nearby [[Forest High School (New South Wales)|Forest High School]] filled out the line-up.<ref name=\"StJohn\" /> Hutchence's parents separated when he was 15; for a short time in 1976, he lived with his mother and half-sister Tina in [[California]].<ref name=\"Official\" /><ref name=\"Creswell\" /> Hutchence later returned to Sydney with his mother.<ref name=\"Official\" />\n\nIn 1977, a new band, The Farriss Brothers, was formed with [[Tim Farriss]] on [[lead guitar]], his younger brother Andrew as [[keyboardist]], and youngest brother [[Jon Farriss|Jon]] on drums.

Yates's statement on 26 November indicated that she had informed Hutchence of the Geldof girls' custody hearing being adjourned until 17 December, which meant that Yates would not be able to bring Tiger and the Geldof girls to Australia for a visit as previously intended. According to Yates, Hutchence \"was frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby... [he] was terribly upset and he said, 'I don't know how I'll live without seeing Tiger'\".

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. The series is produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and [[Jeffrey Bell]] serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\nThe series stars [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]], reprising his role from the film series, alongside [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Brett Dalton]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]] and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]. [[Nick Blood]], [[Adrianne Palicki]], [[Henry Simmons]], [[Luke Mitchell]], [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]], [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]], and [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]] joined in later seasons. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents deal with various unusual cases and enemies, including [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], [[Inhumans]], [[Life Model Decoy]]s, alien species such as the [[Kree]], and time travel.\n\n''The Avengers'' writer and director Joss Whedon began developing a S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Television pilot|pilot]] following the film's release, and Gregg was confirmed to reprise his role in October 2012. The series was officially picked up by ABC in May 2013. [[Prosthetic makeup]] is created with [[Glenn Hetrick]]'s Optic Nerve Studios, while [[Legacy Effects]] contributes other [[practical effects]]. The [[visual effects]] for the series are created by FuseFX, and have been nominated for multiple awards. Several episodes directly crossover with films or other television series set in the MCU, while other characters from MCU films and [[Marvel One-Shots]] also appear throughout the series.\n\nThe series premiered on September 24, 2013, with the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)|first season]] concluding on May 13, 2014. This was followed by a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] from September 2014 to May 2015, a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third]] from September 2015 to May 2016, a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth]] from September 2016 to May 2017, and a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth]] from December 2017 to May 2018. A [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 6)|sixth season]] premiered on May 10, 2019, and a final [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 7)|seventh season]] is set to premiere on May 27, 2020. After starting the first season with high ratings but mixed reviews, the ratings began to drop while reviews improved. This led to much lower but more consistent ratings, as well as more consistently positive reviews in the subsequent seasons.\n\nSeveral characters created for the series have since been introduced to the [[Marvel Universe|comic universe]] and other media. ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]'', a planned spin-off centered on [[Lance Hunter]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], received a pilot order in August 2015 but did not lead to a series. An online digital series, ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', centered on Cordova-Buckley's [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]], was launched in December 2016 on ABC.com.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The series was described as \"'a kernel of an idea' with a number of scenarios being explored, including a high-concept cop show.\"<ref name=\"July2012Kernel\"/> The next month, it was announced that ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''{{'}} director [[Joss Whedon]], creator of other television shows such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', would be involved in the series' development.<ref name=\"Aug2012Whedon\"/>\n\nIn August 2012, ABC ordered a pilot for a series called ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' to be written and directed by Joss Whedon, with [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] also writing.<ref name=\"Aug2012Showrunners\"/><ref name=\"Aug2012PilotGreenlit\"/> Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] greenlit the series after watching the [[Marvel One-Shot]] short film ''[[Item 47]]''.<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\"/> In April 2013, ABC announced that the series would be titled ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"Apr2013ABCAllAccess\" /> and it was officially picked up for a full season of 22 episodes in May 2013.<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\" /><ref name=\"S1pickup\"/> Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and [[Jeffrey Bell]] act as the series' [[showrunner]]s,<ref name=\"Aug2012Showrunners\"/> with Bell joining the show to help the inexperienced former pair with hiring crew members and \"navigating the politics of studios and networks\", saying, \"My job is to help them learn how to do that, to steer the ship while they learn.\" Joss Whedon assisted them before he started work on ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />\n\nThe series was renewed for a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

(season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> The seventh season will serve as the series' final season.<ref name=\"AoSFinalSeason\" />\n\nIn September 2016, discussing the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, \"You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, we will continue to move forward.\" Jed Whedon added, \"There are always ideas in the back of your mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> By May 2017, Bell noted they had \"a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends.

When the showrunners are writing the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, a member of the series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />\n\nIn January 2013, Joss Whedon deflected any direct influences from other series, such as the efforts of [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] in ''[[The X-Files]]'', and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on \"the peripheral people...the people on the edges of the grand adventures.\"<ref name=\"Jan2013WhedonInterview\"/> As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences \"seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyS2Finale\" /> Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, \"The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by ''The Avengers'' there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that.\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" />\n\nOn the balance between creating new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics in a way that works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, \"We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it.\"<ref name=\"ProducersEW\" /> About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. He explained that the series does attempt to create \"Marvel moments\" as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments\u2014something that works really well on television\u2014so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so \"If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we want to be in the car with the character having that experience.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" />\n\n{{multiple image|\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n\n<!-- Images -->\n | width             = \n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width1            = 210\n | alt1              = Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen sitting.\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Jeffrey Bell at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width2            = 100\n | alt2              = Jeffrey Bell sitting.\n\n<!-- Footer -->\n | footer_align      = Left\n | footer            = (L to R) Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell, the showrunners of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''\n}}\nIn September 2015, Bell looked back on the first two seasons and talked about the challenges of and changes in the series. He noted the negative reception from fans concerning the low number of recognizable characters like Coulson, but pointed out that fans seemed to have grown to like the series' original characters as they had been developed over time. He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that \"whether it's a quiet moment or in action, we [hope to] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters.\"<ref name=\"BellPasteSep2015\" /> A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of \"finding new combinations and new conflicts\" between different sets of characters, given \"a lot of procedurals [see] the same people doing the same thing for five years and the character don't evolve or change at all.\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" />\n\nThe producers and writers initially formed a general plan for the show through the end of a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films.<ref name=\"HitfixPg2\" /> In May 2016, [[Chloe Bennet]] likened the end of the third season to \"the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show.\"<ref name=\"BennetFirstBook\" /> She elaborated that \"the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show\" moving forward.<ref name=\"BennetS4\" /> The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to \"skew a little darker because of\" this change, with Loeb adding that \"It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [though]. I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' anytime soon on [ABC].\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" /> Marvel \"had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak\" in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of [[Ghost Rider]] in the season over one of [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], because Marvel felt \"that this character was right to tell [darker and more violent] stories right now\" and having him on ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' aided that because \"it was so unexpected\". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.<ref name=\"GhostRiderAug2016\" />\n\nIn May 2017, ahead of the fifth season renewal, Jed Whedon said the writers were not sure what would happen in the season, and that it would be \"by the seat of our pants.\"<ref name=\"EWMay2017S5Plan\" /> While beginning to write the final episode of season 5 at the end of February 2018, the writers were planning for it to be able to serve as both a season and series finale, with some elements that could be adjusted based on whether the series was renewed for a sixth season or not.

Assistant costume designer Ann Foley took over for subsequent episodes, and worked closely with Tancharoen to create \"very strong, different characters\" whose \"looks evolve along with the show.\"<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> Foley also brought on concept artists Phillip Boutte Jr. and Josh Shaw to assist with the design process.<ref name=\"BoutteInterview\" /><ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> Foley watched every MCU film, paying special attention to ''The Avengers'', and was also inspired by such films as ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol]]''.<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> In October 2016, Foley said that she was specifically following the aesthetic of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', \"So any costume has to fit inside that world we've established and has to fit that tactical look.\"<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" /> On the variety of costumes created for each character, Foley preferred to have set pieces in the characters' \"closets\", as \"it's not a fashion show ... a guy like Ward isn't going to have twenty jackets in his closet. He is going to have one that he uses all of the time.\"<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" />\n\nAfter reading each script, Foley would do her own research, before discussing the look of the episode with the writers.<ref name=\"FoleyHiatus\" /> She then studied the comics, general fashion, and history to get a look that is recognizable to fans, but fits into the more realistic world of the series.<ref name=\"BoutteInterview\" /> Costumes are either custom made or bought, and the actors are brought in for fittings before filming. This process was often challenging because of the series' eight-day-per-episode schedule.<ref name=\"FoleyHiatus\" /> Foley stated that all costumes take a similar amount of time to create, whether they are based on the comics or not.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> Marvel CCO [[Joe Quesada]] is involved in the approval process when costuming preexisting characters,<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> including Daisy Johnson's Quake costume, which is introduced in the third season. The Quake costume incorporates elements from the comic version of the character, and was intended to show that Quake \"could easily be part of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\".<ref name=\"CostumeEvolution\" /><ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Foley took steps to differentiate the Quake costume from [[Scarlett Johansson]]'s [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Black Widow]] costumes from the films, but was \"flattered\" by comparisons made between them. Foley was also adamant about showing that characters such as Quake \"don't have to be sexualised, that they're powerful, strong women\", and so avoided \"a lot of cleavage, you don't see high heels. It's about practicality.\"<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" />\n\nThe costumes go through a natural evolution in the series. There is a shift at the end of the first season to a darker look, and all the characters have \"definitely grown up\" during the second season. In the third season there is another shift, \"from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to [a] more precise militaristic outfit\".<ref name=\"CostumeEvolution\" /> This change is also reflected in the series' color palette, going from \"a much lighter tone, much more patterns\" in the first season to having \"stripped away a bit of color\" by the third.<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" /> Despite this increasing darkness in the costumes, Foley intended to define each character as they are introduced and to have them always be recognizable and identifiable.<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> With the start of the fourth season, Foley said that \"each season definitely has its own feel and this season will be no different. I think that you're going to see some subtle differences in the costumes of the characters\"; she felt like Fitz and Simmons, in particular, had become \"more adult looking\", while all the cast had \"a pretty specific ... civilian look\" that would become more prominent as S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized and becomes more public.<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Foley left the series after the thirteenth episode of the fourth season, to work on a television adaptation of ''[[Altered Carbon]]'',<ref name=\"FoleyLeaves\" /> and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to \"blend in\" with Foley's established look.<ref name=\"ThisWeek58\" />\n\nFoley returned for the first two episodes of the fifth season, before handing costume design over to Whitney Galitz, who had assisted Foley on the previous few seasons, and Christann Chanell.<ref name=\"FoleyBack\" />\n\n====Practical effects====\nThe series' [[Theatrical property|props]] department is led by Scott Bauer. The pilot introduces the Incapacitating Cartridge Emitting Railgun, or ICER, tranquilizer weapons often used by the agents, with Joss Whedon having Bauer design \"sci-fi\"-looking guns, including a large rifle-like weapon. The series' further portrayal of the ICERs was more subtle, with Bauer using airsoft guns that are safe to shoot others with over a small distance. ICER-specific muzzle flashes are then added by the visual effects department. Bauer reused the ICER rifle prop when making Mack's \"Shotgun Ax\", which appears in later seasons. The [[Terrigen Mist|terrigen crystals]] that unlock Inhuman abilities in the series are 3D-printed from solid resin and then altered with extra details.<ref name=\"Props\" /> Additional practical effects and props are created by [[Legacy Effects]], who also work on the MCU films,<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /><ref name=\"LegacyEffectsFilms\" /> notably creating Daisy Johnson's gauntlets for the third season.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> [[Prosthetic makeup]] for the series is designed in conjunction with [[Glenn Hetrick]] of Optic Nerve Studios. Hetrick began work on the series with the second season, to create [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Raina|Raina]]'s Inhuman look,<ref name=\"RainaMakeUp\" /> and returned for the third season to design and create the more unusual-looking Inhumans such as [[Lash (comics)|Lash]].<ref name=\"HetrickLash\" />\n\n====Title sequence====\n[[File:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. title cards animation.gif|thumb|The title sequence for the series' 100th episode, \"The Real Deal\", featuring a montage of all title cards used throughout the series at that point]]\nThe third season introduces a new title sequence for the series, replacing the one that appeared in the first two seasons.<ref name=\"NewTitle\" /> The title sequence in \"[[4,722 Hours]]\" is drastically different from the design introduced for the third season, with the series' title in the episode's typeface silently fading onto the screen over the back drop of the planet Simmons is stranded on.<ref name=\"4722Title\" /><ref name=\"4722Title2\" /> The fourth season sees new series title cards for the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

(season 4)#LMD|LMD]]'' pods,<ref name=\"S4GRTitle\" /><ref name=\"S4LMDTitle\" /> and an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' title card for the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)#Agents of Hydra|Agents of Hydra]]'' pod that changes to say ''Agents of Hydra'' for episodes primarily set in the Framework.<ref name=\"HydraTitleCard\" /><ref name=\"FrameworkTitleCard\" /> The ''Ghost Rider'' graphic is used again for the fourth-season finale.<ref name=\"FinaleTitleCard\" /> For the fifth season, the opening of \"Orientation\" is reminiscent of the sequence for \"4,722 Hours\", forgoing the title card and having the typeface silently fading onto the screen.<ref name=\"OrientationOpening\" /> The subsequent episodes of season five feature a title card with the series name in a new typeface against a backdrop of various depictions of Earth: episodes through \"Past Life\" feature a destroyed future Earth;<ref name=\"S5Opening\" /> episodes from \"Principa\" through \"The Devil Complex\" feature a present Earth<!--can be seen at end of 100th episode card montage-->; while episodes from \"Rise and Shine\" through \"All Roads Lead...\" feature the Earth beginning to crack.<ref name=\"515Recap\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for the pilot took place almost entirely in [[Los Angeles]] to accommodate Joss Whedon's schedule,<ref name=\"Jan2013LeeInterview2\" /> while the rest of the series is primarily filmed in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> Additional filming has also taken place around the world, including in [[Paris]], France,<ref name=\"Oct2013Dalton\" /> [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"Oct2013Armand\" /> and [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" /> The series is filmed on [[Arri Alexa]] cameras,<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> with [[David Boyd (cinematographer)|David Boyd]] serving as [[director of photography]] on the pilot,<ref name=\"BoydDoP\" /> and Feliks Parnell, Jeff Mygatt, and Allan Westbrook doing so throughout the rest of the series.<!-- From the episode credits, unless a separate reliable source can be found --> Garry Brown is the second unit director for the series, with stunts coordinated by Tanner Gill.<ref name=\"302BTS\" /> The series is filmed in [[2K resolution]].<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFuseFX serves as the lead visual effects vendor for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> with additional work by [[Pixomondo]], Cosa, Greenhaus GFX, Lion VFX, and Synaptic.<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> The series sees an average of 80 to 150 visual effects shots per episode,<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" /> with 10 to 12 days to work on the effects for one episode once background plates have been received from filming.<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> This equates to approximately 2000 visual effects shots per season.<ref name=\"PostVFX\" />  Mark Kolpack serves as visual effects supervisor for the series.<ref name=\"VFX1\" /> David Altenau was the in-house supervisor at FuseFX for \"Pilot\" through episode eight, with Kevin Lingenfelser taking over for subsequent episodes.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> VFX producer Andrea D'Amico joined the team at FuseFX to work on the series in December 2015.<ref name=\"DAmico\" /> Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, and producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had to be worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> Typical effects for the series include the creation of character-driving effects animation, photo-realistic vehicles, CG set extensions, pyrotechnics, and atmospheric effects.<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> Some assets, such as a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]] and [[Helicarrier]], are shared from [[Industrial Light & Magic]], though \"those models are generally super heavy and dense with data\" and need to be made \"HD friendly or simply manageable to work in [a] TV schedule.\"<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Bear McCreary]] confirmed that he would compose music for the series in July 2013.<ref name=\"McCreary\"/> Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to work with a full symphonic orchestra,<ref name=\"McCrearyDoG\" /> typically featuring 50 or 70 players,<ref name=\"McCrearyMaveth\" /> with over 90 for \"important\" episodes.<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score \"a modern edge\".<ref name=\"McCrearyPilot\" /> Since ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was \"a sense that it had to connect\" to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens.<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode.<ref name=\"McCrearyS3\" /> Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound\u2014\"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" but also \"intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people.\" McCreary had to work harder to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence.<ref name=\"McCrearyDoG\" /> By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted \"the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... [E]lectronics really moved to the forefront as we got into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" />\n\nIn September 2014, McCreary announced that there were plans for an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' soundtrack,<ref name=\"McCrearySoundtrackPlans\" /> which was released digitally a year later by [[Marvel Music]] on September 4, 2015, and on CD on October 9.

He stated that \"ABC and Marvel both want the series to be able to make sense on its own\", but that it was beneficial for the films to have the series fill in any \"gaps\" for them, due to having to be \"big\" and moving \"quickly through a lot of huge pieces\", unlike television which has time to deal with more nuances.<ref name=\"BellPasteSep2015\" />\n\nIn January 2016, Joss Whedon noted that this process \"unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers.\" He stated that, for example, the series' creative team initially wanted to use [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]'s scepter from ''The Avengers'' but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in ''Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"JossScepter\" /> On how their ability to connect with the films changed over the life of the series, Jed Whedon said, \"The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open.\" He added, \"We have relatively free rein [in what the series can introduce and connect to]; we just can't go anywhere that [the films are] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told \"no\" that much\". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as \"something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2017\" />\n\nThe series mimics the films' [[post credits scene]]s with 'end tags', starting with the episode \"[[0-8-4]]\" which features a [[Samuel L. Jackson]] cameo. Bell explained, \"Sometimes it'll be funny, sometimes it'll be a mythology thing ... or an extra little reveal about\" the episode.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> The end tag for \"[[End of the Beginning (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|End of the Beginning]]\" is a \"directly lifted\" scene from ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"WinterSoldierTag\" />\n\nThe series' first major tie-in episode with the wider MCU was \"[[The Well (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Well]]\", which begins immediately after ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.<ref name=\"ThorTDWCrossover\" /> The episodes \"End of the Beginning\" and \"[[Turn, Turn, Turn (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Turn, Turn, Turn]]\" revolve around the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'',<ref name=\"HitfixPg1\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSCrossover\"/> which led to a retooling of the series.<ref name=\"USATodayHYDRA\" /> Flashback sequences in \"[[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Shadows]]\" and \"[[The Things We Bury]]\" featuring [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]] served as marketing and set-up for the ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' television series.<ref name=\"ACcrossover\" /><ref name=\"Ep8Synopsis\" /> The events of \"[[The Frenemy of My Enemy]]\" and \"[[The Dirty Half Dozen]]\" led up to the opening sequence of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', while \"[[Scars (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Scars]]\" deals with the aftermath of that film.<ref name=\"AoUTieIn\" /> The third season follows similar themes to the film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', focusing on powered people and the different responses to them,<ref name=\"CWThemes\" /> leading up to the episode \"[[Emancipation (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Emancipation]]\", which takes place after the film and shows how its events affect the series' powered characters.<ref name=\"CWTieIn\" />\n\nThe episode \"[[T.A.H.I.T.I.]]\" introduces the [[Kree]] alien race to the MCU, members of which play a significant role in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref name=\"BennetKree\" /><ref name=\"BennetBellKree\" /> This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU,<ref name=\"Daisy\" /> with Jed Whedon saying that it was something \"in the works\" for a long time, as [[Marvel Studios]] had plans for an ''[[Inhumans (film)|Inhumans]]'' film, and this would be \"one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film.\"<ref name=\"CBRDec2014\" /> The third season introduces the concept of the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]], with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name,<ref name=\"S3SecretWarriors\" /><ref name=\"VarietySecretWarriors\" /> while also [[retcon]]ning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline.<ref name=\"HydraRetcon\" /> Gregg noted in January 2016 that the \"writer and director [of the ''Inhumans'' film] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that.\"<ref name=\"GreggInhumansFilm\" /> When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had \"a little more freedom\" and were \"able to do a little bit more\" with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the \"classic\" Inhumans.<ref name=\"ClassicInhumans\" /> ''Marvel's Inhumans'', a television series centered on [[Black Bolt]] and other members of the [[List of Inhumans#Inhuman Royal Family|Inhuman Royal Family]], was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017.<ref name=\"InhumansSeries\" /> It was not intended to be a spin-off of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansSeries2\" />\n\nThe fourth season explores the concept of Life Model Decoys,<ref name=\"LMD\" /> which were first referenced in ''The Avengers'',<ref name=\"LMDAvengers\" /> and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU.<ref name=\"S4Premise\" /> On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously did not want to explore the concept before the release of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', which sees the introductions of [[Ultron]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] in a similar manner to LMDs.<ref name=\"VarietyEPsMay2016\" /> On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that \"with ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' coming out this year, the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe is moving into new waters,\" referring to the exploration of magic. \"We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift.\"<ref name=\"GhostRiderEW\" /> The season also continues storylines from the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]] of ''Agent Carter'', with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]], a mainstay of the MCU.<ref

August 2017, [[Emily VanCamp]] said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of [[Sharon Carter]] for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]''.<ref name=\"VanCampDiscussions\" />\n\nSeason seven sees [[Enver Gjokaj]] reprise his role as Strategic Scientific Reserve agent [[Daniel Sousa (character)|Daniel Sousa]] from ''Agent Carter''.<ref name=\"Gjokaj\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nSocial media accounts for the series were set up in January 2013, months before ABC officially ordered it, \"a rarity for a pilot.\"<ref name=\"SocialMedia\" /> By May 17, 2013, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was the top new show of the television season in terms of social media activity, with the series' official [[Twitter]] account having over 46,000 followers and its official [[Facebook]] page having close to half a million likes.<ref name=\"SocialMedia\" /> Many cast and crew members \"live tweet\" each episode, with [[J. August Richards]] noting that this brings instant feedback from viewers, and allows the crew to \"watch the audience take that journey\" in real time.<ref name=\"RichardsCollider\" />\n\nFor the final six episodes of the first season, Marvel began the \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)#\"The Art of Level Seven\"|''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Art of Level Seven]]\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative was a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the first season. The production team tried to pair specific artists to the teaser posters based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode.<ref name=\"ArtLevelSeven\" /> For the second season, the series returned as \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)#\"The Art of Evolution\"|The Art of Evolution]]\", with an image for each of the final twelve episodes of the season.<ref name=\"ArtEvolution\" /> For season five, Marvel revived their marketing art program, with \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)#\"The Road to 100\"|''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Road to 100]]\", with five posters, one for each season of the series, representing \"key pivotal moments of each season\" to commemorate the series reaching 100 episodes.<ref name=\"RoadTo100\" />\n\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con 2014]], Marvel Custom Solutions and [[Lexus]] released a limited single-issue [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|comic tie-in]] titled [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics#Other titles|''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase'']],<ref name=\"AoSTC\" /> set between the Season 1 episodes \"[[Seeds (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Seeds]]\" and \"[[T.R.A.C.K.S.]]\"<ref name=\"AoSTC1\" /> The comic was written by George Kitson, with art by Mirko Colak, Neil Edwards, and Mirco Pierfederici.<ref name=\"AoSTCTeam\" />\n\nA five-part [[web series]] titled ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Double Agent'', also sponsored by Lexus, was released from March 4 to May 6, 2015 on ABC.com. The web series follows a newly hired ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' production assistant, who acts as a [[double agent]] for the \"Mastermind\", portrayed by [[Stan Lee]]. Cast and crew members from the series, such as Gregg, also appear, with viewers having the ability to vote in an online poll after each episode to guess where the double agent would go in the next episode; votes entered viewers in a drawing to win prizes from the set of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"DoubleAgent\" /><ref name=\"StanLeeMastermind\" /> ''Double Agent'' was nominated for Outstanding Digital Series at the 27th [[Producers Guild Awards]].<ref name=\"DoubleAgentPGA\" /> Another Lexus-sponsored five-part web series, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Academy'', released from March 9 to May 4, 2016. In ''Academy'', three ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' fans compete to play an agent in that series. Members of the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' cast also appear.<ref name=\"Academy\" /> All three fans ultimately made cameo appearances in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"AcademyResult\" />\n\nThe series has been promoted with various subtitles at different times, including ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Uprising'' in season one, leading up to the ''Winter Soldier'' crossover;<ref name=\"Uprising\" /> ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Fallen Agent'' for the end of the third season;<ref name=\"FallenAgent\" /> ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Ghost Rider'' for the first \"pod\" of season four;<ref name=\"GhostRiderSubtitle\" /> and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: LMD'' for the second \"pod\" of season four.<ref name=\"LMDSlingshot\" /> The third \"pod\" of season four was known as ''Agents of Hydra''.<ref name=\"AgentsOfHydra\" />\n\n==Release==\n\n===Broadcast===\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' airs in the United States on ABC,<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\" /> in [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] and [[5.1 surround sound]],<ref name=\"PilotSynopsis\" /> despite delivering the episodes to ABC in [[1080p]].<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" /> The first season aired on Tuesdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm EST for the first season,<ref name=\"S1Timeslot\" /> and starting with the second season, the series aired on Tuesdays at 9{{nbsp}}pm EST,<ref name=\"S2Timeslot\" /> before moving to the 10{{nbsp}}pm time slot on Tuesdays for the fourth season.<ref name=\"S4Timeslot\" /> For its fifth season, the series aired on Fridays at 9{{nbsp}}pm EST,<ref name=\"S5Timeslot\" /> on Fridays at 8{{nbsp}}pm EST for season six,<ref name=\"S6Timeslot\" /> and will air at 10{{nbsp}}pm EST on Wednesdays for season seven.<ref name=\"S7PremiereDate\" />\n\nThe second and third seasons of the series were broadcast in two blocks each, with a season of ''Agent Carter'' airing in between. Bell explained that this decision was made following the challenge of producing 22 episodes for the first season to be aired over 36\u201340 weeks, which meant having repeats and \"losing momentum\". Instead, ''Agent Carter'' took up much of that gap in a row, leaving the back half of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s season to run uninterrupted.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> This format allowed the producers and writers to approach each season in two parts, each with distinct stories connected by carried-over elements.<ref name=\"TwoArcSeasons\" /> Ahead of the fourth season, Tancharoen explained, \"For the past two seasons, we've been able to break our season down into two little mini-seasons because of the airdate schedule. This upcoming season, our airdate schedule is a little different, so we're breaking it into three pods. Story wise, the development of that has made our lives easier, to break it down in that way.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> The pod format was described as \"7-10 episodes [that feature] little 'enclosed plotlines' that formed a larger whole.\"<ref name=\"PodDescription\" />\n\nRegarding whether they would break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, \"A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold on to. By breaking it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it's something the viewers enjoy, and it makes it a little easier to digest when you're telling some of these stories.\" Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be \"broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back to back, it feels weird to start calling it different things... We will try to have it in bite-sized chunks.\"<ref name=\"EWMay2017\" /> The season began airing its episodes on December 1, 2017,<ref name=\"S5Premise\" /> once ''Inhumans'' had aired its eight episodes,<ref name=\"S5StartTimeFrame\" /> with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted;<ref name=\"S5StartTimeFrame\" /> a short hiatus was taken for the airing of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]].<ref name=\"2018OlympicsBreak\" /> The season ultimately was formed by two pod story arcs.<ref name=\"S5TwoPods\" /> The sixth and seventh seasons each featured 13 episodes.<ref name=\"S6Renew\" /><ref name=\"S7Renew\" />\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has been licensed in 155 countries and territories:<ref name=\"worldwide\" /> [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] holds the broadcast rights for Canada;<ref name=\"CanadaBroadcast\"/> [[Channel 4]] aired the series in the United Kingdom for the first two seasons, before it moved to [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] for the third;<ref name=\"UKBroadcastNew\" /> in Australia, the series aired on [[Seven Network]] for the first two seasons,<ref name=\"AUSBroadcast\"/> before moving to [[Fox8]] starting with the third;<ref name=\"AUSBroadcastNew\" /> and in New Zealand, the show airs on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]].<ref name=\"NewZealandRatings\" /> [[MyNetworkTV]] was awarded the series' [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] rights in the United States, and began broadcasting it in September 2016.<ref name=\"Syndication\" />\n\n===Home media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release dates\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Netflix]] release dates (U.S.)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[DVD region 1|Region 1]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[DVD region 2|Region 2]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[DVD region 4|Region 4]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; | [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

It also enjoyed DVR recordings that, according to ''[[TV Guide]]'', were \"through the roof\".<ref name=\"TVGuideNov2013\" />\n\nIn March 2016, Alisha Grauso of ''[[Forbes]]'' discussed the series and its ratings, describing the show as having \"never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be...It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within the continuity of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even harder to do it with a full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the larger world while still being its own thing.\" Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel-Netflix shows]]) or on just being \"support and tie-in to the world of the Avengers\". Grauso concluded, \"The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world.\"<ref name=\"RatingsMar2016Pg1\" /><ref name=\"RatingsMar2016Pg2\" />\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' saw the season five episode \"All Roads Lead...\" earn a series low rating of 0.4/2 in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, as well as the lowest initial viewers with 1.67 million.<ref name=\"518Ratings\" /> In November 2018, Parrot Analytics, which measures \"how viewers interact with a TV show's brand online, assessing everything from global file-sharing and peer-to-peer traffic to social media activity\", ranked ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in the top 0.03 percent of in-demand television series worldwide, classify it as \"Amazing\". Series with similar demand included ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', and ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', while ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' had higher demand than series such as ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Fear The Walking Dead]]''.<ref name=\"ParrotDataNov2018\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; float:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#F77F00;\"|\n| [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is sure to please comic book fans, but the strong ensemble and brisk pacing help to make this better-than-average superhero show accessible to non-fanboys as well.\"<ref name=\"AoSS1RT\" /> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a \"generally favorable\" score of 74 based on 33 reviews.<ref name=\"AoSS1MC\" />\n\nThe second season has a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.66/10 based on 32 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' relaxes into itself during its sophomore season, mitigating the show's growing pains by focusing on characters while amping up narrative thrills.\"<ref name=\"AoSS2RT\"/> The third season has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.19/10 based on 22 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Still evolving in its third season, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' further hits its stride with a blend of thrills, humor, and heart.\"<ref name=\"AoSS3RT\" />\n\nThe fourth season has a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.75/10 based on 25 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' explores darker territory in its fourth season with the thrilling introduction of Ghost Rider, setting up an action-packed new chapter of Marvel's edgier mythologies.\"<ref name=\"AoSS4RT\" /> The fifth season has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.89/10 based on 22 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' swings for the fences with large-scale storytelling and wild twists that elevate season 5 from the saturated MCU and into its own space\".<ref name=\"AoSS5RT\"/>\n\nThe sixth season has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.7/10 based on 15 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Six seasons in and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' continues to deepen its exploration of space and the relationships between its heroes.\"<ref name=\"AoSS6RT\"/>\n\n===Analysis===\nThe way that the series is affected by the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' has been called \"miraculous\",<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" /><ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" /> with Terri Schwartz at [[Zap2it]] writing \"the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven\",<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" /> while Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' \"faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"<ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" /> The fact that the series also depicts the rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the MCU has also been highlighted, with Merrill Barr, reviewing \"[[Beginning of the End (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Beginning of the End]]\" for ''Forbes'', saying \"what Marvel's daring to say with this season finale is 'everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.'\"<ref name=\"ForbesSeasonReview\" />\n\nThe series' introduction of the Inhumans was seen by Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as making ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' an essential part of the MCU and Marvel Studios' plans, with the connections between the series and the films previously having always been reactive on the series' behalf, with \"stuff\" happening in the films, and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' dealing with the fallout of it. However, the series would now be \"making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU\".<ref name=\"SavaAnalysis\" /> Barr wrote that the series \"does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame [of the second season finale], all anyone\u2014Marvel fan or otherwise\u2014will be asking is when season three begins.\"<ref name=\"BarrAnalysis\" />\n\nThe third season's paralleling of themes from ''Captain America: Civil War'' was called \"topical and relevant\" and \"downright eerie\" by ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Alex McCown and [[Screen Crush]]'s Kevin Fitzpatrick. McCown compared the series' approach to setting up \"a world distrustful of superpowers\" to the real life events surrounding [[Cliven Bundy]] and [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], and said that \"''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is taking full advantage of its medium in order to tell the story the upcoming Captain America film can't: A full and fraught exploration of the need to protect freedom and privacy, even for those with extraordinary abilities.\" Fitzpatrick added that this \"topical bent...made for a great angle to build up that world mentality without feeling particularly subservient to the movies.\"<ref name=\"McCownAnalysis\" /><ref name=\"FitzpatrickAnalysis\" />\n\nAhead of the fourth season, [[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Kayti Burt opined that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is \"the X-Men TV show you should be watching\". Burt noted that the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film franchise]] was expanding to television with the series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', but that ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' already served that purpose well, highlighting the similarities between the X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of super-powered people who \"are our neighbors and our friends ... both heroes and villains\", and face \"the same fears and prejudices\" from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between ''S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s Inhumans and the X-Men became \"particularly pointed\" in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executed the storyline \"much better\" than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series' diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the [[Gifted (comics)|mutant cure storyline]], the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it \"not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. I appreciate that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most ''X-Men''-like quality.\" Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to [[20th Century Fox]] holding the rights, \"we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through ''S.H.I.E.L.D.''\"<ref name=\"XMenAnalysis\" />\n\nAdditionally, Marc N. Kleinheinz at Screen Rant discussed how the series \"continues to resist a status quo\", from the destruction and rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D., to the fallout from the Sokovia Accords. He noted that a major driving force behind the changes was the MCU films, with the series being forced \"to constantly adapt to a changing narrative landscape that it has absolutely no control over.\" He also believed that the series was obligated to adapt various Marvel characters to screen which would not be appearing in films, such as Daisy Johnson, Mockingbird, and Ghost Rider. However, Kleinheinz felt that this mindset also came from within the series crew rather than just from Marvel, saying, \"there's also the storytelling modus operandi that showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have very obviously demonstrated during their four-year tenure. It seems that constantly staking out new ground from season to season is just as much a personal predilection as it is, possibly, a corporate mandate.\"<ref name=\"StatusQuoAnalysis\" />\n\nDuring the ''Agents of Hydra'' pod in the fourth season, Collider.com's Evan Valentine noted how \"[o]ne of the prevalent themes of this latter half of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s fourth season has been its jabs at the current [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]... When all's said and done, whether you support or disavow the current administration and what it's done with its time in office, does this commentary work here? Sure it does... We need to be able to laugh at what's going on in the world, regardless of whether we agree or disagree, but ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has managed to throw in some biting commentary this season.\"<ref name=\"Collider419Review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''[[The Atlantic]]'' named \"[[4,722 Hours]]\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.<ref name=\"AtlanticBest2015\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. The series is produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and [[Jeffrey Bell]] serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\nThe series stars [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]], reprising his role from the film series, alongside [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Brett Dalton]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]] and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]. [[Nick Blood]], [[Adrianne Palicki]], [[Henry Simmons]], [[Luke Mitchell]], [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]], [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]], and [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]] joined in later seasons. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents deal with various unusual cases and enemies, including [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], [[Inhumans]], [[Life Model Decoy]]s, alien species such as the [[Kree]], and time travel.\n\n''The Avengers'' writer and director Joss Whedon began developing a S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Television pilot|pilot]] following the film's release, and Gregg was confirmed to reprise his role in October 2012. The series was officially picked up by ABC in May 2013. [[Prosthetic makeup]] is created with [[Glenn Hetrick]]'s Optic Nerve Studios, while [[Legacy Effects]] contributes other [[practical effects]]. The [[visual effects]] for the series are created by FuseFX, and have been nominated for multiple awards. Several episodes directly crossover with films or other television series set in the MCU, while other characters from MCU films and [[Marvel One-Shots]] also appear throughout the series.\n\nThe series premiered on September 24, 2013, with the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)|first season]] concluding on May 13, 2014. This was followed by a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] from September 2014 to May 2015, a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third]] from September 2015 to May 2016, a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth]] from September 2016 to May 2017, and a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth]] from December 2017 to May 2018. A [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 6)|sixth season]] premiered on May 10, 2019, and a final [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 7)|seventh season]] is set to premiere on May 27, 2020. After starting the first season with high ratings but mixed reviews, the ratings began to drop while reviews improved. This led to much lower but more consistent ratings, as well as more consistently positive reviews in the subsequent seasons.\n\nSeveral characters created for the series have since been introduced to the [[Marvel Universe|comic universe]] and other media. ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]'', a planned spin-off centered on [[Lance Hunter]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], received a pilot order in August 2015 but did not lead to a series. An online digital series, ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', centered on Cordova-Buckley's [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]], was launched in December 2016 on ABC.com.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The series was described as \"'a kernel of an idea' with a number of scenarios being explored, including a high-concept cop show.\"<ref name=\"July2012Kernel\"/> The next month, it was announced that ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''{{'}} director [[Joss Whedon]], creator of other television shows such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', would be involved in the series' development.<ref name=\"Aug2012Whedon\"/>\n\nIn August 2012, ABC ordered a pilot for a series called ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' to be written and directed by Joss Whedon, with [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] also writing.<ref name=\"Aug2012Showrunners\"/><ref name=\"Aug2012PilotGreenlit\"/> Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] greenlit the series after watching the [[Marvel One-Shot]] short film ''[[Item 47]]''.<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\"/> In April 2013, ABC announced that the series would be titled ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"Apr2013ABCAllAccess\" /> and it was officially picked up for a full season of 22 episodes in May 2013.<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\" /><ref name=\"S1pickup\"/> Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and [[Jeffrey Bell]] act as the series' [[showrunner]]s,<ref name=\"Aug2012Showrunners\"/> with Bell joining the show to help the inexperienced former pair with hiring crew members and \"navigating the politics of studios and networks\", saying, \"My job is to help them learn how to do that, to steer the ship while they learn.\" Joss Whedon assisted them before he started work on ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />\n\nThe series was renewed for a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

(season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> The seventh season will serve as the series' final season.<ref name=\"AoSFinalSeason\" />\n\nIn September 2016, discussing the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, \"You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, we will continue to move forward.\" Jed Whedon added, \"There are always ideas in the back of your mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> By May 2017, Bell noted they had \"a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends.

When the showrunners are writing the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, a member of the series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />\n\nIn January 2013, Joss Whedon deflected any direct influences from other series, such as the efforts of [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] in ''[[The X-Files]]'', and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on \"the peripheral people...the people on the edges of the grand adventures.\"<ref name=\"Jan2013WhedonInterview\"/> As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences \"seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyS2Finale\" /> Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, \"The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by ''The Avengers'' there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that.\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" />\n\nOn the balance between creating new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics in a way that works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, \"We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it.\"<ref name=\"ProducersEW\" /> About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. He explained that the series does attempt to create \"Marvel moments\" as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments\u2014something that works really well on television\u2014so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so \"If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we want to be in the car with the character having that experience.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" />\n\n{{multiple image|\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n\n<!-- Images -->\n | width             = \n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width1            = 210\n | alt1              = Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen sitting.\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Jeffrey Bell at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width2            = 100\n | alt2              = Jeffrey Bell sitting.\n\n<!-- Footer -->\n | footer_align      = Left\n | footer            = (L to R) Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell, the showrunners of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''\n}}\nIn September 2015, Bell looked back on the first two seasons and talked about the challenges of and changes in the series. He noted the negative reception from fans concerning the low number of recognizable characters like Coulson, but pointed out that fans seemed to have grown to like the series' original characters as they had been developed over time. He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that \"whether it's a quiet moment or in action, we [hope to] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters.\"<ref name=\"BellPasteSep2015\" /> A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of \"finding new combinations and new conflicts\" between different sets of characters, given \"a lot of procedurals [see] the same people doing the same thing for five years and the character don't evolve or change at all.\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" />\n\nThe producers and writers initially formed a general plan for the show through the end of a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films.<ref name=\"HitfixPg2\" /> In May 2016, [[Chloe Bennet]] likened the end of the third season to \"the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show.\"<ref name=\"BennetFirstBook\" /> She elaborated that \"the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show\" moving forward.<ref name=\"BennetS4\" /> The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to \"skew a little darker because of\" this change, with Loeb adding that \"It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [though]. I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' anytime soon on [ABC].\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" /> Marvel \"had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak\" in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of [[Ghost Rider]] in the season over one of [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], because Marvel felt \"that this character was right to tell [darker and more violent] stories right now\" and having him on ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' aided that because \"it was so unexpected\". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.<ref name=\"GhostRiderAug2016\" />\n\nIn May 2017, ahead of the fifth season renewal, Jed Whedon said the writers were not sure what would happen in the season, and that it would be \"by the seat of our pants.\"<ref name=\"EWMay2017S5Plan\" /> While beginning to write the final episode of season 5 at the end of February 2018, the writers were planning for it to be able to serve as both a season and series finale, with some elements that could be adjusted based on whether the series was renewed for a sixth season or not. Whedon added, \"we're ready for if this is the end. We're definitely going to make it rewarding either way.\"<ref name=\"TVLineS5Ending\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn October 2012, a casting sheet for five lead roles was sent out.<ref name=\"Oct2012TVline\" /> At the [[New York Comic Con]], Joss Whedon, [[Kevin Feige]], and Clark Gregg announced that Gregg would be reprising his role as agent Phil Coulson from ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''The Avengers'', and the Marvel One-Shots in the pilot,<ref name=\"CoulsonSHIELD\"/> and would \"headline\" the series.<ref name=\"NYCCCoulson\"/> Actress [[Ming-Na Wen]] was cast as Melinda May.<ref name=\"Oct2012MingNa\"/> The next month, [[Elizabeth Henstridge]] and [[Iain De Caestecker]] were cast as Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz, respectively,<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> while newcomer [[Brett Dalton]] was cast as Grant Ward.<ref name=\"Dalton\"/> In December, Chloe Bennet was chosen out of more than 400 actresses to play Skye, the sixth and final regular for the first season;<ref name=\"Dec2012Bennet\" /><ref name=\"Skye400\" /> the character is revealed in the second season to be [[Daisy Johnson]], and no longer goes by \"Skye\" starting with the third.<ref name=\"SDCC2015\" />\n\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2014, [[Nick Blood]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Lance Hunter]] for the second season, while the character of [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]] was revealed to be appearing.<ref name=\"Blood\" /> That August, [[Henry Simmons]] joined the cast as [[Al MacKenzie|Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie]], a recurring role,<ref name=\"Simmons\" /> and [[Adrianne Palicki]] was cast as Morse in a guest role, to first appear in the episode \"[[A Hen in the Wolf House]]\".<ref name=\"Palicki\" /> The next month, the entire first season principal cast were confirmed to be regulars for the second season, along with Blood.<ref name=\"BloodPrincipal\" /> Palicki joined them with the episode \"[[Aftershocks (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Aftershocks]]\".<ref name=\"PalickiMainVariety\" /><ref name=\"PalickiMain\" /> In February 2015, [[Luke Mitchell]] was cast as Lincoln Campbell, a recurring role for the second half of the season.<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /><ref name=\"MitchellCharacter\" />\n\nAll season-two principal cast members returned for the third season,<ref name=\"SHIELDS3Returners\" /> with Simmons and Mitchell joining them, promoted from their recurring roles.<ref name=\"MitchellRegular\" /><ref name=\"SimmonsRegular\"/> In October 2015, the Inhuman [[Hive (comics)|Hive]] was introduced; for the second part of season three, he possesses the corpse of Grant Ward, again portrayed by Brett Dalton.<ref name=\"Hive\" /> Also introduced were [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]] and [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]], recurring as [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]] and [[Holden Radcliffe]], respectively.<ref name=\"Radcliffe\" /><ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyCast\" /> Blood and Palicki left the main cast following the season-three episode \"[[Parting Shot]]\", to star in the then-planned spin-off show ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]''.<ref name=\"BellPartingShot\" /> Dalton and Mitchell also left following the deaths of their characters in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"EWEPsMay2016\"/>\n\nGregg, Wen, Bennet, De Caestecker, Henstridge, and Simmons returned for the fourth and fifth seasons.<ref name=\"S4Premise\" /><ref name=\"S5Press\" /> They were joined by Hannah in the fourth,<ref name=\"HannahRegular\" /> with Cordova-Buckley once again recurring as Rodriguez in the season,<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyS4\" /> before being promoted to a series regular for the fifth season.<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyMain\" /> Dalton returned as a guest during the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Assistant costume designer Ann Foley took over for subsequent episodes, and worked closely with Tancharoen to create \"very strong, different characters\" whose \"looks evolve along with the show.\"<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> Foley also brought on concept artists Phillip Boutte Jr. and Josh Shaw to assist with the design process.<ref name=\"BoutteInterview\" /><ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> Foley watched every MCU film, paying special attention to ''The Avengers'', and was also inspired by such films as ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol]]''.<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> In October 2016, Foley said that she was specifically following the aesthetic of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', \"So any costume has to fit inside that world we've established and has to fit that tactical look.\"<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" /> On the variety of costumes created for each character, Foley preferred to have set pieces in the characters' \"closets\", as \"it's not a fashion show ... a guy like Ward isn't going to have twenty jackets in his closet. He is going to have one that he uses all of the time.\"<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" />\n\nAfter reading each script, Foley would do her own research, before discussing the look of the episode with the writers.<ref name=\"FoleyHiatus\" /> She then studied the comics, general fashion, and history to get a look that is recognizable to fans, but fits into the more realistic world of the series.<ref name=\"BoutteInterview\" /> Costumes are either custom made or bought, and the actors are brought in for fittings before filming. This process was often challenging because of the series' eight-day-per-episode schedule.<ref name=\"FoleyHiatus\" /> Foley stated that all costumes take a similar amount of time to create, whether they are based on the comics or not.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> Marvel CCO [[Joe Quesada]] is involved in the approval process when costuming preexisting characters,<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> including Daisy Johnson's Quake costume, which is introduced in the third season. The Quake costume incorporates elements from the comic version of the character, and was intended to show that Quake \"could easily be part of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\".<ref name=\"CostumeEvolution\" /><ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Foley took steps to differentiate the Quake costume from [[Scarlett Johansson]]'s [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Black Widow]] costumes from the films, but was \"flattered\" by comparisons made between them. Foley was also adamant about showing that characters such as Quake \"don't have to be sexualised, that they're powerful, strong women\", and so avoided \"a lot of cleavage, you don't see high heels. It's about practicality.\"<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" />\n\nThe costumes go through a natural evolution in the series. There is a shift at the end of the first season to a darker look, and all the characters have \"definitely grown up\" during the second season. In the third season there is another shift, \"from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to [a] more precise militaristic outfit\".<ref name=\"CostumeEvolution\" /> This change is also reflected in the series' color palette, going from \"a much lighter tone, much more patterns\" in the first season to having \"stripped away a bit of color\" by the third.<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" /> Despite this increasing darkness in the costumes, Foley intended to define each character as they are introduced and to have them always be recognizable and identifiable.<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> With the start of the fourth season, Foley said that \"each season definitely has its own feel and this season will be no different. I think that you're going to see some subtle differences in the costumes of the characters\"; she felt like Fitz and Simmons, in particular, had become \"more adult looking\", while all the cast had \"a pretty specific ... civilian look\" that would become more prominent as S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized and becomes more public.<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Foley left the series after the thirteenth episode of the fourth season, to work on a television adaptation of ''[[Altered Carbon]]'',<ref name=\"FoleyLeaves\" /> and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to \"blend in\" with Foley's established look.<ref name=\"ThisWeek58\" />\n\nFoley returned for the first two episodes of the fifth season, before handing costume design over to Whitney Galitz, who had assisted Foley on the previous few seasons, and Christann Chanell.<ref name=\"FoleyBack\" />\n\n====Practical effects====\nThe series' [[Theatrical property|props]] department is led by Scott Bauer. The pilot introduces the Incapacitating Cartridge Emitting Railgun, or ICER, tranquilizer weapons often used by the agents, with Joss Whedon having Bauer design \"sci-fi\"-looking guns, including a large rifle-like weapon. The series' further portrayal of the ICERs was more subtle, with Bauer using airsoft guns that are safe to shoot others with over a small distance. ICER-specific muzzle flashes are then added by the visual effects department. Bauer reused the ICER rifle prop when making Mack's \"Shotgun Ax\", which appears in later seasons. The [[Terrigen Mist|terrigen crystals]] that unlock Inhuman abilities in the series are 3D-printed from solid resin and then altered with extra details.<ref name=\"Props\" /> Additional practical effects and props are created by [[Legacy Effects]], who also work on the MCU films,<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /><ref name=\"LegacyEffectsFilms\" /> notably creating Daisy Johnson's gauntlets for the third season.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> [[Prosthetic makeup]] for the series is designed in conjunction with [[Glenn Hetrick]] of Optic Nerve Studios. Hetrick began work on the series with the second season, to create [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Raina|Raina]]'s Inhuman look,<ref name=\"RainaMakeUp\" /> and returned for the third season to design and create the more unusual-looking Inhumans such as [[Lash (comics)|Lash]].<ref name=\"HetrickLash\" />\n\n====Title sequence====\n[[File:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. title cards animation.gif|thumb|The title sequence for the series' 100th episode, \"The Real Deal\", featuring a montage of all title cards used throughout the series at that point]]\nThe third season introduces a new title sequence for the series, replacing the one that appeared in the first two seasons.<ref name=\"NewTitle\" /> The title sequence in \"[[4,722 Hours]]\" is drastically different from the design introduced for the third season, with the series' title in the episode's typeface silently fading onto the screen over the back drop of the planet Simmons is stranded on.<ref name=\"4722Title\" /><ref name=\"4722Title2\" /> The fourth season sees new series title cards for the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

(season 4)#LMD|LMD]]'' pods,<ref name=\"S4GRTitle\" /><ref name=\"S4LMDTitle\" /> and an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' title card for the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)#Agents of Hydra|Agents of Hydra]]'' pod that changes to say ''Agents of Hydra'' for episodes primarily set in the Framework.<ref name=\"HydraTitleCard\" /><ref name=\"FrameworkTitleCard\" /> The ''Ghost Rider'' graphic is used again for the fourth-season finale.<ref name=\"FinaleTitleCard\" /> For the fifth season, the opening of \"Orientation\" is reminiscent of the sequence for \"4,722 Hours\", forgoing the title card and having the typeface silently fading onto the screen.<ref name=\"OrientationOpening\" /> The subsequent episodes of season five feature a title card with the series name in a new typeface against a backdrop of various depictions of Earth: episodes through \"Past Life\" feature a destroyed future Earth;<ref name=\"S5Opening\" /> episodes from \"Principa\" through \"The Devil Complex\" feature a present Earth<!--can be seen at end of 100th episode card montage-->; while episodes from \"Rise and Shine\" through \"All Roads Lead...\" feature the Earth beginning to crack.<ref name=\"515Recap\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for the pilot took place almost entirely in [[Los Angeles]] to accommodate Joss Whedon's schedule,<ref name=\"Jan2013LeeInterview2\" /> while the rest of the series is primarily filmed in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> Additional filming has also taken place around the world, including in [[Paris]], France,<ref name=\"Oct2013Dalton\" /> [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"Oct2013Armand\" /> and [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" /> The series is filmed on [[Arri Alexa]] cameras,<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> with [[David Boyd (cinematographer)|David Boyd]] serving as [[director of photography]] on the pilot,<ref name=\"BoydDoP\" /> and Feliks Parnell, Jeff Mygatt, and Allan Westbrook doing so throughout the rest of the series.<!-- From the episode credits, unless a separate reliable source can be found --> Garry Brown is the second unit director for the series, with stunts coordinated by Tanner Gill.<ref name=\"302BTS\" /> The series is filmed in [[2K resolution]].<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFuseFX serves as the lead visual effects vendor for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> with additional work by [[Pixomondo]], Cosa, Greenhaus GFX, Lion VFX, and Synaptic.<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> The series sees an average of 80 to 150 visual effects shots per episode,<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" /> with 10 to 12 days to work on the effects for one episode once background plates have been received from filming.<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> This equates to approximately 2000 visual effects shots per season.<ref name=\"PostVFX\" />  Mark Kolpack serves as visual effects supervisor for the series.<ref name=\"VFX1\" /> David Altenau was the in-house supervisor at FuseFX for \"Pilot\" through episode eight, with Kevin Lingenfelser taking over for subsequent episodes.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> VFX producer Andrea D'Amico joined the team at FuseFX to work on the series in December 2015.<ref name=\"DAmico\" /> Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, and producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had to be worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> Typical effects for the series include the creation of character-driving effects animation, photo-realistic vehicles, CG set extensions, pyrotechnics, and atmospheric effects.<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> Some assets, such as a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]] and [[Helicarrier]], are shared from [[Industrial Light & Magic]], though \"those models are generally super heavy and dense with data\" and need to be made \"HD friendly or simply manageable to work in [a] TV schedule.\"<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Bear McCreary]] confirmed that he would compose music for the series in July 2013.<ref name=\"McCreary\"/> Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to work with a full symphonic orchestra,<ref name=\"McCrearyDoG\" /> typically featuring 50 or 70 players,<ref name=\"McCrearyMaveth\" /> with over 90 for \"important\" episodes.<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score \"a modern edge\".<ref name=\"McCrearyPilot\" /> Since ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was \"a sense that it had to connect\" to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens.<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode.<ref name=\"McCrearyS3\" /> Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound\u2014\"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" but also \"intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people.\" McCreary had to work harder to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence.<ref name=\"McCrearyDoG\" /> By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted \"the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... [E]lectronics really moved to the forefront as we got into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" />\n\nIn September 2014, McCreary announced that there were plans for an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' soundtrack,<ref name=\"McCrearySoundtrackPlans\" /> which was released digitally a year later by [[Marvel Music]] on September 4, 2015, and on CD on October 9.

He stated that \"ABC and Marvel both want the series to be able to make sense on its own\", but that it was beneficial for the films to have the series fill in any \"gaps\" for them, due to having to be \"big\" and moving \"quickly through a lot of huge pieces\", unlike television which has time to deal with more nuances.<ref name=\"BellPasteSep2015\" />\n\nIn January 2016, Joss Whedon noted that this process \"unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers.\" He stated that, for example, the series' creative team initially wanted to use [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]'s scepter from ''The Avengers'' but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in ''Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"JossScepter\" /> On how their ability to connect with the films changed over the life of the series, Jed Whedon said, \"The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open.\" He added, \"We have relatively free rein [in what the series can introduce and connect to]; we just can't go anywhere that [the films are] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told \"no\" that much\". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as \"something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2017\" />\n\nThe series mimics the films' [[post credits scene]]s with 'end tags', starting with the episode \"[[0-8-4]]\" which features a [[Samuel L. Jackson]] cameo. Bell explained, \"Sometimes it'll be funny, sometimes it'll be a mythology thing ... or an extra little reveal about\" the episode.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> The end tag for \"[[End of the Beginning (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|End of the Beginning]]\" is a \"directly lifted\" scene from ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"WinterSoldierTag\" />\n\nThe series' first major tie-in episode with the wider MCU was \"[[The Well (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Well]]\", which begins immediately after ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.<ref name=\"ThorTDWCrossover\" /> The episodes \"End of the Beginning\" and \"[[Turn, Turn, Turn (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Turn, Turn, Turn]]\" revolve around the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'',<ref name=\"HitfixPg1\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSCrossover\"/> which led to a retooling of the series.<ref name=\"USATodayHYDRA\" /> Flashback sequences in \"[[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Shadows]]\" and \"[[The Things We Bury]]\" featuring [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]] served as marketing and set-up for the ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' television series.<ref name=\"ACcrossover\" /><ref name=\"Ep8Synopsis\" /> The events of \"[[The Frenemy of My Enemy]]\" and \"[[The Dirty Half Dozen]]\" led up to the opening sequence of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', while \"[[Scars (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Scars]]\" deals with the aftermath of that film.<ref name=\"AoUTieIn\" /> The third season follows similar themes to the film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', focusing on powered people and the different responses to them,<ref name=\"CWThemes\" /> leading up to the episode \"[[Emancipation (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Emancipation]]\", which takes place after the film and shows how its events affect the series' powered characters.<ref name=\"CWTieIn\" />\n\nThe episode \"[[T.A.H.I.T.I.]]\" introduces the [[Kree]] alien race to the MCU, members of which play a significant role in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref name=\"BennetKree\" /><ref name=\"BennetBellKree\" /> This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU,<ref name=\"Daisy\" /> with Jed Whedon saying that it was something \"in the works\" for a long time, as [[Marvel Studios]] had plans for an ''[[Inhumans (film)|Inhumans]]'' film, and this would be \"one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film.\"<ref name=\"CBRDec2014\" /> The third season introduces the concept of the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]], with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name,<ref name=\"S3SecretWarriors\" /><ref name=\"VarietySecretWarriors\" /> while also [[retcon]]ning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline.<ref name=\"HydraRetcon\" /> Gregg noted in January 2016 that the \"writer and director [of the ''Inhumans'' film] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that.\"<ref name=\"GreggInhumansFilm\" /> When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had \"a little more freedom\" and were \"able to do a little bit more\" with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the \"classic\" Inhumans.<ref name=\"ClassicInhumans\" /> ''Marvel's Inhumans'', a television series centered on [[Black Bolt]] and other members of the [[List of Inhumans#Inhuman Royal Family|Inhuman Royal Family]], was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017.<ref name=\"InhumansSeries\" /> It was not intended to be a spin-off of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansSeries2\" />\n\nThe fourth season explores the concept of Life Model Decoys,<ref name=\"LMD\" /> which were first referenced in ''The Avengers'',<ref name=\"LMDAvengers\" /> and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU.<ref name=\"S4Premise\" /> On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously did not want to explore the concept before the release of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', which sees the introductions of [[Ultron]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] in a similar manner to LMDs.<ref name=\"VarietyEPsMay2016\" /> On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that \"with ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' coming out this year, the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe is moving into new waters,\" referring to the exploration of magic. \"We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift.\"<ref name=\"GhostRiderEW\" /> The season also continues storylines from the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]] of ''Agent Carter'', with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]], a mainstay of the MCU.<ref name=\"IsodyneConnection\" /> The last four episodes of season five take place over a single day, and coincide with the events of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"S5IWConnections\" /> In August 2017, [[Emily VanCamp]] said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of [[Sharon Carter]] for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series

account having over 46,000 followers and its official [[Facebook]] page having close to half a million likes.<ref name=\"SocialMedia\" /> Many cast and crew members \"live tweet\" each episode, with [[J. August Richards]] noting that this brings instant feedback from viewers, and allows the crew to \"watch the audience take that journey\" in real time.<ref name=\"RichardsCollider\" />\n\nFor the final six episodes of the first season, Marvel began the \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)#\"The Art of Level Seven\"|''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Art of Level Seven]]\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative was a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the first season. The production team tried to pair specific artists to the teaser posters based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode.<ref name=\"ArtLevelSeven\" /> For the second season, the series returned as \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)#\"The Art of Evolution\"|The Art of Evolution]]\", with an image for each of the final twelve episodes of the season.<ref name=\"ArtEvolution\" /> For season five, Marvel revived their marketing art program, with \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The web series follows a newly hired ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' production assistant, who acts as a [[double agent]] for the \"Mastermind\", portrayed by [[Stan Lee]]. Cast and crew members from the series, such as Gregg, also appear, with viewers having the ability to vote in an online poll after each episode to guess where the double agent would go in the next episode; votes entered viewers in a drawing to win prizes from the set of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"DoubleAgent\" /><ref name=\"StanLeeMastermind\" /> ''Double Agent'' was nominated for Outstanding Digital Series at the 27th [[Producers Guild Awards]].<ref name=\"DoubleAgentPGA\" /> Another Lexus-sponsored five-part web series, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Academy'', released from March 9 to May 4, 2016. In ''Academy'', three ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' fans compete to play an agent in that series. Members of the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' cast also appear.<ref name=\"Academy\" /> All three fans ultimately made cameo appearances in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"AcademyResult\" />\n\nThe series has been promoted with various subtitles at different times, including ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Uprising'' in season one, leading up to the ''Winter Soldier'' crossover;<ref name=\"Uprising\" /> ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Fallen Agent'' for the end of the third season;<ref name=\"FallenAgent\" /> ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Ghost Rider'' for the first \"pod\" of season four;<ref name=\"GhostRiderSubtitle\" /> and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: LMD'' for the second \"pod\" of season four.<ref name=\"LMDSlingshot\" /> The third \"pod\" of season four was known as ''Agents of Hydra''.<ref name=\"AgentsOfHydra\" />\n\n==Release==\n\n===Broadcast===\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' airs in the United States on ABC,<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\" /> in [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] and [[5.1 surround sound]],<ref name=\"PilotSynopsis\" /> despite delivering the episodes to ABC in [[1080p]].<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" /> The first season aired on Tuesdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm EST for the first season,<ref name=\"S1Timeslot\" /> and starting with the second season, the series aired on Tuesdays at 9{{nbsp}}pm EST,<ref name=\"S2Timeslot\" /> before moving to the 10{{nbsp}}pm time slot on Tuesdays for the fourth season.<ref name=\"S4Timeslot\" /> For its fifth season, the series aired on Fridays at 9{{nbsp}}pm EST,<ref name=\"S5Timeslot\" /> on Fridays at 8{{nbsp}}pm EST for season six,<ref name=\"S6Timeslot\" /> and will air at 10{{nbsp}}pm EST on Wednesdays for season seven.<ref name=\"S7PremiereDate\" />\n\nThe second and third seasons of the series were broadcast in two blocks each, with a season of ''Agent Carter'' airing in between. Bell explained that this decision was made following the challenge of producing 22 episodes for the first season to be aired over 36\u201340 weeks, which meant having repeats and \"losing momentum\". Instead, ''Agent Carter'' took up much of that gap in a row, leaving the back half of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s season to run uninterrupted.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> This format allowed the producers and writers to approach each season in two parts, each with distinct stories connected by carried-over elements.<ref name=\"TwoArcSeasons\" /> Ahead of the fourth season, Tancharoen explained, \"For the past two seasons, we've been able to break our season down into two little mini-seasons because of the airdate schedule. This upcoming season, our airdate schedule is a little different, so we're breaking it into three pods. Story wise, the development of that has made our lives easier, to break it down in that way.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> The pod format was described as \"7-10 episodes [that feature] little 'enclosed plotlines' that formed a larger whole.\"<ref name=\"PodDescription\" />\n\nRegarding whether they would break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, \"A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold on to. By breaking it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it's something the viewers enjoy, and it makes it a little easier to digest when you're telling some of these stories.\" Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be \"broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back to back, it feels weird to start calling it different things...

It also enjoyed DVR recordings that, according to ''[[TV Guide]]'', were \"through the roof\".<ref name=\"TVGuideNov2013\" />\n\nIn March 2016, Alisha Grauso of ''[[Forbes]]'' discussed the series and its ratings, describing the show as having \"never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be...It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within the continuity of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even harder to do it with a full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the larger world while still being its own thing.\" Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel-Netflix shows]]) or on just being \"support and tie-in to the world of the Avengers\". Grauso concluded, \"The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world.\"<ref name=\"RatingsMar2016Pg1\" /><ref name=\"RatingsMar2016Pg2\" />\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' saw the season five episode \"All Roads Lead...\" earn a series low rating of 0.4/2 in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, as well as the lowest initial viewers with 1.67 million.<ref name=\"518Ratings\" /> In November 2018, Parrot Analytics, which measures \"how viewers interact with a TV show's brand online, assessing everything from global file-sharing and peer-to-peer traffic to social media activity\", ranked ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in the top 0.03 percent of in-demand television series worldwide, classify it as \"Amazing\". Series with similar demand included ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', and ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', while ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' had higher demand than series such as ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Fear The Walking Dead]]''.<ref name=\"ParrotDataNov2018\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; float:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#F77F00;\"|\n| [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' swings for the fences with large-scale storytelling and wild twists that elevate season 5 from the saturated MCU and into its own space\".<ref name=\"AoSS5RT\"/>\n\nThe sixth season has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.7/10 based on 15 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Six seasons in and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' continues to deepen its exploration of space and the relationships between its heroes.\"<ref name=\"AoSS6RT\"/>\n\n===Analysis===\nThe way that the series is affected by the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' has been called \"miraculous\",<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" /><ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" /> with Terri Schwartz at [[Zap2it]] writing \"the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven\",<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" /> while Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' \"faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"<ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" /> The fact that the series also depicts the rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the MCU has also been highlighted, with Merrill Barr, reviewing \"[[Beginning of the End (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Beginning of the End]]\" for ''Forbes'', saying \"what Marvel's daring to say with this season finale is 'everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.'\"<ref name=\"ForbesSeasonReview\" />\n\nThe series' introduction of the Inhumans was seen by Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as making ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' an essential part of the MCU and Marvel Studios' plans, with the connections between the series and the films previously having always been reactive on the series' behalf, with \"stuff\" happening in the films, and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' dealing with the fallout of it. However, the series would now be \"making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU\".<ref name=\"SavaAnalysis\" /> Barr wrote that the series \"does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame [of the second season finale], all anyone\u2014Marvel fan or otherwise\u2014will be asking is when season three begins.\"<ref name=\"BarrAnalysis\" />\n\nThe third season's paralleling of themes from ''Captain America: Civil War'' was called \"topical and relevant\" and \"downright eerie\" by ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Alex McCown and [[Screen Crush]]'s Kevin Fitzpatrick. McCown compared the series' approach to setting up \"a world distrustful of superpowers\" to the real life events surrounding [[Cliven Bundy]] and [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], and said that \"''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is taking full advantage of its medium in order to tell the story the upcoming Captain America film can't: A full and fraught exploration of the need to protect freedom and privacy, even for those with extraordinary abilities.\" Fitzpatrick added that this \"topical bent...made for a great angle to build up that world mentality without feeling particularly subservient to the movies.\"<ref name=\"McCownAnalysis\" /><ref name=\"FitzpatrickAnalysis\" />\n\nAhead of the fourth season, [[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Kayti Burt opined that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is \"the X-Men TV show you should be watching\". Burt noted that the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film franchise]] was expanding to television with the series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', but that ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' already served that purpose well, highlighting the similarities between the X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of super-powered people who \"are our neighbors and our friends ... both heroes and villains\", and face \"the same fears and prejudices\" from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between ''S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s Inhumans and the X-Men became \"particularly pointed\" in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executed the storyline \"much better\" than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series' diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the [[Gifted (comics)|mutant cure storyline]], the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it \"not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. I appreciate that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most ''X-Men''-like quality.\" Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to [[20th Century Fox]] holding the rights, \"we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through ''S.H.I.E.L.D.''\"<ref name=\"XMenAnalysis\" />\n\nAdditionally, Marc N. Kleinheinz at Screen Rant discussed how the series \"continues to resist a status quo\", from the destruction and rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D., to the fallout from the Sokovia Accords. He noted that a major driving force behind the changes was the MCU films, with the series being forced \"to constantly adapt to a changing narrative landscape that it has absolutely no control over.\" He also believed that the series was obligated to adapt various Marvel characters to screen which would not be appearing in films, such as Daisy Johnson, Mockingbird, and Ghost Rider. However, Kleinheinz felt that this mindset also came from within the series crew rather than just from Marvel, saying, \"there's also the storytelling modus operandi that showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have very obviously demonstrated during their four-year tenure. It seems that constantly staking out new ground from season to season is just as much a personal predilection as it is, possibly, a corporate mandate.\"<ref name=\"StatusQuoAnalysis\" />\n\nDuring the ''Agents of Hydra'' pod in the fourth season, Collider.com's Evan Valentine noted how \"[o]ne of the prevalent themes of this latter half of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s fourth season has been its jabs at the current [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]... When all's said and done, whether you support or disavow the current administration and what it's done with its time in office, does this commentary work here? Sure it does... We need to be able to laugh at what's going on in the world, regardless of whether we agree or disagree, but ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has managed to throw in some biting commentary this season.\"<ref name=\"Collider419Review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''[[The Atlantic]]'' named \"[[4,722 Hours]]\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.<ref name=\"AtlanticBest2015\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Groome rebuilt the house on its original foundation, but reduced it from three to two stories. / When Dr. Head purchased Airlie Farm in 1956, he laid down the foundation for the course of the structure for the next 50 years. Dr. Head had a vision of creating one of the first conference facilities of its kind in the country. He wanted a place where individuals and organizations could meet in a distraction-free, neutral environment to openly exchange ideas and share opinions on important matters of the day. The purpose, of course, was to ignite thought and inspire collective action. / The development of Dr. Head's vision was a success. He integrated modern meeting facilities and accommodations with the lush, natural setting of the Airlie estate. In 1961, [[Airlie Center]] opened its doors and Life Magazine declared it an innovative \"Island of Thought.\" / With this innovative platform, Dr. Head initiated a variety of programs dedicated to education, environmental research, public health, and social progress. During the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Head established [[Airlie Center]] as a safe zone for dialogue.

A minigame contains different [[gameplay]] elements than the main game, may be optional, and is often smaller or more simplistic than the game in which it is contained. Minigames are sometimes also offered separately for free to promote the main game. Some minigames can also be [[bonus stage]]s or [[secret level]]s.\n\n== Features ==\nMinigames occur variously as [[gameplay]] features, or as time fillers while levels are loading, or as [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] even in non video games e.g. a DOOM-like game or a flight simulator in different versions of [[Microsoft Excel]]. In the latter case, they are often called \"''secret games''\". In the former case, the successful completion of such minigames may or may not be required to finish the encompassing game. They are often included as extra content to use once the main storyline is completed.

Some similar games, such as [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, are considered [[party game]]s, specifically developed for [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]. In party games, minigames usually involve performing an activity faster or collecting more of a specified item than other players to win.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notable examples ==\n''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' games have many minigames in each game, often having prizes such as Pieces of Heart (increasing Link's health), Rupees (the games' currency), and upgrades ([[quiver]], [[wallet]], etc.)\n\nThe ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series is notable for featuring minigames in every entry of the series, ever since the first ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' (1987), in which a [[sliding puzzle]] in the form of an Easter egg can be unlocked while boarding the ship.

Later in the series, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) was the first video game to include within it at least thirty minigames, which remains the largest number of minigames for a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]]. The [[PC game]] ''[[Chronomaster]]'' featured similar puzzle minigames which were crucial to the plot.\n\nThe early ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games on the Sega Genesis had minigame bonus/special stages, such as bouncing around a maze searching for a special gem, or collecting gold rings while running down a tube, and stray from standard gameplay. ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'', for example, has a special stage in which Sonic must run around trying to touch all the blue spheres, while avoiding red ones, and interacting with other spheres, who have special properties. This bonus stage actually became its own game. By inserting the original Sonic 1 (or [[Sonic Classics|''Sonic Classics 3 in 1'']]) cartridge into the ''[[Sonic and Knuckles]]'' lock-on slot, you can then press A, B, and C, then enter any given password to play the special stage corresponding to that password, which plays exactly like those of ''Sonic 3''.\n\nLike above, some minigames become so popular that they are eventually published as individual titles by themselves. Notable examples are ''[[Geometry Wars]]'', which was originally a minigame in ''[[Project Gotham Racing 2]]'', and [[Arcomage]], a relatively complex minigame, reminiscent of ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', first introduced in ''[[Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor]]''.\n\nThe [[PocketStation]] (for [[Sony PlayStation]]) and [[VMU]] (for [[Dreamcast]]) accessories allowed the user to download minigames from the main console onto the pocket device, and often then sync progress in the minigame back on to the console. Two examples of this include the ''[[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Minigames|Chocobo World]]'' minigame inside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''<ref>[http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html FFVIII PocketStation Opens Up Chocobo World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213256/http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html |date=2012-03-21 }}, ''IGN'', July 15, 1999</ref> (which is also playable on PC), and 'Chao Adventure', a minigame in ''[[Sonic Adventure]]''.\n\nThe tabletop game ''[[Mansions of Madness]]'' also features minigames in the form of simple puzzles.\n\n''[[Capcom]]'s'' ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series features two minigames as bonus stages in ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Street Fighter III]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', after winning matches.\n\n== List of minigames ==\n\n=== [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|Fifth generation]] ===\n\n==== [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] ====\n* ''[[Ape Escape (video game)|Ape Escape]]'': Galaxy Monkey (a shoot 'em up), Ski Kidz Racing & Specter Boxing.\n* ''[[Crash Bash]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Digimon World]]'': Collecting cards, as well as some minigames in shops.\n*''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'': Triple Triad (card collection and battle game)\n* ''[[Legend of Legaia]]'': Baka Fighter, Coliseum, Fishing, Sol Fever Disco and Slot Machines.\n* ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'': Some Virtual Reality missions can be played.\n** ''[[Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions]]'': This '''compilation''' features over 300 missions.\n* ''[[Syphon Filter 3#Minigames|Syphon Filter 3]]'': Assassinate, Eliminate, Demolition, Thief, Biathlon.\n* ''[[Suikoden]]'': Cups Game and Matching Cards.\n* ''[[Suikoden II]]'': Chinchirorin, Dancing Stage, Cooking, Fishing, Rope Climbing and Whack a Mole. \n* ''[[Tekken (video game)|Tekken]]'': ''[[Galaga]]''.\n* ''[[Tekken 3]]'': Tekken Force, Tekken Ball.\n\n==== [[Nintendo 64]] ====\n* ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'': Included a variant of the original ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' arcade game.\n* ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'': Three minigames: 100-Yard Hop, Bumper Crop Bump, Checker Board Chase.\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'': Balloon Battle\n* ''[[Mario Party (video game)|Mario Party]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Mario Party 2]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Mario Party 3]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium]]'': Nine minigames through Kids Club: Clefairy Says, Dig!

A minigame contains different [[gameplay]] elements than the main game, may be optional, and is often smaller or more simplistic than the game in which it is contained. Minigames are sometimes also offered separately for free to promote the main game. Some minigames can also be [[bonus stage]]s or [[secret level]]s.\n\n== Features ==\nMinigames occur variously as [[gameplay]] features, or as time fillers while levels are loading, or as [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] even in non video games e.g. a DOOM-like game or a flight simulator in different versions of [[Microsoft Excel]]. In the latter case, they are often called \"''secret games''\". In the former case, the successful completion of such minigames may or may not be required to finish the encompassing game. They are often included as extra content to use once the main storyline is completed.

Two examples of this include the ''[[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Minigames|Chocobo World]]'' minigame inside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''<ref>[http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html FFVIII PocketStation Opens Up Chocobo World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213256/http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html |date=2012-03-21 }}, ''IGN'', July 15, 1999</ref> (which is also playable on PC), and 'Chao Adventure', a minigame in ''[[Sonic Adventure]]''.\n\nThe tabletop game ''[[Mansions of Madness]]'' also features minigames in the form of simple puzzles.\n\n''[[Capcom]]'s'' ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series features two minigames as bonus stages in ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Street Fighter III]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', after winning matches.\n\n== List of minigames ==\n\n=== [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|Fifth generation]] ===\n\n==== [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] ====\n* ''[[Ape Escape (video game)|Ape Escape]]'': Galaxy Monkey (a shoot 'em up), Ski Kidz Racing & Specter Boxing.\n* ''[[Crash Bash]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Digimon World]]'': Collecting cards, as well as some minigames in shops.\n*''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'': Triple Triad (card collection and battle game)\n* ''[[Legend of Legaia]]'': Baka Fighter, Coliseum, Fishing, Sol Fever Disco and Slot Machines.\n* ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'': Some Virtual Reality missions can be played.\n** ''[[Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions]]'': This '''compilation''' features over 300 missions.\n* ''[[Syphon Filter 3#Minigames|Syphon Filter 3]]'': Assassinate, Eliminate, Demolition, Thief, Biathlon.\n* ''[[Suikoden]]'': Cups Game and Matching Cards.\n* ''[[Suikoden II]]'': Chinchirorin, Dancing Stage, Cooking, Fishing, Rope Climbing and Whack a Mole. \n* ''[[Tekken (video game)|Tekken]]'': ''[[Galaga]]''.\n* ''[[Tekken 3]]'': Tekken Force, Tekken Ball.\n\n==== [[Nintendo 64]] ====\n* ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'': Included a variant of the original ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' arcade game.\n* ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'': Three minigames: 100-Yard Hop, Bumper Crop Bump, Checker Board Chase.\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'': Balloon Battle\n* ''[[Mario Party (video game)|Mario Party]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Mario Party 2]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Mario Party 3]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium]]'': Nine minigames through Kids Club: Clefairy Says, Dig!

It is 91&nbsp;km north of [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], on State Highway 35, and close to [[Mount Hikurangi (Gisborne)|Mount Hikurangi]]. The district was originally known as Toka-a-Namu, which refers to the abundance of sandflies. Over the years the name was altered to Tokomaru Bay.\n\nThe two hapu or sub-tribes that reside in Tokomaru Bay are [[Te Wh\u0101nau a Ruataupare ki Tokomaru|Te Whanau a Ruataupare]] and [[Te Wh\u0101nau a Te Aotawarirangi]]. The ancestral mountain of Tokomaru Bay is Marotiri. The ancestral river is Mangahauini.\n\n==History and culture==\n\nThe seven-kilometre wide bay is small but sheltered, and was a calling place for passenger ships until the early 20th century. [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] spent time here on his 1769 journey of discovery, and later European settlement included a [[whaling]] station. A visit by Missionaries Williams, Colenso, Matthews and Stack heralded the coming of Christianity to the district in 1838 and their crusade proved very successful with the local people.\n\nThe area around the bay has long been a Maori stronghold.

It is 91&nbsp;km north of [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], on State Highway 35, and close to [[Mount Hikurangi (Gisborne)|Mount Hikurangi]]. The district was originally known as Toka-a-Namu, which refers to the abundance of sandflies. Over the years the name was altered to Tokomaru Bay.\n\nThe two hapu or sub-tribes that reside in Tokomaru Bay are [[Te Wh\u0101nau a Ruataupare ki Tokomaru|Te Whanau a Ruataupare]] and [[Te Wh\u0101nau a Te Aotawarirangi]]. The ancestral mountain of Tokomaru Bay is Marotiri. The ancestral river is Mangahauini.\n\n==History and culture==\n\nThe seven-kilometre wide bay is small but sheltered, and was a calling place for passenger ships until the early 20th century. [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] spent time here on his 1769 journey of discovery, and later European settlement included a [[whaling]] station. A visit by Missionaries Williams, Colenso, Matthews and Stack heralded the coming of Christianity to the district in 1838 and their crusade proved very successful with the local people.\n\nThe area around the bay has long been a Maori stronghold. The nearby [[Pa (Maori)|p\u0101]] at Te Mawhai was refortified by [[Henare Potae]] in the 1860s\nduring the battles between the [[Ngati Porou]] and the warriors that followed the [[Pai M\u0101rire]] movement (commonly known as Hauhau).<ref name=\"ECO117\">{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |title= The New Zealand Wars: A History Of The Maori Campaigns And The Pioneering Period: Volume II: The Hauhau Wars, (1864\u201372)|url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c11.html#name-100550-mention |format= |accessdate=  |year=1939|publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (NZETC)|location= |language= |isbn=|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=|pages=117-122|chapter=|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}</ref><ref name=\"FWW202\">{{cite book |last1= Williams |first1= Frederic Wanklyn |authorlink1= |title= Through Ninety Years, 1826\u20131916: Life and Work Among the Maoris in New Zealand: Notes of the Lives of William and William Leonard Williams, First and Third Bishops of Waiapu |url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WilThro-t1-body-d22.html|format= |accessdate=  |year=1939|publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (NZETC)|location= |language= |isbn=|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=202|pages=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}</ref> \n\nThe town's modern economy is mainly based on [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], with some [[tourism]].
