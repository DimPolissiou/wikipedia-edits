The trio \"mainly jammed a few Cream songs and a few 12-bar blues\". Downing played guitar with the band after winning a coin toss with Badhams \"in his bedroom to see who would play guitar or bass\".<ref name=\"guitarhoo\"/>\n\nPrior to joining Judas Priest, Downing attended catering college and worked as trainee chef at the Lyttelton Arms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelytteltonarms.co.uk/content/pcdg/east-and-west-midlands/thelytteltonarms|title=The Lyttelton Arms Pub & Restaurant in Hagley, West Midlands|website=The Lyttelton Arms|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref> in [[Hagley]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Matt Cooper and Dave Tindall |url=http://www.golf365.co.za/features_story/0,17923,9787_5671418,00.html |title=interview with KK Downing |publisher=Golf365 |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=2014-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518225600/http://www.golf365.co.za/features_story/0,17923,9787_5671418,00.html |archivedate=18 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Playing style and technique==\n[[File:K. K. Downing 1980.jpg|thumb|left|upright|K. K. Downing in 1980]]\nDowning has an aggressive, rock-influenced guitar style featuring solos and dual leads with fellow Judas Priest guitarist [[Glenn Tipton]].<ref>[http://members.firstinter.net/markster/PROFILE2.html Judas Priest Info Pages \u2013 K.K. \u2013 Glenn Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914102903/http://members.firstinter.net/markster/PROFILE2.html |date=14 September 2008 }}</ref> His solos remained of this style for most of his career, but he incorporated various techniques into his playing over the years. As opposed to Tipton, his solos tended to incorporate a more raw, rough-edged sound, making use of techniques such as [[pinch harmonic]]s, [[dive bomb]]s, and [[Alternate picking|tremolo picking]], and often focusing on speed, technical accuracy and melody. From ''[[Stained Class]]'' onward, Tipton became increasingly dominant in Judas Priest's songwriting, particularly on the more commercial tracks while Downing's role in the band started to diminish, especially as Tipton's songs comprised the vast majority of the band's live setlists after 1980. In 1978, Tipton began to incorporate the [[tapping]] technique into his playing, which Downing began to use as well. By 1990, both Tipton and Downing started to use the complex technique of [[sweep-picking]], which can be notably heard on the [[Painkiller (Judas Priest song)|title track]] of their 1990 album ''[[Painkiller (Judas Priest album)|Painkiller]]''. They have continuously used these techniques ever since.\n\nIn Judas Priest's early years, Downing made common use of the [[wah-wah pedal]], but began to limit his use of it in the late 1970s. He had abandoned the use of it by the mid-1980s, but saved it only for live performances of the songs that originally featured it. The only time since then that he began to use it again was in 1996, when vocalist [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]] joined the band, and they began to experiment with their music more than before. One of these experimentations was the renewal of [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] in Downing's playing, which can be heard on their 1997 album ''[[Jugulator]]''. This experimentation was taken further on the 2001 album ''[[Demolition (Judas Priest album)|Demolition]]'', but was abandoned once more when the band's former vocalist, [[Rob Halford]], returned to the band in 2003. However, Downing used a wah-wah pedal on his last few tours with the band.\n\n==Leaving Judas Priest==\n[[File:K. K. Downing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|K. K.

Local residents expressed concerns about the impact of the development on the nature of [[Eardington]] and added traffic on small nearby roads. The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] expressed their own worries of the work on the nearby [[Dudmaston Hall]], but Shropshire Council's planning team decided that there were no grounds on which the development should be refused. Case Officer Richard Fortune said that the report recommending the application was approved, and that the extra traffic on the [[B roads in Zone 4 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|B4555]] would be acceptable. He also noted that it would not generate a significant amount of trips compared to the already existing number of vehicles travelling along the highway. Fortune also said that Shropshire Council as highway authority \"would need to demonstrate that the B4555 and surrounding highway network do not have the capacity to support a development of this nature. It is not considered a highway objection could be sustained on this basis.\" The impact of the volume of traffic on some junctions in [[Bridgnorth]], most notably B4555/B4363 and Oldbury Road/Hollybush Road, have raised concerns. The report backing from the council's economic team claimed that the development could bring as much as \u00a315 million ($19 million) of investment into the county. In a statement released from FCFM Group Limited in December 2018, they said that when they announced the plans at the time, they claimed that the development could be worth more than \u00a33.5 million ($4.6 million) a year to the local economy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/property/2019/03/06/astbury-hall-50m-plan-set-for-approval-at-kk-downings-old-stately-home/|title=Astbury Hall: \u00a350m plan set for approval at KK Downing's old stately home|author=Robertson, Dominic|newspaper=[[Express & Star]]|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition and honours==\nDowning was ranked 23 on rock magazine ''Hit Parader''{{'}}s list of 100 greatest metal guitarists.\n\n==Gear==\n* 1964 [[Gibson Flying V]] Limited Edition with Gibson PAF pickups (one out of 200)\n* 1970 Gibson Flying V with Maestro vibrato bar (number 233 out of 500)\n* 1969 [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Stratocaster (White) with left-handed neck\n* 1965 Fender Stratocaster (Sunburst)\n* Custom [[Hamer Guitars|Hamer]] Vector, Vector KK and KK Mini V guitars\n** Hamer Flying V: Issued to KK during the World Vengeance Tour, Hamer would release the KK Downing Flying V for public sale in 1984, ending in 1985.

K. Downing 1980.jpg|thumb|left|upright|K. K. Downing in 1980]]\nDowning has an aggressive, rock-influenced guitar style featuring solos and dual leads with fellow Judas Priest guitarist [[Glenn Tipton]].<ref>[http://members.firstinter.net/markster/PROFILE2.html Judas Priest Info Pages \u2013 K.K. \u2013 Glenn Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914102903/http://members.firstinter.net/markster/PROFILE2.html |date=14 September 2008 }}</ref> His solos remained of this style for most of his career, but he incorporated various techniques into his playing over the years. As opposed to Tipton, his solos tended to incorporate a more raw, rough-edged sound, making use of techniques such as [[pinch harmonic]]s, [[dive bomb]]s, and [[Alternate picking|tremolo picking]], and often focusing on speed, technical accuracy and melody. From ''[[Stained Class]]'' onward, Tipton became increasingly dominant in Judas Priest's songwriting, particularly on the more commercial tracks while Downing's role in the band started to diminish, especially as Tipton's songs comprised the vast majority of the band's live setlists after 1980. In 1978, Tipton began to incorporate the [[tapping]] technique into his playing, which Downing began to use as well. By 1990, both Tipton and Downing started to use the complex technique of [[sweep-picking]], which can be notably heard on the [[Painkiller (Judas Priest song)|title track]] of their 1990 album ''[[Painkiller (Judas Priest album)|Painkiller]]''. They have continuously used these techniques ever since.\n\nIn Judas Priest's early years, Downing made common use of the [[wah-wah pedal]], but began to limit his use of it in the late 1970s. He had abandoned the use of it by the mid-1980s, but saved it only for live performances of the songs that originally featured it. The only time since then that he began to use it again was in 1996, when vocalist [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]] joined the band, and they began to experiment with their music more than before. One of these experimentations was the renewal of [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] in Downing's playing, which can be heard on their 1997 album ''[[Jugulator]]''. This experimentation was taken further on the 2001 album ''[[Demolition (Judas Priest album)|Demolition]]'', but was abandoned once more when the band's former vocalist, [[Rob Halford]], returned to the band in 2003. However, Downing used a wah-wah pedal on his last few tours with the band.\n\n==Leaving Judas Priest==\n[[File:K. K. Downing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|K. K.

Local residents expressed concerns about the impact of the development on the nature of [[Eardington]] and added traffic on small nearby roads. The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] expressed their own worries of the work on the nearby [[Dudmaston Hall]], but Shropshire Council's planning team decided that there were no grounds on which the development should be refused. Case Officer Richard Fortune said that the report recommending the application was approved, and that the extra traffic on the [[B roads in Zone 4 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|B4555]] would be acceptable. He also noted that it would not generate a significant amount of trips compared to the already existing number of vehicles travelling along the highway. Fortune also said that Shropshire Council as highway authority \"would need to demonstrate that the B4555 and surrounding highway network do not have the capacity to support a development of this nature.

These qualities were well-balanced in him and it produced an open and positive attitude to people and things which was characterized with exuberant good humor and respect. In 1923 his parents relocated to [[Oviedo]] and he accompanied them so that he could attend the Jesuit college of San Ignacio where he graduated in 1929.<ref name=SQPN/> On 26 April 1930 he began his architectural studies in [[Madrid]] though suspended it for a brief period of time in December 1930 after he had a bacterial infection. His mother - in April 1921 - took him to his maternal grandmother in Madrid to recover and he was there for a month. Once he recovered his father took him to [[Zaragoza]] in August 1921 to a church for him to be consecrated to the [[Mother of God]].\n\nOnce he graduated from high school in 1930 he sought a deeper commitment to [[Jesus Christ]] which began in 1930. As a graduation present, he spent his summer vacation with his uncle Leopoldo and his aunt Mar\u00eda who were the Duke and Duchess of [[Maqueda]] at their residence near [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]]. It marked the beginning of a deep and lasting friendship among them. At their encouragement he made his first contact that September with the [[Trappists]] of [[Due\u00f1as, Palencia|San Isidro de Due\u00f1as]] in [[Palencia]].<ref name=VC/> He was attracted to the silence and was attracted to the [[Gregorian chant]] such as the [[Salve Regina]] that was sung at [[Compline]]. On 15 April 1934 - having finished his [[architect]]ural studies he entered the order as a [[postulant]] and then became a [[novice]]; he was convinced that this was his true [[religious calling]].<ref name=HS/>\n\nHe suffered from a severe case of [[diabetes mellitus]] which developed four months after his entering the [[convent]] and was diagnosed on 26 May 1934. The saddened and perplexed novice was forced to rest at home for a few months before returning, which he did three successive times from 1935 through 1937 at the height of the [[Spanish Civil War]] (one occasion was from 29 September to 6 December 1936 and again from 7 February to 15 December 1937). He was called into the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)#Military|armed forces]] but was declared unfit for active service. On his final return to the convent - due to his medical condition - he was obliged to enter as a conventual oblate instead of as a [[monk]] taking the last place and living on the margins of the order; this circumstance revealed his intense vocational commitment.

The formal introduction to the cause came later on 15 January 1983 and the late Trappist became titled as a [[Servant of God]]. The [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] validated the informative process in [[Rome]] on 26 June 1987 and received the [[Positio]] dossier in 1987. Theologians approved this dossier on 12 May 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 11 July 1989. The confirmation of his [[heroic virtue]] on 7 September 1989 allowed for [[Pope John Paul II]] to sign a decree that titled him as [[Venerable]].\n\nThe process for a miracle took place in the location that it originated in and it received C.C.S. validation on 6 October 1989; a medical board approved it on 31 October 1991 as did the theologians on 4 March 1992 and the C.C.S. on 7 April 1992. John Paul II approved this miracle on 13 June 1992 and beatified the Trappist on 27 September 1992 in [[Saint Peter's Square]]. The process for another miracle opened in Madrid and spanned from 9 April 2005 to 7 May 2006 before its validation on 30 November 2006. Medical experts assented to this on 13 March 2008 as well as theologians on 7 June 2008 and the C.C.S. members on 4 November 2008. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] approved this miracle on 6 December 2008 and formalized the date for the sainthood celebration in a consistory on 21 February 2009. Benedict XVI canonized him on 11 October 2009.\n\n===Canonization miracle===\nThe miracle that led to the canonization was the January 2001 healing of Bego\u00f1a Alonso Leon in Madrid. She was 30 and in the fifth month of being pregnant with her daughter Laura and began to feel severe contractions and headaches as well as signs of [[eclampsia]]. On 25 December 2000 - [[Christmas]] - she was admitted at seven months into a Madrid hospital due to the symptoms worsening and after an [[ultrasound]] was directed to the surgical theatre for a [[cesarean section]]. Her daughter was born in good health but Leon's condition worsened and she was in the [[intensive care unit]] for over two weeks. Her rapid healing after this was attributed to the late Trappist whom she appealed to during her illness.\n\n==See also==\n* [[:es:Monasterio de San Isidro de Due\u00f1as|Abbey of San Isidro de Due\u00f1as at Spanish Wikipedia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://newsaints.faithweb.com/year/1938.htm Hagiography Circle]\n* [http://catholicsaints.info/saint-rafael-arnaiz-baron/ Saints SQPN]\n* [https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=42953236 Find a Grave]\n\n{{Portal bar|Saints|Catholicism|Biography|Spain}}\n{{Canonization}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arn\u00e1iz Bar\u00f3n, Rafael}}\n[[Category:1938 deaths]]\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:20th-century venerated Christians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Spanish people]]\n[[Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II]]\n[[Category:Canonizations by Pope Benedict XVI]]\n[[Category:Deaths from diabetes]]\n[[Category:People from Burgos]]\n[[Category:Spanish Roman Catholic saints]]\n[[Category:Trappists]]\n[[Category:Trappist saints]]\n[[Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox saint\n|image            = Rafael_Arnaiz_Bar\u00f3n.jpg\n|caption          = \n|name             = [[Canonization|Saint]]<br>Rafael Arn\u00e1iz Bar\u00f3n<br>[[Trappists|O.C.S.O.]]\n|birth_date       = {{Birth date|1911|04|09|df=yes}}\n|birth_place      = [[Burgos]], [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]] \n|death_date       = {{death date and age|1938|04|26|1911|04|09|df=yes}}\n|death_place      = [[Due\u00f1as, Palencia|Due\u00f1as]], [[Palencia]], [[Second Spanish Republic]]\n|feast_day        = 27 April\n|venerated_in     = [[Roman Catholic Church]]\n|titles           = Religious\n|beatified_date   = 27 September 1992\n|beatified_place  = [[Saint Peter's Square]], [[Vatican City]]\n|beatified_by     = [[Pope John Paul II]]\n|canonized_date   = 11 October 2009\n|canonized_place  = Saint Peter's Square, Vatican City\n|canonized_by     = [[Pope Benedict XVI]]\n|attributes       = Trappist habit\n|patronage        = {{unbulleted list|[[Diabetics]]|[[World Youth Day]]}}\n|major_shrine     = Abbey of San Isidro de Due\u00f1as\n}}\n\nSaint '''Rafael Arn\u00e1iz Bar\u00f3n''' (9 April 1911 - 26 April 1938), also named '''Mar\u00eda Rafael''' [[religious name|in religion]], was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Trappists|Trappist]] [[Oblate#Conventual_oblates|conventual oblate]].<ref name=SQPN>{{citeweb|url=http://catholicsaints.info/saint-rafael-arnaiz-baron/|title=Saint Rafael Arn\u00e1iz Bar\u00f3n|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=5 July 2015|accessdate=30 January 2017}}</ref> He studied architecture in [[Madrid]], but decided to cease his studies in favor of the religious life.

These qualities were well-balanced in him and it produced an open and positive attitude to people and things which was characterized with exuberant good humor and respect. In 1923 his parents relocated to [[Oviedo]] and he accompanied them so that he could attend the Jesuit college of San Ignacio where he graduated in 1929.<ref name=SQPN/> On 26 April 1930 he began his architectural studies in [[Madrid]] though suspended it for a brief period of time in December 1930 after he had a bacterial infection.

He stated in the interview, \"Because with the type of business I'm in, it would definitely hurt my business. And the way that I was raised, I just don't do that. I was raised differently, not to tell... It's about business but it's still also a code of ethics\" When asked by [[Anderson Cooper]] if he would tell the police if a [[serial killer]] was living next to him, Cam'ron replied \"I would probably move\" but would not inform the police.\n\nCam'ron later issued an apology for his comments, calling them an \"error in judgement\":<ref name=\"60min\" /> \"Where I come from, once word gets out that you've cooperated with the police that only makes you a bigger target of criminal violence. That is a dark reality in so many neighborhoods like mine across America. I'm not saying its right, but its reality. And it's not unfounded. There's a harsh reality around violence and criminal justice in our inner cities.\"  Cam'ron has had contact with the police in the past.

In the next issue of [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]], Cam'ron explained the beef originated when Jay-Z became CEO and President of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nahright.com/news/2006/01/18/cam-finally-disses-hov/|title=Cam Finally Disses Hov - Nah Right|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref> In 2010, Cam'ron stated he does not have any issues with Jay-Z anymore.\n\nIn 2013, on \"Pound Cake\", a song by [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], Jay-Z mentioned Cam'ron again by rapping (in the middle of a verse): \n{{cquote|Now here's the icing on the cake/ Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh/ I'm just getting started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch/ I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did/ [[Damon Dash|Dame]] made millions, Bigg made millions/ [[Kanye West|Ye]] made millions, [[Just Blaze|Just]] made millions/ [[Lyor Cohen|Lyor]] made millions, Cam made millions/ [[Beanie Sigel|Beans]] would tell you if he wasn't in his feelin[g]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.25626/title.cam-ron-refutes-jay-z-s-pound-cake-claims|title=Cam'ron Refutes Jay Z's \"Pound Cake\" Claims|author=HipHopDX|date=2 October 2013|work=HipHopDX|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nCam replied briefly on \"Come and Talk to Me\" off of ''Ghetto Heaven Vol. 1'':\n{{cquote|She said Jay made you a millionaire? and looked me in the eyes/ Said cake, cake, cake, got that from the pies/ We made each other millions, that was my reply/ had a mill before I met him, baby, that ain't no lie/ See he named some Harlem cats and the [[Kanye West|homey from the Chi]] / but my thing, he ain't name nobody from the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant|Stuy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddotomen.com/2013/09/30/camron-come-and-talk-to-me-jay-z-response/|title=New Music: Cam'Ron \"Come And Talk To Me\" (Jay Z Response) - DDotOmen|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref>}}\n\n===50 Cent===\nOn February 1, 2007, Cam'ron and [[50 Cent]] had a live argument on ''The [[Angie Martinez]] Show'' on [[WQHT|Hot 97]] radio. 50 Cent commented that he felt [[Koch Entertainment]] was a \"graveyard\", meaning major record labels would not work with their artists.<ref name=NYT>Sanneh, Kelefa (February 27, 2007). Rappers Find That a Small Label Can Have Its Uses. ''The New York Times''. Accessed May 22, 2007.</ref> Cam'ron then ridiculed the record sales of [[G-Unit]] members [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Mobb Deep]] by pointing out that [[The Diplomats|Dipset]] member [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]] outsold both of their albums despite not being signed to a major label, and also went on to clarify that his group, The Diplomats, had a distribution deal from several labels.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Both rappers released diss songs with videos on [[YouTube]]. 50 Cent released \"Funeral Music\", and suggested in the song that Cam'ron is no longer able to lead The Diplomats and that Jim Jones should take his place. Cam'ron responded with \"Curtis\" and \"Curtis Pt. II\", in which he makes fun of 50 Cent's appearance, calling him \"a gorilla, with rabbit teeth\". 50 Cent responded by releasing \"[[Hold On (Young Buck song)|Hold On]]\" with [[Young Buck]]. Since 2009, the feud slowly died down, and they eventually reconciled in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BI50XSmAoci/|title=50 Cent on Instagram: \"I said Cam I would talk to you like you ain't got money, if I didn't see them big ass knot's in ya pockets.\"|website=Instagram|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Jim Jones===\nCam'ron revealed in 2007 that he was no longer speaking to his fellow Diplomat members Juelz Santana and Jim Jones, leading to speculation that the group had officially broken up. However, despite admitting that he did not want to contact Jim Jones, he said that he had no hard feelings towards him. In an interview with Miss Info, Cam'ron said: \"I still haven't spoken to Jim. But Jim ran with me for over 10 years, he worked hard, and I wish him the best of luck. Everybody thinks I'm mad at Jim. Why am I mad? I told people for years that Jimmy was gonna be a star. So it's better on my resume. I wish him the best.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5911/title.camron-addresses-jim-jones-50-cent-his-hiatus-more |title=Cam Speaks on Hiatus}}</ref> After three years of not speaking, Cam'ron and Jim Jones mended their differences in April 2010. In late 2011, both appeared together on [[Wolfgang Gartner]]'s album [[Weekend in America]], on the track \"Circus Freaks\".\n\n===Stop Snitchin'===\nOn April 22, 2007, Cam'ron was interviewed on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' as part of a piece on the [[Stop Snitchin']] movement.<ref name=\"60min\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/19/60minutes/main2704565.shtml |title=Stop Snitchin' - 60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |date=2007-08-12 |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> He also stated that he would \"not help the police\" try to locate the shooter saying he is \"not a snitch\" and helping the police would probably hurt his record sales. He stated in the interview, \"Because with the type of business I'm in, it would definitely hurt my business. And the way that I was raised, I just don't do that. I was raised differently, not to tell... It's about business but it's still also a code of ethics\" When asked by [[Anderson Cooper]] if he would tell the police if a [[serial killer]] was living next to him, Cam'ron replied \"I would probably move\" but would not inform the police.\n\nCam'ron later issued an apology for his comments, calling them an \"error in judgement\":<ref name=\"60min\" /> \"Where I come from, once word gets out that you've cooperated with the police that only makes you a bigger target of criminal violence. That is a dark reality in so many neighborhoods like mine across America. I'm not saying its right, but its reality. And it's not unfounded. There's a harsh reality around violence and criminal justice in our inner cities.\"  Cam'ron has had contact with the police in the past. According to [[The Smoking Gun]], New York Police Department records indicate that Giles filed a report with police after he was assaulted at a park in Harlem in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0419072giles1.html|title=Rapper's Change Of Face|work=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Kanye West===\nBoth Cam'ron and Jim Jones took out their frustrations on former label-mate Kanye West in defense of former CEO Dame Dash (due to their longtime friendship dating back to growing up in Harlem)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/06/03/camron-fact-interview-diplomats-a-trak-drugs/|title=\"I didn't grow up in a musical family, I grew up in a drug family\": Cam'ron talks Paid in Full, A-Trak and the cult of Dipset - FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|work=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref> by releasing a song titled \"Toast\" rhyming over Kanye West's song \"[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]\". The feud eventually ended, evidenced by Cam'ron, Jim Jones, and Kanye West collaborating on a song called \"[[G.O.O.D. Fridays|Christmas in Harlem]]\".\n\n==Personal life==\nOn October 23, 2005, Cam'ron was leaving a nightclub in Washington D.C., having performed the day before at [[Howard University]]. While stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of New York and New Jersey Avenue shortly after midnight, a passenger of a nearby car threatened Cam'ron to \"give up\" his 2006 [[Lamborghini]]. Cam'ron resisted, and the man then shot him. Cam'ron was struck at least once as he was holding the steering wheel, but he was able to drive, going the wrong way on streets and flashing his lights, until a fan drove him to Howard University Hospital. The gunman and passenger drove off, crashed into a parked car, and fled the scene. D.C. Metro Police recovered a cell phone from the scene of the crash, which they tried to use to trace the suspects. He stated that he does not know who shot him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301334.html|title=Rapper Shot in Alleged Carjacking in D.C.|publisher=|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Cam'ron discography}}\n{{See also|The Diplomats discography}}\n\n;Studio albums \n* ''[[Confessions of Fire]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[S.D.E.

He was born on 9 January 1957 in [[London, England]]. He has lived and worked in the U.S. since the 1980s but was privately educated at [[Royal Russell School]] in [[Surrey, England]].\n\n==Early work==\nLewis started the band [[Girl (band)|Girl]] with guitarist [[Gerry Laffy]] in 1978.  They put an ad in [[Melody Maker]] for a \"peroxide guitar hero,\" and [[Phil Collen]] (current guitarist of [[Def Leppard]]) answered.  They were soon joined by drummer [[Dave Gaynor]] and bassist Mark Megary.  Megary was replaced shortly thereafter by Laffy\u2019s brother, [[Simon Laffy]].  They signed a record deal with [[Don Arden]]\u2019s label, [[Jet Records]] in 1979 and released their first album, [[Sheer Greed]], in 1980. Lewis's then girlfriend, [[Britt Ekland]]<ref>https://www.loudersound.com/features/philip-lewis-the-best-advice-ive-ever-been-given-was-to-get-a-vasectomy</ref>, was instrumental in helping Girl land their record deal. Later band members included [[Pete Barnacle]], [[Bryson Graham]], and Pete Bonas.  They released their second album, [[Wasted Youth (Girl album)|Wasted Youth]] in 1982.  Phil Collen left the band in 1982 to join [[Def Leppard]], and the band broke up shortly thereafter.  Their third and final album, [[Killing Time (Girl album)|Killing Time]], was released in 1997.  It consisted of leftover material from the first two albums as well as tracks that were written for an album that never materialized.\n\nLewis later joined forces with guitarist Rudy Rivera, bassist Dave Birch, and drummer Paul Edwards to start the band New Torpedos.  They released a demo tape.\n\nLewis left New Torpedos to join the band [[Torm\u00e9]] with guitarist [[Bernie Torm\u00e9]].  They signed a record deal with Zebra Records and released [[Back to Babylon (album)|Back to Babylon]] in 1986 and [[Die Pretty, Die Young]] in 1987.  They toured both albums with modest success but never quite managed win over mainstream audiences.\n\n==L.A. Guns==\nShortly after leaving Torm\u00e9, Lewis received a call from guitarist [[Tracii Guns]] stating that he was interested in having Phil join his band, [[L.A. Guns]].  The two met on 1 April 1987,<ref>http://love-it-loud.com/biographies/phil-lewis/</ref> and Lewis was hired shortly thereafter. L.A. Guns soon signed a record deal with [[Polygram Records]] and released their first album, ''[[L.A. Guns (album)|L.A. Guns]]'', on 4 January 1988. The band achieved mainstream success with their second album, \"[[Cocked & Loaded]],\" thanks in part due to the very successful single, \"The Ballad of Jayne.\" They released \"[[Hollywood Vampires (L.A. Guns album)|Hollywood Vampires]]\" in 1991, which also had moderate success.  Due to the rise in popularity of the grunge movement, the band would not release their fourth album, \"[[Vicious Circle (L.A. Guns album)|Vicious Circle]]\" until 1994.  That album did not achieve the success of the prior albums, so Lewis left the band shortly after its release.\n\nDuring his time out of L.A. Guns, Lewis participated in several other music projects including Filthy Lucre with [[Steve Dior]] and the [[Liberators (American band)|Liberators]]. Filthy Lucre released an album called \"Popsmear\" in 1997.  During this time, he also held various other jobs including producing albums for other artists, mixing audio for [[Fox Sports]], and even working as a telephone psychic for a short time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metalsludge.tv/?p=27915 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908042637/http://metalsludge.tv/?p=27915 |archivedate=8 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nLewis returned to L.A.

They released \"[[Waking the Dead (album)|Waking The Dead]]\" in April 2002.  It was the first album with producer [[Andy Johns]] and would also prove to be the last with Tracii Guns, as he left the band a few months later to team up with [[Nikki Sixx]] for the band [[Brides of Destruction]].  Guns\u2019 departure forced the band to pull out of a world tour with [[Alice Cooper]], and they were soon dropped from their label as well.\n\nLewis and drummer [[Steve Riley (drummer)|Steve Riley]] continued to tour as L.A. Guns after Tracii Guns\u2019 departure and have released two more original albums, \"[[Tales from the Strip|Tales From The Strip]]\" in 2005 and \"[[Hollywood Forever (album)|Hollywood Forever]]\" in 2012.\n\nIn December 2016, Lewis announced that he would be leaving the current lineup of L.A.
