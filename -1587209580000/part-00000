Kuciak had previously detailed in his articles how Ko\u010dner was involved in an elaborate [[VAT]] tax fraud scheme. According to Kuciak's investigation, Ko\u010dner was buying and selling luxury apartments to himself, sometimes at the symbolic rate of \u20ac1, defrauding the state of substantial tax revenue. Ko\u010dner then allegedly began to threaten Kuciak and his family.

Most of the [[Earth's crust]] consists of solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water.  Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating.  For example, [[aluminium foil]] develops a thin skin of [[alumina|Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]] (called a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]]) that protects the foil from further [[corrosion]].<ref name=Greenwood>Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.</ref>   Certain elements can form multiple oxides, differing in the amounts of the element combining with the oxygen.  Examples are carbon, iron, nitrogen (see [[nitrogen oxide]]), silicon, titanium, and aluminium. In such cases the oxides are distinguished by specifying the numbers of atoms involved, as in [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]], or by specifying the element's [[oxidation number]], as in [[iron(II) oxide]] and [[iron(III) oxide]].\n\n==Formation==\n{{main|corrosion}}\nDue to its [[electronegativity]], oxygen forms stable [[chemical bond]]s with almost all elements to give the corresponding oxides. [[Noble metal]]s (such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]]) are prized because they resist direct chemical combination with oxygen, and substances like [[gold(III) oxide]] must be generated by indirect routes.\n\nTwo independent pathways for corrosion of elements are hydrolysis and oxidation by oxygen.  The combination of water and oxygen is even more corrosive. Virtually all elements burn in an atmosphere of oxygen or an oxygen-rich environment.  In the presence of water and oxygen (or simply air), some elements\u2014 [[sodium]]<!--took out a list-->\u2014react rapidly, to give the hydroxides.  In part, for this reason, alkali and alkaline earth metals are not found in nature in their metallic, i.e., native, form.  Cesium is so reactive with oxygen that it is used as a [[getter]] in [[vacuum tube]]s, and solutions of potassium and sodium, so-called [[NaK]] are used to deoxygenate and dehydrate some organic solvents. The surface of most metals consists of oxides and hydroxides in the presence of air.  A well-known example is [[aluminium foil]], which is coated with a thin film of [[aluminium oxide]] that [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivates]] the metal, slowing further [[corrosion]]<!--This information was mentioned above-->. The aluminum oxide layer can be built to greater thickness by the process of [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] [[anodizing]]. Though solid magnesium and aluminum react slowly with oxygen at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]\u2014they, like most metals, burn in air, generating very high temperatures.  Finely grained powders of most metals can be dangerously explosive in air.  Consequently, they are often used in [[solid-fuel rocket]]s.\n[[Image:Rust screw.jpg|thumb|right|Oxides, such as [[iron(III) oxide]] or [[rust]], which consists of hydrated [[iron(III) oxide]]s Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O and [[iron(III) oxide-hydroxide]] (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>), form when oxygen combines with other elements]]\n\nIn dry oxygen, [[iron]] readily forms [[iron(II) oxide]], but the formation of the hydrated ferric oxides, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3\u2212''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>2''x''</sub>, that mainly comprise rust, typically requires oxygen ''and'' water.  Free oxygen production by [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]] some 3.5 billion years ago [[precipitate]]d iron out of solution in the oceans as Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the economically important [[banded iron formations|iron ore]] [[hematite]].\n\n==Structure==\nOxides have a range of different structures, from individual molecules to [[polymer]]ic and [[crystalline]] structures.  At standard conditions, oxides may range from solids to gases.\n\n=== Oxides of metals ===\n[https://www.draughtsmancivilnotes.in/2020/04/rock-forming-minerals.html Oxides] of most metals adopt [[polymer]]ic structures.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transition Metal Oxides. An Introduction to Their Electronic Structure and Properties|authors=P.A. Cox|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199588947}}</ref>  The oxide typically links three metal atoms (e.g., rutile structure) or six metal atoms ([[carborundum]] or [[rock salt]] structures). Because the M-O bonds are typically strong and these compounds are crosslinked [[polymer]]s, the solids tend to be insoluble in solvents, though they are attacked by acids and bases. The formulas are often deceptively simple where many are [[nonstoichiometric compound]]s.<ref name=Greenwood/>\n\n===Molecular oxides===\n<gallery caption=\"Some important gaseous oxides\" widths=\"140px\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:Carbon-dioxide-2D-dimensions.svg|[[Carbon dioxide]] is the main product of fossil fuel combustion.\nFile: Carbon monoxide 2D.svg|[[Carbon monoxide]] is the product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels and a precursor to many useful chemicals.\nFile:Nitrogen-dioxide-2D-dimensions-vector.svg|Nitrogen dioxide is a problematic pollutant from internal combustion engines.\nFile:Sulfur-dioxide-2D.svg|[[Sulfur dioxide]], the principal oxide of sulfur, is emitted from volcanoes.\nFile:Nitrous-oxide-2D-dimensions.png|[[Nitrous oxide]] (\"laughing gas\") is a potent greenhouse gas produced by soil bacteria.\n</gallery>\n\nAlthough most metal oxides are [[polymer]]ic, some oxides are molecules.  Examples of molecular oxides are [[carbon dioxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]]. All simple oxides of nitrogen are molecular, e.g., NO, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. [[Phosphorus pentoxide]] is a more complex molecular oxide with a deceptive name, the real formula being P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>.  Some [[polymer]]ic oxides [[Cracking (chemistry)|depolymerize]] when heated to give molecules, examples being [[selenium dioxide]] and [[sulfur trioxide]].  Tetroxides are rare.  The more common examples: [[ruthenium tetroxide]], [[osmium tetroxide]], and [[xenon tetroxide]].\n\nMany oxyanions are known, such as [[polyphosphate]]s and [[polyoxometalate]]s.  Oxycations are rarer, some examples being [[nitrosonium]] (NO<sup>+</sup>), [[vanadyl]] (VO<sup>2+</sup>), and [[uranyl]] ({{chem|UO|2|2+}}).  Of course many compounds are known with both oxides and other groups.  In [[organic chemistry]], these include [[ketone]]s and many related [[carbonyl]] compounds.  For the transition metals, many [[Oxo ligand|oxo complex]]es are known as well as [[oxyhalide]]s.\n\n==Reduction==\nConversion of a metal oxide to the metal is called reduction. The reduction can be induced by many reagents.  Many metal oxides convert to metals simply by heating.\n\n===Reduction by carbon===\n{{see also|carbothermic reduction}}\nMetals are \"won\" from their oxides by chemical reduction, i.e. by the addition of a chemical reagent.  A common and cheap reducing agent is carbon in the form of [[coke (fuel)|coke]].  The most prominent example is that of [[Iron#Industrial production|iron ore smelting]]. Many reactions are involved, but the simplified equation is usually shown as:<ref name=Greenwood/>\n: 2 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 C \u2192 4 Fe + 3 CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nMetal oxides can be reduced by organic compounds.  This redox process is the basis for many important transformations in chemistry, such as the detoxification of drugs by the [[P450]] enzymes and the production of [[ethylene oxide]], which is converted to antifreeze.  In such systems, the metal center transfers an oxide ligand to the organic compound followed by regeneration of the metal oxide, often by oxygen in the air.\n\n===Reduction by heating===\n{{see also|thermal decomposition}}\nMetals that are lower in the [[reactivity series]] can be reduced by heating alone. For example, [[silver oxide]] decomposes at 200&nbsp;\u00b0C:<ref>http://chemister.ru/Database/properties-en.php?dbid=1&id=4098</ref>\n: 2 Ag<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 4 Ag + O<sub>2</sub>\n\n===Reduction by displacement===\n{{see also|single displacement reaction}}\nMetals that are more [[reactivity series|reactive]] displace the oxide of the metals that are less reactive. For example, [[zinc]] is more reactive than [[copper]], so it displaces [[copper (II) oxide]] to form [[zinc oxide]]:\n: Zn + CuO \u2192 ZnO + Cu\n\n===Reduction by hydrogen===\n{{see also|single displacement reaction}}\nApart from metals, hydrogen can also displace metal oxides to form [[hydrogen oxide]], also known as water:\n: H<sub>2</sub> + CuO \u2192 Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n===Reduction by electrolysis===\n{{see also|electrolysis}}\nSince metals that are reactive form oxides that are stable, some metal oxides must be electrolyzed to be reduced. This includes [[sodium oxide]], [[potassium oxide]], [[calcium oxide]], [[magnesium oxide]], and [[aluminium oxide]]. The oxides must be molten before immersing [[graphite]] electrodes in them:\n: 2Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> \u2192 4Al + 3O<sub>2</sub>\n\n==Hydrolysis and dissolution==\nOxides typically react with [[acid]]s or [[Base (chemistry)|bases]], sometimes both. Those reacting only with acids are labeled basic oxides.  Those reacting only by bases are called \"acidic oxides\". Oxides that react with both are [[amphoteric]]. Metals tend to form basic oxides, non-metals tend to form acidic oxides, and amphoteric oxides are formed by elements near the boundary between metals and non-metals ([[metalloid]]s).  This reactivity is the basis of many practical processes, such as the extraction of some metals from their ores in the process called [[hydrometallurgy]].\n\nOxides of more [[electropositive]] elements tend to be basic. They are called ''basic anhydrides''. Exposed to water, they may form basic [[hydroxide]]s. For example, [[sodium oxide]] is basic\u2014when hydrated, it forms [[sodium hydroxide]]. Oxides of more [[electronegative]] elements tend to be acidic. They are called \"acid anhydrides\"; adding water, they form [[oxoacid]]s. For example, [[dichlorine heptoxide]] is an acid anhydride; [[perchloric acid]] is its fully hydrated form. Some oxides can act as both acid and base. They are [[amphoteric]]. An example is [[aluminium oxide]]. Some oxides do not show behavior as either acid or base.\n\nThe oxide [[ion]] has the formula O<sup>2\u2212</sup>. It is the [[conjugate base]] of the [[hydroxide]] ion, OH<sup>\u2212</sup> and is encountered in [[ionic compound|ionic]] solids such as [[calcium oxide]].  O<sup>2\u2212</sup> is unstable in [[water|aqueous]] [[solution]] \u2212 its affinity for H<sup>+</sup> is so great (p''K''<sub>b</sub> ~ \u221238) that it abstracts a [[proton]] from a solvent H<sub>2</sub>O molecule:\n\n:O<sup>2\u2212</sup>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O  \u2192  2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe equilibrium constant of aforesaid reactions is pK<sub>eq</sub> ~ \u221222\n\nIn the 18th century, oxides were named '''calxes''' or '''calces''' after the [[calcination]] process used to produce oxides.  ''Calx'' was later replaced by ''oxyd.'' <!--I think that calx is from the greek for ore, hence the term calcogen-->\n\n==Reductive dissolution==\nThe '''reductive dissolution''' of a [[transition metal]] oxide occurs when dissolution is coupled to a [[redox]] event.<ref name=\"CornellSchwertmann2003-306\">{{cite book|title=The Iron Oxides: Structure, Properties, Reactions, Occurrences and Uses, Second Edition|last1=Cornell|first1=R.

Thus, NbO would be called niobium monoxide and TiO<sub>2</sub> is titanium dioxide.  This naming follows the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[numerical prefix]]es.  In the older literature and continuing in industry, oxides are named by adding the suffix ''[[:wikt:-a#Etymology 4|-a]]'' to the element's name.  Hence alumina, magnesia and chromia, are, respectively, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.\n\nSpecial types of oxides are [[peroxide]], O<sub>2</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>, and [[superoxide]], O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>.

Notice that oxide forms three bonds to titanium and titanium forms six bonds to oxide.]]\n\nAn '''oxide''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0252|k|s|a\u026a|d}}) is a [[chemical compound]] that contains at least one [[oxygen]] atom and one other element<ref>Foundations of College Chemistry, 12th Edition</ref> in its [[chemical formula]]. \"Oxide\" itself is the [[dianion]] of oxygen, an O<sup>2\u2013</sup> atom. [[Metal]] oxides thus typically contain an [[anion]] of [[oxygen]] in the [[oxidation state]] of \u22122. Most of the [[Earth's crust]] consists of solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water.  Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating.  For example, [[aluminium foil]] develops a thin skin of [[alumina|Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]] (called a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]]) that protects the foil from further [[corrosion]].<ref name=Greenwood>Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.</ref>   Certain elements can form multiple oxides, differing in the amounts of the element combining with the oxygen.  Examples are carbon, iron, nitrogen (see [[nitrogen oxide]]), silicon, titanium, and aluminium. In such cases the oxides are distinguished by specifying the numbers of atoms involved, as in [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]], or by specifying the element's [[oxidation number]], as in [[iron(II) oxide]] and [[iron(III) oxide]].\n\n==Formation==\n{{main|corrosion}}\nDue to its [[electronegativity]], oxygen forms stable [[chemical bond]]s with almost all elements to give the corresponding oxides. [[Noble metal]]s (such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]]) are prized because they resist direct chemical combination with oxygen, and substances like [[gold(III) oxide]] must be generated by indirect routes.\n\nTwo independent pathways for corrosion of elements are hydrolysis and oxidation by oxygen.  The combination of water and oxygen is even more corrosive. Virtually all elements burn in an atmosphere of oxygen or an oxygen-rich environment.  In the presence of water and oxygen (or simply air), some elements\u2014 [[sodium]]<!--took out a list-->\u2014react rapidly, to give the hydroxides.  In part, for this reason, alkali and alkaline earth metals are not found in nature in their metallic, i.e., native, form.  Cesium is so reactive with oxygen that it is used as a [[getter]] in [[vacuum tube]]s, and solutions of potassium and sodium, so-called [[NaK]] are used to deoxygenate and dehydrate some organic solvents. The surface of most metals consists of oxides and hydroxides in the presence of air.  A well-known example is [[aluminium foil]], which is coated with a thin film of [[aluminium oxide]] that [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivates]] the metal, slowing further [[corrosion]]<!--This information was mentioned above-->. The aluminum oxide layer can be built to greater thickness by the process of [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] [[anodizing]]. Though solid magnesium and aluminum react slowly with oxygen at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]\u2014they, like most metals, burn in air, generating very high temperatures.  Finely grained powders of most metals can be dangerously explosive in air.  Consequently, they are often used in [[solid-fuel rocket]]s.\n[[Image:Rust screw.jpg|thumb|right|Oxides, such as [[iron(III) oxide]] or [[rust]], which consists of hydrated [[iron(III) oxide]]s Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O and [[iron(III) oxide-hydroxide]] (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>), form when oxygen combines with other elements]]\n\nIn dry oxygen, [[iron]] readily forms [[iron(II) oxide]], but the formation of the hydrated ferric oxides, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3\u2212''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>2''x''</sub>, that mainly comprise rust, typically requires oxygen ''and'' water.  Free oxygen production by [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]] some 3.5 billion years ago [[precipitate]]d iron out of solution in the oceans as Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the economically important [[banded iron formations|iron ore]] [[hematite]].\n\n==Structure==\nOxides have a range of different structures, from individual molecules to [[polymer]]ic and [[crystalline]] structures.  At standard conditions, oxides may range from solids to gases.\n\n=== Oxides of metals ===\nOxides of most metals adopt [[polymer]]ic structures.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transition Metal Oxides. An Introduction to Their Electronic Structure and Properties|authors=P.A. Cox|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199588947}}</ref>  The oxide typically links three metal atoms (e.g., rutile structure) or six metal atoms ([[carborundum]] or [[rock salt]] structures). Because the M-O bonds are typically strong and these compounds are crosslinked [[polymer]]s, the solids tend to be insoluble in solvents, though they are attacked by acids and bases. The formulas are often deceptively simple where many are [[nonstoichiometric compound]]s.<ref name=Greenwood/>\n\n===Molecular oxides===\n<gallery caption=\"Some important gaseous oxides\" widths=\"140px\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:Carbon-dioxide-2D-dimensions.svg|[[Carbon dioxide]] is the main product of fossil fuel combustion.\nFile: Carbon monoxide 2D.svg|[[Carbon monoxide]] is the product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels and a precursor to many useful chemicals.\nFile:Nitrogen-dioxide-2D-dimensions-vector.svg|Nitrogen dioxide is a problematic pollutant from internal combustion engines.\nFile:Sulfur-dioxide-2D.svg|[[Sulfur dioxide]], the principal oxide of sulfur, is emitted from volcanoes.\nFile:Nitrous-oxide-2D-dimensions.png|[[Nitrous oxide]] (\"laughing gas\") is a potent greenhouse gas produced by soil bacteria.\n</gallery>\n\nAlthough most metal oxides are [[polymer]]ic, some oxides are molecules.  Examples of molecular oxides are [[carbon dioxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]]. All simple oxides of nitrogen are molecular, e.g., NO, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. [[Phosphorus pentoxide]] is a more complex molecular oxide with a deceptive name, the real formula being P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>.  Some [[polymer]]ic oxides [[Cracking (chemistry)|depolymerize]] when heated to give molecules, examples being [[selenium dioxide]] and [[sulfur trioxide]].  Tetroxides are rare.  The more common examples: [[ruthenium tetroxide]], [[osmium tetroxide]], and [[xenon tetroxide]].\n\nMany oxyanions are known, such as [[polyphosphate]]s and [[polyoxometalate]]s.  Oxycations are rarer, some examples being [[nitrosonium]] (NO<sup>+</sup>), [[vanadyl]] (VO<sup>2+</sup>), and [[uranyl]] ({{chem|UO|2|2+}}).  Of course many compounds are known with both oxides and other groups.  In [[organic chemistry]], these include [[ketone]]s and many related [[carbonyl]] compounds.  For the transition metals, many [[Oxo ligand|oxo complex]]es are known as well as [[oxyhalide]]s.\n\n==Reduction==\nConversion of a metal oxide to the metal is called reduction. The reduction can be induced by many reagents.  Many metal oxides convert to metals simply by heating.\n\n===Reduction by carbon===\n{{see also|carbothermic reduction}}\nMetals are \"won\" from their oxides by chemical reduction, i.e. by the addition of a chemical reagent.  A common and cheap reducing agent is carbon in the form of [[coke (fuel)|coke]].  The most prominent example is that of [[Iron#Industrial production|iron ore smelting]]. Many reactions are involved, but the simplified equation is usually shown as:<ref name=Greenwood/>\n: 2 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 C \u2192 4 Fe + 3 CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nMetal oxides can be reduced by organic compounds.  This redox process is the basis for many important transformations in chemistry, such as the detoxification of drugs by the [[P450]] enzymes and the production of [[ethylene oxide]], which is converted to antifreeze.  In such systems, the metal center transfers an oxide ligand to the organic compound followed by regeneration of the metal oxide, often by oxygen in the air.\n\n===Reduction by heating===\n{{see also|thermal decomposition}}\nMetals that are lower in the [[reactivity series]] can be reduced by heating alone. For example, [[silver oxide]] decomposes at 200&nbsp;\u00b0C:<ref>http://chemister.ru/Database/properties-en.php?dbid=1&id=4098</ref>\n: 2 Ag<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 4 Ag + O<sub>2</sub>\n\n===Reduction by displacement===\n{{see also|single displacement reaction}}\nMetals that are more [[reactivity series|reactive]] displace the oxide of the metals that are less reactive. For example, [[zinc]] is more reactive than [[copper]], so it displaces [[copper (II) oxide]] to form [[zinc oxide]]:\n: Zn + CuO \u2192 ZnO + Cu\n\n===Reduction by hydrogen===\n{{see also|single displacement reaction}}\nApart from metals, hydrogen can also displace metal oxides to form [[hydrogen oxide]], also known as water:\n: H<sub>2</sub> + CuO \u2192 Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n===Reduction by electrolysis===\n{{see also|electrolysis}}\nSince metals that are reactive form oxides that are stable, some metal oxides must be electrolyzed to be reduced. This includes [[sodium oxide]], [[potassium oxide]], [[calcium oxide]], [[magnesium oxide]], and [[aluminium oxide]]. The oxides must be molten before immersing [[graphite]] electrodes in them:\n: 2Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> \u2192 4Al + 3O<sub>2</sub>\n\n==Hydrolysis and dissolution==\nOxides typically react with [[acid]]s or [[Base (chemistry)|bases]], sometimes both. Those reacting only with acids are labeled basic oxides.  Those reacting only by bases are called \"acidic oxides\". Oxides that react with both are [[amphoteric]]. Metals tend to form basic oxides, non-metals tend to form acidic oxides, and amphoteric oxides are formed by elements near the boundary between metals and non-metals ([[metalloid]]s).  This reactivity is the basis of many practical processes, such as the extraction of some metals from their ores in the process called [[hydrometallurgy]].\n\nOxides of more [[electropositive]] elements tend to be basic. They are called ''basic anhydrides''. Exposed to water, they may form basic [[hydroxide]]s. For example, [[sodium oxide]] is basic\u2014when hydrated, it forms [[sodium hydroxide]]. Oxides of more [[electronegative]] elements tend to be acidic. They are called \"acid anhydrides\"; adding water, they form [[oxoacid]]s. For example, [[dichlorine heptoxide]] is an acid anhydride; [[perchloric acid]] is its fully hydrated form. Some oxides can act as both acid and base. They are [[amphoteric]]. An example is [[aluminium oxide]]. Some oxides do not show behavior as either acid or base.\n\nThe oxide [[ion]] has the formula O<sup>2\u2212</sup>. It is the [[conjugate base]] of the [[hydroxide]] ion, OH<sup>\u2212</sup> and is encountered in [[ionic compound|ionic]] solids such as [[calcium oxide]].  O<sup>2\u2212</sup> is unstable in [[water|aqueous]] [[solution]] \u2212 its affinity for H<sup>+</sup> is so great (p''K''<sub>b</sub> ~ \u221238) that it abstracts a [[proton]] from a solvent H<sub>2</sub>O molecule:\n\n:O<sup>2\u2212</sup>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O  \u2192  2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe equilibrium constant of aforesaid reactions is pK<sub>eq</sub> ~ \u221222\n\nIn the 18th century, oxides were named '''calxes''' or '''calces''' after the [[calcination]] process used to produce oxides.  ''Calx'' was later replaced by ''oxyd.'' <!--I think that calx is from the greek for ore, hence the term calcogen-->\n\n==Reductive dissolution==\nThe '''reductive dissolution''' of a [[transition metal]] oxide occurs when dissolution is coupled to a [[redox]] event.<ref name=\"CornellSchwertmann2003-306\">{{cite book|title=The Iron Oxides: Structure, Properties, Reactions, Occurrences and Uses, Second Edition|last1=Cornell|first1=R.

Thus, NbO would be called niobium monoxide and TiO<sub>2</sub> is titanium dioxide.  This naming follows the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[numerical prefix]]es.  In the older literature and continuing in industry, oxides are named by adding the suffix ''[[:wikt:-a#Etymology 4|-a]]'' to the element's name.  Hence alumina, magnesia and chromia, are, respectively, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.\n\nSpecial types of oxides are [[peroxide]], O<sub>2</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>, and [[superoxide]], O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>.  In such species, oxygen is assigned higher [[oxidation state]]s than oxide. <!--suboxide-->\n\nThe [[chemical formula]]s of the oxides of the [[chemical element]]s in their highest [[oxidation state]] are predictable and are derived from the number of [[valence electron]]s for that element.

It is a [[metal]] that belongs to the [[first transition series]] and [[group 8 element|group 8]] of the [[periodic table]]. It is by mass the most common element on [[Earth]], forming much of Earth's [[outer core|outer]] and [[inner core]]. It is the fourth most common [[abundance of elements in Earth's crust|element in the Earth's crust]].\n\nIn its metallic state, iron is rare in the [[Earth's crust]], limited to deposition by [[meteorites]]. [[Iron ore]]s, by contrast, are among the most abundant in the Earth's crust, although extracting usable metal from them requires [[kiln]]s or [[furnace]]s capable of reaching {{convert|1500|C|F}} or higher, about 500&nbsp;\u00b0C (900&nbsp;\u00b0F) higher than what is enough to [[smelting|smelt]] [[copper]]. Humans started to master that process in [[Eurasia]] only about 2000 BCE{{Not in body|date=April 2019}}, and the use of iron [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s began to displace [[list of copper alloys|copper alloys]], in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Iron Age]]. In the [[modern world]], iron alloys, such as [[steel]], [[stainless steel|inox]], [[cast iron]] and [[alloy steel|special steels]] are by far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties and low cost.\n\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However, iron reacts readily with [[oxygen]] and [[water]] to give brown to black [[hydrate]]d [[iron oxide]]s, commonly known as [[rust]]. Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.\n\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]]. These two [[protein]]s play essential roles in [[vertebrate]] [[metabolism]], respectively [[oxygen transport]] by [[blood]] and oxygen storage in [[muscle]]s. To maintain the necessary levels, [[human iron metabolism]] requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important [[redox]] [[enzymes]] dealing with [[cellular respiration]] and [[oxidation and reduction]] in plants and animals<!--\", [[DNA]] synthesis, and [[cell growth]].\" : citation needed-->.<ref name=\"lpi\">{{cite web|title=Iron|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/iron|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=April 2016}}</ref>\n\nChemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are [[iron(II)]] and [[iron(III)]]. Iron shares many properties of other [[transition metal]]s, including the other [[group 8 element]]s, [[ruthenium]] and [[osmium]]. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of [[oxidation state]]s, \u22122 to +7. Iron also forms many [[coordination compound]]s; some of them, such as [[ferrocene]], [[potassium ferrioxalate|ferrioxalate]], and [[Prussian blue]], have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n===Allotropes===\n{{main|Allotropes of iron}}\n[[File:Iron-alpha-pV.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Molar volume vs. pressure for \u03b1 iron at room temperature]]\nAt least four allotropes of iron (differing atom arrangements in the solid) are known, conventionally denoted \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5.\n[[File:Pure iron phase diagram (EN).png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Low-pressure [[phase diagram]] of pure iron]]\n\nThe first three forms are observed at ordinary pressures. As molten [https://www.draughtsmancivilnotes.in/2020/04/rock-forming-minerals.html iron] cools past its freezing point of 1538&nbsp;\u00b0C, it crystallizes into its \u03b4 allotrope, which has a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) [[crystal structure]]. As it cools further to 1394&nbsp;\u00b0C, it changes to its \u03b3-iron allotrope, a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) crystal structure, or [[austenite]]. At 912&nbsp;\u00b0C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc \u03b1-iron allotrope.<ref name=Greenwood1075/>\n\nThe physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively, because of their relevance to theories about the cores of the Earth and other planets. Above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, \u03b1-iron changes into another [[hexagonal close-packed]] (hcp) structure, which is also known as [[hexaferrum|\u03b5-iron]]. The higher-temperature \u03b3-phase also changes into \u03b5-iron, but does so at higher pressure.\n\nSome controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable \u03b2 phase at pressures above 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K.

Thus a macroscopic piece of iron will have a nearly zero overall magnetic field.\n\nApplication of an external magnetic field causes the domains that are magnetized in the same general direction to grow at the expense of adjacent ones that point in other directions, reinforcing the external field. This effect is exploited in devices that needs to channel magnetic fields, such as [[electrical transformer]]s, [[magnetic recording]] heads, and [[electric motor]]s. Impurities, [[lattice defect]]s, or grain and particle boundaries can \"pin\" the domains in the new positions, so that the effect persists even after the external field is removed -- thus turning the iron object into a (permanent) [[magnet]].<ref name=cullity/>\n\nSimilar behavior is exhibited by some iron compounds, such as the ferrites and the mineral [[magnetite]], a crystalline form of the mixed iron(II,III) oxide {{chem2|Fe3O4}} (although the atomic-scale mechanism, [[ferrimagnetism]], is somewhat different). Pieces of magnetite with natural permanent magnetization ([[lodestone]]s) provided the earliest [[compass]]es for navigation.

The latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron(II) complexes and often dissociate in water. Many Fe\u2013O complexes show intense colors and are used as tests for [[phenol]]s or [[enol]]s. For example, in the [[ferric chloride test]], used to determine the presence of phenols, [[iron(III) chloride]] reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex:<ref name=Greenwood1088/>\n\n:3 ArOH + FeCl<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Fe(OAr)<sub>3</sub> + 3 HCl (Ar = [[aryl]])\n\nAmong the halide and pseudohalide complexes, fluoro complexes of iron(III) are the most stable, with the colorless [FeF<sub>5</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>2\u2212</sup> being the most stable in aqueous solution. Chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in [FeCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup>; [FeBr<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> and [FeI<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> are reduced easily to iron(II). [[Thiocyanate]] is a common test for the presence of iron(III) as it forms the blood-red [Fe(SCN)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. Like manganese(II), most iron(III) complexes are high-spin, the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the [[spectrochemical series]] such as [[cyanide]]. An example of a low-spin iron(III) complex is [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3\u2212</sup>. The cyanide ligands may easily be detached in [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3\u2212</sup>, and hence this complex is poisonous, unlike the iron(II) complex [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup> found in Prussian blue,<ref name=Greenwood1088/> which does not release [[hydrogen cyanide]] except when dilute acids are added.<ref name=Greenwood1091/> Iron shows a great variety of electronic [[spin states (d electrons)|spin states]], including every possible spin quantum number value for a d-block element from 0 (diamagnetic) to {{frac|5|2}} (5 unpaired electrons).

Its formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> as they react (respectively) with [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[potassium ferrocyanide]] to form Prussian blue.<ref name=\"HollemanAF\" />\n\nAnother old example of organoiron compound is [[iron pentacarbonyl]], Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>, in which a neutral iron atom is bound to the carbon atoms of five [[carbon monoxide]] molecules. The compound can be used to make [[carbonyl iron]] powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron.

The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32}}\n\nSince iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative [[The Iron Bridge|first iron bridge]] in 1778.

In the first stage, iron ore is [[redox|reduced]] with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in a [[blast furnace]], and the molten metal is separated from gross impurities such as [[silicate mineral]]s. This stage yields an alloy -- [[pig iron]]\u2014that contains relatively large amounts of carbon.<!--\"Alternatively, it may be directly reduced.\" - what does this mean?--> In the second stage, the amount of carbon in the pig iron is lowered by oxidation to yield wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.<ref name=Greenwood1073>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1073</ref><!--https://books.google.com/books?id=xkVPNtRagDkC--> Other metals can be added at this stage to form [[alloy steel]]s.\n[[File:Chinese Fining and Blast Furnace.jpg|thumb|17th century Chinese illustration of workers at a blast furnace, making wrought iron from pig iron<ref name=song>[[Song Yingxing]] (1637): The ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia.</ref>]] [[File:Iron-Making.jpg|thumb|How iron was extracted in the 19th century]]\n\n====Blast furnace processing====\n{{Main|Blast furnace}}\nThe blast furnace is loaded with iron ores, usually [[hematite]] {{chem2|Fe2O3}} or [[magnetite]] {{chem2|Fe3O4}}, together with coke ([[coal]] that has been separately baked to remove volatile components).

Its purpose is to remove silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the furnace. The heat of the furnace decomposes the carbonates to [[calcium oxide]], which reacts with any excess [[silica]] to form a [[slag]] composed of [[calcium silicate]] {{chem2|CaSiO3}} or other products. At the furnace's temperature, the metal and the slag are both molten. They collect at the bottom as two immiscible liquid layers (with the slag on top), that are then easily separated.<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\nThe slag can be used as a material in [[road]] construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for [[agriculture]].<ref name=\"Biddle\" />\n[[File:LightningVolt Iron Ore Pellets.jpg|thumb|This heap of iron ore pellets will be used in steel production.]]\n\n====Steelmaking====\n{{Main|Steelmaking|Ironworks}}\n[[File:Melted raw-iron.jpg|thumb|right|A pot of molten iron being used to make steel]]\n<!-- Several other articles cover the material that might go into this section: please do not expand it excessively. This article concerns all aspects of the element iron, and should thus NOT be overburdened with details of metallurgy... Agree. Should be a summary. -->\nIn general, the pig iron produced by the blast furnace process contains up to 4\u20135% carbon, with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus, and manganese. The high level of carbon makes it relatively weak and brittle. Reducing the amount of carbon to 0.002\u20132.1% by mass produces [[steel]], which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron. A great variety of steel articles can then be made by [[cold working]], [[hot rolling]], [[forging]], [[machining]], etc. Removing the other impurities, instead, results in cast iron, which is used to cast articles in [[foundry|foundries]]; for example stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts, and rails.<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\n\nSteel products often undergo various [[heat treatment]]s after they are forged to shape. [[annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] consists of heating them to 700\u2013800&nbsp;\u00b0C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.<ref name=Verhoeven>Verhoeven, J.D. (1975) ''Fundamentals of Physical Metallurgy'', Wiley, New York, p. 326</ref>\n<!--why is this in production of iron?Steel may be hardened by [[cold working]]. The metal is bent or hammered into its final shape at a relatively cool temperature. Cold forging is the stamping of a piece of steel into shape by a heavy press. Wrenches are commonly made by cold forging. Cold rolling, which involves making a thinner but harder sheet, and cold drawing, which makes a thinner but stronger wire, are two other methods of cold working. To harden the steel, it is heated to red-hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. If it is too hardened, it is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.\n\n[[Heat treatment]] is another way to harden steel. The steel is heated red-hot, then cooled quickly. The iron carbide molecules are decomposed by the heat, but do not have time to reform. Since the free carbon atoms are stuck, it makes the steel much harder and stronger than before.<ref name=\"Biddle\" />\n\nSometimes both toughness and hardness are desired. A process called [[case hardening]] may be used. Steel is heated to about 900&nbsp;\u00b0C then plunged into oil or water. Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard. The surface cools quickly, but the inside cools slowly, making an extremely hard surface and a durable, resistant inner layer.\n\nIron may be [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by dipping it into a concentrated [[nitric acid]] solution. This forms a protective layer of oxide on the metal, protecting it from further corrosion.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/map/Passivating_Pickling_EN.pdf |title=Picking and passivating stainless steel, Materials and Application Series, Volume 4 |publisher=Euro Inox |year=2007 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-2-87997-224-4}}</ref>-->\n\n=== Direct iron reduction ===\nOwing to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have been developed. \"[[Direct reduced iron|Direct iron reduction]]\" [[Sponge iron reaction|reduces iron ore]] to a ferrous lump called [[sponge iron|\"sponge\" iron]] or \"direct\" iron that is suitable for steelmaking.<ref name=\"Biddle\" /> Two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process:\n\nNatural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):<ref name=Biddle/>\n:2 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO + 4 H<sub>2</sub>\n\nIron ore is then treated with these gases in a furnace, producing solid sponge iron:<ref name=Biddle/>\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + CO + 2 H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 Fe + CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n[[Silica]] is removed by adding a [[limestone]] flux as described above.<ref name=Biddle/>\n\n===Thermite process===\n{{Main|Thermite}}\nIgnition of a mixture of aluminium powder and iron oxide yields metallic iron via the [[thermite reaction]]:\n\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2 Al \u2192 2 Fe + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n\nAlternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron).

Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723&nbsp;\u00b0C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and \u03b1-iron, which is soft and malleable and is called [[pearlite]] for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle [[martensite]]. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite.

It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion about 55&nbsp;picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\nWhen deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a [[hydrogen bond]] with it. This results in the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe\u2013O\u2013O bond angle of around 120\u00b0 that avoids the formation of Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe or Fe\u2013O<sub>2</sub>\u2013Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> As described by the [[Bohr effect]] (named after [[Christian Bohr]], the father of [[Niels Bohr]]), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\n[[File:Carboxyhemoglobin from 1AJ9.png|thumb|right|A heme unit of human [[carboxyhemoglobin]], showing the [[carbonyl ligand]] at the apical position, ''trans'' to the histidine residue.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Acta Crystallogr.

Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of [[cyanide]], but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a [[methionine]] sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen \u2013 with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in [[adenosine triphosphate]]. Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows:<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\n:4 Cytc<sup>2+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> + 8H{{su|p=+|b=inside}} \u2192 4 Cytc<sup>3+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 4H{{su|p=+|b=outside}}\n\nAlthough the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the [[iron-sulfur protein]]s are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is [[rubredoxin]], which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from [[cysteine]] residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the [[ferredoxin]]s, which have multiple iron atoms.

It is a [[metal]] that belongs to the [[first transition series]] and [[group 8 element|group 8]] of the [[periodic table]]. It is by mass the most common element on [[Earth]], forming much of Earth's [[outer core|outer]] and [[inner core]]. It is the fourth most common [[abundance of elements in Earth's crust|element in the Earth's crust]].\n\nIn its metallic state, iron is rare in the [[Earth's crust]], limited to deposition by [[meteorites]]. [[Iron ore]]s, by contrast, are among the most abundant in the Earth's crust, although extracting usable metal from them requires [[kiln]]s or [[furnace]]s capable of reaching {{convert|1500|C|F}} or higher, about 500&nbsp;\u00b0C (900&nbsp;\u00b0F) higher than what is enough to [[smelting|smelt]] [[copper]]. Humans started to master that process in [[Eurasia]] only about 2000 BCE{{Not in body|date=April 2019}}, and the use of iron [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s began to displace [[list of copper alloys|copper alloys]], in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Iron Age]]. In the [[modern world]], iron alloys, such as [[steel]], [[stainless steel|inox]], [[cast iron]] and [[alloy steel|special steels]] are by far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties and low cost.\n\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However, iron reacts readily with [[oxygen]] and [[water]] to give brown to black [[hydrate]]d [[iron oxide]]s, commonly known as [[rust]]. Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.\n\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]]. These two [[protein]]s play essential roles in [[vertebrate]] [[metabolism]], respectively [[oxygen transport]] by [[blood]] and oxygen storage in [[muscle]]s. To maintain the necessary levels, [[human iron metabolism]] requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important [[redox]] [[enzymes]] dealing with [[cellular respiration]] and [[oxidation and reduction]] in plants and animals<!--\", [[DNA]] synthesis, and [[cell growth]].\" : citation needed-->.<ref name=\"lpi\">{{cite web|title=Iron|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/iron|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=April 2016}}</ref>\n\nChemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are [[iron(II)]] and [[iron(III)]]. Iron shares many properties of other [[transition metal]]s, including the other [[group 8 element]]s, [[ruthenium]] and [[osmium]]. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of [[oxidation state]]s, \u22122 to +7. Iron also forms many [[coordination compound]]s; some of them, such as [[ferrocene]], [[potassium ferrioxalate|ferrioxalate]], and [[Prussian blue]], have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n===Allotropes===\n{{main|Allotropes of iron}}\n[[File:Iron-alpha-pV.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Molar volume vs. pressure for \u03b1 iron at room temperature]]\nAt least four allotropes of iron (differing atom arrangements in the solid) are known, conventionally denoted \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5.\n[[File:Pure iron phase diagram (EN).png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Low-pressure [[phase diagram]] of pure iron]]\n\nThe first three forms are observed at ordinary pressures. As molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538&nbsp;\u00b0C, it crystallizes into its \u03b4 allotrope, which has a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) [[crystal structure]]. As it cools further to 1394&nbsp;\u00b0C, it changes to its \u03b3-iron allotrope, a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) crystal structure, or [[austenite]]. At 912&nbsp;\u00b0C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc \u03b1-iron allotrope.<ref name=Greenwood1075/>\n\nThe physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively, because of their relevance to theories about the cores of the Earth and other planets.

This stage yields an alloy -- [[pig iron]]\u2014that contains relatively large amounts of carbon.<!--\"Alternatively, it may be directly reduced.\" - what does this mean?--> In the second stage, the amount of carbon in the pig iron is lowered by oxidation to yield wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.<ref name=Greenwood1073>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1073</ref><!--https://books.google.com/books?id=xkVPNtRagDkC--> Other metals can be added at this stage to form [[alloy steel]]s.\n[[File:Chinese Fining and Blast Furnace.jpg|thumb|17th century Chinese illustration of workers at a blast furnace, making wrought iron from pig iron<ref name=song>[[Song Yingxing]] (1637): The ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia.</ref>]] [[File:Iron-Making.jpg|thumb|How iron was extracted in the 19th century]]\n\n====Blast furnace processing====\n{{Main|Blast furnace}}\nThe blast furnace is loaded with iron ores, usually [[hematite]] {{chem2|Fe2O3}} or [[magnetite]] {{chem2|Fe3O4}}, together with coke ([[coal]] that has been separately baked to remove volatile components). Air pre-heated to 900 \u00b0C is blown through the mixture, in sufficient amount to turn the carbon into [[carbon monoxide]]:<ref name=Greenwood1073/> \n:2 C + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO\nThis reaction raises the temperature to about 2000 \u00b0C The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore to metallic iron<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 CO \u2192 2 Fe + 3 CO<sub>2</sub>\nSome iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke:<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\n:2 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 C \u2192 4 Fe + 3 CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nA [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] such as [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) or [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] (calcium-magnesium carbonate) is also added to the furnace's load. Its purpose is to remove silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the furnace. The heat of the furnace decomposes the carbonates to [[calcium oxide]], which reacts with any excess [[silica]] to form a [[slag]] composed of [[calcium silicate]] {{chem2|CaSiO3}} or other products. At the furnace's temperature, the metal and the slag are both molten. They collect at the bottom as two immiscible liquid layers (with the slag on top), that are then easily separated.<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\nThe slag can be used as a material in [[road]] construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for [[agriculture]].<ref name=\"Biddle\" />\n[[File:LightningVolt Iron Ore Pellets.jpg|thumb|This heap of iron ore pellets will be used in steel production.]]\n\n====Steelmaking====\n{{Main|Steelmaking|Ironworks}}\n[[File:Melted raw-iron.jpg|thumb|right|A pot of molten iron being used to make steel]]\n<!-- Several other articles cover the material that might go into this section: please do not expand it excessively. This article concerns all aspects of the element iron, and should thus NOT be overburdened with details of metallurgy... Agree. Should be a summary. -->\nIn general, the pig iron produced by the blast furnace process contains up to 4\u20135% carbon, with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus, and manganese. The high level of carbon makes it relatively weak and brittle. Reducing the amount of carbon to 0.002\u20132.1% by mass produces [[steel]], which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron. A great variety of steel articles can then be made by [[cold working]], [[hot rolling]], [[forging]], [[machining]], etc. Removing the other impurities, instead, results in cast iron, which is used to cast articles in [[foundry|foundries]]; for example stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts, and rails.<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\n\nSteel products often undergo various [[heat treatment]]s after they are forged to shape. [[annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] consists of heating them to 700\u2013800&nbsp;\u00b0C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.<ref name=Verhoeven>Verhoeven, J.D. (1975) ''Fundamentals of Physical Metallurgy'', Wiley, New York, p. 326</ref>\n<!--why is this in production of iron?Steel may be hardened by [[cold working]]. The metal is bent or hammered into its final shape at a relatively cool temperature. Cold forging is the stamping of a piece of steel into shape by a heavy press. Wrenches are commonly made by cold forging. Cold rolling, which involves making a thinner but harder sheet, and cold drawing, which makes a thinner but stronger wire, are two other methods of cold working. To harden the steel, it is heated to red-hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. If it is too hardened, it is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.\n\n[[Heat treatment]] is another way to harden steel. The steel is heated red-hot, then cooled quickly. The iron carbide molecules are decomposed by the heat, but do not have time to reform. Since the free carbon atoms are stuck, it makes the steel much harder and stronger than before.<ref name=\"Biddle\" />\n\nSometimes both toughness and hardness are desired. A process called [[case hardening]] may be used. Steel is heated to about 900&nbsp;\u00b0C then plunged into oil or water. Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard. The surface cools quickly, but the inside cools slowly, making an extremely hard surface and a durable, resistant inner layer.\n\nIron may be [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by dipping it into a concentrated [[nitric acid]] solution. This forms a protective layer of oxide on the metal, protecting it from further corrosion.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/map/Passivating_Pickling_EN.pdf |title=Picking and passivating stainless steel, Materials and Application Series, Volume 4 |publisher=Euro Inox |year=2007 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-2-87997-224-4}}</ref>-->\n\n=== Direct iron reduction ===\nOwing to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have been developed. \"[[Direct reduced iron|Direct iron reduction]]\" [[Sponge iron reaction|reduces iron ore]] to a ferrous lump called [[sponge iron|\"sponge\" iron]] or \"direct\" iron that is suitable for steelmaking.<ref name=\"Biddle\" /> Two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process:\n\nNatural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):<ref name=Biddle/>\n:2 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO + 4 H<sub>2</sub>\n\nIron ore is then treated with these gases in a furnace, producing solid sponge iron:<ref name=Biddle/>\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + CO + 2 H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 Fe + CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n[[Silica]] is removed by adding a [[limestone]] flux as described above.<ref name=Biddle/>\n\n===Thermite process===\n{{Main|Thermite}}\nIgnition of a mixture of aluminium powder and iron oxide yields metallic iron via the [[thermite reaction]]:\n\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2 Al \u2192 2 Fe + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n\nAlternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including [[finery forge]]s, [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] furnaces, [[Bessemer converter]]s, [[open hearth furnace]]s, [[basic oxygen furnace]]s, and [[electric arc furnace]]s. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.<ref name=Greenwood1072/><!-- why is this in production? The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content: the higher the percentage of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the malleability. The properties of the steel can also be changed by several methods.-->\n\n==Applications==\n\n===As structural material===\nIron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for over 90% of worldwide metal production.<!-- The UGSG gives a production of iron including recycling with 998Mt, while aluminium (39Mt), copper (18Mt), zinc (11Mt) and lead (8.6Mt) add up to 77 Mt, all including recycling. This more like 8% than 5.--> Its low cost and high strength often make it the material of choice material to withstand stress or transmit forces, such as the construction of machinery and [[machine tool]]s, [[track (rail transport)|rails]], [[automobile]]s, [[hull (ship)|ship hulls]], [[rebar|concrete reinforcing bars]], and the load-carrying framework of buildings.

Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2\u20134% carbon, 1\u20136% silicon, and small amounts of [[manganese]].<ref name=Greenwood1073/> Pig iron has a [[melting point]] in the range of 1420\u20131470&nbsp;K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together.<ref name=Greenwood1075/> Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.<ref name=Greenwood1074/>\n\n\"White\" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of [[cementite]], or iron carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C).<ref name=Greenwood1074/> This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723&nbsp;\u00b0C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and \u03b1-iron, which is soft and malleable and is called [[pearlite]] for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle [[martensite]]. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite.

It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion about 55&nbsp;picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\nWhen deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a [[hydrogen bond]] with it. This results in the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe\u2013O\u2013O bond angle of around 120\u00b0 that avoids the formation of Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe or Fe\u2013O<sub>2</sub>\u2013Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> As described by the [[Bohr effect]] (named after [[Christian Bohr]], the father of [[Niels Bohr]]), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\n[[File:Carboxyhemoglobin from 1AJ9.png|thumb|right|A heme unit of human [[carboxyhemoglobin]], showing the [[carbonyl ligand]] at the apical position, ''trans'' to the histidine residue.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Acta Crystallogr.

Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of [[cyanide]], but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a [[methionine]] sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen \u2013 with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in [[adenosine triphosphate]]. Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows:<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\n:4 Cytc<sup>2+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> + 8H{{su|p=+|b=inside}} \u2192 4 Cytc<sup>3+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 4H{{su|p=+|b=outside}}\n\nAlthough the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the [[iron-sulfur protein]]s are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is [[rubredoxin]], which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from [[cysteine]] residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the [[ferredoxin]]s, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\nThe ability of sea [[mussel]]s to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] iron-based bonds in their protein-rich [[cuticle]]s.

High blood levels of free ferrous iron react with [[peroxide]]s to produce highly reactive [[free radical]]s that can damage [[DNA]], [[proteins]], [[lipids]], and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of [[transferrin]] to bind the iron. Damage to the cells of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the [[heart]], [[liver]] and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include [[coma]], [[metabolic acidosis]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[liver failure]], [[coagulopathy]], [[adult respiratory distress syndrome]], long-term organ damage, and even death.<ref name=\"Cheney\" /> Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20&nbsp;milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60&nbsp;milligrams per kilogram is considered a [[lethal dose]].<ref name=\"emed-topic285\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic285.htm|title=Toxicity, Iron\n| publisher = Medscape|accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref> Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of [[ferrous sulfate]] tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six.<ref name=\"emed-topic285\" /> The [[Dietary Reference Intake]] (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45&nbsp;mg/day.
