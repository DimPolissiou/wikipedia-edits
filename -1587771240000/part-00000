The first book, ''[[The Outcasts (novel)|The Outcasts]]'' was released in Australia and the United States on 1 November 2011 and in New Zealand on 4 November 2011. The series is a spin-off from Flanagan's other highly popular series, ''[[Ranger's Apprentice]]'', but it focuses on new Skandian characters. It was published by Penguin in the US and Random House in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===''[[The Outcasts (novel)|The Outcasts]]''===\n12 years before the start of the novel, Mikkel, a trusted member of Erak's crew and Hal's father, dies on a raiding trip. Before his death he had his best friend, Thorn, promise that he would help Hal and Karina, Mikkel's wife and child. Thorn promises but loses his hand on the voyage back. Once in Skandia he becomes a drunk, however, Hal's mother Karina reminds Thorn of his promise to help Hal and employs him in her inn.\n\n12 years after his father died, Hal Mikkelson has become a boy who builds whatever he thinks of with the help of his best friend, Stig. At the same time he works with Anders, the local shipbuilder. During this time Hal builds a ship which he names the ''Heron'' after the unique sail design he employed on the ship to sail into the wind. After sailing the Heron, Hal beaches the ship and gets ready for Brotherband training. During Brotherband training, boys who are 16 in Skandia are taught the basics of fighting and ship navigation. For each brotherband a leader must be chosen \u2013 this year there are a total of 28 boys divided into 3 brotherbands: The Sharks, The Wolves, and The Herons. With Hal finding himself the unwilling leader of the Herons, made up of outcasts, he must step up to the challenge. Every Brotherband must participate in team and individual activities to earn points at the end of the Brotherband training the points are totaled up.\n\nWhile Brotherband training continues, a Skandian trading fleet is attacked and the leader of the pirates, Zavac, demands to know about the secret treasure of Skandia. The leader of the trading fleet vows not to tell until he sees that one of the pirates had grabbed his nephew. Knowing that his nephew shouldn\u2019t die for his mistakes the head of the trading fleet begins to tell about the treasure, the Andomal, knowing that it is well guarded. As he talks he remembers that one night every year it is not so well protected. The story again takes a turn towards the Herons where they have no chances of winning against the sharks and wolves. With competitions requiring more people, Herons usually found their way to success by using the boys' special skills. \n\nBut on one challenge when the bands had to show their navigation skills, the wolves got their ship damaged and were disqualified because they didn't have the ship required to complete the last challenge at sea. Luckily Herons jumped from third to second position, by the disqualifying of the wolves.\n\nWith two more challenges remaining, the Herons had to win and tie a challenge with the Sharks, to win brotherband training. Showing good tactics and strategy, the Herons tied the night guard challenge. And because of Hal being a splendid helmsmen, the Herons won the brotherband training by beating Sharks in the last sea challenge.\n\nOn winning the brotherband training they are honored with new and good weapons as well as Skandian helmets. Moreover, they also had to guard the Andomal for one night. But on this night Zavac stole the Andomal when the Herons were sleeping while guarding it.\n\nErak, the Oberjarl take away their weapons and helmets, along with Heron, the ship, and their victory, too. Knowing that they would be hated for the rest of their lives they leave Skandia on the Heron in pursuit of the Andomal.\n\n===''[[The Invaders (Brotherband)|The Invaders]]''===\nHal and his crew are chasing Zavac. After surviving a massive storm, they set out to continue their search for the pirates. They then camp at shelter bay for a few weeks, where they repair their ship and add the Mangler and the hull fin. Thorn also gives them battle drills. Afterward, they go to a small village to stock up on supplies. Meanwhile, Zavac and his crew invade Limmat, a small town with a high grade emerald mine, after one of Zavac's victims give up the town's secrets. Even though it is fortified, Zavac uses a captured trading vessel to get the boom opened and sails through.\n\nWhile Hal is going back to Shelter Bay, he sees ''Wolfwind'' and sails south for a day. While heading back they find Lydia, a girl from Limmat who tells them of the pirate attack. Hal thinks it may be Zavac so he continues back to Shelter Bay. ''Wolfwind'' ambushes them but ends up helping them. The next day, they start sailing to Limmat, and when they arrive, they see Zavac's ship. They therefore hide in the marshes where they find the town's people who had escaped the pirate attack. Hal forms a plan with the locals and when they attack it is a total success. After the attack Zavac slips away and cripples ''Wolfwind'', but the ship survives.\n\n===''[[The Hunters (Brotherband)|The Hunters]]''===\nHal and the crew start off by sailing to the river Dan in search of Zavac with the grudging assistance of Rikard, a captured man in the crew of a ship that helped Zavac attack and capture Limmat. As they near the mouth Ingvar gets a fever from his wound. The crew land on shore to cure him. While on shore Rikard escapes but is quickly tracked and captured by Thorn and Lydia. While this is happening, Ingvar is cured with willow tree bark and when Lydia and Thorn return, they are quickly sailing again. While sailing down the River, they stop at Krall. They find evidence of Zavac, but are accused of murdering Rikard. They are cleared and then are captured by the Gatmeister at Bayrath.\n\nThey are imprisoned but Lydia frees them. They then sail down Wildwater Rift and meet up with the SeaHawk. Her captain tells the Herons to stay behind him and the traders and they agree but are attacked by pirates further down river and the Herons save him and the traders. They are rewarded and have a feast at Drogha. Here, Hal finds out about Raguza (where Zavac is hiding) and its rules and regulations. Hal then poses as a pirate and gains entry in to Raguza. The Korpaljo asks what they are up to and they accuse Zavac of cheating them of emeralds. Zavac is called and an argument starts but the Korpaljo breaks it and takes half of Zavac's emeralds. Zavac then arranges for them to be killed but they fight Zavac's men off. The following day Zavac is expelled from Raguza. However, Hal challenges Zavac to a ship battle. The Herons win, retrieving the Andomal in the process, and return to Hallasholm.\n\n===''[[Slaves of Socorro]]''===\nHal and the Herons have returned home to Skandia after defeating the pirate captain Zavac and reclaiming Skandia's most prized artifact, the Andomal. Now Erak believes it is time for them to once again prove their worth. The crew of the Heron is asked to travel to Araluen and be the Skandians that serve in the country for the next year. Before they can arrive though, an old face returns. Tursgud, leader of the Shark Brotherband and Hal's constant opponent, has gained his own ship, and with his crew he's turned from a bullying youth into a pirate and slave trader. When Tursgud surfaces in Araluen and takes 12 citizens to turn into slaves, the Herons dispatch and pursue him with the help of one of Araluen's finest Rangers, Gilan, who also appears as an important character in Flanagan's other series, 'Ranger's Apprentice.'\n\n===''[[Scorpion Mountain]]''===\nHal, his Brotherband crew, and the Ranger Gilan have freed the twelve Araluens sold into slavery. After reaching the Royal Palace, the group is given a mission none of them expect. Princess Cassandra has recently survived an attempt on her life. Now whispers of a second attempt have reached the kingdom, and the deadly sect known as the Scorpion Cult is believed to be the culprit. An assassin who tries to take Cassandra's life gives up vital information on the cult during interrogation. The cult worships the goddess Imrika, and whenever anybody pays them, they make a compact called the ''tolfah, ''to kill the person the customer wants.\n\nThe crew of the Heron leaves to find the man who paid for the ''tolfah'', Iqbal, brother of the previous Tualaghi chief. They bring along the Ranger Gilan to help negotiate with the cult and ensure Cassandra's safety. While sailing they meet an old friend of Gilan's, the ''wakir'' Selethen. He tells the crew that Iqbal has taken over a city called Tabork along with a Hellenese man Philip Bloodyhand. Using a surprise takeover of an attack vessel of Phillip's, the Herons takeover the city after a bloody fight. They mortally wound Iqbal but find out the ''tolfah'' cannot be removed without the death of the Shurmel, the leader of the Scorpion cult. Ulf gets injured and has to stay in the port as the crew moves on to confront the cult.\n\nThey sail to the old Toscan colony of Ephesa so Hal, Stig and Gilan can go inland to Scorpion Mountain, the headquarters of the cult. There they go inland and find the remnants of an old Roman-style city. Hal notices the constant wind and makes a land-sailer to travel across the desert without a horse. He and Stig take Gilan inland to go and see the Shurmel to remove the tolfah. The remaining crew stays to defend against the ''Ishti'', a group of fighters owned by the Scorpion cult. At the mountain the trio is let in with the Scorpions believing that they have come to buy a tolfah. Gilan is upfront and tries to get it removed. The Shurmel is offended and challenges Gilan to a sword fight where he is defeated and killed. The trio moves to go back and meets Umar, a leader of the Bedullins who helped to free Erak in ''Erak's Ransom''. He wants to defeat the Scorpion cults and helps defeat the ''Ishti'' who were attacking the remaining Heron crew. The Heron crew leave after the battle to Araluen where they are relieved from duty to the kingdom. They sail back to Hallasholm where they meet a feast and are welcomed back into their country.\n\n===''[[The Ghostfaces]]''===\nWhen the Brotherband crew are caught in a massive storm at sea, they\u2019re blown far off course and wash up on the shores of a land so far west that Hal can\u2019t recognize it from any of his maps. Eerily, the locals are nowhere in sight, yet the Herons have a creeping feeling they are being watched.\n\nSuddenly the silence is broken when a massive, marauding bear appears, advancing on two children. The crew springs into action and rescues the children from the bear\u2019s clutches, which earns them the gratitude and friendship of the local Mawagansett tribe, who finally reveal themselves. But the peace is short-lived. The Ghostfaces, a ruthless, warlike tribe who shave their heads and paint their faces white, are on the warpath once more. It\u2019s been eight years since they raided the Mawagansett village, but they\u2019re coming back to pillage and reap destruction. As the enemy approaches, the Herons gear up to help their new friends repel an invasion.\n\n===''[[The Caldera]]''===\nStig, Ulf and Wulf compete in the annual Maktig contest to determine the supreme warrior in all of Skandia when an unexpected-and unwelcome-visitor at Stig's home changes plans. Olaf, Stig's father who had run away with his own shipmates' plunder some years past and thus made himself a widely hated man in Hallasholm, has a request for the Heron crew. He had become the palace guard commander of the city of Byzantos, but the Empress' son had been kidnapped by a fierce pirate named Myrgos and he needed to return the boy for fear of his life. Hal agrees to help him, and they set sail for Byzantos.\n\nAfter sailing through Krall and Bayrath, the Heron crew arrives in Byzantos, but Olaf is arrested-as the Empress had posted a reward for his capture. Once Wulf breaks him and Ulf out of jail, they continue to Cypra, where they find information on the whereabouts of Myrgos' base. It is placed on the side of a caldera: an extinct volcano that had formed a large lagoon when it last erupted. After evading Myrgos' ship in a squall, they make it to the caldera. Hal, Lydia and Olaf successfully extract the Empress' son out of the fortress, but Myrgos intercepts the Heron before the crew can make a clean getaway. However, the volcano, which had been rumbling ominously for some time, finally erupts, triggering a tidal wave that sinks Myrgos' ship but propels the Heron to safety, thanks to Hal's excellent helmsman skills. The crew returns to Byzantos, where Olaf is handsomely rewarded for returning the Empress' son to safety. Stig secretly speaks with his father, but when Olaf refuses to show regret for his past actions, Stig blackmails him into giving up most of his reward as recompense for all the shame that he and his mother had suffered over the years due to his actions, and the Herons return home.\n\n==The Royal Ranger Crossover==\n===''[[The Red Fox Clan]]''===\nThe ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s crew are sent to Araluen as Skandian ambassadors in Book 2 of the ''[[Ranger's Apprentice: The Royal Ranger]]'' series. It is part of the treaty renewal between Skandia and Araluen. Hal, Stig, and Thorn join Cassandra and Maddie on a hunt. They are present to request more archers for the upcoming year as Oberjarl Erak believes they are once again about to be invaded. They setsoff to help a stranded wolfship.\n\n===''[[Duel At Araluen]]''===\nIn this book, Maddie seeks the assistance of the ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s crew to free her father and Gilan from the hill fort in the north in Book 3 of ''[[Ranger's Apprentice: The Royal Ranger]]. Hal invented the [[Telescope]] with Maddie at the end of the book.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Hal Mikkelson''' \u2014 Hal is the main character of the series. He is half-Araluen and half-Skandian. Hal's father Mikkel was a successful Skandian warrior. Unfortunately, he was killed in a raid, leaving Hal and his Araluen mother living alone. Hal's mother was a former slave and now owned an inn/eating house. When Hal became 10 years old, Thorn, who went into a depression after Hal's father's death and the loss of his arm, became a mentor for Hal. He gave him weapons during Brotherband training and brought out his full potential (as well as his crew's) in fighting skills. Due to his mother being an Araluen, he looked different than other Skandians, and was ignored and bullied by his peers.  Hal is a resourceful person; he is the inventor of the double triangular sails which act similarly to seabirds' wings. It is also with the inspiration of seabirds that Hal names his ship ''Heron''. He is also the person who is mainly responsible for the liberation of Limmat and nearly lost his life while trying to save the Town and retrieve the Andomal from Zavac after its stolen from under their noses. Hal is also a very good swordsman and accurate with a crossbow. He is a great Navigator and Helmsmen and is smarter and quicker thinking than most other Skandians. A running gag throughout the books is Hal's tendency to miss out \"little details\" on his inventions, which promptly causes them to break and generally creates a mess, a fact that Stig and Thorn are fond of teasing Hal about. He is perhaps the character who is the closest to Lydia, though she seems to feel torn between Hal and Stig, and she also is fond of Ingvar somewhat like a favorite teddy bear.\n*'''Thorn Hookyhand''' \u2014 Thorn is a close friend of Hal's father, Mikkel. He lost his right hand during a storm at sea and was, in his early years, he won the Maktig (meaning \"the Mighty One\", a title for the greatest warrior in Skandia) three years in a row, which no one had ever done (the longest running besides him was only one year). Before that, he and Mikkel competed for Karina's affections, though Thorn lost to Mikkel, with Karina later becoming Hal's mother and Mikkel's wife. Despite so, Thorn bore no grudge over the matter, though he admittedly did consider how it would have been if things turned out differently at some point of time. He was described as an \"old drunk\" by the Skandians due to the fact that he drank excessively after he lost his hand and death of his friend. Karina, gave Thorn a job and stopped his drinking habit. She allowed Thorn to live in their lean-to and look after Hal as he needed \"a man's influence and guidance\". Soon, Thorn stopped drinking and found himself to be a helpful person. Hal makes a custom hook to place over his arm, and a war club to fit replace the hook when in battle. It gives him an extra edge in battle once more, and brings out his potential as a warrior. Thorn is greatly admired by the ''Heron'' crew as well as Lydia, who consistently believes that despite the loss of his hand and losing the title Maktig because of it, Thorn was still the greatest warrior of all. Thorn disposes his treasured Skandian Warrior headgear- a massive horned helmet he had worn for thirty years, in the third book, choosing instead to don on the ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s black watch cap as a member of the Heron Brotherband, which displayed the sheer amount of loyalty he held to the ''Heron'' crew despite the difference in age.\n*'''Mikkel \"Fastblade\"''' \u2014 Mikkel was Hal's father, but died from a thrown spear when Hal was young. He lost his life during a raid with Erak's crew, struck by a spear thrown by a sneaky townsman. It hit him under the arm and he died soon after. Mikkel and his best friend Thorn were Erak's most trusted and reliable warriors. With his dying breath, Mikkel made Thorn promise to look after his wife and child. Mikkel was a very skilled swordsmen and was faster than the average Skandian. It is revealed in the second book that he and Thorn had fought over Karina before, though Karina ultimately chose Mikkel over Thorn, and conceived a child which they named Hal.\n*'''Karina Mikkelswife''' \u2014 Karina is an Araluen slave who was freed by Mikkel, and later married him.. She is very beautiful and is sought out by many Skandian men. She is a loving and kind mother, although she usually disapproves of her son Hal's ideas (especially when they involved her kitchen). She brought Thorn out of his drinking habits and set his life back on track and also gave him a job. Karina runs an eating house in Hallasholm. In her early years, Karina's feelings were vied for by both Thorn and Mikkel (a scene later commented to be like Hal, Stig and Lydia's scenario). It was implied in the third book that Karina had struggled over whom to pick and had spent a long time over it, though she picked Mikkel in the end and bore his child named Hal. Later, after the Heron's success, she and Thorn decide to marry.\n*'''Stig Olafson''' \u2014 Stig is Hal's best friend and first mate of Hal's crew. He met Hal when he was stealing lobster and slipped into the ocean near Hal's fishing spot. Stig, unable to swim, was saved when Hal jumped in and pulled him out of the water, thus starting their strong bond and friendship. Stig is treated as an outcast because his father had stolen money and jewels from his crew's wolfship, then disappeared without a trace, not telling anyone where he was going. His mother works as a washerwoman, which he is embarrassed about. Stig has a habit of losing his temper but learns to control it through time. He is very athletic and considered the best warrior in the Heron Brotherband, though he never lets this get into his head and still respect Hal's decisions as the skirl. Stig tends to be awkward around girls his age, in which he either speaks too little or much. It is hinted and shown that he has feelings for Lydia just like Hal, though he refuses to let it come between him and Hal.He almost left the crew when he met Tecumsa, a extremely beautiful girl from the Mawangasset, which is a tribe across the endless sea.\n*'''Tursgud''' \u2014 Tursgud is the antagonist in the first book. He is the leader of the Shark Brotherband. Notorious for his arrogance and cruelty, he is disliked by the members of the Heron and Wolf Brotherbands, as well as most of the Sharks. His father is the current Maktig which gives him even more to boast about. In the third book, he openly insults the Heron Brotherband again out of jealousy and went as far as to call Lydia a \"scullery maid\", prompting Ingvar to knock him out in a single blow. He becomes a pirate and slave trader in the latter part of the series. He later dies when his ship, the Nightwolf, sinks underwater on a harbor in soccoro.\n*'''Rollond''' \u2014 Rollond is a fair person who knows what's right, and has common sense. For this, he is popular and is liked by many people. He is the leader of the Wolf Brotherband and dislikes Tursgud. He helped the Herons on numerous occasions, but his team was disqualified from Brotherband training because their ship was ruined in a navigation test during an unsuccessful tacking maneuver. Since they couldn't compete in the last task, they were disqualified. He showed affections for Lydia which she rejected but eventually falls in love and becomes engaged with a girl named Frieda, much to Lydia's hidden jealousy.\n*'''Erak Starfollower''' \u2014 Erak is skirl of the ship, ''Wolfwind'', that Mikkel and Thorn served on. He is now the most powerful person in Skandia, the Oberjarl. Erak has a comical bond with Thorn; while the two insult and tease each other, they clearly still hold a close friendship and care about each other. Erak's nose is considered to be a \"trifle on the large side\", in which he dislikes any reference to it. He is a respected warrior and is inseparable from his ship, The ''Wolfwind''. He claims to be a patron of the arts but in truth is a collector of anything. He is very attached to his axe and his silver staff.\n*'''Ingvar''' \u2014 Ingvar is an extremely strong and solidly built sixteen-year-old boy who is  good at fighting but has problems with eyesight meaning he would do more harm than good in battle. He is in Hal's brotherband, the Herons, and the only person who can load Hal's giant crossbow, the Mangler because of his immense strength and muscle. He is extremely loyal to Hal and has enormous faith in Hal's abilities as a warrior and Navigator. He is also close in a way to Lydia, who joined the crew after her grandfather's death. Despite his poor eyesight, he is able to differentiate between the Heron crew members and enemies by the watch hats Edvin knitted, and has also learnt to see without the need of using his eyes (taught by Thorn), simply by closing his eyes and envisioning the scene clearly as it is. After he becomes disheartened about his eyesight, Hal makes him a sort of early pair of spectacles out of tortoiseshell making him a formidable warrior. He uses the voulge, a weapon with a triple warhead with a hook, spearhead, and an axhead. In the words of Thorn he is a \"monster who's on the right side.\"\n*'''Jesper''' \u2014 Jesper is one of the members of Hal's crew in the Heron Brotherband. Jesper was a thief and has been known to steal bracelets off people's wrists while talking to them just to prove he had the skill. He does however always return them, just because he likes the joy of it. Jesper is also a very fast runner as people do not appreciate him stealing their things, but known to complain (which has sparked Hal, Stig and Thorn's ire on several occasions). He also is very good at picking locks and stealth. Despite leaving those days behind him, he still keeps his lock picking tools, which he uses to break them out of jail in the [[The Invaders (Brotherband)|third book]].\n*'''Edvin''' \u2014 Edvin is a member of the Heron Brotherband. When he disagrees with people he makes it quite clear. He is usually the first member of the Heron's to voice thoughts, his tongue sometimes getting him into trouble. Despite his small build, he is quite resourceful and skilled at cooking. He trains as a healer for a couple of weeks during Brotherband training, and helps save Ingvar's life when the boy was shot by an arrow. Edvin is also trained as the helmsman in battle when Hal's using the Mangler and Stig is boarding enemy craft. He also knows how to knit (an activity that was, at first, mocked by his friends), but is later paid by Hal to make the crew; including Lydia and Thorn, dark wool watch caps as the Heron's headgear. The caps later gain a new Heron patch on them.\n*'''Stefan''' \u2014 Stefan is the wise-guy and mimic of the Herons. He regularly makes impressive comebacks, and when you hear someone, you can never tell if it's he/she or Stefan. He is a sail handler and rower on the ''Heron''. He likes and admires Hal for his leadership skills and qualities. His sharp wit is only aimed at those who have large egos or boastful without being able to back it up, like Tursgud. In the third book, he created a saga entitled \"The Saga of Hal and the Heron Brotherband.\" along with Jesper, which they sang at the party celebrating the Heron Brotherband's return.\n* '''Ulf''' and '''Wulf''' \u2014 Ulf and Wulf are the two twins in the Heron Brotherband and are sail handlers for the Heron. Like most twins, there is a special bond between them. They swear at each other and make nasty remarks about the other's appearance (even though they look exactly the same so no one, not even their mother, can tell them apart) and are constantly fighting. However, when sail handling, they work like well oiled clockwork, a fact that surprises Hal. Despite their antagonising, Ulf and Wulf do hold a special bond, and it is hinted that they some times argue on purpose simply to amuse the Heron Brotherband and lift their spirits when a difficult task lay ahead. They also obey the rule laid down by Hal which says they can't fight on board ship, on the grounds that they don't want to be tossed overboard by Ingvar. Despite trying to get each other in trouble and fighting regularly, if someone tries to harm one of the twins, the other twin will turn on him/her with vengeance. They show their hidden affection after Ulf gets injured at Tabork.\n*'''Sigurd''' \u2014 Sigurd is the organizer of brotherband training. He along with three others (one for each brotherband) run the show. He has been known to encourage a little bit of cheating.\n*'''Zavac''' \u2014 Zavac is a captain of the Magyaran pirate ship, the ''Raven''. When he arrives at Hallasholm, he arrives in a trader ship which is supposedly damaged, in order to steal the Andomal, Skandia's most prized artifact, right under the noses of the Heron Brotherband. He also raided the town Limmat to steal the secret emerald deposit that is hidden there. He is brutal and merciless, with no qualms about betraying his fellow pirates. During the invasion of Limmat, he abandons his fellow pirates to save his own life and keeps all of the treasure. He is eventually hunted down and killed by the Herons when they reclaim the Andomal, Thorn made sure he went down with his ship (by trapping him in his sleeping cabin), the ''Raven'', when he was about to kill Hal during the ship duel.\n*'''Lydia''' \u2014 16-year-old Lydia lived in the town of Limmat, and has long dark glossy hair and olive skin, and is described by the ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s crew as stunningly beautiful. In the battle led by Zavac, her grandfather was killed while trying to defend the city. She leaves her home and helps the Herons in the battle against Zavac and goes hunting for Zavac after deciding to leave Limmat after the battle with the Heron Brotherband. She is extremely accurate with an atlatl and an expert tracker due to her hunting background. Thorn admires the younger girl greatly and to tease her as a sign of affection and respect. Lydia's affections are generally fought for by both Hal and Stig, of which she showed great reluctance to choose between them until Karina advises her not to be in a hurry to do so until she knew and was ready. She seems to also like and admire Ingvar, and the two quickly form a one-of-a kind bond. It is hinted she does have an interest in them as more than friends when she shows slight jealousy upon seeing Hal and Stig receiving much attention from other girls. Lydia is typically tough and tomboyish, though she later displays a more girlish side of herself when she despairs over what to wear to the party of Hallasholm with Karina coming to her aid.\n*'''Barat''' \u2014 Barat is the commander of the town guard in Limmat. He is extremely pig-headed, arrogant and has no faith in Hal or his crew. After the taking back the town, he takes credit for the attack and announces he will marry Lydia (who later leaves) and it is thought that he will run for mayor after the previous mayor's death during the pirate raid.\n*'''Rikard''' \u2013 Rikard was the first mate to Captain Nagy, a magyaran captain. He reveals the location of Zavac and attempts to escape but is caught. At Krall he is killed by Vargas for betraying Zavac.\n*'''Vargas''' \u2013 Vargas is the loyal third mate to Zavac. He was at Krall buying rope for the Raven but spots the Heron's and warns Zavac that they are being followed. Then in Raguza, he leads the ambush on four of the Herons and is killed.\n*'''Andras''' \u2013 Andras is the second mate of the Raven. He thinks that Zavac is not in tune with his ship and is not a good helmsman and that only speed had saved them from the Heron but if they versed a ship with similar speed, they would lose which he ends up being correct. He is killed in the battle against the Heron.\n*'''Mihaly''' \u2013 Mihaly is a pirate and now Korpaljo of Raguza. He is a deadly opponent with great skill in swordsmanship, and using his daggers as well as fast and agile. He is very controlling and hates it when things don't go his way, but he is fair and will not hesitate to protect Raguza.\n*'''Mannaoc''' \u2013 Mannaoc is the captain of the ''Seahawk''. He is a part of a ship escort service which protects traders for a fee from pirates and outlaws. He also knows a lot about Raguza and tells Hal what the rules in are in Raguza and how to gain entry. He is infamous in Raguza for destroying many ships and he is a deadly enemy.\n*'''Kloof''' \u2013 Kloof is a huge mountain dog that Hal ran into in the fourth book. She was a rescue dog and is now Hal's pet. She loves to play tug-a-war with the ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s crew. She also chews on anything she can get her teeth sunk into including, unfortunately for Hal, Erak's prized axe. She is very fond of Hal. Kloof also takes part in battles and is very vicious towards anyone who intends to harm her master.\n*'''Myrgos''' \u2013 Mygros is featured in the 7th book and is an evil pirate, who lives in a mountain lair on santorillous.\n\n==Important items==\n*'''The Andomal''' \u2014 This is a huge amber sphere (about 25 centimeters in diameter) with a reptilian claw in the middle believed to come from a dragon. This artifact has been treasured by Skandians for centuries and is kept in a shrine (the Tabernacle) on a hill close to Hallasholm. It is then stolen by Zavac and his crew while the Heron Brotherband is guarding it.\n*'''The ''Heron''''' \u2014 The ''Heron'' is Hal's ship. Hal was helping a ship-maker build it, and it was originally intended for an old man who later died. Then, as he wanted a ship, Hal bought it and finished building it, but adding a few of his own inventions. The ship is about half the size of a regular Skandian wolfship and carries 8 oars aside. He outfitted the ship with several upgrades, one being his ingenious triangular double [[sail]] plan which allows him to sail about 45 degrees into the wind instead of only 15, three times more than a normal wolfship. Because Hal based this design off of a heron (because of its wing-shaped sail, and how it makes his ship glide over the water like a bird), he named his ship after a heron. Another upgrade is a daggerboard (fin) that is slightly off centre which is inserted through the bottom of the boat; this allows the sail handlers to trim the sails even more and get a greater speed out of the boat. The last improvement to the Heron is a giant crossbow, the Mangler, at the front of the ship, which is on a swiveled platform, but difficult to handle unless you are very strong. This puts Ingvar in charge of loading it.\n*'''The ''Raven''''' \u2014 The ''Raven'' is a Magyaran pirate ship that is captained by Zavac. It has a black hull and a large metal ram at the end of it. This ship is very fast and with its ram, it is a force to be reckoned with. It has 10 oars to a side, which makes it good for handling, and raiding other ships. Zavac has a small sleeping quarter where he keeps personal valuable items, such as the Andomal.\n*'''''Wolfwind''''' \u2014 ''Wolfwind'' is Erak's beloved ship. This ship served Erak for many raiding seasons but when he became Oberjarl, he had to give the ship to his loyal first mate Svengal while he wasn't raiding. In the second book, the ''Raven'' nearly sinks ''Wolfwind'' with its ram, but ''Wolfwind'' is saved by the ''Heron'' Brotherband who had to make the difficult decision between their fellow ship or Zavac escaping. The Heron saved it just in time.\n*'''The ''Porpoise''''' \u2013 The ''Porpoise'' is a Skandian trading ship that is used for brotherband training. It is captained by Tursgud who used it to win the first navigation competition when the ''Heron'' gave up the lead to save the Wolf Brotherband and their ship, the ''Lynx''.\n*'''The ''Lynx''''' \u2014 The ''Lynx'' is another Skandian trading ship that was used for brotherband training. It was captained by Rollond, but in the sailing race, it got run aground and was put out of action, thereby disqualifying the Wolves\n*'''The ''Seahawk''''' \u2013 The ship of Mannaoc. This ship is an escort for traders and is a good fighting vessel and has a square sail.\n\n==Weapons==\n*'''Battleaxe''' \u2013 A specialized axe designed for fighting. This weapon is extremely popular in Skandia.\n*'''Sword''' \u2013 A weapon good for stabbing and slashing. Used by Skandians who have a small build. It is also used around the world in many different places, but design and technique varies.\n*'''Broadsword''' \u2013 A larger version of a sword and used with two hands. Deals more damage because of the added weight, but is more difficult to wield. Like the axe, it is fairly popular with Skandians.\n*'''Spear''' \u2013 A long wooden pole (varies in size) with a sharp metal blade. An excellent weapon as it can be used as a pike or lance. These are popular with Skandians although not as much so as the axe or broadsword.\n*'''Atlatl''' \u2013 An unusual weapon with a wooden handle that helps to throw metal tipped darts longer distance, and is quite effective if in the hands of an expert. It is not heard of to be wielded by Skandians, but is used by some people.\n*'''Longbow''' \u2013 A long bow that can shoot over great distances, which varies depending on draw weight. Skandians do not use these often, but archers in other countries such as Araluen do.\n*'''Crossbow'''  \u2013 A bow propelled by a trigger that can cover varying distances depending on size and type/power of string. It is very rare to find crossbows in Skandia but they may be found in the plunder of Skandian raiders. Used by only a handful of people.\n*'''Saxe Knife''' \u2013 A large broad knife used by most Skandians and Rangers. It serves as an excellent tool as well as a weapon if regular weapons are not in reach.\n*'''Mangler''' \u2013 A giant crossbow mounted on top of the ''Heron''. It was created by Hal and named by the crew. It shoots long iron bolts or fire bolts that deal a great amount of damage and is very hard to load and is loaded by the strongest on the ship, Ingvar. Lydia helps him with this task.\n*'''Voulge -''' A cross between a heavy spear and a long handled axe, this Araluen weapon is chiefly used by Ingvar after he gains better eyesight in ''Scorpion Mountain''.\n\n==Places of interest==\n*'''Hallasholm''' \u2013 The capital of Skandia. This is the where Erak rules the whole of Skandia as well as an excellent harbor. The Andomal is also kept here until Zavac steals it right under the noses of the Heron Brotherband after winning the Brotherband training. For this reason, they chase Zavac to gain back the Andomal as well as their honour.\n*'''Shelter Bay''' \u2013 This is where Hal and his crew shelter from the massive storm that hits the east coast of the Stormwhite begins. The crew start to fight and bicker while staying here because of lack of activity, but Thorn begins training them in speed, agility and weapon skills to enhance their skills learned in Brotherband training. This is also the birthplace of the Mangler and the center lee board, both Hal's inventions to increase their chance of beating Zavac when the time comes.\n*'''Skeagall''' \u2013 A small trading village where Hal and his crew travels to for supplies. They hear vague rumors of pirates from here.\n*'''Limmat''' \u2013 A large town next to a harbor. This town is extremely well fortified with a large palisade, two large watchtowers and a massive boom across the harbor mouth. This town is fairly normal except for one thing, it has a secret emerald mine at the bottom of the cliff in a \"barn\" behind the town. This was a secret to Zavac until he tortures a Gallican trader who eventually gives in and tells him.\n*'''Raguza''' \u2013 A large, wealthy \"city\", the capital of Magyara, that gives pirates and raiders a place of safety for a price of one-tenth of their plunder. It is ruled by the Korpaljo (Mihaly), the leader of the Korpal who rule the town. Although there are multiple people in the Korpal (which means \"circle\") the only real power is bestowed upon the Korpaljo. Although, the Korpal are the only people who can elect a Korpaljo, and have an influence on the town, though not as much so as the Korpaljo. It is a peaceful place with no fighting allowed, for the sake of keeping the city sane and doesn't tear the city apart (because as we all know pirates aren't known to get along well with others).\n*'''Krall''' \u2013 A small river town with a rope manufactory plant on the river Dan.\n*'''Bayrath''' \u2013 A large town governed by the Gatmeister (a mayor) on the River Dan. Here the river narrows and a boom stretches across the river. A hefty fine is paid to the Gatmeister to go through to the other side.\n*'''Drogha''' \u2013 A general town on the river Dan home to a fighting ship escort service.\n*'''Ephesa'''- An old Toscan colonial town. It was once very prized but has been left in disrepair since the Toscan empire left. It serves a staging ground in the fifth book.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.worldofjohnflanagan.com/the-brotherband-chronicles/ Official website]\n\n{{John Flanagan}}\n\n[[Category:Brotherband books]]\n[[Category:21st-century Australian novels]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novel series]]\n[[Category:Australian fantasy novel series]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=October 2011}}\n{{unreferenced|date=May 2016}}\n{{cleanup |reason=use of contractions and \"you\". |date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox book series\n| name             = Brotherband\n| image            =  \n| image_caption    = Australian cover of ''The Outcasts''\n| books            = {{Plainlist|\n* ''[[The Outcasts (novel)|The Outcasts]]''\n* ''[[The Invaders (novel)|The Invaders]]''\n* ''[[The Hunters (Brotherband)|The Hunters]]''\n* ''[[Slaves of Socorro]]''\n* ''[[Scorpion Mountain]]''\n* ''[[The Ghostfaces]]''\n* ''[[The Caldera]]''\n* ''[[Return of the Temujai]]''\n}}\n| author           = [[John Flanagan (author)|John Flanagan]]\n| illustrator      = \n| country          = {{AUS}}\n| language         = [[English language|English]]\n| genre            = [[Fantasy literature|Fantasy]], [[Adventure novel|Adventure]]\n| publisher        = [[Random House]] (AUS & NZ) <br /> [[Penguin Group|Philomel]] (US)<!--  & CAN)<br />[[Yearling Books]] (UK)-->\n| pub_date         = 1 November 2011\u2013 \n| media_type       = Print [[Paperback]] & [[Hardcover]] <br /> [[E-book]]\n}}\n\n'''''Brotherband''''' is a series of fantasy novels written by Australian author [[John Flanagan (author)|John Flanagan]]. The first book, ''[[The Outcasts (novel)|The Outcasts]]'' was released in Australia and the United States on 1 November 2011 and in New Zealand on 4 November 2011. The series is a spin-off from Flanagan's other highly popular series, ''[[Ranger's Apprentice]]'', but it focuses on new Skandian characters. It was published by Penguin in the US and Random House in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===''[[The Outcasts (novel)|The Outcasts]]''===\n12 years before the start of the novel, Mikkel, a trusted member of Erak's crew and Hal's father, dies on a raiding trip. Before his death he had his best friend, Thorn, promise that he would help Hal and Karina, Mikkel's wife and child. Thorn promises but loses his hand on the voyage back. Once in Skandia he becomes a drunk, however, Hal's mother Karina reminds Thorn of his promise to help Hal and employs him in her inn.\n\n12 years after his father died, Hal Mikkelson has become a boy who builds whatever he thinks of with the help of his best friend, Stig. At the same time he works with Anders, the local shipbuilder. During this time Hal builds a ship which he names the ''Heron'' after the unique sail design he employed on the ship to sail into the wind. After sailing the Heron, Hal beaches the ship and gets ready for Brotherband training. During Brotherband training, boys who are 16 in Skandia are taught the basics of fighting and ship navigation. For each brotherband a leader must be chosen \u2013 this year there are a total of 28 boys divided into 3 brotherbands: The Sharks, The Wolves, and The Herons. With Hal finding himself the unwilling leader of the Herons, made up of outcasts, he must step up to the challenge. Every Brotherband must participate in team and individual activities to earn points at the end of the Brotherband training the points are totaled up.\n\nWhile Brotherband training continues, a Skandian trading fleet is attacked and the leader of the pirates, Zavac, demands to know about the secret treasure of Skandia. The leader of the trading fleet vows not to tell until he sees that one of the pirates had grabbed his nephew. Knowing that his nephew shouldn\u2019t die for his mistakes the head of the trading fleet begins to tell about the treasure, the Andomal, knowing that it is well guarded. As he talks he remembers that one night every year it is not so well protected. The story again takes a turn towards the Herons where they have no chances of winning against the sharks and wolves. With competitions requiring more people, Herons usually found their way to success by using the boys' special skills. \n\nBut on one challenge when the bands had to show their navigation skills, the wolves got their ship damaged and were disqualified because they didn't have the ship required to complete the last challenge at sea. Luckily Herons jumped from third to second position, by the disqualifying of the wolves.\n\nWith two more challenges remaining, the Herons had to win and tie a challenge with the Sharks, to win brotherband training. Showing good tactics and strategy, the Herons tied the night guard challenge. And because of Hal being a splendid helmsmen, the Herons won the brotherband training by beating Sharks in the last sea challenge.\n\nOn winning the brotherband training they are honored with new and good weapons as well as Skandian helmets. Moreover, they also had to guard the Andomal for one night. But on this night Zavac stole the Andomal when the Herons were sleeping while guarding it.\n\nErak, the Oberjarl take away their weapons and helmets, along with Heron, the ship, and their victory, too. Knowing that they would be hated for the rest of their lives they leave Skandia on the Heron in pursuit of the Andomal.\n\n===''[[The Invaders (Brotherband)|The Invaders]]''===\nHal and his crew are chasing Zavac. After surviving a massive storm, they set out to continue their search for the pirates. They then camp at shelter bay for a few weeks, where they repair their ship and add the Mangler and the hull fin. Thorn also gives them battle drills. Afterward, they go to a small village to stock up on supplies. Meanwhile, Zavac and his crew invade Limmat, a small town with a high grade emerald mine, after one of Zavac's victims give up the town's secrets. Even though it is fortified, Zavac uses a captured trading vessel to get the boom opened and sails through.\n\nWhile Hal is going back to Shelter Bay, he sees ''Wolfwind'' and sails south for a day. While heading back they find Lydia, a girl from Limmat who tells them of the pirate attack. Hal thinks it may be Zavac so he continues back to Shelter Bay. ''Wolfwind'' ambushes them but ends up helping them. The next day, they start sailing to Limmat, and when they arrive, they see Zavac's ship. They therefore hide in the marshes where they find the town's people who had escaped the pirate attack. Hal forms a plan with the locals and when they attack it is a total success. After the attack Zavac slips away and cripples ''Wolfwind'', but the ship survives.\n\n===''[[The Hunters (Brotherband)|The Hunters]]''===\nHal and the crew start off by sailing to the river Dan in search of Zavac with the grudging assistance of Rikard, a captured man in the crew of a ship that helped Zavac attack and capture Limmat. As they near the mouth Ingvar gets a fever from his wound. The crew land on shore to cure him. While on shore Rikard escapes but is quickly tracked and captured by Thorn and Lydia. While this is happening, Ingvar is cured with willow tree bark and when Lydia and Thorn return, they are quickly sailing again. While sailing down the River, they stop at Krall. They find evidence of Zavac, but are accused of murdering Rikard. They are cleared and then are captured by the Gatmeister at Bayrath.\n\nThey are imprisoned but Lydia frees them. They then sail down Wildwater Rift and meet up with the SeaHawk. Her captain tells the Herons to stay behind him and the traders and they agree but are attacked by pirates further down river and the Herons save him and the traders. They are rewarded and have a feast at Drogha. Here, Hal finds out about Raguza (where Zavac is hiding) and its rules and regulations. Hal then poses as a pirate and gains entry in to Raguza. The Korpaljo asks what they are up to and they accuse Zavac of cheating them of emeralds. Zavac is called and an argument starts but the Korpaljo breaks it and takes half of Zavac's emeralds. Zavac then arranges for them to be killed but they fight Zavac's men off. The following day Zavac is expelled from Raguza. However, Hal challenges Zavac to a ship battle. The Herons win, retrieving the Andomal in the process, and return to Hallasholm.\n\n===''[[Slaves of Socorro]]''===\nHal and the Herons have returned home to Skandia after defeating the pirate captain Zavac and reclaiming Skandia's most prized artifact, the Andomal. Now Erak believes it is time for them to once again prove their worth. The crew of the Heron is asked to travel to Araluen and be the Skandians that serve in the country for the next year. Before they can arrive though, an old face returns. Tursgud, leader of the Shark Brotherband and Hal's constant opponent, has gained his own ship, and with his crew he's turned from a bullying youth into a pirate and slave trader. When Tursgud surfaces in Araluen and takes 12 citizens to turn into slaves, the Herons dispatch and pursue him with the help of one of Araluen's finest Rangers, Gilan, who also appears as an important character in Flanagan's other series, 'Ranger's Apprentice.'\n\n===''[[Scorpion Mountain]]''===\nHal, his Brotherband crew, and the Ranger Gilan have freed the twelve Araluens sold into slavery. After reaching the Royal Palace, the group is given a mission none of them expect. Princess Cassandra has recently survived an attempt on her life. Now whispers of a second attempt have reached the kingdom, and the deadly sect known as the Scorpion Cult is believed to be the culprit. An assassin who tries to take Cassandra's life gives up vital information on the cult during interrogation. The cult worships the goddess Imrika, and whenever anybody pays them, they make a compact called the ''tolfah, ''to kill the person the customer wants.\n\nThe crew of the Heron leaves to find the man who paid for the ''tolfah'', Iqbal, brother of the previous Tualaghi chief. They bring along the Ranger Gilan to help negotiate with the cult and ensure Cassandra's safety. While sailing they meet an old friend of Gilan's, the ''wakir'' Selethen. He tells the crew that Iqbal has taken over a city called Tabork along with a Hellenese man Philip Bloodyhand. Using a surprise takeover of an attack vessel of Phillip's, the Herons takeover the city after a bloody fight. They mortally wound Iqbal but find out the ''tolfah'' cannot be removed without the death of the Shurmel, the leader of the Scorpion cult. Ulf gets injured and has to stay in the port as the crew moves on to confront the cult.\n\nThey sail to the old Toscan colony of Ephesa so Hal, Stig and Gilan can go inland to Scorpion Mountain, the headquarters of the cult. There they go inland and find the remnants of an old Roman-style city. Hal notices the constant wind and makes a land-sailer to travel across the desert without a horse. He and Stig take Gilan inland to go and see the Shurmel to remove the tolfah. The remaining crew stays to defend against the ''Ishti'', a group of fighters owned by the Scorpion cult. At the mountain the trio is let in with the Scorpions believing that they have come to buy a tolfah. Gilan is upfront and tries to get it removed. The Shurmel is offended and challenges Gilan to a sword fight where he is defeated and killed. The trio moves to go back and meets Umar, a leader of the Bedullins who helped to free Erak in ''Erak's Ransom''. He wants to defeat the Scorpion cults and helps defeat the ''Ishti'' who were attacking the remaining Heron crew. The Heron crew leave after the battle to Araluen where they are relieved from duty to the kingdom. They sail back to Hallasholm where they meet a feast and are welcomed back into their country.\n\n===''[[The Ghostfaces]]''===\nWhen the Brotherband crew are caught in a massive storm at sea, they\u2019re blown far off course and wash up on the shores of a land so far west that Hal can\u2019t recognize it from any of his maps. Eerily, the locals are nowhere in sight, yet the Herons have a creeping feeling they are being watched.\n\nSuddenly the silence is broken when a massive, marauding bear appears, advancing on two children. The crew springs into action and rescues the children from the bear\u2019s clutches, which earns them the gratitude and friendship of the local Mawagansett tribe, who finally reveal themselves. But the peace is short-lived. The Ghostfaces, a ruthless, warlike tribe who shave their heads and paint their faces white, are on the warpath once more. It\u2019s been eight years since they raided the Mawagansett village, but they\u2019re coming back to pillage and reap destruction. As the enemy approaches, the Herons gear up to help their new friends repel an invasion.\n\n===''[[The Caldera]]''===\nStig, Ulf and Wulf compete in the annual Maktig contest to determine the supreme warrior in all of Skandia when an unexpected-and unwelcome-visitor at Stig's home changes plans. Olaf, Stig's father who had run away with his own shipmates' plunder some years past and thus made himself a widely hated man in Hallasholm, has a request for the Heron crew. He had become the palace guard commander of the city of Byzantos, but the Empress' son had been kidnapped by a fierce pirate named Myrgos and he needed to return the boy for fear of his life. Hal agrees to help him, and they set sail for Byzantos.\n\nAfter sailing through Krall and Bayrath, the Heron crew arrives in Byzantos, but Olaf is arrested-as the Empress had posted a reward for his capture. Once Wulf breaks him and Ulf out of jail, they continue to Cypra, where they find information on the whereabouts of Myrgos' base. It is placed on the side of a caldera: an extinct volcano that had formed a large lagoon when it last erupted. After evading Myrgos' ship in a squall, they make it to the caldera. Hal, Lydia and Olaf successfully extract the Empress' son out of the fortress, but Myrgos intercepts the Heron before the crew can make a clean getaway. However, the volcano, which had been rumbling ominously for some time, finally erupts, triggering a tidal wave that sinks Myrgos' ship but propels the Heron to safety, thanks to Hal's excellent helmsman skills. The crew returns to Byzantos, where Olaf is handsomely rewarded for returning the Empress' son to safety. Stig secretly speaks with his father, but when Olaf refuses to show regret for his past actions, Stig blackmails him into giving up most of his reward as recompense for all the shame that he and his mother had suffered over the years due to his actions, and the Herons return home.\n\n==The Royal Ranger Crossover==\n===''[[The Red Fox Clan]]''===\nThe ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s crew are sent to Araluen as Skandian ambassadors in Book 2 of the ''[[Ranger's Apprentice: The Royal Ranger]]'' series. It is part of the treaty renewal between Skandia and Araluen. Hal, Stig, and Thorn join Cassandra and Maddie on a hunt. They are present to request more archers for the upcoming year as Oberjarl Erak believes they are once again about to be invaded.They sets off to help a stranded wolfship.\n\n===''[[Duel At Araluen]]''===\nIn this book, Maddie seeks the assistance of the ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s crew to free her father and Gilan from the hill fort in the north in Book 3 of ''[[Ranger's Apprentice: The Royal Ranger]]. Hal invented the [[Telescope]] with Maddie at the end of the book.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Hal Mikkelson''' \u2014 Hal is the main character of the series. He is half-Araluen and half-Skandian. Hal's father Mikkel was a successful Skandian warrior. Unfortunately, he was killed in a raid, leaving Hal and his Araluen mother living alone. Hal's mother was a former slave and now owned an inn/eating house. When Hal became 10 years old, Thorn, who went into a depression after Hal's father's death and the loss of his arm, became a mentor for Hal. He gave him weapons during Brotherband training and brought out his full potential (as well as his crew's) in fighting skills. Due to his mother being an Araluen, he looked different than other Skandians, and was ignored and bullied by his peers.  Hal is a resourceful person; he is the inventor of the double triangular sails which act similarly to seabirds' wings. It is also with the inspiration of seabirds that Hal names his ship ''Heron''. He is also the person who is mainly responsible for the liberation of Limmat and nearly lost his life while trying to save the Town and retrieve the Andomal from Zavac after its stolen from under their noses. Hal is also a very good swordsman and accurate with a crossbow. He is a great Navigator and Helmsmen and is smarter and quicker thinking than most other Skandians. A running gag throughout the books is Hal's tendency to miss out \"little details\" on his inventions, which promptly causes them to break and generally creates a mess, a fact that Stig and Thorn are fond of teasing Hal about. He is perhaps the character who is the closest to Lydia, though she seems to feel torn between Hal and Stig, and she also is fond of Ingvar somewhat like a favorite teddy bear.\n*'''Thorn Hookyhand''' \u2014 Thorn is a close friend of Hal's father, Mikkel. He lost his right hand during a storm at sea and was, in his early years, he won the Maktig (meaning \"the Mighty One\", a title for the greatest warrior in Skandia) three years in a row, which no one had ever done (the longest running besides him was only one year). Before that, he and Mikkel competed for Karina's affections, though Thorn lost to Mikkel, with Karina later becoming Hal's mother and Mikkel's wife. Despite so, Thorn bore no grudge over the matter, though he admittedly did consider how it would have been if things turned out differently at some point of time. He was described as an \"old drunk\" by the Skandians due to the fact that he drank excessively after he lost his hand and death of his friend. Karina, gave Thorn a job and stopped his drinking habit. She allowed Thorn to live in their lean-to and look after Hal as he needed \"a man's influence and guidance\". Soon, Thorn stopped drinking and found himself to be a helpful person. Hal makes a custom hook to place over his arm, and a war club to fit replace the hook when in battle. It gives him an extra edge in battle once more, and brings out his potential as a warrior. Thorn is greatly admired by the ''Heron'' crew as well as Lydia, who consistently believes that despite the loss of his hand and losing the title Maktig because of it, Thorn was still the greatest warrior of all. Thorn disposes his treasured Skandian Warrior headgear- a massive horned helmet he had worn for thirty years, in the third book, choosing instead to don on the ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s black watch cap as a member of the Heron Brotherband, which displayed the sheer amount of loyalty he held to the ''Heron'' crew despite the difference in age.\n*'''Mikkel \"Fastblade\"''' \u2014 Mikkel was Hal's father, but died from a thrown spear when Hal was young. He lost his life during a raid with Erak's crew, struck by a spear thrown by a sneaky townsman. It hit him under the arm and he died soon after. Mikkel and his best friend Thorn were Erak's most trusted and reliable warriors. With his dying breath, Mikkel made Thorn promise to look after his wife and child. Mikkel was a very skilled swordsmen and was faster than the average Skandian. It is revealed in the second book that he and Thorn had fought over Karina before, though Karina ultimately chose Mikkel over Thorn, and conceived a child which they named Hal.\n*'''Karina Mikkelswife''' \u2014 Karina is an Araluen slave who was freed by Mikkel, and later married him.. She is very beautiful and is sought out by many Skandian men. She is a loving and kind mother, although she usually disapproves of her son Hal's ideas (especially when they involved her kitchen). She brought Thorn out of his drinking habits and set his life back on track and also gave him a job. Karina runs an eating house in Hallasholm. In her early years, Karina's feelings were vied for by both Thorn and Mikkel (a scene later commented to be like Hal, Stig and Lydia's scenario). It was implied in the third book that Karina had struggled over whom to pick and had spent a long time over it, though she picked Mikkel in the end and bore his child named Hal. Later, after the Heron's success, she and Thorn decide to marry.\n*'''Stig Olafson''' \u2014 Stig is Hal's best friend and first mate of Hal's crew. He met Hal when he was stealing lobster and slipped into the ocean near Hal's fishing spot. Stig, unable to swim, was saved when Hal jumped in and pulled him out of the water, thus starting their strong bond and friendship. Stig is treated as an outcast because his father had stolen money and jewels from his crew's wolfship, then disappeared without a trace, not telling anyone where he was going. His mother works as a washerwoman, which he is embarrassed about. Stig has a habit of losing his temper but learns to control it through time. He is very athletic and considered the best warrior in the Heron Brotherband, though he never lets this get into his head and still respect Hal's decisions as the skirl. Stig tends to be awkward around girls his age, in which he either speaks too little or much. It is hinted and shown that he has feelings for Lydia just like Hal, though he refuses to let it come between him and Hal.He almost left the crew when he met Tecumsa, a extremely beautiful girl from the Mawangasset, which is a tribe across the endless sea.\n*'''Tursgud''' \u2014 Tursgud is the antagonist in the first book. He is the leader of the Shark Brotherband. Notorious for his arrogance and cruelty, he is disliked by the members of the Heron and Wolf Brotherbands, as well as most of the Sharks. His father is the current Maktig which gives him even more to boast about. In the third book, he openly insults the Heron Brotherband again out of jealousy and went as far as to call Lydia a \"scullery maid\", prompting Ingvar to knock him out in a single blow. He becomes a pirate and slave trader in the latter part of the series.He later dies when his ship, the Nightwolf, sinks underwater on a harbor in soccoro.\n*'''Rollond''' \u2014 Rollond is a fair person who knows what's right, and has common sense. For this, he is popular and is liked by many people. He is the leader of the Wolf Brotherband and dislikes Tursgud. He helped the Herons on numerous occasions, but his team was disqualified from Brotherband training because their ship was ruined in a navigation test during an unsuccessful tacking maneuver. Since they couldn't compete in the last task, they were disqualified. He showed affections for Lydia which she rejected but eventually falls in love and becomes engaged with a girl named Frieda, much to Lydia's hidden jealousy.\n*'''Erak Starfollower''' \u2014 Erak is skirl of the ship, ''Wolfwind'', that Mikkel and Thorn served on. He is now the most powerful person in Skandia, the Oberjarl. Erak has a comical bond with Thorn; while the two insult and tease each other, they clearly still hold a close friendship and care about each other. Erak's nose is considered to be a \"trifle on the large side\", in which he dislikes any reference to it. He is a respected warrior and is inseparable from his ship, The ''Wolfwind''. He claims to be a patron of the arts but in truth is a collector of anything. He is very attached to his axe and his silver staff.\n*'''Ingvar''' \u2014 Ingvar is an extremely strong and solidly built sixteen-year-old boy who is  good at fighting but has problems with eyesight meaning he would do more harm than good in battle. He is in Hal's brotherband, the Herons, and the only person who can load Hal's giant crossbow, the Mangler because of his immense strength and muscle. He is extremely loyal to Hal and has enormous faith in Hal's abilities as a warrior and Navigator. He is also close in a way to Lydia, who joined the crew after her grandfather's death. Despite his poor eyesight, he is able to differentiate between the Heron crew members and enemies by the watch hats Edvin knitted, and has also learnt to see without the need of using his eyes (taught by Thorn), simply by closing his eyes and envisioning the scene clearly as it is. After he becomes disheartened about his eyesight, Hal makes him a sort of early pair of spectacles out of tortoiseshell making him a formidable warrior.He uses the voulge, a weapon with a triple warhead with a hook, spearhead, and an axhead.In the words of Thorn he is a \"monster who's on the right side.\"\n*'''Jesper''' \u2014 Jesper is one of the members of Hal's crew in the Heron Brotherband. Jesper was a thief and has been known to steal bracelets off people's wrists while talking to them just to prove he had the skill. He does however always return them, just because he likes the joy of it. Jesper is also a very fast runner as people do not appreciate him stealing their things, but known to complain (which has sparked Hal, Stig and Thorn's ire on several occasions). He also is very good at picking locks and stealth. Despite leaving those days behind him, he still keeps his lock picking tools, which he uses to break them out of jail in the [[The Invaders (Brotherband)|third book]].\n*'''Edvin''' \u2014 Edvin is a member of the Heron Brotherband. When he disagrees with people he makes it quite clear. He is usually the first member of the Heron's to voice thoughts, his tongue sometimes getting him into trouble. Despite his small build, he is quite resourceful and skilled at cooking. He trains as a healer for a couple of weeks during Brotherband training, and helps save Ingvar's life when the boy was shot by an arrow. Edvin is also trained as the helmsman in battle when Hal's using the Mangler and Stig is boarding enemy craft. He also knows how to knit (an activity that was, at first, mocked by his friends), but is later paid by Hal to make the crew; including Lydia and Thorn, dark wool watch caps as the Heron's headgear. The caps later gain a new Heron patch on them.\n*'''Stefan''' \u2014 Stefan is the wise-guy and mimic of the Herons. He regularly makes impressive comebacks, and when you hear someone, you can never tell if it's he/she or Stefan. He is a sail handler and rower on the ''Heron''. He likes and admires Hal for his leadership skills and qualities. His sharp wit is only aimed at those who have large egos or boastful without being able to back it up, like Tursgud. In the third book, he created a saga entitled \"The Saga of Hal and the Heron Brotherband.\" along with Jesper, which they sang at the party celebrating the Heron Brotherband's return.\n* '''Ulf''' and '''Wulf''' \u2014 Ulf and Wulf are the two twins in the Heron Brotherband and are sail handlers for the Heron. Like most twins, there is a special bond between them. They swear at each other and make nasty remarks about the other's appearance (even though they look exactly the same so no one, not even their mother, can tell them apart) and are constantly fighting. However, when sail handling, they work like well oiled clockwork, a fact that surprises Hal. Despite their antagonising, Ulf and Wulf do hold a special bond, and it is hinted that they some times argue on purpose simply to amuse the Heron Brotherband and lift their spirits when a difficult task lay ahead. They also obey the rule laid down by Hal which says they can't fight on board ship, on the grounds that they don't want to be tossed overboard by Ingvar. Despite trying to get each other in trouble and fighting regularly, if someone tries to harm one of the twins, the other twin will turn on him/her with vengeance. They show their hidden affection after Ulf gets injured at Tabork.\n*'''Sigurd''' \u2014 Sigurd is the organizer of brotherband training. He along with three others (one for each brotherband) run the show. He has been known to encourage a little bit of cheating.\n*'''Zavac''' \u2014 Zavac is a captain of the Magyaran pirate ship, the ''Raven''. When he arrives at Hallasholm, he arrives in a trader ship which is supposedly damaged, in order to steal the Andomal, Skandia's most prized artifact, right under the noses of the Heron Brotherband. He also raided the town Limmat to steal the secret emerald deposit that is hidden there. He is brutal and merciless, with no qualms about betraying his fellow pirates. During the invasion of Limmat, he abandons his fellow pirates to save his own life and keeps all of the treasure. He is eventually hunted down and killed by the Herons when they reclaim the Andomal, Thorn made sure he went down with his ship (by trapping him in his sleeping cabin), the ''Raven'', when he was about to kill Hal during the ship duel.\n*'''Lydia''' \u2014 16-year-old Lydia lived in the town of Limmat, and has long dark glossy hair and olive skin, and is described by the ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s crew as stunningly beautiful. In the battle led by Zavac, her grandfather was killed while trying to defend the city. She leaves her home and helps the Herons in the battle against Zavac and goes hunting for Zavac after deciding to leave Limmat after the battle with the Heron Brotherband. She is extremely accurate with an atlatl and an expert tracker due to her hunting background. Thorn admires the younger girl greatly and to tease her as a sign of affection and respect. Lydia's affections are generally fought for by both Hal and Stig, of which she showed great reluctance to choose between them until Karina advises her not to be in a hurry to do so until she knew and was ready. She seems to also like and admire Ingvar, and the two quickly form a one-of-a kind bond. It is hinted she does have an interest in them as more than friends when she shows slight jealousy upon seeing Hal and Stig receiving much attention from other girls. Lydia is typically tough and tomboyish, though she later displays a more girlish side of herself when she despairs over what to wear to the party of Hallasholm with Karina coming to her aid.\n*'''Barat''' \u2014 Barat is the commander of the town guard in Limmat. He is extremely pig-headed, arrogant and has no faith in Hal or his crew. After the taking back the town, he takes credit for the attack and announces he will marry Lydia (who later leaves) and it is thought that he will run for mayor after the previous mayor's death during the pirate raid.\n*'''Rikard''' \u2013 Rikard was the first mate to Captain Nagy, a magyaran captain. He reveals the location of Zavac and attempts to escape but is caught. At Krall he is killed by Vargas for betraying Zavac.\n*'''Vargas''' \u2013 Vargas is the loyal third mate to Zavac. He was at Krall buying rope for the Raven but spots the Heron's and warns Zavac that they are being followed. Then in Raguza, he leads the ambush on four of the Herons and is killed.\n*'''Andras''' \u2013 Andras is the second mate of the Raven. He thinks that Zavac is not in tune with his ship and is not a good helmsman and that only speed had saved them from the Heron but if they versed a ship with similar speed, they would lose which he ends up being correct. He is killed in the battle against the Heron.\n*'''Mihaly''' \u2013 Mihaly is a pirate and now Korpaljo of Raguza. He is a deadly opponent with great skill in swordsmanship, and using his daggers as well as fast and agile. He is very controlling and hates it when things don't go his way, but he is fair and will not hesitate to protect Raguza.\n*'''Mannaoc''' \u2013 Mannaoc is the captain of the ''Seahawk''. He is a part of a ship escort service which protects traders for a fee from pirates and outlaws. He also knows a lot about Raguza and tells Hal what the rules in are in Raguza and how to gain entry. He is infamous in Raguza for destroying many ships and he is a deadly enemy.\n*'''Kloof''' \u2013 Kloof is a huge mountain dog that Hal ran into in the fourth book. She was a rescue dog and is now Hal's pet. She loves to play tug-a-war with the ''Heron''<nowiki/>'s crew. She also chews on anything she can get her teeth sunk into including, unfortunately for Hal, Erak's prized axe. She is very fond of Hal. Kloof also takes part in battles and is very vicious towards anyone who intends to harm her master.\n*'''Myrgos''' \u2013 Mygros is featured in the 7th book and is an evil pirate, who lives in a mountain lair on santorillous.\n\n==Important items==\n*'''The Andomal''' \u2014 This is a huge amber sphere (about 25 centimeters in diameter) with a reptilian claw in the middle believed to come from a dragon. This artifact has been treasured by Skandians for centuries and is kept in a shrine (the Tabernacle) on a hill close to Hallasholm. It is then stolen by Zavac and his crew while the Heron Brotherband is guarding it.\n*'''The ''Heron''''' \u2014 The ''Heron'' is Hal's ship. Hal was helping a ship-maker build it, and it was originally intended for an old man who later died. Then, as he wanted a ship, Hal bought it and finished building it, but adding a few of his own inventions. The ship is about half the size of a regular Skandian wolfship and carries 8 oars aside. He outfitted the ship with several upgrades, one being his ingenious triangular double [[sail]] plan which allows him to sail about 45 degrees into the wind instead of only 15, three times more than a normal wolfship. Because Hal based this design off of a heron (because of its wing-shaped sail, and how it makes his ship glide over the water like a bird), he named his ship after a heron. Another upgrade is a daggerboard (fin) that is slightly off centre which is inserted through the bottom of the boat; this allows the sail handlers to trim the sails even more and get a greater speed out of the boat. The last improvement to the Heron is a giant crossbow, the Mangler, at the front of the ship, which is on a swiveled platform, but difficult to handle unless you are very strong. This puts Ingvar in charge of loading it.\n*'''The ''Raven''''' \u2014 The ''Raven'' is a Magyaran pirate ship that is captained by Zavac. It has a black hull and a large metal ram at the end of it. This ship is very fast and with its ram, it is a force to be reckoned with. It has 10 oars to a side, which makes it good for handling, and raiding other ships. Zavac has a small sleeping quarter where he keeps personal valuable items, such as the Andomal.\n*'''''Wolfwind''''' \u2014 ''Wolfwind'' is Erak's beloved ship. This ship served Erak for many raiding seasons but when he became Oberjarl, he had to give the ship to his loyal first mate Svengal while he wasn't raiding. In the second book, the ''Raven'' nearly sinks ''Wolfwind'' with its ram, but ''Wolfwind'' is saved by the ''Heron'' Brotherband who had to make the difficult decision between their fellow ship or Zavac escaping. The Heron saved it just in time.\n*'''The ''Porpoise''''' \u2013 The ''Porpoise'' is a Skandian trading ship that is used for brotherband training. It is captained by Tursgud who used it to win the first navigation competition when the ''Heron'' gave up the lead to save the Wolf Brotherband and their ship, the ''Lynx''.\n*'''The ''Lynx''''' \u2014 The ''Lynx'' is another Skandian trading ship that was used for brotherband training. It was captained by Rollond, but in the sailing race, it got run aground and was put out of action, thereby disqualifying the Wolves\n*'''The ''Seahawk''''' \u2013 The ship of Mannaoc. This ship is an escort for traders and is a good fighting vessel and has a square sail.\n\n==Weapons==\n*'''Battleaxe''' \u2013 A specialized axe designed for fighting. This weapon is extremely popular in Skandia.\n*'''Sword''' \u2013 A weapon good for stabbing and slashing. Used by Skandians who have a small build. It is also used around the world in many different places, but design and technique varies.\n*'''Broadsword''' \u2013 A larger version of a sword and used with two hands. Deals more damage because of the added weight, but is more difficult to wield. Like the axe, it is fairly popular with Skandians.\n*'''Spear''' \u2013 A long wooden pole (varies in size) with a sharp metal blade. An excellent weapon as it can be used as a pike or lance. These are popular with Skandians although not as much so as the axe or broadsword.\n*'''Atlatl''' \u2013 An unusual weapon with a wooden handle that helps to throw metal tipped darts longer distance, and is quite effective if in the hands of an expert. It is not heard of to be wielded by Skandians, but is used by some people.\n*'''Longbow''' \u2013 A long bow that can shoot over great distances, which varies depending on draw weight. Skandians do not use these often, but archers in other countries such as Araluen do.\n*'''Crossbow'''  \u2013 A bow propelled by a trigger that can cover varying distances depending on size and type/power of string. It is very rare to find crossbows in Skandia but they may be found in the plunder of Skandian raiders. Used by only a handful of people.\n*'''Saxe Knife''' \u2013 A large broad knife used by most Skandians and Rangers. It serves as an excellent tool as well as a weapon if regular weapons are not in reach.\n*'''Mangler''' \u2013 A giant crossbow mounted on top of the ''Heron''. It was created by Hal and named by the crew. It shoots long iron bolts or fire bolts that deal a great amount of damage and is very hard to load and is loaded by the strongest on the ship, Ingvar. Lydia helps him with this task.\n*'''Voulge -''' A cross between a heavy spear and a long handled axe, this Araluen weapon is chiefly used by Ingvar after he gains better eyesight in ''Scorpion Mountain''.\n\n==Places of interest==\n*'''Hallasholm''' \u2013 The capital of Skandia. This is the where Erak rules the whole of Skandia as well as an excellent harbor. The Andomal is also kept here until Zavac steals it right under the noses of the Heron Brotherband after winning the Brotherband training. For this reason, they chase Zavac to gain back the Andomal as well as their honour.\n*'''Shelter Bay''' \u2013 This is where Hal and his crew shelter from the massive storm that hits the east coast of the Stormwhite begins. The crew start to fight and bicker while staying here because of lack of activity, but Thorn begins training them in speed, agility and weapon skills to enhance their skills learned in Brotherband training. This is also the birthplace of the Mangler and the center lee board, both Hal's inventions to increase their chance of beating Zavac when the time comes.\n*'''Skeagall''' \u2013 A small trading village where Hal and his crew travels to for supplies. They hear vague rumors of pirates from here.\n*'''Limmat''' \u2013 A large town next to a harbor. This town is extremely well fortified with a large palisade, two large watchtowers and a massive boom across the harbor mouth. This town is fairly normal except for one thing, it has a secret emerald mine at the bottom of the cliff in a \"barn\" behind the town. This was a secret to Zavac until he tortures a Gallican trader who eventually gives in and tells him.\n*'''Raguza''' \u2013 A large, wealthy \"city\", the capital of Magyara, that gives pirates and raiders a place of safety for a price of one-tenth of their plunder. It is ruled by the Korpaljo (Mihaly), the leader of the Korpal who rule the town. Although there are multiple people in the Korpal (which means \"circle\") the only real power is bestowed upon the Korpaljo. Although, the Korpal are the only people who can elect a Korpaljo, and have an influence on the town, though not as much so as the Korpaljo. It is a peaceful place with no fighting allowed, for the sake of keeping the city sane and doesn't tear the city apart (because as we all know pirates aren't known to get along well with others).\n*'''Krall''' \u2013 A small river town with a rope manufactory plant on the river Dan.\n*'''Bayrath''' \u2013 A large town governed by the Gatmeister (a mayor) on the River Dan. Here the river narrows and a boom stretches across the river. A hefty fine is paid to the Gatmeister to go through to the other side.\n*'''Drogha''' \u2013 A general town on the river Dan home to a fighting ship escort service.\n*'''Ephesa'''- An old Toscan colonial town. It was once very prized but has been left in disrepair since the Toscan empire left. It serves a staging ground in the fifth book.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.worldofjohnflanagan.com/the-brotherband-chronicles/ Official website]\n\n{{John Flanagan}}\n\n[[Category:Brotherband books]]\n[[Category:21st-century Australian novels]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novel series]]\n[[Category:Australian fantasy novel series]]\n", "name_user": "Beland", "label": "safe", "comment": "whitespace", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherband"}

There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers.

is a [[digital audio workstation]] developed by the Belgian company [[Image-Line]]. FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered.

In marketing theory, American advertising and sales pioneer St. Elmo Lewis laid out his three chief copywriting principles, which he felt were crucial for effective advertising:<blockquote>The mission of an advertisement is to attract a reader so that he will look at the advertisement and start to read it; then to interest him, so that he will continue to read it; then to convince him, so that when he has read it he will believe it. If an advertisement contains these three qualities of success, it is a successful advertisement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rhinodaily.com/donnie-bryant-is-aida-outdated-as-a-marketing-process-part-ii/|title=Is AIDA Outdated As A Marketing Process?

The third element of the triple is often used to create an effect of surprise with the audience,<ref name=\"critiquecircle.com\"/> and is frequently the [[punch line]] of the joke itself. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals\u2014such as [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]]; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead\u2014where the surprise or punch line of the joke comes from the third character.\n\nThe comedic rule of three is often paired with quick timing, ensuring that viewers have less time to catch on to the pattern before the punch line hits. As a whole, the comedic rule of threes relies on setting up a pattern of two items and then subverting viewer expectations by breaking that pattern with the third item. One particularly notable example comes from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' - \"Can I get you anything? Cup of coffee? Doughnut? Toupee?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriple|title=The Triple|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nJust like most comedic writing, the rule of threes in comedy relies on building tension to a comedic release. In the case of the rule of threes, tension is built with the first two items in the pattern and then released with the final item, which should be the funniest of the three. Most triples are short in length, often only two or three sentences, but the rule can also be implemented effectively at longer length as long as base formula is still followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/comedy-writing-secrets-triples|title=Comedy Writing Secrets: Triple the Funny|last=Henshey|first=Chelsea|date=2016-02-11|website=WritersDigest.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\n==Fairy tales==\nIn [[storytelling]], authors often create triplets or structures in three parts. In its simplest form, this is merely ''beginning, middle, and end'', from [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]. [[Syd Field]] wrote a popular handbook of [[screenwriting]], in which he touted the advantages of [[three-act structure]] over the more traditional [[Act (drama)|five-act structure]] used by [[William Shakespeare]] and many other famous playwrights.\n\n[[File:Franz J\u00fcttner Schneewittchen 4.jpg|thumb|[[Snow White]] receives three visits from her wicked stepmother.]]\n\n[[Vladimir Propp]], in his ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', concluded that any of the elements in a folktale could be negated twice so that it would repeat thrice.<ref>Propp, Vladimir.

Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase \"on the other hand\" to play the [[devil's advocate]] and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a [[Gentile]], for which Tevye concludes that \"No, there is no other hand.\"\n* In [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', [[Mark Antony]] starts his speech by using the rule of three: [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears]], to which the commoners start to listen.\n\n==Rhetoric and public speaking==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory.

The third element of the triple is often used to create an effect of surprise with the audience,<ref name=\"critiquecircle.com\"/> and is frequently the [[punch line]] of the joke itself. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals\u2014such as [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]]; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead\u2014where the surprise or punch line of the joke comes from the third character.\n\nThe comedic rule of three is often paired with quick timing, ensuring that viewers have less time to catch on to the pattern before the punch line hits. As a whole, the comedic rule of threes relies on setting up a pattern of two items and then subverting viewer expectations by breaking that pattern with the third item. One particularly notable example comes from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' - \"Can I get you anything? Cup of coffee? Doughnut? Toupee?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriple|title=The Triple|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nJust like most comedic writing, the rule of threes in comedy relies on building tension to a comedic release. In the case of the rule of threes, tension is built with the first two items in the pattern and then released with the final item, which should be the funniest of the three. Most triples are short in length, often only two or three sentences, but the rule can also be implemented effectively at longer length as long as base formula is still followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/comedy-writing-secrets-triples|title=Comedy Writing Secrets: Triple the Funny|last=Henshey|first=Chelsea|date=2016-02-11|website=WritersDigest.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\n==Fairy tales==\nIn [[storytelling]], authors often create triplets or structures in three parts.

Due to the poor quality of radio parts Mr. Kikuchi had to deal with, he decided to start his private radio part manufacturer facility in December 1944 in Yoyogi, Tokyo. He picked transformers as his initial product line. Kikuchi's thought was \"Even with higher prices, let's make the higher quality of products.\" \n\nIn 1954 manufacturing Pre-Amp, Main-Amp kits, as well as finished amplifiers which used tubes, was started; 1958 Sansui introduced the first stereo tube Pre- and Main amplifiers.<ref>[http://www.tube-amps.net/Sansui_Early_History.htm tube-amps.net 2015-01-02, Sansui in Early Days], retrieved 2020-04-23.</ref> By the 1960s Sansui had developed a reputation for making serious audio components.

Sansui developed the [[QS Regular Matrix]] system, which made it possible to transmit four-channel [[Quadraphonic]] sound from a standard LP. The channel separation was only 3&nbsp;dB, but because of the human way of hearing it sounded relatively good.

Due to the poor quality of radio parts Mr. Kikuchi had to deal with, he decided to start his private radio part manufacturer facility in December 1944 in Yoyogi, Tokyo. He picked transformers as his initial product line. Kikuchi's thought was \"Even with higher prices, let's make the higher quality of products.\" \n\nIn 1954 manufacturing Pre-Amp, Main-Amp kits as well as finished amplifiers which used tubes was started; 1958 Sansui introduced the first stereo tube Pre- and Main amplifiers.<ref>[http://www.tube-amps.net/Sansui_Early_History.htm tube-amps.net 2015-01-02, Sansui in Early Days], retrieved 2020-04-23.</ref> By the 1960s Sansui had developed a reputation for making serious audio components.

Sansui developed the [[QS Regular Matrix]] system, which made it possible to transmit four channel [[Quadraphonic]] sound from a standard LP. The channel separation was only 3&nbsp;dB, but because of the human way of hearing it sounded relatively good. In 1973, Sansui introduced the more advanced QS Vario Matrix decoder with 20&nbsp;dB separation.

He also cites \"Identifying the Right Kind of Messenger\" (''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 8) which identifies the Witnesses as his \"true messengers ... by making the messages he delivers through them come true\", in contrast to \"false messengers\", whose predictions fail.

(1971, pg 70, 292) which describes Witnesses as the modern Ezekiel class, \"a genuine prophet within our generation\". The Watch Tower book noted: \"Concerning the message faithfully delivered by the Ezekiel class, Jehovah positively states that it 'must come true' ... those who wait undecided until it does 'come true' will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them.\" He also cites \"Execution of the Great Harlot Nears\", (''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, pg 17) which claims God gives the Witnesses \"special knowledge that others do not have ... advance knowledge about this system's end\".</ref> Professor James A.

A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others.\" The court also stated that, \"even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community.

As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood so long as it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as [[Leviticus]] 17:10\u201314 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 (\"abstain from blood\") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion.<ref name=\"How Can Blood Save Your Life\">{{cite book|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=22}}</ref> Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.<ref name=\"Muramoto\"/>\n\n====Fractions and components====\nIn the case of [[Blood plasma fractionation|minor fractions derived from blood]], each individual is directed to follow their own conscience on whether these are acceptable.<ref>\"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004445 Be guided by the Living God]\" (Jun. 15, 2004).

(1 Timothy 2:12, 13; Hebrews 13:17) When women follow God\u2019s direction to do so, they set an example for the angels in God\u2019s organizational arrangement. (1 Corinthians 11:8-10) In addition, older married women, by their fine example and helpful suggestions, teach younger women to \u2018subject themselves to their own husbands.\u2019\u201d\u200b\u2014Titus 2:3-5.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wives\u200b Deeply Respect Your Husbands |journal=Watchtower |date=15 February 2007 |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=19-20 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007125}}</ref>\n\nThis position of subservience appears more evident in Watchtower publications that discuss stories of women who choose to stay with abusive husbands. The Governing Body, in their publication Awake!, has previously emphasized that while divorce is something that is not taken lightly, leaving an abusive husband should be a personal decision made by the wife\u2014she should not be pressured to leave or stay with her spouse.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Help for Battered Women |journal=Awake! |date=8 November 2001 |volume=82 |issue=21 |pages=9-12 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/g20011108/Help-for-Battered-Women/}}</ref>\n\nHowever, praise has been given to women in the past who remain with abusive husbands. Numerous cases of this behavior have been published in both Awake! and Watchtower magazine, spanning across the history of their publications, in which the \u201csaving\u201d of an abusive spouse takes precedence over separation and the well-being of the person being abused.<ref name=\"Selma\">{{cite journal |title=Happiness Is Possible in a Divided Household |journal=Watchtower |date=15 February 2012 |volume=133 |issue=4 |page=29 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20120215/Happiness-Is-Possible-in-a-Divided-Household/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=An End to Domestic Violence |journal=Awake! |date=April 2013 |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=9-11 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/g201304/end-to-domestic-violence/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Maintain Your Confidence Firm to the End |journal=Watchtower |date=1 May 1996 |volume=117 |issue=9 |pages=22-23 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1996333}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=How Marriage Survives the Assault |journal=Watchtower |date=15 July 1982 |volume=103 |issue=14 |page=7 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1982521}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Can Your Marriage Be Saved? |journal=Watchtower |date=15 December 1969 |volume=90 |issue=24 |pages=739-740 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1969920}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Not Fair-Weather Christians |journal=Watchtower |date=1 July 1958 |volume=79 |issue=13 |page=400 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1958487}}</ref> These anecdotes include that of Selma\u200b\u2014a recently-converted Witness who was in an abusive relationship. Selma endured years of abuse from her husband, Steve. She sought counsel from her friends in the Kingdom, and received the following advice: \u201c\u2018On one particular day,\u2019 says Selma, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to have a Bible study. The night before, Steve had hit me as I had tried to prove a point, and I was feeling sad and sorry for myself. After I told the sister what had happened and how I felt, she asked me to read 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. As I did, I began to reason, \u2018Steve never does any of these loving things for me.\u2019 But the sister made me think differently by asking, \u2018How many of those acts of love do you show to- ward your husband?\u2019 My answer was, \u2018None, for he is so difficult to live with.\u2019 The sister softly said, \u2018Selma, who is trying to be a Christian here? You or Steve?\u2019\u201d Selma endured 17 years of this behavior until her husband \u201caccepted the truth.\u201d<ref name=\"Selma\" /> This wording indicates that Steve had also become a Witness, but not whether or not the abusive behavior halted after this conversion.\n\nPublication of such stories appears to encourage remaining in relationships with abusive husbands, going against the Governing Body\u2019s previous stance taken on the subject in Awake!. These anecdotes remain in the realm of getting a non-believing spouse to convert despite violent behavior, though instances of abuse that take place when the spouse is a part of the Kingdom are also coming to light.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fowler |first1=Jen\u00e9e |title=Learning to Fear Men Through Christ: How Jehovah's Witnesses Deal with Domestic Violence |url=https://medium.com/@CyanideBlue/learning-to-fear-men-through-christ-how-jehovahs-witnesses-deal-with-domestic-violence-871e03c5ecbc |website=Medium |publisher=A Medium Corporation |date=8 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rellahan |first1=Michael P. |title=Richard Greist, 1970s Killer, Has a Hearing |url=https://www.dailylocal.com/news/national/richard-greist-s-killer-has-a-hearing/article_155a356c-e076-50fc-8dd9-729a7c0f2d03.html |website=Daily Local News |publisher=Daily Local News |date=10 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Schapiro |first1=Rich |title=Jehovah's Witness Kills Wife, Himself |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/amp/archives/news/jehovah-witness-kills-wife-article-1.655543 |website=NY Daily News |publisher=New York Daily News |date=2 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Quenqua |first1=Douglas |title=A Secret Database of Child Abuse |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/the-secret-jehovahs-witness-database-of-child-molesters/584311/ |website=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |date=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n===Psychological Impact on Children===\nThe teachings of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are believed to have a significant psychological impact on indoctrinated children.

He also cites \"Identifying the Right Kind of Messenger\" (''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 8) which identifies the Witnesses as his \"true messengers ... by making the messages he delivers through them come true\", in contrast to \"false messengers\", whose predictions fail. In ''In Search of Christian Freedom,'' 2007, he quotes ''The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah - How?'' (1971, pg 70, 292) which describes Witnesses as the modern Ezekiel class, \"a genuine prophet within our generation\". The Watch Tower book noted: \"Concerning the message faithfully delivered by the Ezekiel class, Jehovah positively states that it 'must come true' ... those who wait undecided until it does 'come true' will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them.\" He also cites \"Execution of the Great Harlot Nears\", (''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, pg 17) which claims God gives the Witnesses \"special knowledge that others do not have ... advance knowledge about this system's end\".</ref> Professor James A. Beverley, along with others, has accused the movement of false prophecy for making those predictions, particularly because of assertions in some cases that the predictions were beyond doubt or had been approved by God, but describes its record of telling the future as \"pathetic\".<ref>James A.

Chryssides]] has suggested widespread claims that Witnesses \"keep changing the dates\" are a distortion and misunderstanding of Watch Tower Society chronology. He argues that, although there have been failures in prophetic speculation, the changing views and dates of the Jehovah's Witnesses are more largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions.

As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood so long as it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes.

Herd declared that women have a smaller cranial capacity than men, citing published scientific research, and claiming this as evidence of their rule of \u201csubjection to man.\u201d Herd took the position that women are inherently submissive to men, and they must be proud of their rule in society.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Herd |first1=Samuel |title=The Value of Our Theocratic Sisters |url=https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/womens-place-jehovahs-witnesses.php |website=JWfacts |date=1971}}</ref> Herd\u2019s stance on women has heavily sexist connotations, and research focusing on the variation of cranial composition between men and women is controversial at best (even more so if researchers suggest that this relates to intelligence).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eliot |first1=Lise |title=Neurosexism: the Myth That Men and Women Have Different Brains |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00677-x |website=Nature News |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |date=27 February 2019}}</ref> This stance on the role of women in society has remained a relatively constant one in the Governing Body. As such, women are expected to remain subservient to their husbands: \u201cThe Bible explains that women, whether married or single, should submit to the headship of spiritually qualified men who exercise oversight in the Christian congregation. (1 Timothy 2:12, 13; Hebrews 13:17) When women follow God\u2019s direction to do so, they set an example for the angels in God\u2019s organizational arrangement. (1 Corinthians 11:8-10) In addition, older married women, by their fine example and helpful suggestions, teach younger women to \u2018subject themselves to their own husbands.\u2019\u201d\u200b\u2014Titus 2:3-5.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wives\u200b Deeply Respect Your Husbands |journal=Watchtower |date=15 February 2007 |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=19-20 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007125}}</ref>\n\nThis position of subservience appears more evident in Watchtower publications that discuss stories of women who choose to stay with abusive husbands. The Governing Body, in their publication Awake!, has previously emphasized that while divorce is something that is not taken lightly, leaving an abusive husband should be a personal decision made by the wife\u2014she should not be pressured to leave or stay with her spouse.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Help for Battered Women |journal=Awake! |date=8 November 2001 |volume=82 |issue=21 |pages=9-12 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/g20011108/Help-for-Battered-Women/}}</ref>\n\nHowever, praise has been given to women in the past who remain with abusive husbands. Numerous cases of this behavior have been published in both Awake! and Watchtower magazine, spanning across the history of their publications, in which the \u201csaving\u201d of an abusive spouse takes precedence over separation and the well-being of the person being abused.<ref name=\"Selma\">{{cite journal |title=Happiness Is Possible in a Divided Household |journal=Watchtower |date=15 February 2012 |volume=133 |issue=4 |page=29 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20120215/Happiness-Is-Possible-in-a-Divided-Household/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=An End to Domestic Violence |journal=Awake! |date=April 2013 |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=9-11 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/g201304/end-to-domestic-violence/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Maintain Your Confidence Firm to the End |journal=Watchtower |date=1 May 1996 |volume=117 |issue=9 |pages=22-23 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1996333}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=How Marriage Survives the Assault |journal=Watchtower |date=15 July 1982 |volume=103 |issue=14 |page=7 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1982521}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Can Your Marriage Be Saved? |journal=Watchtower |date=15 December 1969 |volume=90 |issue=24 |pages=739-740 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1969920}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Not Fair-Weather Christians |journal=Watchtower |date=1 July 1958 |volume=79 |issue=13 |page=400 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1958487}}</ref> These anecdotes include that of Selma\u200b\u2014a recently-converted Witness who was in an abusive relationship. Selma endured years of abuse from her husband, Steve. She sought counsel from her friends in the Kingdom, and received the following advice: \u201c\u2018On one particular day,\u2019 says Selma, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to have a Bible study. The night before, Steve had hit me as I had tried to prove a point, and I was feeling sad and sorry for myself. After I told the sister what had happened and how I felt, she asked me to read 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. As I did, I began to reason, \u2018Steve never does any of these loving things for me.\u2019 But the sister made me think differently by asking, \u2018How many of those acts of love do you show to- ward your husband?\u2019 My answer was, \u2018None, for he is so difficult to live with.\u2019 The sister softly said, \u2018Selma, who is trying to be a Christian here? You or Steve?\u2019\u201d Selma endured 17 years of this behavior until her husband \u201caccepted the truth.\u201d<ref name=\"Selma\" /> This wording indicates that Steve had also become a Witness, but not whether or not the abusive behavior halted after this conversion.\n\nPublication of such stories appears to encourage remaining in relationships with abusive husbands, going against the Governing Body\u2019s previous stance taken on the subject in Awake!. These anecdotes remain in the realm of getting a non-believing spouse to convert despite violent behavior, though instances of abuse that take place when the spouse is a part of the Kingdom are also coming to light.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fowler |first1=Jen\u00e9e |title=Learning to Fear Men Through Christ: How Jehovah's Witnesses Deal with Domestic Violence |url=https://medium.com/@CyanideBlue/learning-to-fear-men-through-christ-how-jehovahs-witnesses-deal-with-domestic-violence-871e03c5ecbc |website=Medium |publisher=A Medium Corporation |date=8 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rellahan |first1=Michael P. |title=Richard Greist, 1970s Killer, Has a Hearing |url=https://www.dailylocal.com/news/national/richard-greist-s-killer-has-a-hearing/article_155a356c-e076-50fc-8dd9-729a7c0f2d03.html |website=Daily Local News |publisher=Daily Local News |date=10 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Schapiro |first1=Rich |title=Jehovah's Witness Kills Wife, Himself |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/amp/archives/news/jehovah-witness-kills-wife-article-1.655543 |website=NY Daily News |publisher=New York Daily News |date=2 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Quenqua |first1=Douglas |title=A Secret Database of Child Abuse |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/the-secret-jehovahs-witness-database-of-child-molesters/584311/ |website=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |date=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n===Psychological Impact on Children===\nThe teachings of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are believed to have a significant psychological impact on indoctrinated children.

These men were skilled in operating the weapons and were trained to launch their rockets at an angle calculated from the diameter of the cylinder and the distance to the target. The rockets had twin side sharpened blades mounted on them, and when fired ''en masse'', spun and wreaked significant damage against a large army. Tipu greatly expanded the use of rockets after Hyder's death, deploying as many as 5,000 rocketeers at a time.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} The rockets deployed by Tipu during the [[Battle of Pollilur (1780)|Battle of Pollilur]] were much more advanced than those the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missiles (up to 2&nbsp;km range).<ref name=Narasimha/>\n\nBritish accounts describe the use of the rockets during the third and fourth wars.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} During the climactic battle at Srirangapatna in 1799, British shells struck a magazine containing rockets, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements. After Tipu's defeat in the fourth war the British captured a number of the Mysorean rockets. These became influential in British rocket development, inspiring the [[Congreve rocket]], which was soon put into use in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=Narasimha>Roddam Narasimha (1985).

This temple was hardly a stone's throw from his palace from where he would listen with equal respect to the ringing of temple bells and the [[muezzin]]'s call from the mosque; to the [[Lakshmikanta Temple, Kalale|Lakshmikanta Temple]] at [[Kalale]] he gifted four cups, a plate and [[Spitoon]] in silver.<ref name=\"padiga3\"/><ref name=\"hasan2\"/>\n\n=====Sringeri incident, Maratha sacking, and rebuilding temple=====\nDuring the [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] in 1791, a group of [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] horsemen under Raghunath Rao Patwardhan  raided the temple and ''matha'' of [[Sringeri]] ''[[Shankaracharya]]''. They killed and wounded many people, including Brahmins, plundered the monastery of all its valuable possessions, and desecrated the temple by displacing the image of goddess Sarada.<ref name=\"Hasan358\"/>\n\nThe incumbent ''Shankaracharya'' petitioned Tipu Sultan for help. A bunch of about 30 letters written in [[Kannada]], which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the [[Sringeri]] [[Shankaracharya]] were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in [[Mysore]]. Tipu Sultan expressed his indignation and grief at the news of the raid:<ref name=\"Hasan358\">{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkbJ6xA1_jEC&pg=PA358|title=History of Tipu Sultan|author=Mohibbul Hasan|page=358|isbn=9788187879572|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/bO9Ma9Sb2g4aUvIUT29fCP/Why-we-love-to-hate-Tipu-Sultan.html|title=Why we love to hate Tipu Sultan|author=Vikram Sampath|work=www.livemint.com/|date=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date in this Kali age in accordance with the verse: \"Hasadbhih kriyate karma rudadbhir-anubhuyate\" (People do [evil] deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying).\"<ref>''Annual Report of the Mysore Archaeological Department'' 1916 pp&nbsp;10\u201311, 73\u20136</ref> </blockquote>\n\nHe immediately ordered the Asaf of [[Bednur]] to supply the Swami with 200 ''rahati''s (''[[Travancore Fanam|fanam]]''s) in cash and other gifts and articles.

It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C.

He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\". He further asserts that the acts of Tipu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n| last = Rao\n| first = Hayavadana C.\n| title = History of Mysore 1399\u20131799: Incorporating the latest Epigraphical, Literary and Historical Researches Vol. 3 pgs 1047\u201353\n| publisher = Bangalore Government Press\n}}</ref>\n\n=====Persecution of Lingayats=====\nAfter Haider Ali was appointed the military chief of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty]] of Mysore and led a coup, the [[Lingayats]] of Karnataka came under Islamic rule in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aya Ikegame|title=Princely India Re-imagined: A Historical Anthropology of Mysore from 1799 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJkn2ukhLgUC&pg=PA123 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-23910-6|pages=123\u2013125}}</ref> During this period, the followers of Lingayatism were persecuted.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b. Abi Talib]], who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\n\n'''Gold''': Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda ([[Umar|Umar al-Faruq]], the second caliph) -- Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda ([[Abu Bakr]] al-Sadiq, the first caliph) -- Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Successive [[Indian National Congress]] governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been largely critical.

It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C. Hayavadana Rao]] wrote about Tipu in his encyclopaedic court history of Mysore. He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\". He further asserts that the acts of Tipu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n| last = Rao\n| first = Hayavadana C.\n| title = History of Mysore 1399\u20131799: Incorporating the latest Epigraphical, Literary and Historical Researches Vol. 3 pgs 1047\u201353\n| publisher = Bangalore Government Press\n}}</ref>\n\n=====Persecution of Lingayats=====\nAfter Haider Ali was appointed the military chief of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty]] of Mysore and led a coup, the [[Lingayats]] of Karnataka came under Islamic rule in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aya Ikegame|title=Princely India Re-imagined: A Historical Anthropology of Mysore from 1799 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJkn2ukhLgUC&pg=PA123 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-23910-6|pages=123\u2013125}}</ref> During this period, the followers of Lingayatism were persecuted.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b.

During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Successive [[Indian National Congress]] governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been largely critical.
