''Supergirl'' as the series' \"''[[Black Mirror]]'' season\", with Rovner elaborating that \"What we\u2019re looking at is how technology is impacting the way people engage and giving them an escape not to engage. It seems like nowadays, everyone is kind of on their phones or not really present, and so we wanted to speak to that and kind of how it might be hard to live in the ugliness of what's going on, and how a character like Kara can try and help us overcome that.\" [[Melissa Benoist]], who stars as [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Kara Danvers / Supergirl]], said the season would be \"a fight for [<nowiki/>[[Lena Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lena Luthor's]]] soul\", following [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] exposing to Lena that Kara, her best friend, is Supergirl.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/17/supergirl-season-5-melissa-benoist-lena-kara-crisis-leviathan/ |title=Exclusive: 'Supergirl' star Melissa Benoist teases 'fight for Lena's soul' in season 5 |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |date=July 17, 2019 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718033423/https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/17/supergirl-season-5-melissa-benoist-lena-kara-crisis-leviathan/ |archive-date=July 18, 2019 |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> Rovner said the rift between Kara and Lena was something the writers had been building towards for a number of years, with the fifth season serving as the \"long-awaited payoff\". Queller described \"betrayal\" as Lena's [[Achilles' heel|Achilles heel]] due to every member of the Luthor family having betrayed her in some way over the years: \"She has to put on this protective shell, and the last person she thought would betray her was Kara, and that really hurts more deeply than any of the others\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/06/supergirl-season-5-premiere-release-date-introduces-dark-new-threats-ign-first |title=Supergirl: Season 5 Introduces Dark New Threats&nbsp;\u2013 IGN First |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=September 6, 2019 |website=[[IGN]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190907052907/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/06/supergirl-season-5-premiere-release-date-introduces-dark-new-threats-ign-first |archive-date=September 7, 2019 |access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> The season also features the series' [[100 episodes|100th episode]]; teasing this episode, Queller said, \"Characters may reappear\" while Rovner noted, \"We want to treat the fans to an episode that serves the show's past.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tvinsider.com/794777/supergirl-season-5-burning-questions-answered/ |title=What's Next for Kara in Season 5?

While searching for the acrata medallion, Andrea has her first encounter with Leviathan, who put her up to killing Governor Harper and Caroline O'Connor by telling her how said medallion works. To further their goals, Leviathan brainwashes Rogers into becoming Rip Roar to act on their behalf. In the present, Andrea is assigned to eliminate the captured Rogers, but her first attempt to break into the D.E.O. fails. She goes to Lena for help, so she sets up a fake break-in for Supergirl to investigate while she, as the masked Acrata, raids the D.E.O. headquarters once again with psychic tech; making off with Rip Roar even in spite of Supergirl's intervention. During the raid, Supergirl discovers the latter's connection to Leviathan. Andrea gives Lena the medallion and attempts to run away with Rogers, but a Leviathan operative kills him before another of their representatives meets with her.

Queller described \"betrayal\" as Lena's [[Achilles' heel|Achilles heel]] due to every member of the Luthor family having betrayed her in some way over the years: \"She has to put on this protective shell, and the last person she thought would betray her was Kara, and that really hurts more deeply than any of the others\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/06/supergirl-season-5-premiere-release-date-introduces-dark-new-threats-ign-first |title=Supergirl: Season 5 Introduces Dark New Threats&nbsp;\u2013 IGN First |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=September 6, 2019 |website=[[IGN]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190907052907/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/06/supergirl-season-5-premiere-release-date-introduces-dark-new-threats-ign-first |archive-date=September 7, 2019 |access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> The season also features the series' [[100 episodes|100th episode]]; teasing this episode, Queller said, \"Characters may reappear\" while Rovner noted, \"We want to treat the fans to an episode that serves the show's past.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tvinsider.com/794777/supergirl-season-5-burning-questions-answered/ |title=What's Next for Kara in Season 5?

He lives with Juliet Higgins, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent assigned by Masters to protect the estate, and native Hawaiian Kumu Tuileta, who is the estate's cultural curator. (Juliet Higgins replaces the male character Jonathan Higgins from the original series.) Juliet often assists Thomas with his cases, and becomes a full partner in the agency during season 2.

He lives with Juliet Higgins, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent assigned by Masters to protect the estate, and native Hawaiian Kumu Tuileta, who is the estate's cultural curator. (Juliet Higgins replaces the male character Jonathan Higgins from the original series.) Juliet often assists Thomas with his cases, and becomes a full partner in the agency during season 2. Magnum is also frequently assisted by two former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], Rick Wright and TC Calvin. Rick is now a bar owner, while TC is a pilot whose main business is running helicopter tours of the islands. Magnum tends to butt heads with HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, but the two also help each other when needed.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as [[Thomas Magnum]], a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] who is a security consultant for the successful novelist Robin Masters, living in the guest house on his estate, while also working as a [[private investigator]]\n* [[Perdita Weeks]] as [[Jonathan Higgins#2018 reboot|Juliet Higgins]], a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent who is [[majordomo]] to Robin Masters; she and Magnum bicker but become allies\n* [[Zachary Knighton]] as Orville \"Rick\" Wright, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] veteran and former [[door gunner]], who runs his own [[tiki bar]] and is also a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]]\n* Stephen Hill as Theodore \"TC\" Calvin, a Marine veteran and [[helicopter]] pilot who runs helicopter tours of Hawaii and is a member of Magnum's team\n* [[Amy Hill]] as Teuila \"Kumu\" Tuileta, the cultural [[curator]] of Robin Masters' estate\n* [[Tim Kang]] as HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, who dislikes Magnum but usually comes to the team's aid when needed\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[James Remar]] as Captain Buck Greene, Magnum's former C.O.\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Sebastian Nuzo, Magnum's friend who was killed in the pilot but recurs in flashbacks\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Francis \"Icepick\" Hofstetler, Rick's underworld-connected father figure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |title=Corbin Bernsen Cast on ''Magnum P.I.'' as [Spoiler]'s Degenerate Father Figure |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |work=TVLine |date=November 20, 2018 |access-date=November 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123200751/https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |archive-date=November 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bernsen guest starred in [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0 ]] in another part.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Luther H.

The tunnel carries the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] (serving the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie}}) under the [[East River]] in New York City, connecting the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]], and is used by an average of 225,000 passengers per weekday. A key segment of the 14th Street Tunnel, between the [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] station in Brooklyn and the [[First Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|First Avenue]] station in Manhattan, would be partially closed for 15 to 20 months to allow for necessary and extensive repairs to the underwater tubes after it was flooded and severely damaged during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nTwo options were proposed in 2016: a three-year construction period where one tube at a time would be closed or an 18-month closure where both tubes would be worked on simultaneously. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] ultimately chose the 18-month closure option because it would be less disruptive to passenger service. The shutdown period was later reduced to 15 months to reduce service disruption. To accommodate displaced passengers, new or expanded bus, subway, and ferry service was to be added, and a [[14th Street busway]] would have been implemented. The shutdown plan was criticized by riders who use the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie|time=nolink}} and people living along or near [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] in Manhattan, as it would have had adverse effects on other subway routes and on vehicular traffic. In January 2019, it was announced that the shutdown would not be a full-time closure, but a night and weekend closure. Ultimately, the line was not closed; night and weekend service was merely reduced.<ref name=\"L Project\"/>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Canarsie (8168179049).jpg|thumb|Damaged tunnels after draining]]\nIn October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused [[Hurricane Sandy in New York|severe damage to New York City]], and many subway tunnels were inundated with floodwater. The subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed years of repair. A year after the storm, a spokesman for the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), which operates the New York City Subway, said that Hurricane Sandy \"was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boissoneault |first1=Lorraine |title=Superstorm Sandy Anniversary \u2013 How the Subway Survived |url=http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/devastating-effects-water-how-superstorm-sandy-shut-down-subway-swamped-city |website=The Weather Channel |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines and yards, and completely destroyed a portion of the [[IND Rockaway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Rockaway}}) in [[Queens]], as well as much of the [[South Ferry (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] terminal at [[Manhattan]]'s southern tip. Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines and long-term closures on the [[IND Crosstown Line|Greenpoint Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Crosstown}}), [[Montague Street Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Fourth Montague header}}), Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station. A long-term closure was planned for the 14th Street Tunnel because it was significantly damaged by the storm surge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/sandy/nyct_girds.htm|title=mta.info {{!}} Superstorm Sandy: One Year Later|website=web.mta.info|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=July 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803224532/http://web.mta.info/sandy/nyct_girds.htm|archive-date=August 3, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Moreover, the 14th Street Tunnel dates from 1924;<ref>{{cite news |title=Celebrate Opening of Subway Link |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/07/01/archives/celebrate-opening-of-subway-link-civic-and-city-officials-ride-in.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 1, 1924 |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> thus its equipment was already 88 years old when Hurricane Sandy occurred.<ref name=\"Surico 2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yweynb/whats-actually-wrong-with-the-l-train-tunnel|title=What's Actually Wrong with the L Train Tunnel?|last=Surico|first=John|date=June 29, 2018|website=Vice|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Planning==\n\n=== Closure options ===\nIn January 2016, the Canarsie Line between [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Eighth Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line station)|Eighth Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]] was proposed for either of two shutdown options.<ref name=\":0\" /> One option involved shuttering the entire segment for eighteen months.

The demolition and replacement of the tunnels' wire duct banks, or benchwalls, were to take up much the project's duration. A dust collection machine, which was custom-ordered for the 14th Street Tunnel project, was to include ventilation and dust filtration systems that allow dust to be contained within the tunnels. The dust was to be taken out of the tunnels via flatbed cars that travel to the shafts at Avenue A in Manhattan and Driggs Avenue in Brooklyn. The demolition was to be completed within three months, after which work on the new station entrances and replacement duct banks would commence. The tracks within the tunnels were also be replaced.<ref name=\"Surico 2018\" /> These repairs would be able to last up to eighty years.<ref name=\"NYTimes-LTrainSully-2019\"/>\n\nFollowing the January 2019 announcement that the shutdown would instead be a partial closure, Cuomo and the MTA board unveiled some new details about the project. Rather than completely replacing the benchwall, workers would install new cable ducts on the sides of the existing tunnel walls, and the existing ducts would be abandoned.<ref name=\"MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/docs/Canarsie%20-%20Board%20Presentation%20011519%201120%20FINAL.pdf|title=L Project Update New Design Recommendations Overall Project Update|date=January 15, 2019|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref>{{rp|7}}<ref name=\"Berger 2019\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> The technique of racking the cables on the wall differed from previous proposals, in that a rack, rather than the cables themselves, would be bolted onto the wall.<ref name=\"NYTimes-TransportationPurgatory-2019\"/><ref name=MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019/>{{rp|9}} The benchwalls would be repaired with [[epoxy]] and [[fiberglass]] as necessary, then converted into emergency egress walkways.<ref name=MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019/>{{rp|7, 11}}<ref name=\"Berger 2019\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> By using this approach, less silica would need to be extracted from the tunnels because the benchwalls would not be entirely demolished.<ref name=MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019/>{{rp|12}} [[Optical fiber|Fiber-optic]] and [[lidar]] sensors would be installed to allow MTA workers to more easily track imminent failures in the benchwalls.<ref name=\"Hawkins 2019\" /> Station and track improvements would continue under the revised proposal.<ref name=MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019/>{{rp|21}} The repairs could last for up to forty years, and work might be elongated due to the need to maintain weekday service.<ref name=\"NYTimes-LTrainSully-2019\"/>\n\nThe new plan meant that only 1% of the benchwall would have to be removed, namely the concrete surrounding 96 manholes.

The tunnel carries the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] (serving the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie}}) under the [[East River]] in New York City, connecting the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]], and is used by an average of 225,000 passengers per weekday. A key segment of the 14th Street Tunnel, between the [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] station in Brooklyn and the [[First Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|First Avenue]] station in Manhattan, would be partially closed for 15 to 20 months to allow for necessary and extensive repairs to the underwater tubes after it was flooded and severely damaged during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nTwo options were proposed in 2016: a three-year construction period where one tube at a time would be closed or an 18-month closure where both tubes would be worked on simultaneously. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] ultimately chose the 18-month closure option because it would be less disruptive to passenger service. The shutdown period was later reduced to 15 months to reduce service disruption. To accommodate displaced passengers, new or expanded bus, subway, and ferry service was to be added, and a [[14th Street busway]] would have been implemented. The shutdown plan was criticized by riders who use the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie|time=nolink}} and people living along or near [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] in Manhattan, as it would have had adverse effects on other subway routes and on vehicular traffic. In January 2019, it was announced that the shutdown would not be a full-time closure, but a night and weekend closure. Ultimately, the line was not closed; night and weekend service was merely reduced.<ref name=\"L Project\"/>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Canarsie (8168179049).jpg|thumb|Damaged tunnels after draining]]\nIn October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused [[Hurricane Sandy in New York|severe damage to New York City]], and many subway tunnels were inundated with floodwater. The subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed years of repair. A year after the storm, a spokesman for the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), which operates the New York City Subway, said that Hurricane Sandy \"was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boissoneault |first1=Lorraine |title=Superstorm Sandy Anniversary \u2013 How the Subway Survived |url=http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/devastating-effects-water-how-superstorm-sandy-shut-down-subway-swamped-city |website=The Weather Channel |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines and yards, and completely destroyed a portion of the [[IND Rockaway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Rockaway}}) in [[Queens]], as well as much of the [[South Ferry (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] terminal at [[Manhattan]]'s southern tip. Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines and long-term closures on the [[IND Crosstown Line|Greenpoint Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Crosstown}}), [[Montague Street Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Fourth Montague header}}), Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station. A long-term closure was planned for the 14th Street Tunnel because it was significantly damaged by the storm surge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/sandy/nyct_girds.htm|title=mta.info {{!}} Superstorm Sandy: One Year Later|website=web.mta.info|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=July 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803224532/http://web.mta.info/sandy/nyct_girds.htm|archive-date=August 3, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Moreover, the 14th Street Tunnel dates from 1924;<ref>{{cite news |title=Celebrate Opening of Subway Link |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/07/01/archives/celebrate-opening-of-subway-link-civic-and-city-officials-ride-in.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 1, 1924 |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> thus its equipment was already 88 years old when Hurricane Sandy occurred.<ref name=\"Surico 2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yweynb/whats-actually-wrong-with-the-l-train-tunnel|title=What's Actually Wrong with the L Train Tunnel?|last=Surico|first=John|date=June 29, 2018|website=Vice|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Planning==\n\n=== Closure options ===\nIn January 2016, the Canarsie Line between [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Eighth Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line station)|Eighth Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]] was proposed for either of two shutdown options.<ref name=\":0\" /> One option involved shuttering the entire segment for eighteen months.

The demolition and replacement of the tunnels' wire duct banks, or benchwalls, were to take up much the project's duration. A dust collection machine, which was custom-ordered for the 14th Street Tunnel project, was to include ventilation and dust filtration systems that allow dust to be contained within the tunnels. The dust was to be taken out of the tunnels via flatbed cars that travel to the shafts at Avenue A in Manhattan and Driggs Avenue in Brooklyn. The demolition was to be completed within three months, after which work on the new station entrances and replacement duct banks would commence. The tracks within the tunnels were also be replaced.<ref name=\"Surico 2018\" /> These repairs would be able to last up to eighty years.<ref name=\"NYTimes-LTrainSully-2019\"/>\n\nFollowing the January 2019 announcement that the shutdown would instead be a partial closure, Cuomo and the MTA board unveiled some new details about the project.

The church grew rapidly and it was declared illegal in 1923, presumably due to internal divisions within the church regarding its basic convictions, shared only by a few \"initiated\" individuals. Still, growth continued, but appeals for official status were denied in 1924 and 1929. During this time, a significant number of Pentecostal churches identified as [[Baptist Union of Romania|Baptist]] in order to be registered with an official religious organisation as specified by the 1928 Law on Cults.<ref>Pope, p. 183-4.</ref>\n\nIn 1940 the [[Ion Antonescu|Antonescu]] regime imprisoned a large number of Pentecostalists and Baptists, even planning to send them to concentration camps in [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]];<ref name=\"crestinul\">[http://www.crestinul.ro/istoriamispenticostale.htm \"Istoria mi\u015fc\u0103rii penticostale din Rom\u00e2nia\" (\"History of the Pentecostal Movement in Romania\")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417182148/http://www.crestinul.ro/istoriamispenticostale.htm |date=2008-04-17 }}, ''Cre\u015ftinul''; accessed April 7, 2008.</ref> the church was outlawed from 1942 until after the [[King Michael Coup]] of 1944.

He took part in the 50th Interconfessional Theological Conference at Bucharest in 1987 and was the only neo-Protestant quoted by the international press. He declared that his country had become \"more beautiful and stronger\" each year, and expressed special gratitude to the state for the pastoral programme and the publications the churches were allowed to have. He called particular attention to the cross-cultural appeal of his church (generally lacking in more established bodies), noting that services were conducted in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] in addition to the Romanian language of the majority. At the close of his address, he praised Ceau\u015fescu's \"indefatigable work\" for global peace.<ref name=\"R1845\">Pope, p. 184-5.</ref> During the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], when Ceau\u015fescu feared Romania would be invaded next, an official relayed to him that a prophecy had been made by a Pentecostal believer in [[Vicovu de Sus]] to the effect that the country's borders were protected by angels.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Lavinia Betea, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/Biserica_Penticostala_si_lucrarea_Duhului_Sfant_0_787721381.html \"Biserica Penticostal\u0103 \u015fi lucrarea Duhului Sf\u00e2nt\"]; ''Adev\u0103rul'', October 8, 2012; accessed October 18, 2012</ref>\n\nThe church strove to transform its members to become model socialist citizens of industry and integrity; while some Pentecostal views clearly perplexed state authorities, they found within these communities signs of the moral qualities and ethnic reconciliation needed in Romanian society.<ref name=\"R1845\"/> By the 1980s, the church was anxious for better relations with other religious groups, particularly the dominant [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] from which it had long been estranged, and the Baptists, severe critics of their focus on [[glossolalia]].

They represented groups of believers scattered throughout the country, some of whom may also have belonged to the official church but who gathered in rural areas for their own Bible Studies and prayer meetings \u201cunauthorized\u201d by the Institutionalized Church. The official church was restrained in its public exercise of the [[spiritual gift]]s, and this attitude may have been important in bringing about extralegal inspirational meetings. The group may also have included a segment of the church that originally remained outside the union because of what it perceived as the official body's unacceptable relationship to the state. Additional concerns were similar to those openly voiced by the Baptists: difficulties in building new churches, baptism restrictions, registration of church members, evangelism and approval of pastors. They deplored what they saw as their leaders' \"blind submissiveness\", the \"political elements\" expected to be embodied in preaching, the censorship of the ''Buletin'', the control of visits from abroad, and reports that had to be filed with the [[Securitate]].

The church grew rapidly and it was declared illegal in 1923, presumably due to internal divisions within the church regarding its basic convictions, shared only by a few \"initiated\" individuals. Still, growth continued, but appeals for official status were denied in 1924 and 1929. During this time, a significant number of Pentecostal churches identified as [[Baptist Union of Romania|Baptist]] in order to be registered with an official religious organisation as specified by the 1928 Law on Cults.<ref>Pope, p. 183-4.</ref>\n\nIn 1940 the [[Ion Antonescu|Antonescu]] regime imprisoned a large number of Pentecostalists and Baptists, even planning to send them to concentration camps in [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]];<ref name=\"crestinul\">[http://www.crestinul.ro/istoriamispenticostale.htm \"Istoria mi\u015fc\u0103rii penticostale din Rom\u00e2nia\" (\"History of the Pentecostal Movement in Romania\")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417182148/http://www.crestinul.ro/istoriamispenticostale.htm |date=2008-04-17 }}, ''Cre\u015ftinul''; accessed April 7, 2008.</ref> the church was outlawed from 1942 until after the [[King Michael Coup]] of 1944.

He took part in the 50th Interconfessional Theological Conference at Bucharest in 1987 and was the only neo-Protestant quoted by the international press. He declared that his country had become \"more beautiful and stronger\" each year, and expressed special gratitude to the state for the pastoral programme and the publications the churches were allowed to have. He called particular attention to the cross-cultural appeal of his church (generally lacking in more established bodies), noting that services were conducted in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] in addition to the Romanian language of the majority. At the close of his address, he praised Ceau\u015fescu's \"indefatigable work\" for global peace.<ref name=\"R1845\">Pope, p. 184-5.</ref> During the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], when Ceau\u015fescu feared Romania would be invaded next, an official relayed to him that a prophecy had been made by a Pentecostal believer in [[Vicovu de Sus]] to the effect that the country's borders were protected by angels.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Lavinia Betea, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/Biserica_Penticostala_si_lucrarea_Duhului_Sfant_0_787721381.html \"Biserica Penticostal\u0103 \u015fi lucrarea Duhului Sf\u00e2nt\"]; ''Adev\u0103rul'', October 8, 2012; accessed October 18, 2012</ref>\n\nThe church strove to transform its members to become model socialist citizens of industry and integrity; while some Pentecostal views clearly perplexed state authorities, they found within these communities signs of the moral qualities and ethnic reconciliation needed in Romanian society.<ref name=\"R1845\"/> By the 1980s, the church was anxious for better relations with other religious groups, particularly the dominant [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] from which it had long been estranged, and the Baptists, severe critics of their focus on [[glossolalia]].

They represented groups of believers scattered throughout the country, some of whom may also have belonged to the official church but who gathered in rural areas for their own Bible Studies and prayer meetings \u201cunauthorized\u201d by the Institutionalized Church. The official church was restrained in its public exercise of the [[spiritual gift]]s, and this attitude may have been important in bringing about extralegal inspirational meetings. The group may also have included a segment of the church that originally remained outside the union because of what it perceived as the official body's unacceptable relationship to the state. Additional concerns were similar to those openly voiced by the Baptists: difficulties in building new churches, baptism restrictions, registration of church members, evangelism and approval of pastors. They deplored what they saw as their leaders' \"blind submissiveness\", the \"political elements\" expected to be embodied in preaching, the censorship of the ''Buletin'', the control of visits from abroad, and reports that had to be filed with the [[Securitate]]. The Dissidents maintained an extremely low profile and no accurate estimate of their strength can be made. It may have experienced considerable growth alongside the official church, attracting those who favoured more independent leadership. It very likely had close ties with Eastern European missions in Western Europe and the US that strongly supported this type of clandestine community.<ref>Pope, pp. 192-3.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Anderson, Allan.

Book spent a large part of his career in [[Non-League football]] with his home town club [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]], before entering league football with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. At the age of 31, he joined [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], where he became captain. Under Book's captaincy, Manchester City won four trophies, making him the second-most decorated Manchester City captain of all-time. Book had a five-year tenure as Manchester City manager from 1974 to 1979, and subsequently held various coaching roles at the club until 1996.\n\n==Early life and non-league career==\nBook was born in Bath, but at the age of four moved to India when his father, an officer in the [[Somerset Light Infantry]], was posted.<ref>{{cite book |last= Book|first= Tony|first2= David |last2=Clayton| title= Maine Man | page=21|publisher=Mainstream publishing |year= 2004 |isbn= 1-84018-812-X}}</ref> During World War II, Book's father served in [[Burma]], and Book lived with his mother and brothers in army quarters in a number of places in [[British India]], including [[Mumbai]] and [[Multan]]. In September 1945, the Book family returned to England. Tony started secondary school in Bath, and gained his first experience in competitive football when he was selected to play for both Bath boys and Somerset boys.<ref name =\"Penney\">{{cite book | last=Penney|first= Ian |  title=The Legends of Manchester City |  publisher=Breedon Books |  year=2002 |   isbn=1-85983-326-8 }}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving school at 16, Book became an apprentice [[bricklayer]] and played amateur football as an inside-forward for Peasedown Miners, until he was called up for [[national service]] in 1952.<ref>''Maine Man'' 32\u201333</ref> While playing for his army team Book converted to the [[full-back (association football)|full-back]] position and had a trial with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] courtesy of a recommendation from army teammate [[Frank Blunstone]], but was not taken on.<ref>{{cite book |last= James|first= Gary| title= The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame | page=30|publisher=Hamlyn |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-600-61282-1}}</ref>\n\nAfter completing his national service, Book returned his bricklaying job in Bath and started playing for [[Frome Town F.C.|Frome Town]].<ref name=\"Penney\"/> During the 1955\u201356 season Frome suffered financial difficulties, and sent letters to all their players permitting them to leave if they wished.
