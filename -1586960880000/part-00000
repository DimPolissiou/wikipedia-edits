{"title_page": "20th-century history of the Catholic Church in the United States", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe '''20th-century history of the Catholic Church in the United States''' was characterized by a period of continuous growth for the Church in the United States, with Catholics progressively evolving from a small minority to a large minority.\n\n==Early 20th century==\nIn 1900 the Catholic population was 10 million, under the control of  14 Archbishops, 77 bishops, and 12,000 priests.  The community had built 10,000 churches, of which two-thirds had resident pastors.  Catholic schools educated nearly 1,000,000 children and youth.   Catholics were heavily concentrated in the industrial and mining centers of the Northeast; few were farmers and only a small fraction lived in the South, chiefly in Louisiana. Catholics comprised less than one in 7 of the national population of 76 million.<ref>Thomas T. McAvoy, \"The Catholic Minority after the Americanist Controversy, 1899-1917: A Survey,\" ''Review of Politics'' (1959) 21#1 pp. 53-82, at p 59 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1405340 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===National Catholic War Council===\n\nIt was [[John J. Burke]], editor of the [[Catholic World]], who first recognized the urgency of the moment. Burke had long argued for a national outlook and sense of unity among the country's Catholics.  The war provided the impetus to initiate these efforts.  The Catholic hierarchy was eager to show its enthusiastic support for the war effort.  In order to better address challenges posed by World War I, the American Catholic hierarchy in 1917 chose to meet collectively for the first time since 1884. In August 1917, on the campus of [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, Burke, with the backing of Cardinal Gibbons and other bishops,  convened a meeting to discuss organizing a national agency to coordinate the war effort of the American Catholic community. One hundred and fifteen delegates from sixty-eight dioceses, together with members from the Catholic press and representatives from twenty-seven national Catholic organizations attended this first meeting. It set up the National Catholic War Council, \"to study, coordinate, unify and put in operation all Catholic activities incidental to the war.\"  An executive committee, chaired by Cardinal [[George Mundelein]] of Chicago, was formed in December 1917, to oversee the work of the Council.  The mandate of the newly formed organization included the promotion of Catholic participation in the war, through chaplains, literature, and care for the morale of the troops, as well as (for the first time) lobbying for Catholic interests in the nation's capital.<ref>National Catholic War Council, ''Handbook of the National Catholic War council'' (1918) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bmQvAAAAYAAJ online]</ref>\n\nAs the war ended liberals hoped that a new commitment to social reform would characterize the ensuing peace. The Council saw an opportunity to use its national voice to shape reform and in April 1918 created a Committee for Reconstruction.  [[John A. Ryan]] wrote the \"Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction.\" It was issued to the public on February 12, 1919,  through a carefully planned public relations campaign.  The plan offered a guide for overhauling America's politics, society, and economy based on Pope Leo XIII's ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' and a variety of influences reflecting the [[Progressive Era]] in the U.S..\n\nThe Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was thus questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, while Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and [[William Henry O'Connell]] of Boston, among others, opposed it. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backing it, for example, and business groups criticizing it.\n\n===Threats to parochial schools===\n{{Main|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\n\nAfter World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and \"foreign\" values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted lawsdesigned to use schools to promote a common American culture.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attracted as many as 14,000 members in Oregon, establishing 58 klaverns by the end of 1922.  Given the small population of non-white minorities outside Portland, the Oregon Klan directed its attention almost exclusively against Catholics, who numbered about 8% of the population.\n\nIn 1922, the [[Freemasons|Masonic]] Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored a bill to require all school-age children to attend public schools.  With support of the Klan and Democratic Governor [[Walter M. Pierce]], endorsed by the Klan, the Compulsory Education Act was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685.  Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. The constitutionality of the law was challenged in court and ultimately struck down by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) before it went into effect.<ref name=\"shibleyrighton.com\">Howard, J. Paul.

In [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]] (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\"\n\nThe Catholic leadership in 1924 mobilized to defeat a constitutional amendment that, they feared, would mean not just federal control of child labor, but also would be the opening wedge for federal invasion of individual and parental rights, that would threaten parochial schools.  Many church leaders had also opposed woman suffrage. When  it passed in 1920 they called upon Catholic women to start voting.  Most of the Catholic women actually started to vote in 1928, when there was a Catholic on the  presidential ticket.<ref>James Hennessy, ''American Catholics: A history of the Roman Catholic community in the United States'' (1981) pp 233-4</ref>\n\n===1928 Presidential election===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1928}}\n\n[[Image:AlSmithWaves.jpg|thumb|right|Al Smith]]\n\nIn 1928, [[Al Smith]] became the first Roman Catholic to gain a major party's nomination for president, and his religion became an issue during the [[1928 United States presidential election|campaign]].  Many Protestants feared that Smith would take orders from church leaders in Rome in making decisions affecting the country. Smith was from New York City, with strong ties to the Democratic machine known as Tammany Hall.  To top it off, he was a wet who strongly opposed national prohibition.<ref>Edmund Arthur Moore, ''A Catholic Runs for President'' (1956)</ref>\n\n===National Catholic Welfare Conference===\n{{Main|National Catholic Welfare Council}}\n\nThe National Catholic Welfare Council (NCWC) began in 1919 as the annual meeting of the American Catholic hierarchy and its standing secretariat.  It consists of a staff of clergy as well as committees of bishops who discussed and sometimes issued statements on matters of national policy such as education, welfare, and health care.\n\nIt split into the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference. Today it is the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (USCCB).\n\n==Parochial schools==\n{{main|History of Catholic education in the United States}}\nIn 1900, the Church supported 3,500 parochial schools, usually under the control of the local parish. By 1920, the number of elementary schools had reached 6,551, enrolling 1,759, 673 pupils taught by 41, 581 teachers. Secondary education likewise boomed. In 1900, there were only about 100 Catholic high schools, but by 1920 more than 1,500 were in operation. For more than two generations, enrollment continued to climb.\n\nThe Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities was founded in 1899,   In 1904, Catholic educators formed an organization to coordinate their efforts on a national scale: the [[National Catholic Educational Association|Catholic Educational Association]] which later changed its name to the National Catholic Educational Association.\n\n===Polish Catholic parish schools===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Polish American catholic school language.jpg|thumb|right|169px|Catholic nun teaching the Polish language, Detroit. The phrase \"dzieci ida\" means \"children go\".]] -->\n\nPolish Americans boosted membership in the Catholic church and expanded parishes previously non-existent in the Midwestern United States. Student enrollment had increased significantly in the interwar period and many young Polish women were requested to teach in the schools. Polish-born nuns were strongly desired for educating the students. A study in 1932 found that close to 300,000 Polish Americans were enrolled in over 600 Polish grade schools in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.pchswi.org/archives/polish_heritage/soroka/soroka_pages_59_60.htm |title = Catholic Schools}}</ref> Very few of the Polish Americans who graduated from grade school at the time pursued high school or college at that time. High School was not required and enrollment across the United States was far lower at the time.\n\nPolish Americans took to the Catholic private schools in great numbers. In Chicago, 35,862 students (60 percent of the Polish population) attended Polish parochial schools in 1920. Nearly every Polish parish in the American Catholic Church had a school, whereas in Italian parishes, it was typically one in ten parishes. Even as late as 1960, estimates of Chicago's students attending Polish parochial schools was about 60% of the Polish American population.\n\n===Supreme Court upholds parochial schools===\n{{Further|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\nIn 1922, the voters of Oregon passed an [[initiative]] amending [[Oregon Revised Statutes|Oregon Law]] Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act.  The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law.  The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools.<ref name=\"shibleyrighton.com\"/>  The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools.  In [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]] (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\"\n\n===Peak===\n\nBy the mid-1960s, enrollment in Catholic parochial schools had reached an all-time high of 4.5 million elementary school pupils, with about 1 million students in Catholic high schools.  The enrollments steadily declined as Catholics moved to the suburbs, where the children attended public schools.<ref>Andrew M. Greeley, et al.  ''Catholic Schools and a Declining Church'' (1976) ch 2</ref>\n\n==Mid-20th century==\n\n===Catholic Worker Movement===\n{{Main|Catholic Worker Movement}}\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement began as a means to combine [[Dorothy Day]]'s history in American social activism, anarchism, and pacifism with the tenets of Catholicism (including a strong current of [[distributism]]), five years after her 1927 conversion.<ref>\"[http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html \"Dorothy Day, Prophet of Pacifism for the Catholic Church\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927232314/http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html |date=September 27, 2008 }}\" from \"Houston Catholic Worker\" newspaper, October 1997</ref>\nThe group started with the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' magazine that staked out a neutral, [[pacifism|pacifist]] position in the war-torn 1930s. This grew into a \"[[house of hospitality]]\" in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States, and to Canada and Britain.\n\n===1930s===\nHistorian John McGreevey notes: \"Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraged their parishioners to join unions, and some like Pittsburgh's [[Charles Owen Rice|Charles Rice]], Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo's]] Monsignor [[John P. Boland (labor priest)|John P.Boland]], served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations.\"  The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and [[Dorothy Day]] grew out of the same impetuses to put [[Catholic social teaching]] into action.\n\n===Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems===\n\nThe [[Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems]] (1923\u20131937) was conceived by Fr. Raymond McGowan as a way of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of Catholic social teaching. Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due in part to lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business.\n\n===1960s===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1960}}\n[[Image:John F. Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States]]\nThe 1960s marked a profound transformation of the Catholic Church in the United States.<ref>Mark S. Massa, ''The American Catholic Revolution: How the Sixties Changed the Church Forever'' (2010) [https://www.questia.com/library/120076903/the-american-catholic-revolution-how-the-sixties online]</ref>\n\nReligion became a divisive issue during the [[1960 United States presidential election|presidential campaign of 1960]]. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] of Massachusetts was vying to become the nation's first Catholic president, Using his base of support among urban Catholics.  A key factor that was hurting  Kennedy in his campaign was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some [[Protestants]] believed that, if he were elected president, Kennedy would have to take orders from the [[pope]] in Rome.  When offered the opportunity to speak before a convention of Baptist ministers, decided to try to put the issue to rest.\n\nTo address fears that his Roman Catholicism would impact his decision-making, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, \"I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters \u2014 and the Church does not speak for me.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html |title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |last=Kennedy |first=John F. |date=June 18, 2002 |work=American Rhetoric |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911175450/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html |archivedate=September 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Roman Catholic.\n\nEven so, it was widely believed after the election that Kennedy lost some heavily Protestant states because of his Catholicism.  His address did not please everyone: many non-Catholics remained unconvinced that a Catholic could be president without divided loyalties; and many Catholics thought he conceded too much in his profession of belief in an \"absolute\" [[separation of church and state]]. The speech is widely considered to be an important marker in the history of Catholicism (and anti-Catholicism) in the United States.\n\nKennedy went on to win the national popular vote over [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) - the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  ''[[The New York Times]]'', summarizing the discussion late in November, spoke of a \"narrow consensus\" among the experts that Kennedy had won more than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,<ref>New York Times, November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5</ref> as Northern Catholics flocked to Kennedy because of attacks on his religion.\n\n===1970s===\nOn January 22, 1973,  the Supreme Court of the United States announced its decision in the [[Roe v. Wade]] case, finding that a constitutional [[right to privacy]] prohibited interference with a woman's 'right' to an abortion. The Catholic Church was one of the few institutional voices opposing the decision at the time, leading to the abortion issue being construed then and since largely as a religious one. Although a majority of Catholics have agreed with the hierarchy in their insistence on legal protection of the unborn, some\u2014including prominent politicians\u2014have not, leading to perennial controversies concerning the responsibilities of Catholics in American public life.\n\n==Late 20th century==\n\n=== 1980s ===\n{{Further|Sanctuary movement}}\nSanctuary of refugees from Central American civil wars was a movement in the 1980s. It was part of a broader anti-war movement positioned against U.S. foreign policy in Central America.  By 1987, 440 sites in the United States had been declared \"sanctuary congregations\" or \"[[sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]]\" open to migrants from the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.  These sites included university campuses.\n\nThe movement originated along the U.S. border with Mexico in [[Arizona]] but was also strong in Chicago, [[Philadelphia]], and [[California]]. In 1981, Rev. [[John Fife]] and [[James A. \"Jim\" Corbett|Jim Corbett]], among others, began bringing Central American refugees into the United States. It was their intent to offer sanctuary, or faith-based protection, from the political violence that was taking place in [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]].<ref>See [[James P. Carroll]], 2006: \"Sanctuary\", in ''House of War'', pp. 397-404. {{ISBN|0-618-18780-4}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] indicted several activists in south [[Texas]] for assisting refugees.  Later 16 activists in Arizona were indicted, including Fife and Corbett in 1985; 11 were brought to trial and 8 were convicted of alien smuggling and other charges.  The defendants claimed their actions were justifiable to save lives of people who would be killed and had no other way to escape.\n\nThis movement has been succeeded in the 2000s by the movement of churches and other houses of worship, to shelter immigrants in danger of deportation.  The New Sanctuary Movement is a network of houses of worship that facilitates this effort.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newsanctuarymovement.org/build-tradition.htm |title=Sanctuary Movement history on New Sanctuary Movement page |access-date=October 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327231015/http://www.newsanctuarymovement.org/build-tradition.htm |archive-date=March 27, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Abuse affairs in the later 20th century===\n{{Main|Catholic sex abuse scandal in the United States}}\n\nIn the later 20th century \"[...] the Catholic Church in the United States became the subject of controversy due to allegations of [[Catholic sex abuse cases|clerical child abuse of children and adolescents]], of episcopal [[negligence]] in arresting these crimes, and of numerous civil suits that cost Catholic dioceses hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\"<ref>Patrick W.

The community had built 10,000 churches, of which two-thirds had resident pastors.  Catholic schools educated nearly 1,000,000 children and youth.   Catholics were heavily concentrated in the industrial and mining centers of the Northeast; few were farmers and only a small fraction lived in the South, chiefly in Louisiana. Catholics comprised less than one in 7 of the national population of 76 million.<ref>Thomas T. McAvoy, \"The Catholic Minority after the Americanist Controversy, 1899-1917: A Survey,\" ''Review of Politics'' (1959) 21#1 pp. 53-82, at p 59 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1405340 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===National Catholic War Council===\n\nIt was [[John J. Burke]], editor of the [[Catholic World]], who first recognized the urgency of the moment. Burke had long argued for a national outlook and sense of unity among the country's Catholics.  The war provided the impetus to initiate these efforts.  The Catholic hierarchy was eager to show its enthusiastic support for the war effort.  In order to better address challenges posed by World War I, the American Catholic hierarchy in 1917 chose to meet collectively for the first time since 1884. In August 1917, on the campus of [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, Burke, with the backing of Cardinal Gibbons and other bishops,  convened a meeting to discuss organizing a national agency to coordinate the war effort of the American Catholic community. One hundred and fifteen delegates from sixty-eight dioceses, together with members from the Catholic press and representatives from twenty-seven national Catholic organizations attended this first meeting. It set up the National Catholic War Council, \"to study, coordinate, unify and put in operation all Catholic activities incidental to the war.\"  An executive committee, chaired by Cardinal [[George Mundelein]] of Chicago, was formed in December 1917, to oversee the work of the Council.  The mandate of the newly formed organization included the promotion of Catholic participation in the war, through chaplains, literature, and care for the morale of the troops, as well as (for the first time) lobbying for Catholic interests in the nation's capital.<ref>National Catholic War Council, ''Handbook of the National Catholic War council'' (1918) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bmQvAAAAYAAJ online]</ref>\n\nAs the war ended liberals hoped that a new commitment to social reform would characterize the ensuing peace. The Council saw an opportunity to use its national voice to shape reform and in April 1918 created a Committee for Reconstruction.  [[John A. Ryan]] wrote the \"Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction.\" It was issued to the public on February 12, 1919,  through a carefully planned public relations campaign.  The plan offered a guide for overhauling America's politics, society, and economy based on Pope Leo XIII's ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' and a variety of influences reflecting the [[Progressive Era]] in the U.S..\n\nThe Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was thus questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, while Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and [[William Henry O'Connell]] of Boston, among others, opposed it. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backing it, for example, and business groups criticizing it.\n\n===Threats to parochial schools===\n{{Main|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\n\nAfter World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and \"foreign\" values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted lawsdesigned to use schools to promote a common American culture.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attracted as many as 14,000 members in Oregon, establishing 58 klaverns by the end of 1922.  Given the small population of non-white minorities outside Portland, the Oregon Klan directed its attention almost exclusively against Catholics, who numbered about 8% of the population.\n\nIn 1922, the [[Freemasons|Masonic]] Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored a bill to require all school-age children to attend public schools.  With support of the Klan and Democratic Governor [[Walter M. Pierce]], endorsed by the Klan, the Compulsory Education Act was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685.  Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. The constitutionality of the law was challenged in court and ultimately struck down by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) before it went into effect.<ref name=\"shibleyrighton.com\">Howard, J. Paul.

In [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]] (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\"\n\nThe Catholic leadership in 1924 mobilized to defeat a constitutional amendment that, they feared, would mean not just federal control of child labor, but also would be the opening wedge for federal invasion of individual and parental rights, that would threaten parochial schools.  Many church leaders had also opposed woman suffrage. When  it passed in 1920 they called upon Catholic women to start voting.  Most of the Catholic women actually started to vote in 1928, when there was a Catholic on the  presidential ticket.<ref>James Hennessy, ''American Catholics: A history of the Roman Catholic community in the United States'' (1981) pp 233-4</ref>\n\n===1928 Presidential election===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1928}}\n\n[[Image:AlSmithWaves.jpg|thumb|right|Al Smith]]\n\nIn 1928, [[Al Smith]] became the first Roman Catholic to gain a major party's nomination for President, and his religion became an issue during the [[1928 United States presidential election|campaign]].  Many Protestants feared that Smith would take orders from church leaders in Rome in making decisions affecting the country. Smith was from New York City, with strong ties to the Democratic machine known as Tammany Hall.  To top it off, he was a wet who strongly opposed national prohibition.<ref>Edmund Arthur Moore, ''A Catholic Runs for President'' (1956)</ref>\n\n===National Catholic Welfare Conference===\n{{Main|National Catholic Welfare Council}}\n\nThe National Catholic Welfare Council (NCWC) began in 1919 as the annual meeting of the American Catholic hierarchy and its standing secretariat.  It consists of a staff of clergy as well as committees of bishops who discussed and sometimes issued statements on matters of national policy such as education, welfare, and health care.\n\nIt split into the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference. Today it is the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (USCCB).\n\n==Parochial schools==\n{{main|History of Catholic education in the United States}}\nIn 1900, the Church supported 3,500 parochial schools, usually under the control of the local parish. By 1920, the number of elementary schools had reached 6,551, enrolling 1,759, 673 pupils taught by 41, 581 teachers. Secondary education likewise boomed. In 1900, there were only about 100 Catholic high schools, but by 1920 more than 1,500 were in operation. For more than two generations, enrollment continued to climb.\n\nThe Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities was founded in 1899,   In 1904, Catholic educators formed an organization to coordinate their efforts on a national scale: the [[National Catholic Educational Association|Catholic Educational Association]] which later changed its name to the National Catholic Educational Association.\n\n===Polish Catholic parish schools===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Polish American catholic school language.jpg|thumb|right|169px|Catholic nun teaching the Polish language, Detroit. The phrase \"dzieci ida\" means \"children go\".]] -->\n\nPolish Americans boosted membership in the Catholic church and expanded parishes previously non-existent in the Midwestern United States. Student enrollment had increased significantly in the interwar period and many young Polish women were requested to teach in the schools. Polish-born nuns were strongly desired for educating the students. A study in 1932 found that close to 300,000 Polish Americans were enrolled in over 600 Polish grade schools in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.pchswi.org/archives/polish_heritage/soroka/soroka_pages_59_60.htm |title = Catholic Schools}}</ref> Very few of the Polish Americans who graduated from grade school at the time pursued high school or college at that time. High School was not required and enrollment across the United States was far lower at the time.\n\nPolish Americans took to the Catholic private schools in great numbers. In Chicago, 35,862 students (60 percent of the Polish population) attended Polish parochial schools in 1920. Nearly every Polish parish in the American Catholic Church had a school, whereas in Italian parishes, it was typically one in ten parishes. Even as late as 1960, estimates of Chicago's students attending Polish parochial schools was about 60% of the Polish American population.\n\n===Supreme Court upholds parochial schools===\n{{Further|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\nIn 1922, the voters of Oregon passed an [[initiative]] amending [[Oregon Revised Statutes|Oregon Law]] Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act.  The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law.  The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools.<ref name=\"shibleyrighton.com\"/>  The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools.  In [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]] (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\"\n\n===Peak===\n\nBy the mid-1960s, enrollment in Catholic parochial schools had reached an all-time high of 4.5 million elementary school pupils, with about 1 million students in Catholic high schools.  The enrollments steadily declined as Catholics moved to the suburbs, where the children attended public schools.<ref>Andrew M. Greeley, et al.  ''Catholic Schools and a Declining Church'' (1976) ch 2</ref>\n\n==Mid-20th century==\n\n===Catholic Worker Movement===\n{{Main|Catholic Worker Movement}}\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement began as a means to combine [[Dorothy Day]]'s history in American social activism, anarchism, and pacifism with the tenets of Catholicism (including a strong current of [[distributism]]), five years after her 1927 conversion.<ref>\"[http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html \"Dorothy Day, Prophet of Pacifism for the Catholic Church\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927232314/http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html |date=September 27, 2008 }}\" from \"Houston Catholic Worker\" newspaper, October 1997</ref>\nThe group started with the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' magazine that staked out a neutral, [[pacifism|pacifist]] position in the war-torn 1930s. This grew into a \"[[house of hospitality]]\" in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States, and to Canada and Britain.\n\n===1930s===\nHistorian John McGreevey notes: \"Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraged their parishioners to join unions, and some like Pittsburgh's [[Charles Owen Rice|Charles Rice]], Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo's]] Monsignor [[John P. Boland (labor priest)|John P.Boland]], served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations.\"  The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and [[Dorothy Day]] grew out of the same impetuses to put [[Catholic social teaching]] into action.\n\n===Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems===\n\nThe [[Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems]] (1923\u20131937) was conceived by Fr. Raymond McGowan as a way of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of Catholic social teaching. Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due in part to lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business.\n\n===1960s===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1960}}\n[[Image:John F. Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States]]\nThe 1960s marked a profound transformation of the Catholic Church in the United States.<ref>Mark S. Massa, ''The American Catholic Revolution: How the Sixties Changed the Church Forever'' (2010) [https://www.questia.com/library/120076903/the-american-catholic-revolution-how-the-sixties online]</ref>\n\nReligion became a divisive issue during the [[1960 United States presidential election|presidential campaign of 1960]]. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] of Massachusetts was vying to become the nation's first Catholic president, Using his base of support among urban Catholics.  A key factor that was hurting  Kennedy in his campaign was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some [[Protestants]] believed that, if he were elected President, Kennedy would have to take orders from the [[Pope]] in Rome.  When offered the opportunity to speak before a convention of Baptist ministers, decided to try to put the issue to rest.\n\nTo address fears that his Roman Catholicism would impact his decision-making, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, \"I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters \u2014 and the Church does not speak for me.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html |title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |last=Kennedy |first=John F. |date=June 18, 2002 |work=American Rhetoric |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911175450/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html |archivedate=September 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Roman Catholic.\n\nEven so, it was widely believed after the election that Kennedy lost some heavily Protestant states because of his Catholicism.  His address did not please everyone: many non-Catholics remained unconvinced that a Catholic could be president without divided loyalties; and many Catholics thought he conceded too much in his profession of belief in an \"absolute\" [[separation of church and state]]. The speech is widely considered to be an important marker in the history of Catholicism (and anti-Catholicism) in the United States.\n\nKennedy went on to win the national popular vote over [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) - the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  ''[[The New York Times]]'', summarizing the discussion late in November, spoke of a \"narrow consensus\" among the experts that Kennedy had won more than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,<ref>New York Times, November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5</ref> as Northern Catholics flocked to Kennedy because of attacks on his religion.\n\n===1970s===\nOn January 22, 1973,  the Supreme Court of the United States announced its decision in the [[Roe v. Wade]] case, finding that a constitutional [[right to privacy]] prohibited interference with a woman's 'right' to an abortion. The Catholic Church was one of the few institutional voices opposing the decision at the time, leading to the abortion issue being construed then and since largely as a religious one. Although a majority of Catholics have agreed with the hierarchy in their insistence on legal protection of the unborn, some\u2014including prominent politicians\u2014have not, leading to perennial controversies concerning the responsibilities of Catholics in American public life.\n\n==Late 20th century==\n\n=== 1980s ===\n{{Further|Sanctuary movement}}\nSanctuary of refugees from Central American civil wars was a movement in the 1980s. It was part of a broader anti-war movement positioned against U.S. foreign policy in Central America.  By 1987, 440 sites in the United States had been declared \"sanctuary congregations\" or \"[[sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]]\" open to migrants from the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.  These sites included university campuses.\n\nThe movement originated along the U.S. border with Mexico in [[Arizona]] but was also strong in Chicago, [[Philadelphia]], and [[California]]. In 1981, Rev. [[John Fife]] and [[James A. \"Jim\" Corbett|Jim Corbett]], among others, began bringing Central American refugees into the United States. It was their intent to offer sanctuary, or faith-based protection, from the political violence that was taking place in [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]].<ref>See [[James P. Carroll]], 2006: \"Sanctuary\", in ''House of War'', pp. 397-404. {{ISBN|0-618-18780-4}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] indicted several activists in south [[Texas]] for assisting refugees.  Later 16 activists in Arizona were indicted, including Fife and Corbett in 1985; 11 were brought to trial and 8 were convicted of alien smuggling and other charges.  The defendants claimed their actions were justifiable to save lives of people who would be killed and had no other way to escape.\n\nThis movement has been succeeded in the 2000s by the movement of churches and other houses of worship, to shelter immigrants in danger of deportation.  The New Sanctuary Movement is a network of houses of worship that facilitates this effort.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newsanctuarymovement.org/build-tradition.htm |title=Sanctuary Movement history on New Sanctuary Movement page |access-date=October 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327231015/http://www.newsanctuarymovement.org/build-tradition.htm |archive-date=March 27, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Abuse affairs in the later 20th century===\n{{Main|Catholic sex abuse scandal in the United States}}\n\nIn the later 20th century \"[...] the Catholic Church in the United States became the subject of controversy due to allegations of [[Catholic sex abuse cases|clerical child abuse of children and adolescents]], of episcopal [[negligence]] in arresting these crimes, and of numerous civil suits that cost Catholic dioceses hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\"<ref>Patrick W.

The division was discontinued at the end of the 2017-18 season and Gloucester 2 was divided into north and south regional divisions.\n\n==Teams 2017\u201318==\n\n{{col-begin|width=100%}}\n{{col-break|width=70%}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100%\n|-\n!Team\n!Ground\n!Capacity\n!Town/Village\n!Previous season\n|-\n| Cainscross || Victory Park || || [[Cainscross]], [[Stroud]], [[Gloucestershire]] || 6th\n|-\n| Fairford || Walnut Tree Field || || [[Fairford]], [[Gloucestershire]] || 4th\n|-\n| Gloucester All Blues || The Oxleaze || || [[Gloucester]], [[Gloucestershire]] || 7th\n|-\n| Kingswood || Grimsbury Road Playing Fields || || [[Warmley]], [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood]], [[Gloucestershire]] || Relegated from [[Gloucester 2]] (12th)\t\n|-\n| Norton || Norton Parish Grounds || || [[Norton, Gloucestershire|Norton]], [[Gloucestershire]] || 5th\n|-\n| Painswick || Broadham Fields || || [[Painswick]], [[Gloucestershire]] || Relegated from [[Gloucester 2]] (11th)\n|-\n| Tetbury || The Recreation Ground || || [[Tetbury]], [[Gloucestershire]] || 3rd\n|-\n| United Bristol Hospitals || Portway Development Ground || || [[Portway, Bristol|Portway]], [[Bristol]] || Transferred from Gloucestershire Reserve Leagues\n|-\n| Westbury-on-Severn || Parish Playing Field || || [[Westbury-on-Severn]], [[Gloucestershire]] || Relegated from [[Gloucester 2]] (10th)\n|-\n|}\n\n{{col-break|width=30%}}\n\n{{Location map+|Gloucestershire|width=450|float=right|caption=Locations of the 2017-18 Gloucester 3 teams|places=\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.7426796|long=-2.2476499|label='''[[Cainscross RFC|Cainscross]]'''|position=right|label_size=80}}\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.8675385|long=-2.2595799|label='''[[Gloucester All Blues RFC|Gloucester All Blues]]'''|position=left|label_size=80}}\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.7062607|long=-1.7866100|label='''[[Fairford RFC|Fairford]]'''|position=right|label_size=80}}\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.45997|long=-2.487031|label='''[[Kingswood RFC|Kingswood]]'''|position=right|label_size=80}}\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.915938|long=-2.209299|label='''[[Norton RFC|Norton]]'''|position=left|label_size=80}}\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.7791078|long=-2.205635|label='''[[Painswick RFC|Painswick]]'''|position=right|label_size=80}}\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.6403885|long=-2.1642599|label='''[[Tetbury RFC|Tetbury]]'''|position=right|label_size=80}}\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.821614|long=-2.405423|label='''[[Westbury-on-Severn RFC|Westbury]]'''|position=left|label_size=80}}\n{{location map~|Gloucestershire|lat=51.482456207|long=-2.649753809|label='''[[United Bristol Hospitals RFC|UBH]]'''|position=right|label_size=80}}\n}}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Teams 2016-17==\n*Aretians '''(relegated from [[Gloucester 2]])'''\n*Cainscross\n*[[Cotham Park RFC|Cotham Park]]\n*Fairford\n*Gloucester All Blues\n*Norton\n*Tetbury\n*Wotton\n\n==2015\u201316==\nThe 2015\u201316 Gloucester 3 consists of seven teams from [[Gloucestershire]].

He won three consecutive [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Piston Cups]] (1951/52/53) and he still held the record for most wins in a single season (27, also the number of [[NASCAR]] Grand National races won by Hudson Hornets in 1952<ref>{{cite web |title=Hudson Hornet |author=Jack Nerad |publisher=Driving Today |url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/hudson-hornet |accessdate=26 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025030434/http://www.wbrz.com/news/hudson-hornet |archivedate=25 October 2012}}</ref>). All of that changed for the famous Hornet when a terrible crash on the track during the final lap of the 1954 Piston Cup championship race saw him put out for the season in a career-ending injury which closely paralleled the fate of [[Herb Thomas]], NASCAR's 1951 and 1953 champion. Upon his return, he was received with a complete absence of fanfare and told that he was passed up for the next rookie in line. He kept a newspaper article on the career-ending crash as a reminder to never return to the life that nearly killed him.\n\nJaded by the racing scene, he left that world, apparently taking out time to study medicine. The famous No. 51 disappeared into obscurity, leaving many wondering where he went. He instead opted for a simple navy blue paint job and the life of a physician in the tiny town of Radiator Springs, the \"shining [[Gemstone]]\" of the Mother Road \u2013 [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]. He ran Doc's Clinic as a \"doctor of [[Internal combustion]]\". As times changed and the town was bypassed by [[Interstate 40]], Doc stayed on, even when the population dwindled to a meager dozen residents. He was respected, well-loved and served not only as the town's physician, but as its judge. Nobody in the town had any idea of his past as a racer, knowing him merely as an ordinary Hudson Hornet and he used his Piston Cup trophies to hold his tools instead of putting them on display.\n \n[[File:Reverse Lock Steering.svg|thumb|left|200 px|[[Opposite lock]] or counter-steering through an abrupt right turn, depicted with front wheels in blue during right steer, red during left steer.]]\nUpon meeting the rookie hotshot [[Lightning McQueen]] after he got arrested for destroying the town's main street by accident, Doc saw far too much of the past that he left behind. His one token attempt to explain a controlled skid on an abrupt turn in dirt-track racing to Lightning was met with misunderstanding and skepticism, leaving Doc disillusioned and bitter about the young hot rod who seemed to care only about himself.\n\n{{quote|\"This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt. You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle. Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips. I'll put it simple. If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.\"|Doc Hudson explaining [[drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] to a skeptical McQueen}}\n\nHe was less than happy when an amazed McQueen discovered his past and asked, \"How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?\" Doc admitted that he did not quit, but was forced into retirement after his crash by the rise of hot young racers. \"I had a lot of stuff left,\" Doc said sadly, \"but I never got the chance to show it.\" After McQueen finished fixing the Radiator Springs road that he damaged when arriving in town as part of Doc's court ruling, McQueen decided to stay in town for a while, but Doc was unable to bear having him around any longer and called the news and press, prompting McQueen to immediately leave for the Piston Cup championship race in California. But, seeing how disheartened that everyone was by the unplanned departure, Doc realized that Lightning became more important to them than he thought. His racing days are known to the town by now and he took back his #51 racing colors to become McQueen's pit crew chief. Nearly [[list of Cars characters#Radiator Springs populace|the entire town]] traveled to California as McQueen's [[pit crew]] and cheering section. At the race, the commentators recognized his presence on the cameras and Doc finally received a long-overdue acknowledgment for his return. When McQueen chose to help an injured Strip Weathers finish his last race instead of winning the Piston Cup, he expressed how proud he was of Lightning.\n\n{{quote|It\u2019s just an empty cup.|Doc Hudson, thinking friends are more important than trophies and fame.}}\n\nAt the end of the film, Doc kept his racing colors, becoming a trainer and mentor as well as a friend to the young McQueen. Just like McQueen, Doc learned some lessons: friendship, promises, how greed affected others and secrets could not be kept forever. When a racing museum subsequently opened in Radiator Springs, one entire wing was devoted to his racing career. Much as [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.|Junior #8]] acknowledged to [[Richard Petty|\"The King\"]] that \"you've been an inspiration to me\", The King indicated \"the Hudson Hornet was my inspiration\".\n\nIn the video game taking place after the first ''Cars'' film, he taught McQueen powerslide lessons and became the crew chief for McQueen during the Piston Cup season in the game's story mode. He was also a playable character who could be purchased by 5,000 points. Though during the game's story mode, he wore his original blue paint job and white wheels when racing McQueen or training him, but his original racing colors along with his red wheels could also be purchased.\n\nIn ''[[Cars 2]]'', Doc died before the events of the film and the Piston Cup was renamed in his honor, with his clinic being converted into a museum that displayed trophies and mementos from his career.\n\n[[John Lasseter]] announced that ''[[Cars 3]]'' would include a tribute to Doc. McQueen's crash in the teaser was a reference to Doc's accident and he often recalled pieces of advice that Doc gave him in flashbacks. Lightning went to Doc's old trainer, Smokey in [[Thomasville, Georgia|Thomasville]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for help and watched movies of Doc's old races for inspiration. Smokey also explained that training Lightning, not racing, was the most enjoyable part of Doc's life. At the end, Lightning adopted Doc's old racing colors and painted \"The Fabulous Lightning McQueen\" on himself in honor of Doc, \"The Fabulous Hudson Hornet.\" Lightning's bumper also read, \"For Doc Hudson.\" Cruz Ramirez, a trainer who subsequently started a racing career of her own took on Doc's old number 51 as a second tribute.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Fabulous Hudson Hornet}}\n[[File:Hudson Hornet 51.jpg|thumb|#51 \"Doc\", Fabulous Hudson Hornet]]\nThe car is based on the real-life Fabulous Hudson Hornet in NASCAR competition, with Doc's racing career most closely resembling that of [[Herb Thomas]]. Newman, a racing enthusiast and former driver, drew upon his experiences for the grumpy old race car's personality.

He won three consecutive [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Piston Cups]] (1951/52/53) and he still held the record for most wins in a single season (27, also the number of [[NASCAR]] Grand National races won by Hudson Hornets in 1952<ref>{{cite web |title=Hudson Hornet |author=Jack Nerad |publisher=Driving Today |url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/hudson-hornet |accessdate=26 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025030434/http://www.wbrz.com/news/hudson-hornet |archivedate=25 October 2012}}</ref>). All of that changed for the famous Hornet when a terrible crash on the track during the final lap of the 1954 Piston Cup championship race saw him put out for the season in a career-ending injury which closely paralleled the fate of [[Herb Thomas]], NASCAR's 1951 and 1953 champion. Upon his return, he was received with a complete absence of fanfare and told that he was passed up for the next rookie in line. He kept a newspaper article on the career-ending crash as a reminder to never return to the life that nearly killed him.\n\nJaded by the racing scene, he left that world, apparently taking out time to study medicine. The famous No. 51 disappeared into obscurity, leaving many wondering where he went. He instead opted for a simple navy blue paint job and the life of a physician in the tiny town of Radiator Springs, the \"shining [[Gemstone]]\" of the Mother Road \u2013 [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]. He ran Doc's Clinic as a \"doctor of [[Internal combustion]]\". As times changed and the town was bypassed by [[Interstate 40]], Doc stayed on, even when the population dwindled to a meager dozen residents. He was respected, well-loved and served not only as the town's physician, but as its judge. Nobody in the town had any idea of his past as a racer, knowing him merely as an ordinary Hudson Hornet and he used his Piston Cup trophies to hold his tools instead of putting them on display.\n \n[[File:Reverse Lock Steering.svg|thumb|left|200 px|[[Opposite lock]] or counter-steering through an abrupt right turn, depicted with front wheels in blue during right steer, red during left steer.]]\nUpon meeting the rookie hotshot [[Lightning McQueen]] after he got arrested for destroying the town's main street by accident, Doc saw far too much of the past that he left behind. His one token attempt to explain a controlled skid on an abrupt turn in dirt-track racing to Lightning was met with misunderstanding and skepticism, leaving Doc disillusioned and bitter about the young hot rod who seemed to care only about himself.\n\n{{quote|\"This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt. You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle. Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips. I'll put it simple. If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.\"|Doc Hudson explaining [[drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] to a skeptical McQueen}}\n\nHe was less than happy when an amazed McQueen discovered his past and asked, \"How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?\" Doc admitted that he did not quit, but was forced into retirement after his crash by the rise of hot young racers. \"I had a lot of stuff left,\" Doc said sadly, \"but I never got the chance to show it.\" After McQueen finished fixing the Radiator Springs road that he damaged when arriving in town as part of Doc's court ruling, McQueen decided to stay in town for a while, but Doc was unable to bear having him around any longer and called the news and press, prompting McQueen to immediately leave for the Piston Cup championship race in California. But, seeing how disheartened that everyone was by the unplanned departure, Doc realized that Lightning became more important to them than he thought. His racing days are known to the town by now and he took back his #51 racing colors to become McQueen's pit crew chief. Nearly [[list of Cars characters#Radiator Springs populace|the entire town]] traveled to California as McQueen's [[pit crew]] and cheering section. At the race, the commentators recognized his presence on the cameras and Doc finally received a long-overdue acknowledgment for his return. When McQueen chose to help an injured Strip Weathers finish his last race instead of winning the Piston Cup, he expressed how proud he was of Lightning.\n\n{{quote|It\u2019s just an empty cup.|Doc Hudson, thinking friends are more important than trophies and fame.}}\n\nAt the end of the film, Doc kept his racing colors, becoming a trainer as well as a friend to the young McQueen. Just like McQueen, Doc learned some lessons: friendship, promises, how greed affected others and secrets could not be kept forever. When a racing museum subsequently opened in Radiator Springs, one entire wing was devoted to his racing career. Much as [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.|Junior #8]] acknowledged to [[Richard Petty|\"The King\"]] that \"you've been an inspiration to me\", The King indicated \"the Hudson Hornet was my inspiration\".\n\nIn the video game taking place after the first ''Cars'' film, he taught McQueen powerslide lessons and became the crew chief for McQueen during the Piston Cup season in the game's story mode. He was also a playable character who could be purchased by 5,000 points. Though during the game's story mode, he wore his original blue paint job and white wheels when racing McQueen or training him, but his original racing colors along with his red wheels could also be purchased.\n\nIn ''[[Cars 2]]'', Doc died before the events of the film and the Piston Cup was renamed in his honor, with his clinic being converted into a museum that displayed trophies and mementos from his career.\n\n[[John Lasseter]] announced that ''[[Cars 3]]'' would include a tribute to Doc. McQueen's crash in the teaser was a reference to Doc's accident and he often recalled pieces of advice that Doc gave him in flashbacks. Lightning went to Doc's old trainer, Smokey in [[Thomasville, Georgia|Thomasville]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for help and watched movies of Doc's old races for inspiration. Smokey also explained that training Lightning, not racing, was the most enjoyable part of Doc's life. At the end, Lightning adopted Doc's old racing colors and painted \"The Fabulous Lightning McQueen\" on himself in honor of Doc, \"The Fabulous Hudson Hornet.\" Lightning's bumper also read, \"For Doc Hudson.\" Cruz Ramirez, a trainer who subsequently started a racing career of her own took on Doc's old number 51 as a second tribute.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Fabulous Hudson Hornet}}\n[[File:Hudson Hornet 51.jpg|thumb|#51 \"Doc\", Fabulous Hudson Hornet]]\nThe car is based on the real-life Fabulous Hudson Hornet in NASCAR competition, with Doc's racing career most closely resembling that of [[Herb Thomas]].

The track, written and produced by [[Chad Hugo]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] of [[The Neptunes]], was released on September 24, 2001 through [[Jive Records]] as the [[lead single]] off the record.<ref name=\"radio\"/>\n\nAt the time of its release, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" garnered a mixed reception from [[music critics]]. Some argued it was the singer's most mature sound at the time, compared to her previous singles, while others noticed the song's attempt to leave behind Spears' [[girl next door]] image and said her vocals were unnatural. It achieved commercial success, placing within the top ten in almost every country that it charted in. However, the song peaked at number 27 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 85 in ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], both being the lowest chart positions of the single worldwide. As [[Clear Channel Entertainment]] (CCE), who handled Spears' previous concert tours and owned most radio stations, was outbid by [[Concerts West]] in promoting the tour, it is alleged a radio boycott ensued after Spears chose the latter for promoting the tour, which in turn affected the era's chart success in the US.<ref name=west>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Concerts West Lands Spears Trek |date=September 1, 2001|accessdate=May 28, 2010|last=Waddell|first=Ray|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>  \n\nIn its legacy, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" has become one of Spears' signature hits and its VMA performance is considered one of her career highlights. Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized Spears's performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting \u2013 surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits \u2013 Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669706/briefly-spears-mtv-vma-history.jhtml|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Britney Spears' Iconic VMA History: Snakes, Stripteases And Smooches|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=March 6, 2012|publisher=MTV}}</ref> \n\nA music video for the single, which was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]], was released along with the single. It features Spears dancing in a [[sauna]] that has prison cell doors in a [[high-rise building]]. Spears' now-iconic performance of the song at the [[2001 MTV Video Music Awards]] in New York City was criticized by [[animal rights]] group [[PETA]] for the inclusion of [[introduced species|exotic animal]]s.<ref>https://idobi.com/news/peta-asks-britney-not-to-use-live-animals-for-vma/</ref> Her representatives ignored the calls from PETA.

In a dream sequence, Morris' character [[Brittany Pierce]] sings the song, while recreating several iconic looks from Spears' videos: the red catsuit from \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]],\" the outfit with a snake from Spears' 2001 performance at the VMAs, and the white diamond bodysuit from \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\". Morris also performed the song during the live 2011 Glee Tour.\n\n==Legacy==\n\u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d was widely seen as being a departure from Spears\u2019 [[girl next door]] image and signature [[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum-pop]] sound from her previous two albums ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|Baby One More Time]]'' and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]] -'' the sound of the single leans more towards \u201c[[Urban contemporary|urban pop]]\u201d and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and the accompanying video and live performances are more overtly sexual. Upon its release, the song and video - as well as Spears\u2019 performance at the [[2001 MTV Video Music Awards|2001 Video Music Awards]] - were heavily criticized for their overt sexual nature as well as for Spears only being 19 years old at the time and a self-proclaimed virgin. Many critics at the time compared the song and its video to that of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Janet Jackson]], who was offered the song and turned it down. Some critics also noted similarities in Spears\u2019 slight transition from bubblegum pop and more confident overt sexuality to that of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in the early 1990s, during which she was transitioning from her pop sound of the 1980s to a more mature sound and more explicit sexuality on her single and music video for \"[[Justify My Love]]\" and on her ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' album.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d was seen as so controversial upon its release that Spears received immense backlash from [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], The Parents Association of America, as well as several other conservative outlets. After Spears\u2019 VMAs performance, PETA urged people to boycott Spears\u2019 upcoming album and [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]]. The PAA also urged people to boycott Spears and criticized her for \u201cbeing an irresponsible and bad role model to young girls all over the country\u201d, with even the wife of governor [[Bob Ehrlich|Robert Ehrlich]] proclaiming at a live press conference, \u201cIf I had a chance, I would shoot Britney Spears.\" In response to the backlash, Spears said in a December 2001 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article, \u201cI don\u2019t see the big deal and I don\u2019t see the need for an apology. I\u2019m a 19-year-old girl about to be 20, I\u2019m growing up and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Besides no matter what, I can never win, when I did \u201c...Baby One More Time\u201d they were saying I was too controversial, so you can never win.\u201d\n\nWhile seen as controversial at the time, over subsequent years since \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d has gone down in pop culture history with [[Billboard 200|Billboard]] regarding the video and song itself as \u201cgroundbreaking, daring and artistically creative\u201d in 2013. With the Britney album as a whole and \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d being it's the lead single many music critics have credited them for inspiring other female artists of her own generation and the generation following her. In 2017, writing for ''Rolling Stone,'' [[Peter Travers]] noted, \u201cIn the early 2000s there was no one bigger in music than Britney Spears and with her third studio album \u2018Britney\u2019 and its lead single \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d, Britney Spears started a new trend. The now cliched trend of a young girl transitioning from the [[Disney Channel]] to a squeaky clean pop image than into overtly sexual \u2018[[femme fatale]]\u2019 if you will. From girls of her own era, such as [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Jessica Simpson]], to girls of the next generation, such as [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Selena Gomez]], Spears blazed the trail of how to grow and sustain from Disney kid to pop sensation to pop culture powerhouse.\u201d\n\nThe music video for \u201dI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d has been heavily compared in the media to Aguilera's music video for her coming of age and into womanhood anthem \u201c[[Dirrty]]\u201d with many critics labeling the video a copycat. Noting the similarities. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] called Aguilera's video \u201can over the top and blatant rip off of ''Slave''\u201d. [[Jancee Dunn]] called Aguilera's \u201cDirrty\u201d video \u201ca shameless copycat\u201d, and noted, \u201c...maybe instead of continuing to follow in Spears' footsteps, Aguilera should focus on showcasing her vocals, considering she lacks the appeal and danceability of Spears.\u201d In an October 2018 interview with [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan magazine]], Aguilera referenced the comparison of the videos and constant comparisons to Spears expressing how it affected her self esteem at the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d has also been cited by Miley Cyrus for influencing her song and video [[We Can't Stop|\u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d]] likewise Selena Gomez cited \u201cSlave\u201d for influencing her 2013 single  [[Come & Get It (Selena Gomez song)|\u201cCome and Get it\u201d]]. In a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair [[Lindsay Lohan]] said the song and video for \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d were the main influence for her 2004 hit \u201c[[Rumors (Lindsay Lohan song)|Rumors]]\u201d, with Lohan even using the same director Spears had previously used on her video \u201c[[My Prerogative]]\u201d. At the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards|2014 Video Music Award]]<nowiki/>s, [[Nicki Minaj]] had planned on paying homage to Spears\u2019 2001 performance for her performance of her song [[Anaconda (Nicki Minaj song)|Anaconda]] by using several albino snakes, however, MTV banned Minaj's use of live snakes after a backup dancer was bitten. In 2016, Mexican-American singer [[Becky G]] paid homage to Spears\u2019 2001 VMA performance by dancing with a yellow snake at [[Univision]]'s annual awards show ''[[Premios Juventud]].''\n\n==Track listings==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*;European CD single\n# \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" (Main Version)&nbsp;\u2014 3:23\n# \"Intimidated\"&nbsp;\u2014 3:17\n\n*;European and Australian CD maxi single\n# \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" (Main Version)&nbsp;\u2014 3:23\n# \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" (Instrumental)&nbsp;\u2014 3:23\n# \"Intimidated\"&nbsp;\u2014 3:17\n# \"Britney...

The track, written and produced by [[Chad Hugo]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] of [[The Neptunes]], was released on September 24, 2001 through [[Jive Records]] as the [[lead single]] off the record.<ref name=\"radio\"/>\n\nAt the time of its release, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" garnered a mixed reception from [[music critics]]. Some argued it was the singer's most mature sound at the time, compared to her previous singles, while others noticed the song's attempt to leave behind Spears' [[girl next door]] image and said her vocals were unnatural. It achieved commercial success, placing within the top ten in almost every country that it charted in. However, the song peaked at number 27 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 85 in ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], both being the lowest chart positions of the single worldwide. As [[Clear Channel Entertainment]] (CCE), who handled Spears' previous concert tours and owned most radio stations, was outbid by [[Concerts West]] in promoting the tour, it is alleged a radio boycott ensued after Spears chose the latter for promoting the tour, which in turn affected the era's chart success in the US.<ref name=west>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Concerts West Lands Spears Trek |date=September 1, 2001|accessdate=May 28, 2010|last=Waddell|first=Ray|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> . \n\nIn its legacy, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" has become one of Spears' signature hits and its VMA performance is considered one of her career highlights. Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized Spears's performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting \u2013 surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits \u2013 Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669706/briefly-spears-mtv-vma-history.jhtml|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Britney Spears' Iconic VMA History: Snakes, Stripteases And Smooches|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=March 6, 2012|publisher=MTV}}</ref> \n\nA music video for the single, which was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]], was released along with the single.

In a dream sequence, Morris' character [[Brittany Pierce]] sings the song, while recreating several iconic looks from Spears' videos: the red catsuit from \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]],\" the outfit with a snake from Spears' 2001 performance at the VMAs, and the white diamond bodysuit from \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\". Morris also performed the song during the live 2011 Glee Tour.\n\n==Legacy==\n\u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d was widely seen as being a departure from Spears\u2019 [[girl next door]] image and signature [[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum-pop]] sound from her previous two albums ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|Baby One More Time]]'' and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]] -'' the sound of the single leans more towards \u201c[[Urban contemporary|urban pop]]\u201d and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and the accompanying video and live performances are more overtly sexual. Upon its release, the song and video - as well as Spears\u2019 performance at the [[2001 MTV Video Music Awards|2001 Video Music Awards]] - were heavily criticized for their overt sexual nature as well as for Spears only being 19 years old at the time and a self-proclaimed virgin. Many critics at the time compared the song and its video to that of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Janet Jackson]], who was offered the song and turned it down. Some critics also noted similarities in Spears\u2019 slight transition from bubblegum pop and more confident overt sexuality to that of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in the early 1990s, during which she was transitioning from her pop sound of the 1980s to a more mature sound and more explicit sexuality on her single and music video for \"[[Justify My Love]]\" and on her ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' album.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d was seen as so controversial upon its release that Spears received immense backlash from [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], The Parents Association of America, as well as several other conservative outlets. After Spears\u2019 VMAs performance, PETA urged people to boycott Spears\u2019 upcoming album and [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]]. The PAA also urged people to boycott Spears and criticized her for \u201cbeing an irresponsible and bad role model to young girls all over the country\u201d, with even the wife of governor [[Bob Ehrlich|Robert Ehrlich]] proclaiming at a live press conference, \u201cIf I had a chance, I would shoot Britney Spears.\" In response to the backlash, Spears said in a December 2001 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article, \u201cI don\u2019t see the big deal and I don\u2019t see the need for an apology. I\u2019m a 19-year-old girl about to be 20, I\u2019m growing up and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Besides no matter what, I can never win, when I did \u201c...Baby One More Time\u201d they were saying I was too controversial, so you can never win.\u201d\n\nWhile seen as controversial at the time, over subsequent years since \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d has gone down in pop culture history with [[Billboard 200|Billboard]] regarding the video and song itself as \u201cgroundbreaking, daring and artistically creative\u201d in 2013. With the Britney album as a whole and \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d being it's the lead single many music critics have credited them for inspiring other female artists of her own generation and the generation following her. In 2017, writing for ''Rolling Stone,'' [[Peter Travers]] noted, \u201cIn the early 2000s there was no one bigger in music than Britney Spears and with her third studio album \u2018Britney\u2019 and its lead single \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d, Britney Spears started a new trend. The now cliched trend of a young girl transitioning from the [[Disney Channel]] to a squeaky clean pop image than into overtly sexual \u2018[[femme fatale]]\u2019 if you will. From girls of her own era, such as [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Jessica Simpson]], to girls of the next generation, such as [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Selena Gomez]], Spears blazed the trail of how to grow and sustain from Disney kid to pop sensation to pop culture powerhouse.\u201d\n\nThe music video for \u201dI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d has been heavily compared in the media to Aguilera's music video for her coming of age and into womanhood anthem \u201c[[Dirrty]]\u201d with many critics labeling the video a copycat. Noting the similarities. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] called Aguilera's video \u201can over the top and blatant rip off of ''Slave''\u201d. [[Jancee Dunn]] called Aguilera's \u201cDirrty\u201d video \u201ca shameless copycat\u201d, and noted, \u201c...maybe instead of continuing to follow in Spears' footsteps, Aguilera should focus on showcasing her vocals, considering she lacks the appeal and danceability of Spears.\u201d In an October 2018 interview with [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan magazine]], Aguilera referenced the comparison of the videos and constant comparisons to Spears expressing how it affected her self esteem at the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d has also been cited by Miley Cyrus for influencing her song and video [[We Can't Stop|\u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d]] likewise Selena Gomez cited \u201cSlave\u201d for influencing her 2013 single  [[Come & Get It (Selena Gomez song)|\u201cCome and Get it\u201d]]. In a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair [[Lindsay Lohan]] said the song and video for \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d were the main influence for her 2004 hit \u201c[[Rumors (Lindsay Lohan song)|Rumors]]\u201d, with Lohan even using the same director Spears had previously used on her video \u201c[[My Prerogative]]\u201d. At the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards|2014 Video Music Award]]<nowiki/>s, [[Nicki Minaj]] had planned on paying homage to Spears\u2019 2001 performance for her performance of her song [[Anaconda (Nicki Minaj song)|Anaconda]] by using several albino snakes, however, MTV banned Minaj's use of live snakes after a backup dancer was bitten. In 2016, Mexican-American singer [[Becky G]] paid homage to Spears\u2019 2001 VMA performance by dancing with a yellow snake at [[Univision]]'s annual awards show ''[[Premios Juventud]].''\n\n==Track listings==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*;European CD single\n# \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" (Main Version)&nbsp;\u2014 3:23\n# \"Intimidated\"&nbsp;\u2014 3:17\n\n*;European and Australian CD maxi single\n# \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" (Main Version)&nbsp;\u2014 3:23\n# \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" (Instrumental)&nbsp;\u2014 3:23\n# \"Intimidated\"&nbsp;\u2014 3:17\n# \"Britney...
