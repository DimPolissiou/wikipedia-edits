He is the current consultant of [[Hong Kong Premier League]] club [[Kitchee SC|Kitchee]], having previously served as the club's manager.\n\nAs a player, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 was capped 26 times for [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After retiring from playing, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 became a successful manager. In July 2011, French professional football manager and former player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], named Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 as one of his idols while growing up and included him in his ''\"All Time Best 11\"'' of [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].\n\n==Club career==\nDuring his playing days, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 was considered one of the most technically gifted players of his generation. In 1985, he was named the [[Yugoslav Footballer of the Year]]. He had the most success while playing for hometown club [[FK Vele\u017e Mostar|Vele\u017e Mostat]] and Croatian club [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]. With Vele\u017e, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 won the [[1980\u201381 Yugoslav Cup]] and the [[1980\u201381 Balkans Cup]], while with Hajduk he won the [[1983\u201384 Yugoslav Cup]] and was also part of the Hajduk team that made it all the way to the [[1983\u201384 UEFA Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] of the [[1983\u201384 UEFA Cup]].\n\nSli\u0161kovi\u0107 was most famous while playing for French [[Ligue 1]] club [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. Even though he played only one season for the club, he showed what an unbelievable player he was and showed what a great football technician can do with a ball. After Marseille, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 played in Italy with [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara]], before returning to France and playing for [[RC Lens|Lens]], [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]] and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]].

He scored 3 goals in the process. Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 was prevented from playing in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] due to an injury, sustained in the second half during a [[1981\u201382 Yugoslav First League]] match between [[OFK Beograd]] and [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]. He then lost his place in the [[UEFA Euro 1984]] Yugoslav squad after, allegedly, a Yugoslav-printed newspaper journalist quoted Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 incorrectly after an interview after a [[Exhibition game|friendly game]] between Yugoslavia and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] (0\u20132) and caused the national team head coach, [[Todor Veselinovi\u0107]], to drop him from the squad.\n\nSli\u0161kovi\u0107 began to play for the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team]] after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in the early 1990s.

\"'''Baka'''\" '''Sli\u0161kovi\u0107''' (born 30 May 1959) is a Bosnian professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]]. He is the current consultant of [[Hong Kong Premier League]] club [[Kitchee SC|Kitchee]], having previously served as the club's manager.\n\nAs a player, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 was capped 26 times for [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After retiring from playing, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 became a successful manager. In July 2011, French professional football manager and former player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], named Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 as one of his idols while growing up and included him in his ''\"All Time Best 11\"'' of [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].\n\n==Club career==\nDuring his playing days, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 was considered one of the most technically gifted players of his generation. In 1985, he was named the [[Yugoslav Footballer of the Year]]. He had the most success while playing for hometown club [[FK Vele\u017e Mostar|Vele\u017e Mostat]] and Croatian club [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]. With Vele\u017e, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 won the [[1980\u201381 Yugoslav Cup]] and the [[1980\u201381 Balkans Cup]], while with Hajduk he won the [[1983\u201384 Yugoslav Cup]] and was also part of the Hajduk team that made it all the way to the [[1983\u201384 UEFA Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] of the [[1983\u201384 UEFA Cup]].\n\nSli\u0161kovi\u0107 was most famous while playing for French [[Ligue 1]] club [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. Even though he played only one season for the club, he showed what an unbelievable player he was and showed what a great football technician can do with a ball. After Marseille, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 played in Italy with [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara]], before returning to France and playing for [[RC Lens|Lens]], [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]] and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]]. In 1992, he returned to Italy and came back to Pescara. In 1993, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 left Italy and joined Croatian club [[NK Hrvatski Dragovoljac|Hrvatski Dragovoljac]], where he stayed until 1995. Finally, in 1996 he joined Bosnian club [[H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar|Zrinjski Mostar]], where he eventually finished his career in 1997 at the age of 38.\n\nIn 2011, for the 100th anniversary of Hajduk Split, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 was chosen in the \"Hajduk Split Best 11 of all-time\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hajduk/tabid/83/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/129116/Default.aspx |title=IZBOR SLOBODNE DALMACIJE Jedanaest veli\u010danstvenih hajduka; I Grgur Ninski - hajdukovac!

He scored 3 goals in the process. Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 was prevented from playing in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] due to an injury, sustained in the second half during a [[1981\u201382 Yugoslav First League]] match between [[OFK Beograd]] and [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]. He then lost his place in the [[UEFA Euro 1984]] Yugoslav squad after, allegedly, a Yugoslav-printed newspaper journalist quoted Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 incorrectly after an interview after a [[Exhibition game|friendly game]] between Yugoslavia and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] (0\u20132) and caused the national team head coach, [[Todor Veselinovi\u0107]], to drop him from the squad.\n\nSli\u0161kovi\u0107 began to play for the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team]] after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in the early 1990s. He played three friendly games for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1993 as the [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in all three games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/clanak/100309007 |title=Su\u0161i\u0107, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107, \u0160koro i drugi po\u010deli stvaranje reprezentacije |publisher=Sarajevo-x.com |accessdate=2012-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\u010cudesni Mostarac koji je bio idol Zinedineu Zidaneu|url=http://www.sport.ba/video/cudesni-mostarac-koji-je-bio-idol-zinedineu-zidaneu/|publisher=sport.ba|language=Bosnian|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=2013-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\nRight after ending his playing career, Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 became the new manager of [[NK Hrvatski Dragovoljac|Hrvatski Dragovoljac]] in 1997.
