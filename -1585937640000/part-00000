Later she has an appointment with the school [[therapist]] Vincent ([[Tom Malloy]]) who sees the burn and questions how it happened but she refuses to talk. During class she begins to fantasize about kissing the Red Headed Girl (Mallory Moye) who is sitting in the front row. After class, the girl approaches Ashley asking why she is always looking at her during class and calls her weird. As she is leaving, a boy named Steve approaches her, but she ignores him and leaves.\n\nAt home, Ashley has a fight with her mother Stacy Collins ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]]) because Vincent had called her and requested she take Ashley to group therapy at the hospital. Ashley attends the group therapy sessions, but refuses to participate in the discussion. Things become worse when one member becomes aggressive and is dragged away by hospital attendants. Ashley returns to the park to smoke where she meets Vickey (Danielle Morrow), who asks for a smoke. Asking if her lighter is real gold, Vickey suggests that she should try to scratch it like in the movies. Ashley hands Vickey her [[switchblade]]. Impressed, Vickey invites Ashley to her house. Vickey tells Ashley she can contact her under the username \"SapphoGirl13\" on her computer. Vickey and Ashley begin kissing when Vickey notices [[Self-harm|cuts]] along Ashley's wrists. Ashley becomes [[Turn-on|turned on]] when Vickey touches her wrists, but Vickey becomes disturbed when Ashley wants to use the switchblade and asks her to leave. At home, Ashley contacts Vickey on her computer using the alias \"HomeStarch99\" and they begin to have [[cybersex]] however Ashley quickly becomes uninterested, turns off the computer and cuts herself instead.\n\nWith the group therapy not working, Vincent informs Ashley and Stacy that a social worker will visit them. Stacy threatens to confiscate Ashley's computer, but eventually lets her keep it after she begs her not to take it. The next day at the park, Ashley meets Randall ([[Luke Eberl]]) and the Red Headed Girl from her class in a car [[Alcohol consumption|drinking]]. They invite Ashley to join them and the girl begins to give Ashley alcohol using [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|mouth to mouth]] and then offers to reward her with a kiss every time she takes a drink. Initially starting off well, the girl becomes angry when Ashley scratches her nails hard onto her back and they ask her to get out of the car. Ashley is waiting at a [[bus stop]] to return home when she meets Chico (Brennan Murray) after talking to her. She does not reply so he decides to try holding her hand and she does not resist. Arriving home, she meets Stacy's new boyfriend Bill ([[Michael Madsen]]) and instantly does not like him. After an awkward meal, she retreats to her room and proceeds to play loud music to distract her from the sexual sounds coming from her mother's room. She goes on her computer and begins to chat with \"Candid33,\" a 33-year-old woman called Candice (Nicole Buehrer). They exchange phone numbers and talk about their hobbies.\n\nThe social worker arrives to meet Ashley and Stacy, however, Stacy becomes angry when she feels that she thinks Stacy is a bad mother. Ashley leaves for school and meets Chico again at the bus stop. He once again tries to hold hands, but this time she refuses. When he asks why, she tells him she [[lesbian|likes girls]]. Chico becomes angry and leaves. At school, Ashley goes to her appointment with Vincent who decides to try a new approach, but Ashley is reminded of her dad who had died years before and she begins to cry. Ashley reveals her dad Michael Collins (Bill Lippincott) hurt her, but before going into detail, the session ends and she gets up and leaves for class. After class, she again meets Steve who asks her out, but is rejected. Ashley is at home watching TV when Stacy and Bill come home from the market, but Stacy has to go back because she forgot her [[debit card]]. Alone in the house with Ashley, Bill sits next to her and tries to initiate a conversation. Continually ignored, Bill forces a kiss on Ashley just as Stacy returns home. Stacy kicks Bill out of the house and questions Ashley on what was happening. But when Ashley won't talk, Stacy slaps her and sends her to her room. Ashley sits on her bed, takes out her switchblade and cuts her wrists. As she watches the blood coming from her wrists, she decides to call Candice and they proceed to have [[phone sex]].\n\nAt school, Carly (Deanna Moore), Sammy (Anne Elisabeth) and Summer (Reid Cox) invite Ashley to join them skipping class. However, when they are outside the school, the three girls all attack Ashley because she is a lesbian. The social worker returns, this time speaking to Stacy in private. Still initially unwilling to answer and questions, she eventually breaks down crying and reveals that Ashley's dad Michael [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] Ashley when she was a child.\n\nAfter school, Steve once again approaches Ashley who again ignores him and enters the women's bathroom. Angry at constantly being rejected, Steve follows her into the bathroom and forces a kiss on her, however she retaliates by biting his lip. Enraged, he throws her to the ground and begins to [[rape|force himself on her]] when she slashes his chest with the switchblade and runs away. Ashley goes to meet Candice at her house. Ashley is initially very shy, so Candice decides that to break the awkward silence, they should get dressed up and go out for dinner. Their date is a success and Candice even manages to get Ashley to smile, something she almost never does. Returning to Candice's house, they meet her roommate Clair (Sarah Schreiber) and photographer Laura (Ilea Matthews). After introducing themselves to each other, Laura asks Ashley if she could take some pictures of her. Ashley is having fun until they notice the scars on her wrists and she once again becomes silent. However, she gets her confidence back when Laura reveals she also used to cut her wrists. That night, Ashley and Candice spend the night together.\n\nIn the morning, Candice points out that Ashley should leave or she will be late for her train. Ashley becomes disheartened however Candice quickly reassures her that she does want to continue their relationship together. When Ashley arrives home, she finds Stacy waiting up for her and worrying where she had been, After talking together, they are finally able to reconcile their relationship. Back at school, Ashley has her appointment with Vincent as usual and he is surprised to see her happy and smiling for the first time. On the way home, she meets Chico again and they decide to be friends again. That night, Ashley goes to her room and merrily calls Candice.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Nicole Fox]] as Ashley Collins\n* Nicole Buehrer as Candice\n* [[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]] as Stacy Collins\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Bill\n* [[Tom Malloy]] as Vincent\n* Olivia Rose Keegan as Gabby\n* Danielle Morrow as Vickey\n* Brennan Murray as Chico\n* Ilea Matthews as Laura\n* Mallory Moye as Red Headed Girl\n* Hagen Mills as Steve\n* [[Luke Eberl]] as Randall\n* [[Lauren C.

Later she has an appointment with the school [[therapist]] Vincent ([[Tom Malloy]]) who sees the burn and questions how it happened but she refuses to talk. During class she begins to fantasize about kissing the Red Headed Girl (Mallory Moye) who is sitting in the front row. After class, the girl approaches Ashley asking why she is always looking at her during class and calls her weird. As she is leaving, a boy named Steve approaches her, but she ignores him and leaves.\n\nAt home, Ashley has a fight with her mother Stacy Collins ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]]) because Vincent had called her and requested she take Ashley to group therapy at the hospital. Ashley attends the group therapy sessions, but refuses to participate in the discussion. Things become worse when one member becomes aggressive and is dragged away by hospital attendants. Ashley returns to the park to smoke where she meets Vickey (Danielle Morrow), who asks for a smoke. Asking if her lighter is real gold, Vickey suggests that she should try to scratch it like in the movies. Ashley hands Vickey her [[switchblade]]. Impressed, Vickey invites Ashley to her house. Vickey tells Ashley she can contact her under the username \"SapphoGirl13\" on her computer. Vickey and Ashley begin kissing when Vickey notices [[Self-harm|cuts]] along Ashley\u2019s wrists. Ashley becomes [[Turn-on|turned on]] when Vickey touches her wrists, but Vickey becomes disturbed when Ashley wants to use the switchblade and asks her to leave. At home, Ashley contacts Vickey on her computer using the alias \"HomeStarch99\" and they begin to have [[cybersex]] however Ashley quickly becomes uninterested, turns off the computer and cuts herself instead.\n\nWith the group therapy not working, Vincent informs Ashley and Stacy that a social worker will visit them. Stacy threatens to confiscate Ashley\u2019s computer, but eventually lets her keep it after she begs her not to take it. The next day at the park, Ashley meets Randall ([[Luke Eberl]]) and the Red Headed Girl from her class in a car [[Alcohol consumption|drinking]].

It does not have universally accepted boundaries to the north and east, though the [[River Lea]] is sometimes seen as the eastern boundary. Parts of it may be regarded as lying within [[Central London]] (though that term too has no precise definition). The term \"East of [[Aldgate Pump]]\" is sometimes used as a synonym for the area.\n\nThe East End began to emerge in the Middle Ages with initially slow urban growth outside the eastern walls, which later accelerated, especially in the 19th century, to absorb pre-existing settlements. The first known written record of the East End as a distinct entity, as opposed its component parts, comes from [[John Strype]]'s 1720 ''Survey of London'', which describes London as consisting of four parts: the City of London, [[City and Liberty of Westminster|Westminster]], [[Southwark]], and \"That Part beyond the Tower\". The relevance of Strype's reference to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] was more than geographical. The East End was the urbanised part of an administrative area called the [[Tower division|Tower Division]], which had owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] since time immemorial. Later, as London grew further, the fully urbanised Tower Division became a byword for wider East London, before East London grew further still, east of the [[River Lea]] and into [[Essex]].\n\nThe area was notorious for its deep poverty, overcrowding and associated social problems. This led to the East End's history of intense political activism and association with some of the country's most influential social reformers. Another major theme of East End history has been migration, both inward and outward. The area had a strong pull on the rural poor from other parts of England, and attracted waves of migration from further afield, notably [[Huguenot]] refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in [[Spitalfields]] in the 17th century,<ref name=Huguenot>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22743 Bethnal Green: Settlement and Building to 1836], ''A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green'' (1998), pp. 91\u20135.

The East End was the urbanised part of an administrative area called the [[Tower division|Tower Division]], which had owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] since time immemorial, having its roots in the Bishop of London's historic Manor of Stepney. Later, as London grew further, the fully urbanised Tower Division became a byword for wider [[East London]], before East London grew further still, east of the [[River Lea]] and into [[Essex]].\n\nFor a very long time the East End was physically separated from London's western growth by the open space known as [[Moorfields]]. Shoreditch's boundary with the parish of [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] (and its predecessor [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]]) ran through the [[Moorfields]], which became, on urbanisation, the boundary of [[East London|east]] and north London. That line, with very slight modifications, also became part of the boundary between the modern London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]].\n\nMoorfields remained largely open until 1812, and the longstanding presence of that open space separating the emerging East End from the western urban expansion of London must have helped shape the different economic character of the two parts and perceptions of their distinct identity (see map below).\n\n[[File:City of London Ogilby and Morgan's Map of 1677.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|Ogilby & Morgan's map of the City of London (1673). \"A Large and Accurate Map of the City of London. Ichnographically describing all the Streets, Lanes, Alleys, Courts, Yards, Churches, Halls, & Houses &c. Actually Surveyed and Delineated by [[John Ogilby]], His Majesties Cosmographer.\"|Ogilby & Morgan's 1673 map of London. The East End is developing outside [[Bishopsgate]], [[Aldgate]] and along the river - it is separated from the western growth of the city by [[Moorfields]]]]\n\nThe East End has always contained some of London's poorest areas. The main reasons for this include:\n* The [[medieval]] system of [[copyhold]], which prevailed throughout the East End into the 19th century. Essentially, there was little point in developing land that was held on short leases.<ref name=palmer/>\n* The siting of noxious industries, such as [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] and [[fulling]] downwind outside the boundaries of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls. The foul-smelling industries partially preferred the East End because the prevailing winds in London traveled from west to east (i.e. it was downwind from the rest of the city), so that most odours from their businesses would not go into the city.\n* The low paid employment in the [[London Docklands|docks]] and related industries, made worse by the trade practices of outwork, [[piecework]] and casual labour.\n* The concentration of the ruling court and national political centre in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], on the opposite, western side of the [[City of London]].\n\nHistorically, the East End is arguably conterminous with the Manor of Stepney. This manor was held by the [[Bishop of London]], in compensation for his duties in maintaining and garrisoning the [[Tower of London]]. Further ecclesiastic holdings came about from the need to enclose the marshes and create flood defences along the Thames. [[Edward VI]] passed the land to the [[Baron Wentworth|Wentworth]] family, and thence to their descendants, the Earls of Cleveland. The ecclesiastic system of copyhold, whereby land was leased to tenants for terms as short as seven years, prevailed throughout the manor. This severely limited scope for improvement of the land and new building until the estate was broken up in the 19th century.<ref name=Stepney>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45083 ''Stepney, Old and New London: Volume 2'' (1878), pp. 137-142] accessed: 17 November 2007</ref>\n\nIn medieval times trades were carried out in workshops in and around the owners' premises in the City. By the time of the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666 these were becoming industries, and some were particularly noisome, such as the processing of urine for the tanning industry, or required large amounts of space, such as drying clothes after process and dying in fields known as [[tenterground]]s. Some were dangerous, such as the manufacture of gunpowder or the proving of guns. These activities came to be performed outside the City walls in the near suburbs of the East End. Later, when lead-making and bone-processing for soap and china came to be established, they too located in the East End rather than in the crowded streets of the City.<ref name=palmer/>\n\nThe lands east of the City had always been used as hunting grounds for bishops and royalty, with [[John of England|King John]] establishing a palace at [[Bow, London|Bow]]. The [[Cistercian]] [[Stratford Langthorne Abbey]] became the court of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1267 for the visitation of the [[Papal legate]]s, and it was here that he made peace with the barons under the terms of the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]].

The principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel and Bow. Settlements along the river began at that time to service the needs of shipping on the Thames, but the City of London retained its right to land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times (16th century), as the [[Royal Navy]] expanded and international trading developed, and a major fishing port developed downstream at [[Barking, London|Barking]] to provide fish for the City. These and other factors meant that industries relating to construction, repair, and victualling of naval and merchant ships flourished in the area.\n\nRoyalty such as [[John of England|King John]] had had a hunting lodge at [[Bromley-by-Bow]], and the [[Bishop of London]] had a palace at [[Bethnal Green]], but later these estates began to be split up, and estates of fine houses for captains, merchants and owners of manufacturers began to be built. [[Samuel Pepys]] moved his family and goods to Bethnal Green during the [[Great Fire of London]], and [[Captain Cook]] moved from [[Shadwell]] to [[Stepney Green]], where a school and assembly rooms had been established (commemorated by ''Assembly Passage'', and a plaque on the site of Cook's house on the Mile End Road). Mile End Old Town also acquired some fine buildings, and the New Town began to be built. As the area became built up and more crowded, the wealthy sold their plots for subdivision and moved further afield. Into the 18th and 19th centuries, there were still attempts to build fine houses, for example [[Tredegar Square]] (1830), and the open fields around Mile End New Town were used for the construction of estates of workers' cottages in 1820. This was designed in 1817 in Birmingham by Anthony Hughes and finally constructed in 1820.<ref name=MEOT>\n[http://www.mcmullencarpentersandjoiners.co.uk/what-lies-beneath-east-end-of-london/ ''What lies beneath ...

Pankhurst refocused her efforts, and with the outbreak of [[World War I|the First World War]], she began a nursery, clinic and cost price canteen for the poor at the bakery. A paper, the ''[[Women's Dreadnought]]'', was published to bring her campaign to a wider audience. Pankhurst spent twelve years in Bow fighting for women's rights. During this time, she risked constant arrest and spent many months in [[Holloway Prison]], often on [[hunger strike]].

Anti-aircraft installations were built in public parks, such as [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]] and the Mudchute on the Isle of Dogs, and along the line of the Thames, as this was used by the aircraft to guide them to their target.\n\nThe authorities were initially wary of opening the [[London Underground]] for shelter, fearing the effect on morale elsewhere in London and hampering normal operations. On 12 September, having suffered five days of heavy bombing, the people of the East End took the matter into their own hands and invaded tube stations with pillows and blankets. The government relented and opened the partially completed [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] as a shelter.

The term Cockney has loose geographic and linguistic definitions with blurring between the two. In practice people from all over the East End, [[East London|the wider East London area]] and sometimes beyond, identify as Cockneys; some of these use the Cockney dialect to some degree and others not.\n\nA traditional definition is that to be a Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of [[St Mary-le-Bow|Bow Bells]], situated on [[Cheapside]]. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as [[Aldgate]] and [[Whitechapel]], but it is unlikely that the bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternity hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.\n\nThe Cockney dialect has lexical borrowings from [[Yiddish]], [[Romani language|Romani]], and [[costermonger]] slang, and a distinctive accent that includes [[T-glottalization]], a loss of dental fricatives, diphthong alterations, the use of [[rhyming slang]] and other features. The accent is said to be a remnant of early English London speech, modified by the many immigrants to the area.<ref>''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language'' Ed. Tom McArthur (Oxford University Press, 2005)</ref> \nCockney English is spoken widely in the East End, other areas of East London and in many traditionally working-class areas across London.\n\nThe position of the Cockney dialect in London has been weakened by the promotion of [[Received Pronunciation|Received Pronunciation (RP)]] in the 20th century, and by the scale of migration to London. This has included both gentrifying domestic migration (RP speakers) and the scale of international migration.  Conversely, out-migration from East London has spread the Cockney dialect beyond the capital.\n \nThe Cockney dialect taken beyond London is sometimes referred to as Estuary English, heavily influenced by Cockney and named after the Thames Estuary area where the movement of East Londoners to south Essex and to a lesser extent parts on north Kent led it to be most widely spoken.<ref>[http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/rosew.htm ''Estuary English'' David Rosewarne] ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'', (19 October 1984) accessed 20 November 2007</ref>\nWithin London Cockney speech is, to a significant degree, being replaced by [[Multicultural London English]], a form of speech with a significant Cockney influence.\n\n===Bells===\nIn 1360, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], then living in the [[London Wall|City Wall's]] [[Aldgate]] gatehouse, recorded a pre-existing bell-founding industry, outside the wall in the Aldgate\\[[Whitechapel]] area.\n\nTwo of the six sets of bells featured in the Nursery rhyme [[Oranges and Lemons]] are in the East End ([[St Mary Matfelon|Whitechapel]] and [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch]]), as well as that symbol of the East End - Bow Bells (at [[St Mary-le-Bow]] on Cheapside, within the former walls and therefore outside of the East End). Older versions of the rhyme include the bells at [[St Botolph's Aldgate|Aldgate]], though this may instead reference the bell founding industry in that area. The Shoreditch bells that feature in the rhyme are used to represent Shoreditch in the [[Coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney]].\n\n[[File:Olympic Bell.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic Bell]].]]\nThe [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] opened in 1570, and until its closure in 2016 was the oldest manufacturing company in the UK.<ref>BBC article on the failure of a plan to reopen the foundry https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-50430425</ref> The foundry built many of the most famous bells in the world including [[Big Ben]], the [[Liberty Bell]] in [[Philadelphia]] and Bow Bells. \nOther Whitechapel cast bells of local significance include [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's in Stepney]], and the parish churches of [[All Saints Church, West Ham|West Ham]] and [[Church of St John-at-Hackney|Hackney]].

As [[Bishop of London]] he was also the Lord of the [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient Parish|Manor of Stepney]], an estate that included most or all of what would become the East End, and like subsequent bishops may have lived in the manor. The extent of the manor, and the association with the [[Tower of London|Tower]] means the [[Tower division|Tower division, also known as the Tower Hamlets]] may have been based on Stepney.<ref>The map shows the extent of the TD, which corresponds to Stepney, except for Shoreditch which was also held by the Bishops https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp1-7</ref>\n\nIn 952, Dunstan is recorded as founding (or rebuilding) [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's Church]] in Stepney. This was initially the only church for the [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient Parish|Parish of Stepney]] which, like the manor, originally included much or all of the East End area, with daughter parishes forming much later as a result of population growth. For this reason, St Dunstan's is known as ''The Mother Church of the East End'' <ref>The website homepage of the church http://www.stdunstanstepney.com/</ref> (not to be confused with St Mark's in [[Dalston]], known as the ''Cathedral of the East End'' due to its size). As patron of Stepney, Dunstan is the closest East London has to a patron saint. He is also the patron saint of bell ringers and various types of metalworker. His feast day is May 19.\n\nA folk story about Dunstan is that the devil, in the guise of a beautiful woman, came to tempt Dunstan - a talented metalworker - while he was working in his forge. Dunstan spotted hooves under the skirt, realised that it was the devil, so took his red-hot tongs from the fire and grabbed the devil by the nose, causing him intense pain. The fire-tongs have become a symbol of St Dunstan. The encounter is commonly referenced in English literature, for instance [[A Christmas Carol]] and in the folk rhyme:\n<poem>St Dunstan, as the story goes,\nOnce pull'd the devil by the nose\nWith red-hot tongs, which made him roar,\nThat he was heard three miles or more.{{sfn|Hone|1825|p=670}}</poem>\n\nDunstan's links to the area led to his fire-tong symbol being included in the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney#Borough seal and coat of arms|Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]], and the arms of its successor, the modern [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets#Coat of Arms|London Borough of Tower Hamlets]].\n\n===Brick Lane Mosque===\nThroughout its history, the East End has evolved in response to economic and social change, including migration, with its population being joined by large numbers of people from the UK and overseas.  This is exemplified by the [[Brick Lane Mosque]].<ref>web article on the history of the mosque https://heritage-futures.org/oranges-lemons-heritage-diversity/</ref><ref>second web article on the history of the mosque https://www.citymetric.com/fabric/history-brick-lane-mosque-tells-story-east-end-s-immigrant-past-3759</ref>\n\nThe mosque was first built as a church by [[Huguenot]] Protestant refugees who came to East London to escape persecution in France. After much of that community moved on from the Spitalfields area it was used as a [[Methodist]] chapel for a more widely based Christian congregation. It later became a synagogue, used by Jewish people who came to avoid pogroms in the [[Russian Empire]] and other parts of Europe. The Jewish community of the area dwindled, and in 1976 the building was taken on by the local Bengali community and is now used as a mosque.\n\n===Pearlies===\nThe [[Pearly Kings and Queens]], or more usually '''pearlies''', are a traditional part of London [[costermonger]] culture, their name derives from their clothes which are decorated with [[mother-of-pearl]] buttons.\n[[Image:Pearlykingandqueen.jpg|thumb|Pearly King and Queen]]\nThe pearlies are described as the \u2018aristocracy\u2018 of the costermongers and were originally elected by them to safeguard their rights from competitors and \u2018roughs\u2019.

From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships' crews were employed on a casual basis. New and replacement crew would be found wherever they were available, local sailors being particularly prized for their knowledge of currents and hazards in foreign ports. Crews were paid at the end of their voyages. Inevitably, permanent communities became established, including colonies of [[Lascar]]s and [[Africans]] from the [[Guinea (region)|Guinea Coast]]. Large [[Chinatown]]s at both [[Shadwell]] and [[Limehouse]] developed, associated with the crews of [[East Indiaman|merchantmen]] in the [[opium]] and [[tea]] trades. It was only after the devastation of the Second World War that this predominantly [[Han Chinese]] community relocated to [[Chinatown, London|Soho]].<ref>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.127/chapterId/2614/Chinese-in-the-Port-of-London.html ''London's First Chinatown''] Port Cities: London.

From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] built high-walled docks at [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice led to the creation of ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.<ref name=palmer/>\n\nNo police force operated in London before the 1750s. Crime and disorder were dealt with by a system of magistrates and volunteer parish constables, with strictly limited jurisdiction. Salaried constables were introduced by 1792, although they were few in number and their power and jurisdiction continued to derive from local magistrates, who ''in extremis'' could be backed by militias. In 1798, England's first [[Marine Police Force]] was formed by magistrate Patrick Colquhoun and a Master Mariner, [[John Harriott]], to tackle theft and looting from ships anchored in the [[Pool of London]] and the lower reaches of the river. Its base was (and remains) in [[Wapping]] High Street.

It does not have universally accepted boundaries to the north and east, though the [[River Lea]] is sometimes seen as the eastern boundary. Parts of it may be regarded as lying within [[Central London]] (though that term too has no precise definition). The term \"East of [[Aldgate Pump]]\" is sometimes used as a synonym for the area.\n\nThe East End began to emerge in the Middle Ages with initially slow urban growth outside the eastern walls, which later accelerated, especially in the 19th century, to absorb pre-existing settlements. The first known written record of the East End as a distinct entity, as opposed its component parts, comes from [[John Strype]]'s 1720 ''Survey of London'', which describes London as consisting of four parts: the City of London, [[City and Liberty of Westminster|Westminster]], [[Southwark]], and \"That Part beyond the Tower\". The relevance of Strype's reference to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] was more than geographical. The East End was the urbanised part of an administrative area called the [[Tower division|Tower Division]], which had owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] since time immemorial. Later, as London grew further, the fully urbanised Tower Division became a byword for wider East London, before East London grew further still, east of the [[River Lea]] and into [[Essex]].\n\nThe area was notorious for its deep poverty, overcrowding and associated social problems. This led to the East End's history of intense political activism and association with some of the country's most influential social reformers. Another major theme of East End history has been migration, both inward and outward. The area had a strong pull on the rural poor from other parts of England, and attracted waves of migration from further afield, notably [[Huguenot]] refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in [[Spitalfields]] in the 17th century,<ref name=Huguenot>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22743 Bethnal Green: Settlement and Building to 1836], ''A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green'' (1998), pp. 91\u20135.

Shoreditch's boundary with the parish of [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] (and its predecessor [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]]) ran through the [[Moorfields]], which became, on urbanisation, the boundary of [[East London|east]] and north London. That line, with very slight modifications, also became part of the boundary between the modern London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]].\n\nMoorfields remained largely open until 1812, and the longstanding presence of that open space separating the emerging East End from the western urban expansion of London must have helped shape the different economic character of the two parts and perceptions of their distinct identity (see map below).\n\n[[File:City of London Ogilby and Morgan's Map of 1677.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|Ogilby & Morgan's map of the City of London (1673). \"A Large and Accurate Map of the City of London.

The East End is developing outside [[Bishopsgate]], [[Aldgate]] and along the river - it is separated from the western growth of the city by [[Moorfields]]]]\n\nThe East End has always contained some of London's poorest areas. The main reasons for this include:\n* The [[medieval]] system of [[copyhold]], which prevailed throughout the East End into the 19th century. Essentially, there was little point in developing land that was held on short leases.<ref name=palmer/>\n* The siting of noxious industries, such as [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] and [[fulling]] downwind outside the boundaries of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls. The foul-smelling industries partially preferred the East End because the prevailing winds in London traveled from west to east (i.e. it was downwind from the rest of the city), so that most odours from their businesses would not go into the city.\n* The low paid employment in the [[London Docklands|docks]] and related industries, made worse by the trade practices of outwork, [[piecework]] and casual labour.\n* The concentration of the ruling court and national political centre in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], on the opposite, western side of the [[City of London]].\n\nHistorically, the East End is arguably conterminous with the Manor of Stepney. This manor was held by the [[Bishop of London]], in compensation for his duties in maintaining and garrisoning the [[Tower of London]]. Further ecclesiastic holdings came about from the need to enclose the marshes and create flood defences along the Thames. [[Edward VI]] passed the land to the [[Baron Wentworth|Wentworth]] family, and thence to their descendants, the Earls of Cleveland. The ecclesiastic system of copyhold, whereby land was leased to tenants for terms as short as seven years, prevailed throughout the manor. This severely limited scope for improvement of the land and new building until the estate was broken up in the 19th century.<ref name=Stepney>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45083 ''Stepney, Old and New London: Volume 2'' (1878), pp. 137-142] accessed: 17 November 2007</ref>\n\nIn medieval times trades were carried out in workshops in and around the owners' premises in the City. By the time of the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666 these were becoming industries, and some were particularly noisome, such as the processing of urine for the tanning industry, or required large amounts of space, such as drying clothes after process and dying in fields known as [[tenterground]]s. Some were dangerous, such as the manufacture of gunpowder or the proving of guns. These activities came to be performed outside the City walls in the near suburbs of the East End. Later, when lead-making and bone-processing for soap and china came to be established, they too located in the East End rather than in the crowded streets of the City.<ref name=palmer/>\n\nThe lands east of the City had always been used as hunting grounds for bishops and royalty, with [[John of England|King John]] establishing a palace at [[Bow, London|Bow]]. The [[Cistercian]] [[Stratford Langthorne Abbey]] became the court of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1267 for the visitation of the [[Papal legate]]s, and it was here that he made peace with the barons under the terms of the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. It became the fifth largest Abbey in the country, visited by monarchs and providing a retreat (and a final resting place) for the nobility.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39836 ''Houses of Cistercian monks: Abbey of Stratford Langthorne'', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 2 (1907), pp. 129-133] accessed: 30 April 2008.</ref> The [[Palace of Placentia]] at [[Greenwich]], to the south of the river, was built by the Regent to [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] and [[Henry VIII]] established a hunting lodge at [[Bromley Hall]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22734 ''Stepney: Manors and Estates'', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 19-52] accessed: 20 November 2007</ref> These Royal connections continued until after the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] (1649\u201360) when the Court established itself in the [[Palace of Whitehall]] and the offices of politics congregated around them.

The principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel and Bow. Settlements along the river began at that time to service the needs of shipping on the Thames, but the City of London retained its right to land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times (16th century), as the [[Royal Navy]] expanded and international trading developed, and a major fishing port developed downstream at [[Barking, London|Barking]] to provide fish for the City. These and other factors meant that industries relating to construction, repair, and victualling of naval and merchant ships flourished in the area.\n\nRoyalty such as [[John of England|King John]] had had a hunting lodge at [[Bromley-by-Bow]], and the [[Bishop of London]] had a palace at [[Bethnal Green]], but later these estates began to be split up, and estates of fine houses for captains, merchants and owners of manufacturers began to be built. [[Samuel Pepys]] moved his family and goods to Bethnal Green during the [[Great Fire of London]], and [[Captain Cook]] moved from [[Shadwell]] to [[Stepney Green]], where a school and assembly rooms had been established (commemorated by ''Assembly Passage'', and a plaque on the site of Cook's house on the Mile End Road). Mile End Old Town also acquired some fine buildings, and the New Town began to be built. As the area became built up and more crowded, the wealthy sold their plots for subdivision and moved further afield. Into the 18th and 19th centuries, there were still attempts to build fine houses, for example [[Tredegar Square]] (1830), and the open fields around Mile End New Town were used for the construction of estates of workers' cottages in 1820. This was designed in 1817 in Birmingham by Anthony Hughes and finally constructed in 1820.<ref name=MEOT>\n[http://www.mcmullencarpentersandjoiners.co.uk/what-lies-beneath-east-end-of-london/ ''What lies beneath ...

Bethnal Green's population trebled between 1801 and 1831, with 20,000 looms being operated in people's own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms had become idle, and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture.<ref name=women/> Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the silk industry's decline.\n\n[[File:1745 Roque Map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|The East End in 1741\u20135, as depicted on [[John Rocque]]'s ''[[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746#The Country Near Ten Miles Round|Exact Survey of the city's of London Westminster ye Borough of Southwark and the Country near ten miles round]]''.

Conversely, out-migration from East London has spread the Cockney dialect beyond the capital.\n \nThe Cockney dialect taken beyond London is sometimes referred to as Estuary English, heavily influenced by Cockney and named after the Thames Estuary area where the movement of East Londoners to south Essex and to a lesser extent parts on north Kent led it to be most widely spoken.<ref>[http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/rosew.htm ''Estuary English'' David Rosewarne] ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'', (19 October 1984) accessed 20 November 2007</ref>\nWithin London Cockney speech is, to a significant degree, being replaced by [[Multicultural London English]], a form of speech with a significant Cockney influence.\n\n===Bells===\nIn 1360, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], then living in the [[London Wall|City Wall's]] [[Aldgate]] gatehouse, recorded a pre-existing bell-founding industry, outside the wall in the Aldgate\\[[Whitechapel]] area.\n\nTwo of the six sets of bells featured in the Nursery rhyme [[Oranges and Lemons]] are in the East End ([[St Mary Matfelon|Whitechapel]] and [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch]]), as well as that symbol of the East End - Bow Bells (at [[St Mary-le-Bow]] on Cheapside, within the former walls and therefore outside of the East End). Older versions of the rhyme include the bells at [[St Botolph's Aldgate|Aldgate]], though this may instead reference the bell founding industry in that area. The Shoreditch bells that feature in the rhyme are used to represent Shoreditch in the [[Coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney]].\n\n[[File:Olympic Bell.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic Bell]].]]\nThe [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] opened in 1570, and until its closure in 2016 was the oldest manufacturing company in the UK.<ref>BBC article on the failure of a plan to reopen the foundry https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-50430425</ref> The foundry built many of the most famous bells in the world including [[Big Ben]], the [[Liberty Bell]] in [[Philadelphia]] and Bow Bells. \nOther Whitechapel cast bells of local significance include [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's in Stepney]], and the parish churches of [[All Saints Church, West Ham|West Ham]] and [[Church of St John-at-Hackney|Hackney]]. The [[Olympic Bell]] at the London Stadium \u2013 the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world and used in the opening ceremony of the 2012 games was jointly developed by Whitechapel, in partnership with a [[Royal Eijsbouts|Dutch foundry]].\n\n===St Dunstan and Stepney===\n[[Dunstan]] was a tenth century churchman, statesman and saint with strong links to the East End area. As [[Bishop of London]] he was also the Lord of the [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient Parish|Manor of Stepney]], an estate that included most or all of what would become the East End, and like subsequent bishops may have lived in the manor. The extent of the manor, and the association with the [[Tower of London|Tower]] means the [[Tower division|Tower division, also known as the Tower Hamlets]] may have been based on Stepney.<ref>The map shows the extent of the TD, which corresponds to Stepney, except for Shoreditch which was also held by the Bishops https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol11/pp1-7</ref>\n\nIn 952, Dunstan is recorded as founding (or rebuilding) [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's Church]] in Stepney. This was initially the only church for the [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient Parish|Parish of Stepney]] which, like the manor, originally included much or all of the East End area, with daughter parishes forming much later as a result of population growth. For this reason, St Dunstan's is known as ''The Mother Church of the East End'' <ref>The website homepage of the church http://www.stdunstanstepney.com/</ref> (not to be confused with St Mark's in [[Dalston]], known as the ''Cathedral of the East End'' due to its size). As patron of Stepney, Dunstan is the closest East London has to a patron saint. He is also the patron saint of bell ringers and various types of metalworker. His feast day is May 19.\n\nA folk story about Dunstan is that the devil, in the guise of a beautiful woman, came to tempt Dunstan - a talented metalworker - while he was working in his forge. Dunstan spotted hooves under the skirt, realised that it was the devil, so took his red-hot tongs from the fire and grabbed the devil by the nose, causing him intense pain. The fire-tongs have become a symbol of St Dunstan. The encounter is commonly referenced in English literature, for instance [[A Christmas Carol]] and in the folk rhyme:\n<poem>St Dunstan, as the story goes,\nOnce pull'd the devil by the nose\nWith red-hot tongs, which made him roar,\nThat he was heard three miles or more.{{sfn|Hone|1825|p=670}}</poem>\n\nDunstan's links to the area led to his fire-tong symbol being included in the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney#Borough seal and coat of arms|Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]], and the arms of its successor, the modern [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets#Coat of Arms|London Borough of Tower Hamlets]].\n\n===Brick Lane Mosque===\nThroughout its history, the East End has evolved in response to economic and social change, including migration, with its population being joined by large numbers of people from the UK and overseas.  This is exemplified by the [[Brick Lane Mosque]].<ref>web article on the history of the mosque https://heritage-futures.org/oranges-lemons-heritage-diversity/</ref><ref>second web article on the history of the mosque https://www.citymetric.com/fabric/history-brick-lane-mosque-tells-story-east-end-s-immigrant-past-3759</ref>\n\nThe mosque was first built as a church by [[Huguenot]] Protestant refugees who came to East London to escape persecution in France. After much of that community moved on from the Spitalfields area it was used as a [[Methodist]] chapel for a more widely based Christian congregation. It later became a synagogue, used by Jewish people who came to avoid pogroms in the [[Russian Empire]] and other parts of Europe. The Jewish community of the area dwindled, and in 1976 the building was taken on by the local Bengali community and is now used as a mosque.\n\n===Pearlies===\nThe [[Pearly Kings and Queens]], or more usually '''pearlies''', are a traditional part of London [[costermonger]] culture, their name derives from their clothes which are decorated with [[mother-of-pearl]] buttons.\n[[Image:Pearlykingandqueen.jpg|thumb|Pearly King and Queen]]\nThe pearlies are described as the \u2018aristocracy\u2018 of the costermongers and were originally elected by them to safeguard their rights from competitors and \u2018roughs\u2019. They are now devoted entirely to charitable activities.<ref>The origins of the pearlies are briefly described in The London Encyclopaedia, Weinreb and Hibbert, 1983</ref> Pearlies are part of the East End's heritage, but contrary to the widespread perception, they are not an exclusively East End institution, there are Pearly Kings and Queens across inner London. \nA parade of real-life Pearly Kings and Queens was featured at the [[2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony]].\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Brick Lane 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brick Lane]] has been a centre for new immigration through the centuries (Sep 2005)]]\n{{Further|Ethnic groups in London}}\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 009 - Billingsgate Market (tone).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Billingsgate Fish Market]] in the early 19th century]]\nThroughout history the area has absorbed waves of immigrants, who have added new dimensions to its culture and history, most notably the [[French people|French]] [[Protestant]] [[Huguenot]]s in the 17th century,<ref name=Huguenot/> the [[Irish people|Irish]] in the 18th century,<ref name=Irish/> [[Ashkenazi Jews]] fleeing [[pogroms]] in [[Eastern Europe]] towards the end of the 19th century,<ref name=Jews/> and the [[British Bangladeshi|Sylheti Bangladeshis]]<ref name=\"Sylhetis\" /> community in the 1960s.\n\n===Immigration===\n[[File:Aerial view of East London Mosque complex - Feb 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[East London Mosque]] was one of the first in Britain to be allowed to use loudspeakers to broadcast the adhan.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eade|first1=John|editor1-last=Metcalf|editor1-first=Barbara Daly|title=Making Muslim Space in North America and Europe|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=[https://archive.org/details/makingmuslimspac0000unse/page/223 223\u2013224]|isbn=978-0520204041|chapter-url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2s2004p0&chunk.id=s1.12.69&toc.id=ch12&brand=ucpress|accessdate=19 April 2015|chapter=Nationalism, Community, and the Islamization of Space in London|quote=As one of the few mosques in Britain permitted to broadcast calls to prayer (azan), the mosque soon found itself at the center of a public debate about \"noise pollution\" when local non-Muslim residents began to protest.|url=https://archive.org/details/makingmuslimspac0000unse/page/223}}</ref>]]\nImmigrant communities first developed in the riverside settlements. From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships' crews were employed on a casual basis. New and replacement crew would be found wherever they were available, local sailors being particularly prized for their knowledge of currents and hazards in foreign ports. Crews were paid at the end of their voyages. Inevitably, permanent communities became established, including colonies of [[Lascar]]s and [[Africans]] from the [[Guinea (region)|Guinea Coast]]. Large [[Chinatown]]s at both [[Shadwell]] and [[Limehouse]] developed, associated with the crews of [[East Indiaman|merchantmen]] in the [[opium]] and [[tea]] trades. It was only after the devastation of the Second World War that this predominantly [[Han Chinese]] community relocated to [[Chinatown, London|Soho]].<ref>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.127/chapterId/2614/Chinese-in-the-Port-of-London.html ''London's First Chinatown''] Port Cities: London.

Others were discharged sailors and some a legacy of British involvement in the [[slave trade]]. The committee distributed food, clothing, and medical aid and found work for men, from various locations including the White Raven tavern in Mile End.<ref>Further relief was distributed at the [[Yorkshire Stingo]], on the south side of Marylebone Road, with other centres of black poor being the rookery of [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]] and [[Marylebone]].</ref> They also helped the men to go abroad, some to Canada. In October 1786, the Committee funded an ill-fated expedition of 280 black men, 40 black women and 70 white women (mainly wives and girlfriends) to settle in [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>Braidwood, Stephen ''Black Poor and White Philanthropists: London's Blacks and the Foundation of the Sierra Leone Settlement 1786\u20131791'' (Liverpool University Press, 1994)</ref> From the late 19th century, a large African mariner community was established in [[Canning Town]] as a result of new shipping links to the Caribbean and West Africa.<ref>Geoffrey Bell, ''The other Eastenders : Kamal Chunchie and West Ham's early black community'' (Stratford: Eastside Community Heritage, 2002)</ref>\n\nImmigrants have not always been readily accepted.

From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] built high-walled docks at [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice led to the creation of ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.<ref name=palmer/>\n\nNo police force operated in London before the 1750s. Crime and disorder were dealt with by a system of magistrates and volunteer parish constables, with strictly limited jurisdiction. Salaried constables were introduced by 1792, although they were few in number and their power and jurisdiction continued to derive from local magistrates, who ''in extremis'' could be backed by militias. In 1798, England's first [[Marine Police Force]] was formed by magistrate Patrick Colquhoun and a Master Mariner, [[John Harriott]], to tackle theft and looting from ships anchored in the [[Pool of London]] and the lower reaches of the river. Its base was (and remains) in [[Wapping]] High Street.  It is now known as the [[Marine Support Unit]].<ref>[http://www.met.police.uk/msu/history.htm ''History of the Marine Support Unit''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716200107/http://www.met.police.uk/msu/history.htm |date=16 July 2007 }} ([[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]) accessed 24 January 2007</ref>\n\nIn 1829, the [[Metropolitan Police Force]] was formed, with a remit to patrol within {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} of [[Charing Cross]], with a force of 1,000 men in 17 divisions, including 'H' division, based in Stepney. Each division was controlled by a superintendent, under whom were four inspectors and sixteen sergeants.

In 1600, it was described by the antiquarian [[John Stow]] as \"a continual street, or filthy straight passage, with alleys of small tenements or cottages builded, inhabited by sailors and victuallers\".

The [[Society for the Suppression of Vice]] estimated that between the Houndsditch, Whitechapel and Ratcliffe areas there were 1803 prostitutes; and between Mile End, Shadwell and Blackwall 963 women in the trade.

Eventually, the passage of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts|Contagious Diseases Prevention Act]] in 1864 allowed policemen to arrest prostitutes and detain them in hospital.
