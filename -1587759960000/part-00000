{"title_page": "History of Hull City A.F.C.", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Inception==\n[[Hull City A.F.C.]] were founded on 28 June 1904. For some years before these attempts were made to found a [[football (soccer)|football]] club, but in a city dominated initially by [[rugby league]] with the likes of [[Hull F.C.]] and [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] this proved difficult.\n\nThe first season for Hull City consisted of friendly matches; because of the time of founding, City  were unable to apply for membership to [[The Football League]] for the 1904\u201305 season. The early matches were played at [[The Boulevard (stadium)|The Boulevard]], home of rugby league side Hull FC. On 1 September 1904, City's debut match took place against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]; with 6000 in attendance at the Boulevard, City notched up an impressive start holding the more experienced County to a 2\u20132 draw.\n\nHull's first taste of competitive football came in the [[FA Cup]], but they were eliminated, after a replay, in the preliminary round against [[Stockton F.C.|Stockton]], the score was 7\u20134 on aggregate. After uneasy relationships with landlords, Hull City moved to Anlaby Road Cricket Ground.\n\n==Football League==\nFinally, after playing 44 friendly fixtures the previous season, Hull City were entered into the [[Football League Second Division]] for the [[1905\u201306 in English football|1905\u201306 season]]. Other teams competing in the league that season included the likes of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], as well as [[Yorkshire]] rivals [[Leeds City F.C.|Leeds City]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. Indeed, it was Barnsley who they faced in their first game, beating them 4\u20131. Eventually, Hull would finish fifth.\n\nThe following season a new ground was built for Hull City across the road from the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, City continued to finish consistently in the top half of the table. They came agonisingly close to promotion in the [[1909\u201310 in English football|1909\u201310]] season, recording what would be their highest ever finish in their history (a record which will be surpassed at the end of the 2008\u201309 Premier League season); Hull finishing third, level on points with second placed [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], they missed promotion on goal average by the slim margin of 0.29 of a goal.\n\nBefore the [[First World War]], Hull reached the quarter-finals of the [[FA Cup]] in 1915, beating out [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], before eventually going out to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in a 4\u20132 away defeat.\n\n==Post-War==\nIn cup competitions, the club's greatest achievement was in 1930, when they reached the [[FA Cup]] semi-final. The cup run saw Hull knocking out [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and eventual Champions of the Second and Third Division; [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] respectively. They then knocked out [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], to meet [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the FA Cup quarter finals. The first leg at [[St James' Park]] finished as a 1\u20131 draw, but in the replay Hull beat Newcastle 1\u20130.\n\nThe semi-final match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] took place at Elland Road in [[Leeds]], the game ended 2\u20132, and was taken to a replay. Arsenal knocked Hull City out at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]'s home ground, the game ended 1\u20130.\n\nIn [[1948\u201349 in English football|1948\u201349]], managed by former England international [[Raich Carter]], Hull City won the Third Division (North), and their new Boothferry Park ground saw a crowd approaching 50,000 for the Christmas Day game against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], and exceeding that for the [[FA Cup]] 6th round tie with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]; the attendance of 55,019 still remains a record today.\n\nYo-yoing between the second and third tiers of English football, Hull City had promotion seasons from the third to the second division again in 1959 and 1966, winning the third division championship in that latter season. Still, however, top flight football eluded the club. They came close several times in the early 1970s under the player-management of [[Terry Neill]], but were not able to secure promotion before Neill left to join [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1974. Another player-manager, [[John Kaye (footballer)|John Kaye]] succeeded Neill, but the club's form slowly deteriorated over the following years, eventually culminating in a disastrous 1977\u201378 season that saw four men (Kaye, [[Bobby Collins (footballer)|Bobby Collins]], [[Wilf McGuinness]], and [[Ken Houghton]]) take charge of the team on its way to being relegated in bottom place.\n\nThe following season saw Hull struggle for consistency, before recovering well in the second half of the season to finish a respectable 8th place. This form was not carried forward into the 1979\u201380 season, however, and manager Ken Houghton was sacked in December 1979 after a two-month winless run left them near the bottom of the table. [[Wales national football team|Wales]] manager [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] was recruited to take over, and a strong end to the season saw Hull avoid relegation by a single point. This just staved off the inevitable, however, and a thoroughly disastrous 1980\u201381 season saw the club finish bottom again, resulting in their first-ever relegation to the fourth tier. Two relegations in three years had a dire effect on the club's finances, which in turn helped lead to a dismal start to their first season in Division Four. An upturn in form later in the season saw them finish in 8th place, but it wasn't enough to save Smith's job, and he was made redundant two months before the season ended.\n\nThe low ebb saw the arrival of unlikely looking saviours in the form of a chairman (Don Robinson) and manager ([[Colin Appleton]]) from the footballing outpost of [[Scarborough F.C.]] Promotion to Division Three followed in 1983, with a young team featuring the likes of future England international [[Brian Marwood]], future England manager [[Steve McClaren]], fearsome centre-forward [[Billy Whitehurst]], and the prolific goal-scorer Les Mutrie. When Hull City missed out on promotion by 1 goal the following season, Appleton left to manage [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]].\n\nHull City reached the Second Division in 1985 under new player-manager [[Brian Horton]], and again nearly earned a second successive promotion, this time finishing in 6th place. The two following seasons saw Hull only able to record mid-table finishes, however, and Horton was controversially sacked shortly before the end of the 1987\u201388 season. Former [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] manager [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] replaced Horton, but was himself sacked at the end of the following season, following a disastrous run that saw them win only one of their last twenty games. \n\n1989-90 proved another very inconsistent season, with Colin Appleton returning for a second stint as manager, only to resign after just five months, following the club's worst-ever start to a league campaign. [[Stan Ternent]] took over from Appleton, and oversaw a remarkable upswing in form that saw the team manage a respectable 14th-place finish. This proved a false dawn, however, and Hull's start to the 1990\u201391 season was almost as bad as the previous one, including a humiliating 7-0 thrashing by [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]]. Ternent was sacked shortly after the turn of the year with the club well adrift at the bottom of the table, with [[Terry Dolan (football manager)|Terry Dolan]] replacing him. Despite an initial upturn in form after Dolan's appointment, and there being only two relegation spots that year due to league restructuring, it proved too little, too late, and Hull were relegated back to the Third Division, the beginning of what would prove a 14-year absence from the second tier.\n\n==Striving to survive: 1990s==\n\nHull finished 14th in the Third Division in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], meaning that they would be competing in the new Football League Division Two. In their first season in the rebranded division, Hull narrowly avoided another relegation but the board kept faith in Dolan and over the next two seasons they achieved secure mid table finishes. But terrible form in [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]] condemned Hull to relegation to Division Three.\n\nDolan was fired by new chairman [[David Lloyd (tennis)|David Lloyd]] after Hull failed to get anywhere near the top of Division Three in [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u201397]], with former England international [[Mark Hateley]] taking over the manager's job. By this stage, financial problems were taking their toll on the Tigers and it was starting to look as though the club would go out of business before long. And Hull's league form was steadily deteriorating to the point that relegation to the Conference was looking a real possibility \u2013 which surely would have meant the death of the club. The [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season would prove to be arguably the worst in the club's history, with the club earning just 41 points; any other season this would almost certainly have seen Hull relegated to the Football Conference, but [[Brighton and Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton and Hove Albion]] and Doncaster Rovers both had unbelievably poor campaigns, and instead it was Doncaster who were relegated, with Hull recording their lowest ever finish in 22nd place. Lloyd stepped down as chairman that summer and was replaced by Nick Buchanan, while Hateley departed in November 1998 to be replaced by 34-year-old veteran player [[Warren Joyce]], who steered the club to safety after being anchored to the foot of the table \u2013 Hull City fans refer to this season as \"The Great Escape\". After this feat, Joyce was perhaps unlucky to be replaced in April 2000 by the experienced [[Brian Little (footballer)|Brian Little]].\n\nLittle breathed new life into Hull and managed to get good results out of the players, despite briefly being locked out of [[Boothferry Park]] by the bailiffs and with liquidation looking a real possibility. Hull qualified for the Division Three playoffs in [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301]], and lost in the semi finals. But things could have been much worse \u2013 at least the Hull City fans still had a football club to support. A boardroom takeover had eased the club's precarious financial situation and all fears of closure were banished \u2013 had the club been relegated to the Conference the previous season, it is extremely unlikely that this takeover would have taken place.\n\n===The Tigers on their way up===\n[[File:KC Stadium.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[KC Stadium|Kingston Communications Stadium]].]]\n[[File:Bothferry.jpg|thumb|200px|Recent picture of [[Boothferry Park]]]]\nNew Chairman [[Adam Pearson (sports executive)|Adam Pearson]] ploughed funds into the club, allowing Little to rebuild the team with the aim of immediate promotion. Hull occupied the Division Three promotion and playoff places for much of the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]] season, but Little was sacked two months before the end of the season and Hull slipped to 11th under his successor [[Jan M\u00f8lby]].\n\nHull began the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] season as most people's favourites for promotion from Division Three, but a terrible start to the season saw relegation look more likely than promotion and Molby was sacked in October as the Tigers languished fifth from bottom in the league.\n\n[[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]] was named as Hull's new manager and in December 2002, just weeks after his appointment, Hull relocated to the impressive new 25,400-seat [[KC Stadium|Kingston Communications Stadium]] after 56 years at [[Boothferry Park]]. After this move, Hull's attendances were some of the best in the division but their results were rarely this impressive and they were unable to finish above 13th place in the final table.\n\nHull's new stadium was one of the most impressive stadiums outside the Premier League<ref>{{cite web | title = Prestigious Award for The KC Stadium | url = \nhttp://www.kcstadium.co.uk/newsstory.asp?id=545 | accessdate = 27 September 2006 }}</ref> and it has helped influence an upturn in Hull's fortunes after a decade of misery. The two seasons which followed the opening of the new stadium were hugely successful. Hull were Division Three runners-up in [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]] and League One runners-up in [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] \u2013 back-to-back promotions \u2013 which took them into the Championship, the second tier of English football.\n\n[[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] was hardly the most exciting season in the history of Hull City football club; it was more a season of consolidation after two successive promotions. Hull finished 18th in the final table \u2013 a comfortable 10 points clear of relegation and their highest league finish for 16 years.\n\n==2006 and onwards==\n===Championship struggles===\n[[File:Hull-City-League-Finishes.png|thumb|right|Graph showing Hull City A.F.C's progress through the [[The Football League|English Football League]] System [[The Football League 1983-84|1983\u20131984]] to [[2012\u201313 Football League|2012\u201313]] (last position shown: 9 May 2013, 2nd in the [[Football League Championship]])]]\nThe successful stint at Hull City saw Peter Taylor's name linked with the [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] manager's job before it was given to [[Iain Dowie]]. On 13 June 2006, Peter Taylor left Hull to take up the job vacated by Dowie at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], a club at which he had enjoyed considerable success as a player. [[Phil Parkinson]] was confirmed as his replacement on 29 June 2006, with Hull paying Colchester (with whom Parkinson was still under contract) \u00a3400,000 compensation. [[Phil Brown (footballer born 1959)|Phil Brown]], who had recently departed his job as manager of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], joined the club as Parkinson's assistant.\n\nDefender [[Leon Cort]] became Hull's first million-pound player when he followed Peter Taylor to Crystal Palace for a fee of \u00a31,250,000. Parkinson wasted no time in spending the majority of this money on strengthening the City squad in readiness for the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] season.\n\nChairman Adam Pearson has stated his ambition to take Hull into the top flight for the first time in their history<ref>{{cite web | title = Hull in print | url = http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/hullinprint/archive/febmar2005/hull_city_stand_up.php | accessdate = 26 September 2006 }}</ref> \u2013 and he believed Phil Parkinson was the manager to do it.<ref>{{cite web | title = thepfa.co.uk | url = http://www.thepfa.co.uk/display.cfm?article=8723&type=1 | accessdate = 18 May 2014 |date= 14 July 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008144225/http://www.thepfa.co.uk/display.cfm?article=8723&type=1 | archivedate = 8 October 2007}}</ref> However, their dismal start to the 2006\u201307 season was hardly the form of a team attempting to gain promotion, and on 4 December 2006 Parkinson was sacked as manager with Hull in the relegation zone, despite having spent over \u00a32 million on players. Parkinson had achieved two notable firsts, under his management Hull City won for the first time ever on live television and also won a penalty shoot-out for the first time.\n\nPhil Brown was appointed as caretaker manager, and by 4 January 2007 Hull had moved out of the relegation zone and Brown was rewarded with a contract as their new manager until at least the end of the season.\n\nHull's Championship game against [[Sunderland AFC]] on 17 March 2007 at the [[Stadium of light]] saw an attendance of 38,448, a record to a Hull City game since they visited [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on 14 May 1977.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hull versus Sunderland: Match Report | url = http://www.hullcityafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10338~33911,00.html | accessdate = 18 May 2007 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120804031316/http://www.hullcityafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10338~33911,00.html | archive-date = 4 August 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nHull City all but secured their place in the Championship next season with a 1\u20130 victory away at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], on 28 April 2007.  This left them 3 points clear of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], the only side with a chance of overtaking them, but with a vastly superior goal difference this was only a mathematical possibility. This crucial goal was scored by [[Dean Windass]], who had rejoined his hometown club on loan from [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].\n\nBy 4 May, due to a lack of any realistic chance of them remaining in the [[Coca Cola Championship|Championship]], Leeds went into [[administration (insolvency)|administration]]<ref>{{cite news | title = Relegated Leeds in administration | url = \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/6625751.stm | accessdate = 4 May 2007  | work = BBC News |publisher = BBC| date = 4 May 2007}}</ref> and in doing so received the 10 point penalty such a move incurs.

For some years before these attempts were made to found a [[football (soccer)|football]] club, but in a city dominated initially by [[rugby league]] with the likes of [[Hull F.C.]] and [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] this proved difficult.\n\nThe first season for Hull City consisted of friendly matches; because of the time of founding, City  were unable to apply for membership to [[The Football League]] for the 1904\u201305 season. The early matches were played at [[The Boulevard (stadium)|The Boulevard]], home of rugby league side Hull FC. On 1 September 1904, City's debut match took place against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]; with 6000 in attendance at the Boulevard, City notched up an impressive start holding the more experienced County to a 2\u20132 draw.\n\nHull's first taste of competitive football came in the [[FA Cup]], but they were eliminated, after a replay, in the preliminary round against [[Stockton F.C.|Stockton]], the score was 7\u20134 on aggregate. After uneasy relationships with landlords, Hull City moved to Anlaby Road Cricket Ground.\n\n==Football League==\nFinally, after playing 44 friendly fixtures the previous season, Hull City were entered into the [[Football League Second Division]] for the [[1905\u201306 in English football|1905\u201306 season]]. Other teams competing in the league that season included the likes of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], as well as [[Yorkshire]] rivals [[Leeds City F.C.|Leeds City]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. Indeed, it was Barnsley who they faced in their first game, beating them 4\u20131. Eventually, Hull would finish fifth.\n\nThe following season a new ground was built for Hull City across the road from the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, City continued to finish consistently in the top half of the table. They came agonisingly close to promotion in the [[1909\u201310 in English football|1909\u201310]] season, recording what would be their highest ever finish in their history (a record which will be surpassed at the end of the 2008\u201309 Premier League season); Hull finishing third, level on points with second placed [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], they missed promotion on goal average by the slim margin of 0.29 of a goal.\n\nBefore the [[First World War]], Hull reached the quarter-finals of the [[FA Cup]] in 1915, beating out [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], before eventually going out to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in a 4\u20132 away defeat.\n\n==Post-War==\nIn cup competitions, the club's greatest achievement was in 1930, when they reached the [[FA Cup]] semi-final. The cup run saw Hull knocking out [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and eventual Champions of the Second and Third Division; [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] respectively. They then knocked out [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], to meet [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the FA Cup quarter finals. The first leg at [[St James' Park]] finished as a 1\u20131 draw, but in the replay Hull beat Newcastle 1\u20130.\n\nThe semi-final match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] took place at Elland Road in [[Leeds]], the game ended 2\u20132, and was taken to a replay. Arsenal knocked Hull City out at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]'s home ground, the game ended 1\u20130.\n\nIn [[1948\u201349 in English football|1948\u201349]], managed by former England international [[Raich Carter]], Hull City won the Third Division (North), and their new Boothferry Park ground saw a crowd approaching 50,000 for the Christmas Day game against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], and exceeding that for the [[FA Cup]] 6th round tie with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]; the attendance of 55,019 still remains a record today.\n\nYo-yoing between the second and third tiers of English football, Hull City had promotion seasons from the third to the second division again in 1959 and 1966, winning the third division championship in that latter season. Still, however, top flight football eluded the club. They came close several times in the early 1970s under the player-management of [[Terry Neill]], but were not able to secure promotion before Neill left to join [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1974. Another player-manager, [[John Kaye (footballer)|John Kaye]] succeeded Neill, but the club's form slowly deteriorated over the following years, eventually culminating in a disastrous 1977\u201378 season that saw four men (Kaye, [[Bobby Collins (footballer)|Bobby Collins]], [[Wilf McGuinness]], and [[Ken Houghton]]) take charge of the team on its way to being relegated in bottom place.\n\nThe following season saw Hull struggle for consistency, before recovering well in the second half of the season to finish a respectable 8th place. This form was not carried forward into the 1979\u201380 season, however, and manager Ken Houghton was sacked in December 1979 after a two-month winless run left them near the bottom of the table. [[Wales national football team|Wales]] manager [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] was recruited to take over, and a strong end to the season saw Hull avoid relegation by a single point. This just staved off the inevitable, however, and a thoroughly disastrous 1980\u201381 season saw the club finish bottom again, resulting in their first-ever relegation to the fourth tier. Two relegations in three years had a dire effect on the club's finances, which in turn helped lead to a dismal start to their first season in Division Four. An upturn in form later in the season saw them finish in 8th place, but it wasn't enough to save Smith's job, and he was made redundant two months before the season ended.\n\nThe low ebb saw the arrival of unlikely looking saviours in the form of a chairman (Don Robinson) and manager ([[Colin Appleton]]) from the footballing outpost of [[Scarborough F.C.]] Promotion to Division Three followed in 1983, with a young team featuring the likes of future England international [[Brian Marwood]], future England manager [[Steve McClaren]], fearsome centre-forward [[Billy Whitehurst]], and the prolific goal-scorer Les Mutrie. When Hull City missed out on promotion by 1 goal the following season, Appleton left to manage [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]].\n\nHull City reached the Second Division in 1985 under new player-manager [[Brian Horton]], and again nearly earned a second successive promotion, this time finishing in 6th place. The two following seasons saw Hull only able to record mid-table finishes, however, and Horton was controversially sacked shortly before the end of the 1987\u201388 season. Former [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] manager [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] replaced Horton, but was himself sacked at the end of the following season, following a disastrous run that saw them win only one of their last twenty games. \n\n1989-90 proved another very inconsistent season, with Colin Appleton returning for a second stint as manager, only to resign after just five months, following the club's worst-ever start to a league campaign. [[Stan Ternent]] took over from Appleton, and oversaw a remarkable upswing in form that saw the team manage a respectable 14th-place finish. This proved a false dawn, however, and Hull's start to the 1990\u201391 season was almost as bad as the previous one, including a humiliating 7-0 thrashing by [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]]. Ternent was sacked shortly after the turn of the year with the club well adrift at the bottom of the table, with [[Terry Dolan (football manager)|Terry Dolan]] replacing him. Despite an initial upturn in form after Dolan's appointment, and there being only two relegation spots that year due to league restructuring, it proved too little, too late, and Hull were relegated back to the Third Division, the beginning of what would prove a 14-year absence from the second tier.\n\n==Striving to survive: 1990s==\n\nHull finished 14th in the Third Division in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], meaning that they would be competing in the new Football League Division Two. In their first season in the rebranded division, Hull narrowly avoided another relegation but the board kept faith in Dolan and over the next two seasons they achieved secure mid table finishes. But terrible form in [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]] condemned Hull to relegation to Division Three.\n\nDolan was fired by new chairman [[David Lloyd (tennis)|David Lloyd]] after Hull failed to get anywhere near the top of Division Three in [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u201397]], with former England international [[Mark Hateley]] taking over the manager's job. By this stage, financial problems were taking their toll on the Tigers and it was starting to look as though the club would go out of business before long. And Hull's league form was steadily deteriorating to the point that relegation to the Conference was looking a real possibility \u2013 which surely would have meant the death of the club. The [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season would prove to be arguably the worst in the club's history, with the club earning just 41 points; any other season this would almost certainly have seen Hull relegated to the Football Conference, but [[Brighton and Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton and Hove Albion]] and Doncaster Rovers both had unbelievably poor campaigns, and instead it was Doncaster who were relegated, with Hull recording their lowest ever finish in 22nd place. Lloyd stepped down as chairman that summer and was replaced by Nick Buchanan, while Hateley departed in November 1998 to be replaced by 34-year-old veteran player [[Warren Joyce]], who steered the club to safety after being anchored to the foot of the table \u2013 Hull City fans refer to this season as \"The Great Escape\". After this feat, Joyce was perhaps unlucky to be replaced in April 2000 by the experienced [[Brian Little (footballer)|Brian Little]].\n\nLittle breathed new life into Hull and managed to get good results out of the players, despite briefly being locked out of [[Boothferry Park]] by the bailiffs and with liquidation looking a real possibility. Hull qualified for the Division Three playoffs in [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301]], and lost in the semi finals. But things could have been much worse \u2013 at least the Hull City fans still had a football club to support. A boardroom takeover had eased the club's precarious financial situation and all fears of closure were banished \u2013 had the club been relegated to the Conference the previous season, it is extremely unlikely that this takeover would have taken place.\n\n===The Tigers on their way up===\n[[File:KC Stadium.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[KC Stadium|Kingston Communications Stadium]].]]\n[[File:Bothferry.jpg|thumb|200px|Recent picture of [[Boothferry Park]]]]\nNew Chairman [[Adam Pearson (sports executive)|Adam Pearson]] ploughed funds into the club, allowing Little to rebuild the team with the aim of immediate promotion. Hull occupied the Division Three promotion and playoff places for much of the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]] season, but Little was sacked two months before the end of the season and Hull slipped to 11th under his successor [[Jan M\u00f8lby]].\n\nHull began the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] season as most people's favourites for promotion from Division Three, but a terrible start to the season saw relegation look more likely than promotion and Molby was sacked in October as the Tigers languished fifth from bottom in the league.\n\n[[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]] was named as Hull's new manager and in December 2002, just weeks after his appointment, Hull relocated to the impressive new 25,400-seat [[KC Stadium|Kingston Communications Stadium]] after 56 years at [[Boothferry Park]]. After this move, Hull's attendances were some of the best in the division but their results were rarely this impressive and they were unable to finish above 13th place in the final table.\n\nHull's new stadium was one of the most impressive stadiums outside the Premier League<ref>{{cite web | title = Prestigious Award for The KC Stadium | url = \nhttp://www.kcstadium.co.uk/newsstory.asp?id=545 | accessdate = 27 September 2006 }}</ref> and it has helped influence an upturn in Hull's fortunes after a decade of misery. The two seasons which followed the opening of the new stadium were hugely successful. Hull were Division Three runners-up in [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]] and League One runners-up in [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] \u2013 back-to-back promotions \u2013 which took them into the Championship, the second tier of English football.\n\n[[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] was hardly the most exciting season in the history of Hull City football club; it was more a season of consolidation after two successive promotions. Hull finished 18th in the final table \u2013 a comfortable 10 points clear of relegation and their highest league finish for 16 years.\n\n==2006 and onwards==\n===Championship struggles===\n[[File:Hull-City-League-Finishes.png|thumb|right|Graph showing Hull City A.F.C's progress through the [[The Football League|English Football League]] System [[The Football League 1983-84|1983\u20131984]] to [[2012\u201313 Football League|2012\u201313]] (last position shown: 9 May 2013, 2nd in the [[Football League Championship]])]]\nThe successful stint at Hull City saw Peter Taylor's name linked with the [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] manager's job before it was given to [[Iain Dowie]]. On 13 June 2006, Peter Taylor left Hull to take up the job vacated by Dowie at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], a club at which he had enjoyed considerable success as a player. [[Phil Parkinson]] was confirmed as his replacement on 29 June 2006, with Hull paying Colchester (with whom Parkinson was still under contract) \u00a3400,000 compensation. [[Phil Brown (footballer born 1959)|Phil Brown]], who had recently departed his job as manager of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], joined the club as Parkinson's assistant.\n\nDefender [[Leon Cort]] became Hull's first million-pound player when he followed Peter Taylor to Crystal Palace for a fee of \u00a31,250,000. Parkinson wasted no time in spending the majority of this money on strengthening the City squad in readiness for the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] season.\n\nChairman Adam Pearson has stated his ambition to take Hull into the top flight for the first time in their history<ref>{{cite web | title = Hull in print | url = http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/hullinprint/archive/febmar2005/hull_city_stand_up.php | accessdate = 26 September 2006 }}</ref> \u2013 and he believed Phil Parkinson was the manager to do it.<ref>{{cite web | title = thepfa.co.uk | url = http://www.thepfa.co.uk/display.cfm?article=8723&type=1 | accessdate = 18 May 2014 |date= 14 July 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008144225/http://www.thepfa.co.uk/display.cfm?article=8723&type=1 | archivedate = 8 October 2007}}</ref> However, their dismal start to the 2006\u201307 season was hardly the form of a team attempting to gain promotion, and on 4 December 2006 Parkinson was sacked as manager with Hull in the relegation zone, despite having spent over \u00a32 million on players. Parkinson had achieved two notable firsts, under his management Hull City won for the first time ever on live television and also won a penalty shoot-out for the first time.\n\nPhil Brown was appointed as caretaker manager, and by 4 January 2007 Hull had moved out of the relegation zone and Brown was rewarded with a contract as their new manager until at least the end of the season.\n\nHull's Championship game against [[Sunderland AFC]] on 17 March 2007 at the [[Stadium of light]] saw an attendance of 38,448, a record to a Hull City game since they visited [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on 14 May 1977.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hull versus Sunderland: Match Report | url = http://www.hullcityafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10338~33911,00.html | accessdate = 18 May 2007 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120804031316/http://www.hullcityafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10338~33911,00.html | archive-date = 4 August 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nHull City all but secured their place in the Championship next season with a 1\u20130 victory away at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], on 28 April 2007.  This left them 3 points clear of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], the only side with a chance of overtaking them, but with a vastly superior goal difference this was only a mathematical possibility. This crucial goal was scored by [[Dean Windass]], who had rejoined his hometown club on loan from [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].\n\nBy 4 May, due to a lack of any realistic chance of them remaining in the [[Coca Cola Championship|Championship]], Leeds went into [[administration (insolvency)|administration]]<ref>{{cite news | title = Relegated Leeds in administration | url = \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/6625751.stm | accessdate = 4 May 2007  | work = BBC News |publisher = BBC| date = 4 May 2007}}</ref> and in doing so received the 10 point penalty such a move incurs. This deduction left Leeds at the bottom of the championship on 36 points, securing Hull's place in the Championship for the [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308]] season.\n\n[[File:Bristol City 0-1 Hull City.png|thumb|[[Wembley Stadium]] before the [[2008 Football League Championship playoff final|Championship play-off final]] against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]]]\n[[File:Hull City promotion celebration.jpg|thumb|right|Phil Brown and players celebrate on promotion to the Premier League in 2008]]\n\n===Championship success===\nThat summer saw Adam Pearson move on, declaring that he felt he had taken the club as far as he could and new investment would be required to progress further.

She later progressed to car racing in [[Skip Barber National Championship|Skip Barber]] and [[Formula Mazda]], winning 25 races and two series titles in the former in 2010. Funding issues caused Freiberg to drop out after four wins in 2011, but later drove for JDC Motorsports in the [[2012 Star Mazda Championship]], finishing ninth in points.\n\nFreiberg moved to sports car racing in 2013, entering the IMSA GT3 Cup Challenge before moving to the Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge in [[2014 Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge|2014]] and [[2015 Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge|2015]], earning two outright victories. She debuted in the [[2016 WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] in [[2016 WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|2016]], running a partial schedule in the [[Le Mans Prototype Challenge|Prototype Challenge]] and [[Grand tourer|Grand Touring Daytona]] (GTD) categories.

Frost's political affiliations were greatly influenced by [[Thomas Paine]] and [[William Cobbett]]. John and Sarah Frost worshipped at [[Baptist Church|Hope Baptist Chapel]], situated behind the present day Commercial Street and Skinner Street and their eight children were all baptised there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newport.ac.uk/research/ResearchGroups/swchir/Pages/swchir.aspx|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120715093842/http://www.newport.ac.uk/research/ResearchGroups/swchir/Pages/swchir.aspx|url-status=dead|title=University of Wales, Newport Chartism Day, Chartist Walk, 7 June 2008|archivedate=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrost's mother Sarah died early in his childhood and he was brought up by his grandparents. He was apprenticed as a bootmaker to his grandfather and left home at the age of sixteen to become a draper's apprentice and tailor, first in [[Cardiff]], then [[Bristol]] and later London. He returned to Newport in 1806 to start his own business, which became prosperous. He married a widow Mary Geach in 1812 and over the course of eleven years they had eight children. He was held in great esteem and affection for his appealing character and was commended for being \"studios, quiet and obedient.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Rud\u00e9|first=G.|title=Frost, John (1784\u20131877)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/frost-john-2071|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2019-01-02}}</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1821, Frost became embroiled in a dispute with a Newport solicitor, [[Thomas Prothero]], who was also [[Town Clerk]], over his uncle's [[Will (law)|will]]. In a letter Frost accused Prothero of being responsible for the former's exclusion from the will. Prothero sued for libel and Frost was ordered to pay \u00a31,000. Frost then accused Prothero of malpractice. Again, Prothero sued for libel and again won. In February 1823, Frost was imprisoned for six months and told in no uncertain terms that further accusations against Prothero would lead to a longer sentence.\n\nAfter his release Frost turned his anger against Prothero's friends and business partners, notably [[Charles Morgan, 1st Baron Tredegar|Sir Charles Morgan]] of [[Tredegar House|Tredegar House and Park]], a major Newport and [[south Wales]] landowner and industrialist. In a pamphlet of 1830, he accused Morgan of [[slumlord|mistreating]] his many tenants and advocated electoral reform as a means of bringing Morgan and others like him to account. An appreciation both of Frost's literary skill and his mounting exasperation can be gained easily from a consideration of his early letters, to Sir Charles Morgan himself amongst many others<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newportpast.com/nfs/strands/frost/letter2.htm|title=Newport Past - Strands - Letter to Sir Charles Morgan, Bart., Rowley Lascelles, William Phillips, Charles Morgan and others from John Frost|website=www.newportpast.com}}</ref> In the early 1830s Frost increasingly became a champion of [[universal suffrage]].\n\nEstablishing himself as a prominent Chartist, he was elected in 1835 as a town [[councillor]] for Newport and appointed as a [[magistrate]]. He also became an Improvement Commissioner and [[Poor Law]] Guardian and the following year became [[Mayor of Newport]]. His aggressive behaviour and election as a delegate to the Chartist Convention in 1838, however, further alienated his old enemies. He was duly forced to stand down as mayor the following year and the [[Home Secretary]] also revoked his appointment as magistrate.\n\n== Letter to Lord John Russell ==\nBecause of his continuing role within the Chartist Movement, [[Home Secretary]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Russell]] dismissed Frost from his position as [[Justice of the Peace]]. In response, while at a Chartist Convention in [[Pontypool]], Frost responded to Russell in a straightforward letter, containing the contemporary Chartist songs of Wales, which gave expression to the feelings and determination of the Welsh coal miners:\n\n:''Uphold those bold Comrades, who suffer for you,''\n:''Who nobly stand foremost, demanding your due,''\n:''Away with the timid \u2013'tis treason to fear\u2013''\n:''To surrender or falter, when danger is near,''\n:''For now that our leaders disdain to betray''\n:'' 'Tis base to desert them, or succour delay''\n\n:'' 'Tis time that the victims of labour and care''\n:''Should for reap what is labour's fair share''\n:'' 'Tis time that these voice in the councils be heard''\n:''The rather than pay for the law of the sword;''\n:''All power is ours, with a will of our own''\n:''We conquer, united \u2013 divided we groan.''\n\n:''Come hail brothers, hail the shrill sound of the horn''\n:''For ages deep wrongs have been hopelessly borne''\n:''Despair shall no longer our spirits dismay''\n:''Nor wither the arms when upraised for the fray;''\n:''The conflict for freedom is gathering nigh:''\n:''We live to secure it, or gloriously die.''\n\nNonetheless, while the desire amongst the Welsh to rebel was ever stronger, Frost himself still wished to postpone the date of an uprising. By the end of October, the Welsh Chartists were holding daily meetings in Monmouthshire in an attempt to force an armed rebellion. Records suggest that ultimately, finding himself unable to postpone the date of an organised uprising any longer and still doubting its success, Frost burst into tears. A thirty-member conference ultimately fixed the date for 3 November.\n\n== The Newport Rising ==\n[[File:John Frost plaque.jpg|thumb|John Frost commemorative plaque, [[High Street, Newport, Wales|High Street, Newport]]]]\n\nOn 3\u20134 November 1839 John Frost, together with [[William Jones (Chartist)|William Jones]] and [[Zephaniah Williams]], led a [[Chartism|Chartist]] march on the [[Westgate Hotel|Westgate Inn]] in Newport. The rationale for the set piece confrontation remains opaque, although it may have its origins in Frost's ambivalence towards the more violent attitudes of some of the Chartists, and the personal animus he bore towards some of the Newport establishment who were ensconced in the hotel along with 60 armed soldiers. The Chartist movement in south east Wales was chaotic in this period, after the arrest of [[Henry Vincent]], a leading agitator, who was imprisoned nearby in [[Monmouth]] gaol and the feelings of the workers were running extremely high, too high for Frost to reason with and control. One of his contemporaries, [[William Price (doctor)|William Price]] described Frost's stance at the time of the [[Newport Rising]] as being akin to \"putting a sword in my hand and a rope around my neck.\"\n\nThe march, which had been gathering momentum over the course of the whole weekend as Frost and his associates led the protestors down from the valley towns above Newport, numbered some 3,000 when it entered the town. According to the plan, three columns from three directions were to march upon Newport and take the town before dawn. The contingent starting from Blackwood was commanded by Frost, the detachment coming from Nantyglo by Williams and the main body of Pontypool by Jones. The three columns were to meet at Risca, but this did not come to pass; owing to a storm raging in the night, all of them arrived late, and the worst trouble was that the delay gave the Newport authorities ample time to get wind of what was afoot and make ready to confront the coming armed Chartists. Special constables were sworn in hastily, the known Chartists of Newport were arrested and shut up in the Westgate Hotel where the mayor held 30 soldiers in reserve. The Chartist troops led by Frost, proceeding to the hotel at 9:30&nbsp;am and demanding the surrender of the Chartist prisoners, advanced to the door. When the soldiers posted in the hotel started firing, ten to fifteen Chartists died instantly, about 50 were wounded. The bloody event was over in 20 minutes. The Chartists miners were in a very bad strategic position, and the firing took them by surprise. When they withdrew, they met the contingent of Williams and outside the town, the column of Jones. The times estimated that the strength of the Chartists army at 8,000 and [[Robert Gammage (Chartist)|Gammage]] at 20,000.\n\nOverall the battle of the Westgate lasted only about 25 minutes, but at its close some 22 people lay dead or dying and upwards of 50 had been injured. An eyewitness report spoke of one man, wounded with gunshot, lying on the ground, pleading for help until he died an hour later.\n\n== Reprisal by the local council ==\n\nThe reprisal by the local council followed immediately. The three commanders and 150 Chartists were arrested in a short time. The rumour spread that the Chartists insurgents intended to take Cardiff on 5 November. The Cardiff magistrates were seized with panic: in addition to mobilising the special constables they built up serious military defences and the crew of an American vessel lying at anchor in the port were also brought to the aid of the authorities. After Newport, however the Welsh Valleys were wrapped in quiet, and even the English manufacturing districts were paralysed for a short while.\n\n== Trial and sentencing ==\n[[File:Dramatisation of the trial of the Chartists at Shire Hall, Monmouth, including background information 1 of 7.ogv|thumb|Dramatisation of the trial of the Chartists at [[Shire Hall, Monmouth]], including background information]]\n\nA reward of \u00a3100 was offered for Frost's capture and he was arrested by solicitor and clerk Thomas Jones Phillips and charged with [[high treason]]. Early in 1840, along with Jones and Williams, was tried at [[Shire Hall, Monmouth|Monmouth's Shire Hall]].<ref>[http://www.newportpast.com/nmg/chartists/n06frost.htm John Frost], NewportPast.com, accessed October 2011.</ref> All three were found guilty and became the last men in Britain to be sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newportpast.com/nfs/strands/frost/part2.htm |title=Strands \u2013 John Frost |publisher=Newport Past |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> The Chartists stood up as one man for the Newport leaders under sentences of death. O'Connor, O'Brien, Harney Taylor and other Chartists leaders free on bail rose to speak on their behalf. O'Connor offered one week's income of the Northern Star for a Frost fund and retained one of the best lawyers of the time, [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]] as defence counsel. Following a huge public outcry, however, these sentences were discussed by the Cabinet and on 1 February the Prime Minister, [[Lord Melbourne]], announced that the executions would be commuted to [[Penal transportation|transportation for life]].\n\nOn reaching [[Van Diemen's Land]] (modern [[Tasmania]]), Frost was immediately sentenced to two years' hard labour for making a disparaging remark about [[Lord John Russell]], the Colonial Secretary. Frost was indentured to a local storekeeper, spent three years working as a clerk, before becoming a school teacher for eight years when he was granted his ticket of leave.\n\nChartists in Britain continued to campaign for the release of Frost. Thomas Duncombe pleaded Frost's case in the House of Commons but his attempt to secure a pardon in 1846 was unsuccessful. Duncombe refused to be defeated and in 1854 he persuaded the Prime Minister, [[Lord Aberdeen]], to grant Frost a pardon on the condition that he never returned to Britain. Rather than stay in Australia Frost immediately left for the United States, with his daughter, Catherine, who had joined him in Tasmania, and toured the country, organised by [[William Prowting Roberts]], lecturing on the unfairness of the British system of government.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:John Frost's headstone.jpg|thumb|upright|New 1980s headstone on John Frost's grave]]\nIn 1856, when the residency condition was lifted, Frost was given an unconditional pardon and he straightaway sailed for [[Bristol]]. He retired to [[Stapleton, Bristol|Stapleton]], near the city, but continued to publish articles advocating reform until his death there, aged 93, in 1877.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Annual summary, by J. Mason|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzoIAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA276|year=1877|pages=276}}</ref>\n\nFrost was buried in the churchyard of the [[Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund]], [[Horfield]], Bristol in accordance with his will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newportpast.com/nfs/strands/frost/will.htm|title=Newport Past - John Frost's Will|website=www.newportpast.com}}</ref> In the 1980s Richard Frame found Frost's lost grave site and organised for a new headstone to be created and erected on the site, with the aid of a grant from [[Newport City Council|Newport council]].

In response, while at a Chartist Convention in [[Pontypool]], Frost responded to Russell in a straightforward letter, containing the contemporary Chartist songs of Wales, which gave expression to the feelings and determination of the Welsh coal miners:\n\n:''Uphold those bold Comrades, who suffer for you,''\n:''Who nobly stand foremost, demanding your due,''\n:''Away with the timid \u2013'tis treason to fear\u2013''\n:''To surrender or falter, when danger is near,''\n:''For now that our leaders disdain to betray''\n:'' 'Tis base to desert them, or succour delay''\n\n:'' 'Tis time that the victims of labour and care''\n:''Should for reap what is labour's fair share''\n:'' 'Tis time that these voice in the councils be heard''\n:''The rather than pay for the law of the sword;''\n:''All power is ours, with a will of our own''\n:''We conquer, united \u2013 divided we groan.''\n\n:''Come hail brothers, hail the shrill sound of the horn''\n:''For ages deep wrongs have been hopelessly borne''\n:''Despair shall no longer our spirits dismay''\n:''Nor wither the arms when upraised for the fray;''\n:''The conflict for freedom is gathering nigh:''\n:''We live to secure it, or gloriously die.''\n\nNonetheless, while the desire amongst the Welsh to rebel was ever stronger, Frost himself still wished to postpone the date of an uprising. By the end of October, the Welsh Chartists were holding daily meetings in Monmouthshire in an attempt to force an armed rebellion. Records suggest that ultimately, finding himself unable to postpone the date of an organised uprising any longer and still doubting its success, Frost burst into tears. A thirty-member conference ultimately fixed the date for 3 November.\n\n== The Newport Rising ==\n[[File:John Frost plaque.jpg|thumb|John Frost commemorative plaque, [[High Street, Newport, Wales|High Street, Newport]]]]\n\nOn 3\u20134 November 1839 John Frost, together with [[William Jones (Chartist)|William Jones]] and [[Zephaniah Williams]], led a [[Chartism|Chartist]] march on the [[Westgate Hotel|Westgate Inn]] in Newport. The rationale for the set piece confrontation remains opaque, although it may have its origins in Frost's ambivalence towards the more violent attitudes of some of the Chartists, and the personal animus he bore towards some of the Newport establishment who were ensconced in the hotel along with 60 armed soldiers. The Chartist movement in south east Wales was chaotic in this period, after the arrest of [[Henry Vincent]], a leading agitator, who was imprisoned nearby in [[Monmouth]] gaol and the feelings of the workers were running extremely high, too high for Frost to reason with and control. One of his contemporaries, [[William Price (doctor)|William Price]] described Frost's stance at the time of the [[Newport Rising]] as being akin to \"putting a sword in my hand and a rope around my neck.\"\n\nThe march, which had been gathering momentum over the course of the whole weekend as Frost and his associates led the protestors down from the valley towns above Newport, numbered some 3,000 when it entered the town. According to the plan, three columns from three directions were to march upon Newport and take the town before dawn. The contingent starting from Blackwood was commanded by Frost, the detachment coming from Nantyglo by Williams and the main body of Pontypool by Jones. The three columns were to meet at Risca, but this did not come to pass; owing to a storm raging in the night, all of them arrived late, and the worst trouble was that the delay gave the Newport authorities ample time to get wind of what was afoot and make ready to confront the coming armed Chartists. Special constables were sworn in hastily, the known Chartists of Newport were arrested and shut up in the Westgate Hotel where the mayor held 30 soldiers in reserve. The Chartist troops led by Frost, proceeding to the hotel at 9:30&nbsp;am and demanding the surrender of the Chartist prisoners, advanced to the door. When the soldiers posted in the hotel started firing, ten to fifteen Charists died instantly, about 50 were wounded. The bloody event was over in 20 minutes. The Chartists miners were in a very bad strategic position, and the firing took them by surprise. When they withdrew, they met the contingent of Williams and outside the town, the column of Jones. The times estimated that the strength of the Chartists army at 8,000 and [[Robert Gammage (Chartist)|Gammage]] at 20,000.\n\nOverall the battle of the Westgate lasted only about 25 minutes, but at its close some 22 people lay dead or dying and upwards of 50 had been injured. An eyewitness report spoke of one man, wounded with gunshot, lying on the ground, pleading for help until he died an hour later.\n\n== Reprisal by the local council ==\n\nThe reprisal by the local council followed immediately. The three commanders and 150 Chartists were arrested in a short time. The rumour spread that the Chartists insurgents intended to take Cardiff on 5 November. The Cardiff magistrates were seized with panic: in addition to mobilising the special constables they built up serious military defences and the crew of an American vessel lying at anchor in the port were also brought to the aid of the authorities. After Newport, however the Welsh Valleys were wrapped in quiet, and even the English manufacturing districts were paralysed for a short while.\n\n== Trial and sentencing ==\n[[File:Dramatisation of the trial of the Chartists at Shire Hall, Monmouth, including background information 1 of 7.ogv|thumb|Dramatisation of the trial of the Chartists at [[Shire Hall, Monmouth]], including background information]]\n\nA reward of \u00a3100 was offered for Frost's capture and he was arrested by solicitor and clerk Thomas Jones Phillips and charged with [[high treason]]. Early in 1840, along with Jones and Williams, was tried at [[Shire Hall, Monmouth|Monmouth's Shire Hall]].<ref>[http://www.newportpast.com/nmg/chartists/n06frost.htm John Frost], NewportPast.com, accessed October 2011.</ref> All three were found guilty and became the last men in Britain to be sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newportpast.com/nfs/strands/frost/part2.htm |title=Strands \u2013 John Frost |publisher=Newport Past |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> The Chartists stood up as one man for the Newport leaders under sentences of death. O'Connor, O'Brien, Harney Taylor and other Chartists leaders free on bail rose to speak on their behalf. O'Connor offered one week's income of the Northern Star for a Frost fund and retained one of the best lawyers of the time, [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]] as defence counsel. Following a huge public outcry, however, these sentences were discussed by the Cabinet and on 1 February the Prime Minister, [[Lord Melbourne]], announced that the executions would be commuted to [[Penal transportation|transportation for life]].\n\nOn reaching [[Van Diemen's Land]] (modern [[Tasmania]]), Frost was immediately sentenced to two years' hard labour for making a disparaging remark about [[Lord John Russell]], the Colonial Secretary. Frost was indentured to a local storekeeper, spent three years working as a clerk, before becoming a school teacher for eight years when he was granted his ticket of leave.\n\nChartists in Britain continued to campaign for the release of Frost. Thomas Duncombe pleaded Frost's case in the House of Commons but his attempt to secure a pardon in 1846 was unsuccessful. Duncombe refused to be defeated and in 1854 he persuaded the Prime Minister, [[Lord Aberdeen]], to grant Frost a pardon on the condition that he never returned to Britain. Rather than stay in Australia Frost immediately left for the United States, with his daughter, Catherine, who had joined him in Tasmania, and toured the country, organised by [[William Prowting Roberts]], lecturing on the unfairness of the British system of government.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:John Frost's headstone.jpg|thumb|upright|New 1980s headstone on John Frost's grave]]\nIn 1856, when the residency condition was lifted, Frost was given an unconditional pardon and he straightaway sailed for [[Bristol]]. He retired to [[Stapleton, Bristol|Stapleton]], near the city, but continued to publish articles advocating reform until his death there, aged 93, in 1877.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Annual summary, by J.

They perform various operations on land as well as in the water. Until the late 1990s, all members of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) [[Special Air Service#Boat troop|Boat Troop]] were trained as commando [[frogman|frogmen]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1942===\nIn 1909 the British designer Commander Godfrey Herbert received a patent for a [[Human torpedo|manned torpedo]]. During [[World War I]], it was rejected by the [[War Office]] as impracticable and unsafe.\nInstead, in the inter-war period the Italian Navy successfully trained the special frogmen corp [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]] equipped with a new and powerful craft: a slow speed human torpedo (''SLC: siluro a lenta corsa'', best known as ''maiale''). Italian manned torpedoes were first used against Britain in 1941 when [[Decima Flottiglia MAS#Chronicle of operations|Italian commando frogmen]], some riding manned torpedoes, attacked British naval bases at [[Malta]], [[Gibraltar]] and [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|Alexandria]]. In the last operation six Italian frogmen rode three SLC's into the harbour and damaged the British battleships ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Valiant'', and the tanker ''Sagona'' (the six frogmen were then captured). After these operations had shown how powerful and effective this weapon was the [[Royal Navy]] was convinced to create their own programme. This was also fictionalised in the 1958 film ''[[The Silent Enemy (1958 film)|The Silent Enemy]]''.\n\n===1942===\n* April: The British Navy formed the \"Experimental Submarine Flotilla\", initially based at [[Portsmouth]]. It was led by Commanders G.M. Sladen and W.R. \"Tiny\" Fell, who began to train frogmen in secret. The Navy called their manned torpedoes [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariots]]. Many of their frogmen's breathing sets' oxygen cylinders were German pilots' oxygen cylinders recovered from shot-down German [[Luftwaffe]] planes. Those first breathing sets may have been modified [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus|Davis Submarine Escape Sets]]; their [[full face diving mask]]s were the type intended for the [[Siebe Gorman Salvus]]. But in later operations different designs were used, leading to a  full face diving mask with one big face window. One version had a flip-up single window for both eyes to let the user get [[binoculars]] to his eyes when on the surface. They used bulky thick diving suits called [[Sladen suit]]s.\n* 1942 June: The Experimental Submarine Flotilla moved to \"Port ZD\" (Port D) at [[Keose]] on [[Loch Erisort]] in Scotland.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120805050511/http://www.hebrideanconnections.com/Details.aspx?subjectid=38913&relationship=associated~with~location%E2%80%A6&caller=38002 Port D at hebrideanconnections.com]</ref> Their first powered manned torpedo was the [[Chariot manned torpedo|Mark I Chariot]]. Its hull was {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. It could make {{convert|2.9|kn|km/h|abbr=on|lk=in}} and could dive safely to a depth of {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The nose was a [[warhead]] with 600 pounds of [[high explosive]]. Training was hard. The men often suffered from [[oxygen poisoning]] because of the use of pure oxygen at depth, burst [[eardrum]]s and [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] trouble. The strangeness of the Chariots added to their problems. They were trained to ride and steer for a long time under water, and to then cut through harbour [[Torpedo net|defence nets]]. The hardest part was learning to work with the Chariots' warheads.\n* August: The first group of trained British charioteers moved to Base HHZ on [[Loch Cairnbawn]] in Scotland to train in deeper waters - better matching the Norwegian Fiords, and to simulate attacking bigger better-defended places. One died in training.\n* September: The Norwegian Navy officer [[Leif Larsen]] told the British Navy that he wanted to attack the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'' in [[Asenfjord]], a branch of [[Trondheim Fjord]] in [[Norway]].\n* Operation \"Title\":<ref>[http://www.underwatertrust.org.uk/the-operations/ Operations at underwatertrust.org.uk]</ref>\n** 26 October: The fishing boat ''Arthur'' operated by three Norwegians left Britain with seven British frogmen and two chariots hidden aboard.\n** 28 October: ''Arthur'' reached Norway's coast near [[Ed\u00f8ya]].\n** 30 October: ''Arthur'' unloaded the chariots and began to tow them to the target.\n** 31 October: A storm broke the fastening bolts of the chariots, which were lost. The attack was called off.\n** 1 November: The ''Arthur'' was scuttled at [[Sm\u00e5land, Inder\u00f8y|Breidvik]]. The ten members of the operation set off for Sweden in two groups. Nine reached Sweden; Germans captured one and later shot him as a spy.\n*** This operation was later portrayed in the 1955 war film, ''[[Above Us the Waves (film)|Above Us the Waves]]'', featuring [[John Mills]], which was based on Operation Title and the later ''[[Operation Source]]'' [[X class submarine|X-Craft]] midget submarine attacks on the ''Tirpitz''.\n* Late November: Britain sent 26 Chariots to [[Malta]], and they became part of the \"[[Tenth Submarine Flotilla]]\". Three submarines received containers on their decks to carry the Chariots.\n* Operation \"Principle\":\n** 28 November: The British submarine [[HMS P311|''P-311'']] carrying 3 Chariots and 10 Charioteers left  [[Marsamxett]] on [[Malta]] to attack [[La Maddalena]] on [[Sardinia]], but struck a [[naval mine]] near Sardinia and sank with all hands.\n** 30 November: The British submarines ''Thunderbolt'', ''Trooper'' and ''Unruffled'' (P46), left Malta carrying Chariots.\n* After December 17: First known British frogman use of [[swimfin]]s, rather than a [[Sladen suit]] and weighted boots riding a Chariot, was by [[Clearance diver#Britain|British Clearance Divers]].\n\n===1943===\n* Operation \"Principal\":<ref>[http://www.underwatertrust.org.uk/the-operations/ Operations at underwatertrust.org.uk]</ref>\n** 3 January: The submarines [[HMS Thunderbolt (N25)|HMS ''Thunderbolt'']] and [[HMS P311|HMS ''P311'']] carrying two chariots each and [[HMS Trooper (N91)|HMS ''Trooper'']] carrying three, with their respective crews, left to carry out this operation, the first by Britain involving the use of chariots. ''P311'' was scheduled to attack targets at La Maddalena, while the other two submarines headed for the coast of [[Sicily]] near [[Palermo]] in a [[Beaufort scale|Force 5 wind]].\n** One of the chariots which the ''Trooper'' carried was ridden by Sub-Lieutenant Rodney Dove and Leading Seaman Jimmy Freel. As it was launched, a big wave washed it over the submarine, causing the loss of its limpet mines and the gear to attach the warhead to a ship.\n** The chariots put mines on ships and patrol boats and sank some of them, but none of the mines exploded.\n** One chariot put its warhead on the Italian cruiser ''[[Italian cruiser Ulpio Traiano|Ulpio Traiano]]'' (under construction), and afterwards smaller explosives on four ships. ''Ulpio Traiano'' sank.\n** Dove's chariot (Chariot XVI) put its warhead on the Italian troop ship ''Viminale'' (formerly a [[Ocean liner|liner]]), by tying it to the [[sternpost]] with ropes, causing severe damage but not sinking it. While being towed from the harbour for repairs, it was torpedoed by a British submarine and damaged again. Later in the year, while en route for repairs for the second attack, it was sunk by American torpedo boats.\n** Because of bad weather two chariots did not reach the harbour.\n** All the chariots were lost; either scuttled, through equipment malfunction or human error. One charioteer died in the attack. The British submarine ''Unruffled'' recovered two others. Five had to land  and were taken prisoner. Two of these prisoners later escaped from guards in Rome and hid in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] until the Americans [[Battle of Monte Cassino|liberated Rome]] in 1944. Two others, involved in a quite separate operation (see below), escaped from guards in Libya. In the middle of [[Tripoli]] they found a British Army unit and were returned to England.\n** Dove ended up in a [[POW]] camp at [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] in Germany, and got home in May 1945. He received the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]. He died on 30 October 2005 aged 84.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/20/db2001.xml Sub-Lieutenant Rod Dove obituary]</ref>\n* This left eight charioteers with two Chariots on Malta.\n* 18 January-19: These two chariots were carried by submarines to attack ships that the Germans were going to use to block [[Tripoli]] harbour. The frogmen arrived too late and a [[blockship]] was sunk in the harbour mouth. None of the men or chariots returned to Malta.\n* January: At Loch Corrie and [[Loch Cairnbawn]] in Scotland more charioteers were being trained.\n* 16 April: Britain sent 14 new charioteers to Malta. In the days following they sent the new  Chariot Mark II, also called the \"Terry\". Its riders sat back to back. It could manage {{convert|4.5|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}. The warhead was {{convert|1100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[Torpex]] high explosive.\n* June: During this month, the British submarine {{HMS|Unseen|P51}} carried three chariots from Malta to Sicily. The divers [[Amphibious reconnaissance|surveyed]] {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} of coast, examining beaches to find dangers for armies who would be landing there later.\n* 11 June: The other British charioteers went to Loch Cairnbawn.\n* Late June: Britain sent six more charioteers to Malta, for an operation to attack [[Taranto]].\n* 25 June: Mussolini was replaced by [[Pietro Badoglio]] as the head of the Italian government''.'' As a result, the attack on [[Taranto]] was called off, and the British frogmen were all sent to [[Scotland]]. After this, there was only one British chariot attack in the Mediterranean.\n* July: At Loch Cairnbawn a charioteer died through an accident.\n* 20 September: The British midget submarines known as [[X-craft]] set out to attack the German [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and the [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] in [[K\u00e5fjord, Alta|K\u00e5fjord]] in [[Norway]]. The ''Scharnhorst'' was absent but the ''Tirpitz'' was damaged in the attack.\n* 24 September: Britain sent 4 chariots and 12 charioteers from their Scottish base to [[Lunna Voe]] in [[Shetland]] to train for operations among the Norwegian islands.\n* 14 October: A British [[Motor Torpedo Boat|torpedo boat]] carrying two chariots and four charioteers sailed from Lunna Voe to [[Tevik]] Bay in Norway and landed a man called Job to wait until a German ship came, but German aircraft found the torpedo boat and attacked. The torpedo boat had to flee to Britain badly damaged, and it landed at [[Dunbar]] in Scotland. Four days later another torpedo boat brought Job back to Shetland.\n* October or November: A British torpedo boat carrying two chariots and four charioteers went from Lunna Voe to Nordfjord in Norway and landed a man to wait until a German ship came. In two days no German ship came, the boat went back to Shetland.\n* 11 November: A British torpedo boat carrying two chariots and four charioteers sailed from [[Lunna Voe]] to Tevik Bay in Norway and landed a man to wait until a German ship came to [[Askvoll]] harbour. In two days no German ship came. It snowed, and they thought that Askvoll harbour would be blocked with ice. As the torpedo boat returned to Shetland it ditched the chariots because of bad weather, and it brought the charioteers back.\n* 31 October: ''On this day or earlier British and American forces entered [[Naples]].''\n* October or November: British frogmen went to [[Brindisi]] in Italy where they were combined with those [[Decima Flottiglia MAS|Italian frogmen]] who were in the Allied-controlled areas and those Italian frogmen who had been prisoners in Britain, as a single organization.\n\n===1944===\n:''For more information about the X-craft operations, see [[X class submarine]].''\n* 15 April: [[X-craft]] attacked the floating dock [[Laksev\u00e5g]] at [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] in [[Norway]], but sank a cargo ship by mistake instead.\n* May: 14 British charioteers were sent to [[Trincomalee]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n* In the run up to the [[Normandy Landings]] British Chariots were used to [[Amphibious reconnaissance|survey]] the seabed along Normandy's coast in preparation for the troop landings.\n* 2 June: After the Italians had left the [[Axis Powers|Axis]], the [[Maestrale class destroyer|Italian destroyer ''Grecale'']] sailed from [[Bastia]] in [[Corsica]] to [[La Spezia]] carrying three speedboats, and [[Decima Flottiglia MAS|Italian frogmen]] including [[Luigi Durand de la Penne]], and two British chariots, to attack the Italian cruisers ''[[Bolzano (ship)|Bolzano]]'' and ''[[Zara class cruiser#Gorizia|Gorizia]]'', which had been taken by the Germans after the Italian surrender. The ''Grecale'' launched the boats, which then carried the chariots and their charioteers and released them three miles from La Spezia harbour. One chariot began to leak from its float tank and had to be abandoned, but the others sank the ''Bolzano''.

They perform various operations on land as well as in the water. Until the late 1990s, all members of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) [[Special Air Service#Boat troop|Boat Troop]] were trained as commando [[frogman|frogmen]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1942===\nIn 1909 the British designer Commander Godfrey Herbert received a patent for a [[Human torpedo|manned torpedo]]. During [[World War I]], it was rejected by the [[War Office]] as impracticable and unsafe.\nInstead, in the inter-war period the Italian Navy successfully trained the special frogmen corp [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]] equipped with a new and powerful craft: a slow speed human torpedo (''SLC: siluro a lenta corsa'', best known as ''maiale''). Italian manned torpedoes were first used against Britain in 1941 when [[Decima Flottiglia MAS#Chronicle of operations|Italian commando frogmen]], some riding manned torpedoes, attacked British naval bases at [[Malta]], [[Gibraltar]] and [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|Alexandria]]. In the last operation six Italian frogmen rode three SLC's into the harbour and damaged the British battleships ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Valiant'', and the tanker ''Sagona'' (the six frogmen were then captured). After these operations had shown how powerful and effective this weapon was the [[Royal Navy]] was convinced to create their own programme. This was also fictionalised in the 1958 film ''[[The Silent Enemy (1958 film)|The Silent Enemy]]''.\n\n===1942===\n* April: The British Navy formed the \"Experimental Submarine Flotilla\", initially based at [[Portsmouth]]. It was led by Commanders G.M. Sladen and W.R. \"Tiny\" Fell, who began to train frogmen in secret. The Navy called their manned torpedoes [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariots]]. Many of their frogmen's breathing sets' oxygen cylinders were German pilots' oxygen cylinders recovered from shot-down German [[Luftwaffe]] planes. Those first breathing sets may have been modified [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus|Davis Submarine Escape Sets]]; their [[full face diving mask]]s were the type intended for the [[Siebe Gorman Salvus]]. But in later operations different designs were used, leading to a  full face diving mask with one big face window. One version had a flip-up single window for both eyes to let the user get [[binoculars]] to his eyes when on the surface. They used bulky thick diving suits called [[Sladen suit]]s.\n* 1942 June: The Experimental Submarine Flotilla moved to \"Port ZD\" (Port D) at [[Keose]] on [[Loch Erisort]] in Scotland.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120805050511/http://www.hebrideanconnections.com/Details.aspx?subjectid=38913&relationship=associated~with~location%E2%80%A6&caller=38002 Port D at hebrideanconnections.com]</ref> Their first powered manned torpedo was the [[Chariot manned torpedo|Mark I Chariot]]. Its hull was {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. It could make {{convert|2.9|kn|km/h|abbr=on|lk=in}} and could dive safely to a depth of {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The nose was a [[warhead]] with 600 pounds of [[high explosive]]. Training was hard. The men often suffered from [[oxygen poisoning]] because of the use of pure oxygen at depth, burst [[eardrum]]s and [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] trouble. The strangeness of the Chariots added to their problems. They were trained to ride and steer for a long time under water, and to then cut through harbour [[Torpedo net|defence nets]]. The hardest part was learning to work with the Chariots' warheads.\n* August: The first group of trained British charioteers moved to Base HHZ on [[Loch Cairnbawn]] in Scotland to train in deeper waters - better matching the Norwegian Fiords, and to simulate attacking bigger better-defended places. One died in training.\n* September: The Norwegian Navy officer [[Leif Larsen]] told the British Navy that he wanted to attack the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'' in [[Asenfjord]], a branch of [[Trondheim Fjord]] in [[Norway]].\n* Operation \"Title\":<ref>[http://www.underwatertrust.org.uk/the-operations/ Operations at underwatertrust.org.uk]</ref>\n** 26 October: The fishing boat ''Arthur'' operated by three Norwegians left Britain with seven British frogmen and two chariots hidden aboard.\n** 28 October: ''Arthur'' reached Norway's coast near [[Ed\u00f8ya]].\n** 30 October: ''Arthur'' unloaded the chariots and began to tow them to the target.\n** 31 October: A storm broke the fastening bolts of the chariots, which were lost. The attack was called off.\n** 1 November: The ''Arthur'' was scuttled at [[Sm\u00e5land, Inder\u00f8y|Breidvik]]. The ten members of the operation set off for Sweden in two groups. Nine reached Sweden; Germans captured one and later shot him as a spy.\n*** This operation was later portrayed in the 1955 war film, ''[[Above Us the Waves (film)|Above Us the Waves]]'', featuring [[John Mills]], which was based on Operation Title and the later ''[[Operation Source]]'' [[X class submarine|X-Craft]] midget submarine attacks on the ''Tirpitz''.\n* Late November: Britain sent 26 Chariots to [[Malta]], and they became part of the \"[[Tenth Submarine Flotilla]]\". Three submarines received containers on their decks to carry the Chariots.\n* Operation \"Principle\":\n** 28 November: The British submarine [[HMS P311|''P-311'']] carrying 3 Chariots and 10 Charioteers left  [[Marsamxett]] on [[Malta]] to attack [[La Maddalena]] on [[Sardinia]], but struck a [[naval mine]] near Sardinia and sank with all hands.\n** 30 November: The British submarines ''Thunderbolt'', ''Trooper'' and ''Unruffled'' (P46), left Malta carrying Chariots.\n* After December 17: First known British frogman use of [[swimfin]]s, rather than a [[Sladen suit]] and weighted boots riding a Chariot, was by [[Clearance diver#Britain|British Clearance Divers]].\n\n===1943===\n* Operation \"Principal\":<ref>[http://www.underwatertrust.org.uk/the-operations/ Operations at underwatertrust.org.uk]</ref>\n** 3 January: The submarines [[HMS Thunderbolt (N25)|HMS ''Thunderbolt'']] and [[HMS P311|HMS ''P311'']] carrying two chariots each and [[HMS Trooper (N91)|HMS ''Trooper'']] carrying three, with their respective crews, left to carry out this operation, the first by Britain involving the use of chariots. ''P311'' was scheduled to attack targets at La Maddalena, while the other two submarines headed for the coast of [[Sicily]] near [[Palermo]] in a [[Beaufort scale|Force 5 wind]].\n** One of the chariots which the ''Trooper'' carried was ridden by Sub-Lieutenant Rodney Dove and Leading Seaman Jimmy Freel. As it was launched, a big wave washed it over the submarine, causing the loss of its limpet mines and the gear to attach the warhead to a ship.\n** The chariots put mines on ships and patrol boats and sank some of them, but none of the mines exploded.\n** One chariot put its warhead on the Italian cruiser ''[[Italian cruiser Ulpio Traiano|Ulpio Traiano]]'' (under construction), and afterwards smaller explosives on four ships. ''Ulpio Traiano'' sank.\n** Dove's chariot (Chariot XVI) put its warhead on the Italian troop ship ''Viminale'' (formerly a [[Ocean liner|liner]]), by tying it to the [[sternpost]] with ropes, causing severe damage but not sinking it. While being towed from the harbour for repairs, it was torpedoed by a British submarine and damaged again. Later in the year, while en route for repairs for the second attack, it was sunk by American torpedo boats.\n** Because of bad weather two chariots did not reach the harbour.\n** All the chariots were lost; either scuttled, through equipment malfunction or human error. One charioteer died in the attack. The British submarine ''Unruffled'' recovered two others. Five had to land  and were taken prisoner. Two of these prisoners later escaped from guards in Rome and hid in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] until the Americans [[Battle of Monte Cassino|liberated Rome]] in 1944. Two others, involved in a quite separate operation (see below), escaped from guards in Libya. In the middle of [[Tripoli]] they found a British Army unit and were returned to England.\n** Dove ended up in a [[POW]] camp at [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] in Germany, and got home in May 1945. He received the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]. He died on 30 October 2005 aged 84.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/20/db2001.xml Sub-Lieutenant Rod Dove obituary]</ref>\n* This left eight charioteers with two Chariots on Malta.\n* 18 January-19: These two chariots were carried by submarines to attack ships that the Germans were going to use to block [[Tripoli]] harbour. The frogmen arrived too late and a [[blockship]] was sunk in the harbour mouth. None of the men or chariots returned to Malta.\n* January: At Loch Corrie and [[Loch Cairnbawn]] in Scotland more charioteers were being trained.\n* 16 April: Britain sent 14 new charioteers to Malta. In the days following they sent the new  Chariot Mark II, also called the \"Terry\". Its riders sat back to back. It could manage {{convert|4.5|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}. The warhead was {{convert|1100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[Torpex]] high explosive.\n* June: During this month, the British submarine {{HMS|Unseen|P51}} carried three chariots from Malta to Sicily. The divers [[Amphibious reconnaissance|surveyed]] {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} of coast, examining beaches to find dangers for armies who would be landing there later.\n* 11 June: The other British charioteers went to Loch Cairnbawn.\n* Late June: Britain sent six more charioteers to Malta, for an operation to attack [[Taranto]].\n* 25 June: Mussolini was replaced by [[Pietro Badoglio]] as the head of the Italian government''.'' As a result, the attack on [[Taranto]] was called off, and the British frogmen were all sent to [[Scotland]]. After this, there was only one British chariot attack in the Mediterranean.\n* July: At Loch Cairnbawn a charioteer died through an accident.\n* 20 September: The British midget submarines known as [[X-craft]] set out to attack the German [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and the [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] in [[K\u00e5fjord, Alta|K\u00e5fjord]] in [[Norway]]. The ''Scharnhorst'' was absent but the ''Tirpitz'' was damaged in the attack.\n* 24 September: Britain sent 4 chariots and 12 charioteers from their Scottish base to [[Lunna Voe]] in [[Shetland]] to train for operations among the Norwegian islands.\n* 14 October: A British [[Motor Torpedo Boat|torpedo boat]] carrying two chariots and four charioteers sailed from Lunna Voe to [[Tevik]] Bay in Norway and landed a man called Job to wait until a German ship came, but German aircraft found the torpedo boat and attacked. The torpedo boat had to flee to Britain badly damaged, and it landed at [[Dunbar]] in Scotland. Four days later another torpedo boat brought Job back to Shetland.\n* October or November: A British torpedo boat carrying two chariots and four charioteers went from Lunna Voe to Nordfjord in Norway and landed a man to wait until a German ship came. In two days no German ship came, the boat went back to Shetland.\n* 11 November: A British torpedo boat carrying two chariots and four charioteers sailed from [[Lunna Voe]] to Tevik Bay in Norway and landed a man to wait until a German ship came to [[Askvoll]] harbour. In two days no German ship came. It snowed, and they thought that Askvoll harbour would be blocked with ice. As the torpedo boat returned to Shetland it ditched the chariots because of bad weather, and it brought the charioteers back.\n* 31 October: ''On this day or earlier British and American forces entered [[Naples]].''\n* October or November: British frogmen went to [[Brindisi]] in Italy where they were combined with those [[Decima Flottiglia MAS|Italian frogmen]] who were in the Allied-controlled areas and those Italian frogmen who had been prisoners in Britain, as a single organization.\n\n===1944===\n:''For more information about the X-craft operations, see [[X class submarine]].''\n* 15 April: [[X-craft]] attacked the floating dock [[Laksev\u00e5g]] at [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] in [[Norway]], but sank a cargo ship by mistake instead.\n* May: 14 British charioteers were sent to [[Trincomalee]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n* In the run up to the [[Normandy Landings]] British Chariots were used to [[Amphibious reconnaissance|survey]] the seabed along Normandy's coast in preparation for the troop landings.\n* 2 June: After the Italians had left the [[Axis Powers|Axis]], the [[Maestrale class destroyer|Italian destroyer ''Grecale'']] sailed from [[Bastia]] in [[Corsica]] to [[La Spezia]] carrying three speedboats, and [[Decima Flottiglia MAS|Italian frogmen]] including [[Luigi Durand de la Penne]], and two British chariots, to attack the Italian cruisers ''[[Bolzano (ship)|Bolzano]]'' and ''[[Zara class cruiser#Gorizia|Gorizia]]'', which had been taken by the Germans after the Italian surrender. The ''Grecale'' launched the boats, which then carried the chariots and their charioteers and released them three miles from La Spezia harbour. One chariot began to leak from its float tank and had to be abandoned, but the others sank the ''Bolzano''. This thwarted a German plan to sink the ''Bolzano'' and the ''Gorizia'' where they would block the harbour entrance.

Competence may be differentiated between ''natural competence'', a genetically specified ability of [[bacteria]] which is thought to occur under natural conditions as well as in the laboratory, and ''induced'' or ''artificial competence'', which arises when cells in laboratory cultures are treated to make them transiently permeable to DNA.  Competence allows for rapid adaptation and DNA repair of the cell. This article primarily deals with natural competence in bacteria, although information about artificial competence is also provided.\n\n==History==\nNatural competence was discovered by [[Frederick Griffith]] in 1928, when he showed that a preparation of killed cells of a pathogenic bacterium contained something that could transform related non-pathogenic cells into the pathogenic type.  In 1944 [[Oswald Avery]], [[Colin Munro MacLeod|Colin MacLeod]], and [[Maclyn McCarty]] demonstrated that this 'transforming factor' was pure [[DNA]]<ref name=\"pmid19871359\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Avery OT, Macleod CM, McCarty M |title=STUDIES ON THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE INDUCING TRANSFORMATION OF PNEUMOCOCCAL TYPES : INDUCTION OF TRANSFORMATION BY A DESOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID FRACTION ISOLATED FROM PNEUMOCOCCUS TYPE III |journal=J. Exp. Med. |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=137\u201358 |year=1944 |pmid=19871359 |pmc=2135445 |doi= 10.1084/jem.79.2.137|url=}}</ref> \n.  This was the first compelling evidence that DNA carries the genetic information of the cell.\n\nSince then, natural competence has been studied in a number of different bacteria, particularly ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' (Griffith's \"pneumococcus\"), ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' and members of the ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' genus.  Areas of active research include the mechanisms of DNA transport, the regulation of competence in different bacteria, and the evolutionary function of competence.\n\n==Mechanisms of DNA uptake==\nIn the laboratory, DNA is provided by the researcher, often as a genetically engineered fragment or [[plasmid]].  During uptake, DNA is transported across the [[cell membrane|cell membrane(s)]], and the [[cell wall]] if one is present.  Once the DNA is inside the cell it may be degraded to [[nucleotides]], which are reused for [[DNA synthesis|DNA replication]] and other [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions.  Alternatively it may be [[genetic recombination|recombined]] into the cell's [[genome]] by its [[DNA repair]] enzymes.  If this recombination changes the cell's [[genotype]] the cell is said to have been transformed.

Specifically with respect to bacterial transformation, competence requires the high cost of a global protein synthesis switch, with, for example, more than 16 genes that are switched on only during competence of ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson S, Cline RT, Tettelin H, Sharov V, Morrison DA |title= Gene expression analysis of the Streptococcus pneumoniae competence regulons by use of DNA microarrays |journal= J.

Thus, there is always a high cost in protein expression without, in general, an increase in diversity.  Other differences between competence and sex have been considered in models of the evolution of genes causing competence; these models found that competence's postulated recombinational benefits were even more elusive than those of sex.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Redfield R|title=Is sex with dead cells ever better than no sex at all? |journal= Genetics|volume= 119 |pages= 213\u201321|year= 1988 |pmid=3396864 |issue=1 |pmc=1203342}}</ref>\n\n===Hypothesis of DNA as food===\n\nThe second hypothesis, DNA as food, relies on the fact that cells that take up DNA inevitably acquire the nucleotides the DNA consists of, and, because nucleotides are needed for DNA and  [[RNA]] synthesis and are expensive to synthesize, these may make a significant contribution to the cell's energy budget.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Redfield RJ |title=Do bacteria have sex? |journal=Nat.

In principle the cost of nuclease production and the uncertainty of nucleotide recovery must be balanced against the energy needed to synthesize the uptake machinery and to pull DNA in. Other important factors are the likelihoods that nucleases and competent cells will encounter DNA molecules, the relative inefficiencies of nucleotide uptake from the environment and from the periplasm (where one strand is degraded by competent cells), and the advantage of producing ready-to-use nucleotide monophosphates from the other strand in the cytoplasm.  Another complicating factor is the self-bias of the DNA uptake systems of species in the family ''Pasteurellaceae'' and the genus ''Neisseria'', which could reflect either selection for recombination or for mechanistically efficient uptake.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maughan H|title=Bacterial DNA uptake sequences can accumulate by molecular drive alone |journal=Genetics|volume=186 |pages=613\u201327|year=2010 |pmc=2954483 |doi=10.1534/genetics.110.119438 |pmid=20628039 |issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Redfield R, Schrag M, Dead A |title=The evolution of bacterial transformation: sex with poor relations. |journal=Genetics|volume=146 |pages=27\u201338|year=1997 |pmid=9135998 |issue=1 |pmc=1207942}}</ref>\n\n===Hypothesis of repair of DNA damage===\nIn bacteria, the problem of DNA damage is most pronounced during periods of stress, particularly oxidative stress, that occur during crowding or starvation conditions.  Under such conditions there is often only a single chromosome present.  The finding that some bacteria induce competence under such stress conditions, supports the third hypothesis, that transformation exists to permit DNA repair.  In experimental tests, bacterial cells exposed to agents damaging their DNA, and then undergoing transformation, survived better than cells exposed to DNA damage that did not undergo transformation (Hoelzer and Michod, 1991).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoelzer MA, Michod RE |title=DNA repair and the evolution of transformation in ''Bacillus subtilis''.
