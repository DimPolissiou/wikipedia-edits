The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the Lok Sabha after these elections owing to widespread disenchantment over the rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis.

Following the 1967 elections, Gandhi gradually began to move towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders over several issues. Chief among them was her decision to support [[V. V.

The other was the announcement by the prime minister of Bank nationalisation without consulting the finance minister, Morarji Desai. These steps culminated in party president [[S.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government.

He was known as '''Ashot the Great''' (\u0531\u0577\u0578\u057f \u0544\u0565\u056e) and was the son of Smbat VIII the Confessor and was a member of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nAshot was born around 820 to [[Smbat VIII Bagratuni]] and his wife Hripsime. Smbat VIII was ''[[sparapet]]'' (supreme commander) and the son of [[Ashot Msaker]], the Prince of Armenia (r. 806\u2013826).{{sfn|Toumanoff|1990|p=121}} Ashot also had a brother named Abas. The family, the [[Bagratuni dynasty|Bagratunis]], was one of the most powerful in the kingdom, along with the [[Artsruni]]. Both families struggled for power through warfare against [[Arab]] invaders. The kingdom was later taken over by Armenians who overthrew the [[Arminiya|Arab government]]. Smbat VIII was exiled to [[Samarra]], where he later died.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|pp=367, 378}} Ashot continued to live in his father's quarters,{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} located around the city of [[Bagaran (ancient city)|Bagaran]].{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=234}} He was married to Katranide.{{sfn|Donab\u00e9dian|Thierry|1987|p=124}} Like Smbat before him, Ashot was named ''sparapet'' in 856 by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]].{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=372}}\n\n===Prince of Princes of Armenia===\n[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|The Arab-Byzantine frontier zone during Ashot's lifetime.]]\nDuring the [[Arab-Byzantine Wars]], much of Ashot's territory was located near the main site of conflict. In 862, Ashot was recognized as the Prince of Princes of Armenia by Abbasid Caliph [[al-Musta'in]], who saw this as a measure of protection against the local autonomous [[emir]]s.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=237}}{{sfn|Cowe|2000|p=78}} This title essentially granted Ashot the status of ''de facto'' king{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2004|p=147}} and placed him at a similar level of power as the emirs,{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=237}} but did not allow Ashot to have administrative rule over the kingdom.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=373}} Ashot kept this status during the reigns of Abbasid Caliphs [[al-Mu'tazz]] (866\u2013869), [[al-Muhtadi]] (869\u2013870) and [[al-Mu'tamid]] (870\u2013892).\n\nAshot annexed [[Bagrevand]] in 862, shortly after the death of the ruling [[Mamikonian|Mamikonian Dynasty's]] head, Grigor Mamikonian.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} Ashot mediated between Grigor-Derenik Artsruni and Gurgen Artsruni, cousins and members of the Artsruni family who controlled [[Vaspurakan]].{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} Ashot then captured Grigor-Derenik{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=374}} and reduced the size of the cantons around [[Van, Turkey|Van]].{{sfn|Thierry|2007|p=275}} Ashot released Grigor-Derenik to avoid further conflict with the Artsruni family. Ashot later arranged a marriage between his daughter, Sophie, and Grigor-Derenik, in order to reconcile.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=375}} Ashot also strengthened relations with the [[Siunia Dynasty]] by arranging another marriage between his second daughter, Mariam, with Prince Vasak Gabur IV.{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=272}} These familial ties helped strengthen relations between Ashot's sons and the surrounding dynasties.\n\nAshot used this support to wage war against the emirs. He began by defeating the [[Kaysites]] of [[Manazkert]] in 863,{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=376}} with the help of his brother and [[sparapet]], Abas Bagratuni.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} In 877, he began to fight against the emir of [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]] alongside his [[ostikan]]; however, failure of this ostikan led to his replacement.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=385}} The new ostikan made a secret peace treaty with the emir and betrayed Ashot. Ashot learned of the conspiracy against him and sent Abas to disarm the ostikan in [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]; Abas escorted him to the border under Ashot's orders in order to prevent the Caliph's retaliation.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=386}} Ashot defeated the emirs of Barda and Manazkert, laying siege to the latter city in 884; however, the siege was ceased prematurely. The siege caused Grigor-Derenik to worry about the borders of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]], which was under Grigor-Derenik's control.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=387}} Ashot gained control of the [[Gugark]] and [[Utik]] regions{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=391}} as early as 860.{{sfn|Dorfman-Lazarev|2004|p=65}}\n\nAshot's reach also extended to [[Principality of Iberia|Caucasian Iberia]], where some of his Bagratuni family had settled in the late 7th century. There, around 875, he formed an alliance with [[Bagrat I of Iberia]], his step-brother, against Bagrat's brother, [[Guaram Mampali]].{{sfn|Toumanoff|1990|pp=121, 129}} Together, Ashot and Bagrat defeated Guaram. In 881, Ashot formed an alliance with [[David I of Iberia]] and [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]], Bagrat's son and grandson, respectively, to defeat Guaram's son, [[Nasra of Tao-Klarjeti]].{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=392}}\n\n===King of Armenia===\n[[File:Caucasus, 884-962.gif|thumb|300px|The borders of Bagratid Armenia from 884 to 962.]]\nSeveral contemporary prominent Armenians, including Grigor-Derenik Vaspurakan, insisted on Ashot's coronation.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=394}} Ashot was crowned [[King of Armenia]] through the consent of Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] in 885 to prevent intrusion into Armenian territory by [[Basil I]], a [[Byzantine emperor]] of Armenian origin.{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=244}} As a result of his coronation, Ashot restored the Armenian monarchy and became the founder of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Kingdom of Armenia]], also known as [[Bagratid Armenia]], named after the contemporary rule of the Bagratunis. The Bagratid kingdom lasted until 1045, when it was annexed into the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Cheynet|2006|p=41}}\n\nDespite his status, Ashot remained a subordinate to the Caliph and was put under the supervision of the emirs of Azerbaijan.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=238}} Every Armenian prince fell under Ashot's authority (though in the effect of [[primus inter pares]]{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=239}}).

He was known as '''Ashot the Great''' (\u0531\u0577\u0578\u057f \u0544\u0565\u056e) and was the son of Smbat VIII the Confessor and was a member of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nAshot was born around 820 to [[Smbat VIII Bagratuni]] and his wife Hripsime. Smbat VIII was ''[[sparapet]]'' (supreme commander) and the son of [[Ashot Msaker]], the Prince of Armenia (r. 806\u2013826).{{sfn|Toumanoff|1990|p=121}} Ashot also had a brother named Abas. The family, the [[Bagratuni dynasty|Bagratunis]], was one of the most powerful in the kingdom, along with the [[Artsruni]]. Both families struggled for power through warfare against [[Arab]] invaders. The kingdom was later taken over by Armenians who overthrew the [[Arminiya|Arab government]]. Smbat VIII was exiled to [[Samarra]], where he later died.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|pp=367, 378}} Ashot continued to live in his father's quarters,{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} located around the city of [[Bagaran (ancient city)|Bagaran]].{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=234}} He was married to Katranide.{{sfn|Donab\u00e9dian|Thierry|1987|p=124}} Like Smbat before him, Ashot was named ''sparapet'' in 856 by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]].{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=372}}\n\n===Prince of Princes of Armenia===\n[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|The Arab-Byzantine frontier zone during Ashot's lifetime.]]\nDuring the [[Arab-Byzantine Wars]], much of Ashot's territory was located near the main site of conflict. In 862, Ashot was recognized as the Prince of Princes of Armenia by Abbasid Caliph [[al-Musta'in]], who saw this as a measure of protection against the local autonomous [[emir]]s.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=237}}{{sfn|Cowe|2000|p=78}} This title essentially granted Ashot the status of ''de facto'' king{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2004|p=147}} and placed him at a similar level of power as the emirs,{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=237}} but did not allow Ashot to have administrative rule over the kingdom.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=373}} Ashot kept this status during the reigns of Abbasid Caliphs [[al-Mu'tazz]] (866\u2013869), [[al-Muhtadi]] (869\u2013870) and [[al-Mu'tamid]] (870\u2013892).\n\nAshot annexed [[Bagrevand]] in 862, shortly after the death of the ruling [[Mamikonian|Mamikonian Dynasty's]] head, Grigor Mamikonian.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} Ashot mediated between Grigor-Derenik Artsruni and Gurgen Artsruni, cousins and members of the Artsruni family who controlled [[Vaspurakan]].{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} Ashot then captured Grigor-Derenik{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=374}} and reduced the size of the cantons around [[Van, Turkey|Van]].{{sfn|Thierry|2007|p=275}} Ashot released Grigor-Derenik to avoid further conflict with the Artsruni family. Ashot later arranged a marriage between his daughter, Sophie, and Grigor-Derenik, in order to reconcile.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=375}} Ashot also strengthened relations with the [[Siunia Dynasty]] by arranging another marriage between his second daughter, Mariam, with Prince Vasak Gabur IV.{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=272}} These familial ties helped strengthen relations between Ashot's sons and the surrounding dynasties.\n\nAshot used this support to wage war against the emirs. He began by defeating the [[Kaysites]] of [[Manazkert]] in 863,{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=376}} with the help of his brother and [[sparapet]], Abas Bagratuni.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=236}} In 877, he began to fight against the emir of [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]] alongside his [[ostikan]]; however, failure of this ostikan led to his replacement.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=385}} The new ostikan made a secret peace treaty with the emir and betrayed Ashot. Ashot learned of the conspiracy against him and sent Abas to disarm the ostikan in [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]; Abas escorted him to the border under Ashot's orders in order to prevent the Caliph's retaliation.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=386}} Ashot defeated the emirs of Barda and Manazkert, laying siege to the latter city in 884; however, the siege was ceased prematurely. The siege caused Grigor-Derenik to worry about the borders of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]], which was under Grigor-Derenik's control.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=387}} Ashot gained control of the [[Gugark]] and [[Utik]] regions{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=391}} as early as 860.{{sfn|Dorfman-Lazarev|2004|p=65}}\n\nAshot's reach also extended to [[Principality of Iberia|Caucasian Iberia]], where some of his Bagratuni family had settled in the late 7th century. There, around 875, he formed an alliance with [[Bagrat I of Iberia]], his step-brother, against Bagrat's brother, [[Guaram Mampali]].{{sfn|Toumanoff|1990|pp=121, 129}} Together, Ashot and Bagrat defeated Guaram. In 881, Ashot formed an alliance with [[David I of Iberia]] and [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]], Bagrat's son and grandson, respectively, to defeat Guaram's son, [[Nasra of Tao-Klarjeti]].{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=392}}\n\n===King of Armenia===\n[[File:Caucasus, 884-962.gif|thumb|300px|The borders of Bagratid Armenia from 884 to 962.]]\nSeveral contemporary prominent Armenians, including Grigor-Derenik Vaspurakan, insisted on Ashot's coronation.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=394}} Ashot was crowned [[King of Armenia]] through the consent of Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] in 885 to prevent intrusion into Armenian territory by [[Basil I]], a [[Byzantine emperor]] of Armenian origin.{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=244}} As a result of his coronation, Ashot restored the Armenian monarchy and became the founder of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Kingdom of Armenia]], also known as [[Bagratid Armenia]], named after the contemporary rule of the Bagratunis. The Bagratid kingdom lasted until 1045, when it was annexed into the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Cheynet|2006|p=41}}\n\nDespite his status, Ashot remained a subordinate to the Caliph and was put under the supervision of the emirs of Azerbaijan.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=238}} Every Armenian prince fell under Ashot's authority (though in the effect of [[primus inter pares]]{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=239}}). Dvin and the emirates of Manazkert and [[Erzurum|Karin]] (and, according to [[Constantine VII]], [[Khoy]] and [[Salmas]]){{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}} also fell under Ashot's control, despite the local governments' unwillingness to accept.{{sfn|Martin-Hisard|2007|p=238}} The emir of Manazkert was in this way defeated and was forced to submit to Ashot's rule in 885.{{sfn|Thierry|2007|pp=291-292}}\n\nAshot's influence continued not only in Armenia but also in Iberia. After the death on Grigor-Derenik Artsruni in 887, Ashot placed his own grandson (and Grigor-Derenik's son), Ashot-Sargis Artsruni, under the rule of relative Gagik Aboumerwan Artsruni.{{sfn|Grousset|2008|p=389}} In 887 and 888, Ashot supported his nephew [[Adarnase IV of Iberia]] in overthrowing [[Bagrat I of Abkhazia]].{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}} Also in 888, Ashot sent his brother Abas to [[Kars]] to stop a rebellion led by Prince Sahak-Mleh of [[Vanand]].{{sfn|Garso\u00efan|2007|p=245}}\n\nAshot travelled to [[Gugark]] to stop another rebellion, fighting alongside his son and heir, [[Smbat I of Armenia|Smbat I]]. He died in 890.

Microwaves are evidently carcinogenic, especially on long term exposure. Many studies regarding adverse health effects of electromagnetic radiation (especially microwave radiation from mobile phones) on humans, are not conclusive and haven't been pursued in adequate and accurate enough manner and depth, (e.g. simulated real-life conditions of frequency interference and alteration on the test subjects) to guarantee or assume any granted safety, for currently deployed and existing wireless systems(e.g. Wifi, 4G, LTE, 5G). Other relevant research hasn't been recognized due to regulations of arbitrary statistical-significance guidelines, not fully meeting the hallmark of about 95%, and therefore being dismissed as \"no findings at all\". Such crucial errors of scientific evaluation in research and differentiation of the magnitude of observed effects, caused by an overextended statistical bureaucracy, prove to be problematic for developing a better understanding for such electromagnetic phenomena. Another significant factor is the conflict of interest, resulting between independent researchers, investigating those effects, and the profit oriented, telecommunications industry, which also happens to very often sponsor studies in their interest, therefore rendering the results questionable. Microwave non-ionizing radiation (mobile phone radiation) evokes a metabolic response in the brain, through the specific absorption rate (SAR), measured in W/kg. Children, undergoing physical development, are more afflictable to electromagnetic radiation, due to comparatively lower thickness of the cranium, protecting the brain from exterior sources. EM radiation also shows to have compromising effects on melatonin levels in the human brain, resulting in a systemic degradation of the immune system, disrupted sleep patterns and alterations of the circadian rhythm, accounting for the symptoms of electromagnetic sensitivity. Melatonin, being the very powerful antioxidant and oncostatic agent that it is, protects the body against cancer, through eradication of free radicals. In an affected state, with low levels of melatonin and a resultingly suppressed immune system, from EM radiation, cancer risk increases and leaves one generally more prone to disease of all kind. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saroka|first=Kevin S.|last2=Vares|first2=David E.|last3=Persinger|first3=Michael A.|date=2016-01-19|title=Similar Spectral Power Densities Within the Schumann Resonance and a Large Population of Quantitative Electroencephalographic Profiles: Supportive Evidence for Koenig and Pobachenko|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4718669/|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0146595|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4718669|pmid=26785376}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simk\u00f3|first=Myrtill|last2=Mattsson|first2=Mats-Olof|date=2019-9|title=5G Wireless Communication and Health Effects\u2014A Pragmatic Review Based on Available Studies Regarding 6 to 100 GHz|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=16|issue=18|doi=10.3390/ijerph16183406|issn=1661-7827|pmc=6765906|pmid=31540320}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewczuk|first=Bogdan|last2=Redlarski|first2=Grzegorz|last3=\u017bak|first3=Arkadiusz|last4=Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska|first4=Natalia|last5=Przybylska-Gornowicz|first5=Barbara|last6=Krawczuk|first6=Marek|date=2014|title=Influence of Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields on the Circadian System: Current Stage of Knowledge|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4130204/|journal=BioMed Research International|volume=2014|doi=10.1155/2014/169459|issn=2314-6133|pmc=4130204|pmid=25136557}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosen|first=L.

Microwaves are evidently carcinogenic, especially on long term exposure. Many studies regarding adverse health effects of electromagnetic radiation (especially microwave radiation from mobile phones) on humans, are not conclusive and haven't been pursued in adequate and accurate enough manner and depth, (e.g. simulated real-life conditions of frequency interference and alteration on the test subjects) to guarantee or assume any granted safety, for currently deployed and existing wireless systems(e.g. Wifi, 4G, LTE, 5G). Other relevant research hasn't been recognized due to regulations of arbitrary statistical-significance guidelines, not fully meeting the hallmark of about 95%, and therefore being dismissed as \"no findings at all\". Such crucial errors of scientific evaluation in research and differentiation of the magnitude of observed effects, caused by an overextended statistical bureaucracy, prove to be problematic for developing a better understanding for such electromagnetic phenomena. Another significant factor is the conflict of interest, resulting between independent researchers, investigating those effects, and the profit oriented, telecommunications industry, which also happens to very often sponsor studies in their interest, therefore rendering the results questionable. Microwave non-ionizing radiation (mobile phone radiation) evokes a metabolic response in the brain, through the specific absorption rate (SAR), measured in W/kg. Children, undergoing physical development, are more afflictable to electromagnetic radiation, due to comparatively lower thickness of the cranium, protecting the brain from exterior sources. EM radiation also shows to have compromising effects on melatonin levels in the human brain, resulting in a systemic degradation of the immune system, disrupted sleep patterns and alterations of the circadian rhythm, accounting for the symptoms of electromagnetic sensitivity. Melatonin, being the very powerful antioxidant and oncostatic agent that it is, protects the body against cancer, through eradication of free radicals.

[[Glassblower's cataract]] is an example of a heat injury that damages the [[anterior lens]] capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for prolonged periods over many years.<ref name=Fry_et_al2004>{{cite book | title=Clinical Practice in Small Incision Cataract Surgery | editor1-first=Luther L. | editor1-last=Fry | editor2-first=Ashok | editor2-last=Garg | editor3-first=Francisco | editor3-last=Guit\u00e9rrez-Camona | editor4-first=Suresh K. | editor4-last=Pandey | editor5-first=Geoffrey | editor5-last=Tabin | publisher=CRC Press | year=2004 | isbn=0203311825 | page=79 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gswq6FvdU7oC&pg=PA79 }}</ref>\n \nAnother important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of [[arc welding]], infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does.  This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Visible light===\n[[Photic retinopathy]] is damage to the [[Macula of retina|macular area of the eye's retina]] that results from prolonged exposure to sunlight, particularly with [[Mydriasis|dilated pupil]]s. This can happen, for example, while observing a [[solar eclipse]] without suitable eye protection. The Sun's radiation creates a photochemical reaction that can result in [[Dazzle reflex|visual dazzling]] and a [[scotoma]]. The initial lesions and [[edema]] will disappear after several weeks, but may leave behind a permanent reduction in visual acuity.<ref name=Sullivan2001>{{cite book | title=Clinical Environmental Health and Toxic Exposures | editor1-first=John Burke | editor1-last=Sullivan | editor2-first=Gary R. | editor2-last=Krieger | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year=2001 | isbn=9780683080278 | page=275 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUSgdZUGr4C&pg=PA275 }}</ref>\n\nModerate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the [[retina]] of the eye, or even the [[skin]].

This effect is a response of the skin called [[erythema]], which is caused by a sufficient strong dose of [[UV-B]]. The Sun's UV output is divided into [[UV-A]] and UV-B: solar UV-A flux is 100 times that of UV-B, but the erythema response is 1,000 times higher for UV-B.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} This exposure can increase at higher altitudes and when reflected by snow, ice, or sand.
