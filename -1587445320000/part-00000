The story revolves around Sister Shannon Masters, a [[Joan of Arc]]-like heroine of the Order of the Cruciform Sword, a fictional [[Military order (society)|military order]] of [[Warrior]] [[Nun]]s and [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Priest]]s in service of the [[Catholic Church]]. The order was created in 1066 when a [[Valkyrie]] named Auria renounced her pagan ways and turned to [[Jesus Christ]] for salvation; ever since then, Auria, now Areala, has chosen an avatar every generation to carry on the mission. In modern times, this has grown to a world-spanning organization in the service of the Catholic Church with the current Areala, Sister Shannon Masters, as the best and brightest of all. With her friends beside her, Sister Shannon has led the forces of good against those of evil, ever serving the Lord with faith and humility. Appearing on and off for 20 years since her first appearance, Warrior Nun Areala is creator Ben Dunn's favorite character.<ref name=\"Warrior Nun Areala Vol. 2 #6\">''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nWith strong continuity telling storylines in a serialized manner, Sister Shannon Masters' cast, powers, and trappings have slowly expanded throughout the years thus creating an entire society within the Church. There has been some controversy regarding the character from both religious and non-religious people, the former for appropriating Catholic imagery and the latter for how the comic book unapologetically shows the Catholic Church as a force for good. While there have been other comic books emphasizing Christianity and [[superheroes]] utilizing Christian imagery, ''Warrior Nun Areala'' is unique in that it is a mainstream, albeit [[Alternative comics|independent comic]] that approaches its subject matter with respect and takes its idea seriously.\n\nWebsite Comicsutra states \"That's what makes Warrior Nun Areala so special. At its core, it portrays people who have unshakable faith in God and their religion. ...Its affection for nuns is also evident\u2014and sometimes returned. One real nun asked about Warrior Nun Areala noted that she and her colleagues give poor children college prep-level educations\u2014that they are superheroes. Amen, sister.\"<ref name=\"comicsutra.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsutra.com/cs/stripped/strippedv1i30.htm |title=Cheap? Exploitive? Hypocritical? Nun of the Above |publisher=Comicsutra.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Creation===\nThe creation of ''Areala'' has its roots in the [http://www.fraternitenotredame.com/Pages/EN_Pages/IndexEN.html Fraternite Notre Dame], or the Fraternity of Our Lady, a [[traditionalist Catholic]] organization. In 1991, a chapter was established in New York City's [[East Harlem]] in order to found a [[soup kitchen]]. It was in New York that Sister Marie Chantel who had been a [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Judo]] learned [[Taekwondo]] under a [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] martial arts master. Her fellow nuns, including the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]], also learned self-defense hearing that the neighborhoods were dangerous, though they insist that their martial arts training is mostly for sport and that they have had no problems with the surrounding neighborhoods. Their story was ultimately picked up and reported by ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>\"Black Belts and Blessings for East Harlem Nuns, ''[[New York Times]]'', by David Gonzales. February 2, 1994</ref>\n\nBen Dunn, who attended [[Catholic school]]s, read that article and was inspired. He states that \"Other superheroes, you never know what their faith is. Batman or Spider-Man or Superman, they do all these great things, but what do they believe in?\"<ref>\"Super sister fights evil\", ''[[USA Today]]'', by Leslie Miller. May 5, 1997. Actually, according to [http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/comic_book_religion.html The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Characters] Batman is a lapsed Catholic or [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]; Superman, a [[Christ figure]], is a [[Methodism#Methodism in the United States|Methodist]]; and Spider-Man seems to be a [[Protestant]] of unidentified denomination. According to this \"Spider-Man was one of 33 characters who were identified as the most religious superheroes in the Marvel Universe.\"</ref> While not a true Christian comic book as its emphasis is not on directly calling readers to repentance or propagating the faith but on [[superheroes]] utilizing Christian imagery and on Christian-based [[speculative fiction]], ''Warrior Nun Areala'' takes its idea very seriously.\n\nPart of this was due to the power Ben Dunn sees the Vatican as possessing. He at one point wrote that it may not speak of itself as being a world power but it is. That is because despite being the smallest country on Earth the Vatican's influence on world affairs is disproportionately immense by virtue of its moral and spiritual authority as the headquarters of Earth's largest religion. With over a billion adherents, a headquarters that is a [[Sovereign nation]], [[Pope|a leader]] that is a world leader, it ''is'' a force in the world. Thus, it was only a small step to grant the (fictionalized) church also has a military force that would serve as Heaven's proxy if demons were to attack. In further explaining the concept, he added that \"If [[Hell]] were an actual physical place with physical manifestations then they would be subject to some of the physical laws of nature would they not? Of course that would mean [[Heaven]] too would be physical place. While this may not be so in our world it certainly is so in WNA's world. Therefore, things would progress differently. To the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] in WNA's world 'thou shalt kick [[Satan]]'s ass!'.\"<ref>Letter column ''Warrior Nun Areala: Rituals #4''</ref> However, in creating the character, Dunn sought to distinguish Areala from scantily clad [[Bad Girl Art|bad girl]] antiheroines with which she might be confused. He was also desirous of creating a true hero, not an anti-hero. \"I made it a very strong point that she doesn't kill people, only demons\", and that \"She believes everybody &ndash; no matter how bad they've been &ndash; can be saved.\"<ref>[http://www.smallbytes.net/~bobkat/nun.html \"Super sister fights evil,\"] ''[[USA Today]]'' (May 5, 1997).</ref>\n\n===Publication===\nThe first appearance of the character Sister Shannon Masters was in ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 1 #1. Beginning in December 1994 and ending in April 1995, it was a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] that established the world of Areala, introduced several key characters, and served as her origin story. She was shown having just completed her training in a time when there had been no demonic activity for years and the Warrior Nuns were in danger of being disbanded. Even so, she was assigned to New York City and saw that Satan's minions of Earth were planning an assault on Heaven. She foiled their plans of course.\n\nThis was then followed by other ''Warrior Nun Areala'' mini series some written by Ben Dunn and some not, such as ''Rituals'' (1995\u20131996), ''Scorpio Rose'' (1996\u20131997), and ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2. Published every two months, they expanded the world and provided more information and depth concerning the characters. There were also [[One-shot (comics)|one shots]] such as [[Intercompany crossover|crossovers]] with heroines of other companies such as [[Glory (comics)|Glory]] and [[Avengelyne]]. At the time there were other mini-series set in the Warrior Nun Areala universe that were not directly related to Sister Shannon Masters but instead widened the scope of the fictional world. Focusing on other Nuns of her order from past, present, and future; they include but are not limited to ''Crimson Nun'' (1997), ''Warrior Nun Frenzy'' (1998), and ''Warrior Nun Dei'' (1997\u20131999), respectively. There was also an ongoing [[anthology]] series, ''Warrior Nun Black and White'' that focused on the whole of the Warrior Nun universe.\n\nIt was not until 1999 that Sister Shannon gained her own series. The miniseries ''Areala: Angel of War'' which detailed the original Areala and ''Warrior Nun Areala: Resurrection'' led up to it. Running from 1999 to 2001, it was simply titled ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 3. It concerned an ongoing threat by Areala's most persistent foe, Helga, as she tried to destroy the Vatican itself. In a battle that put to the test, the promise that the gates of Hell would not prevail. Though it climaxed seemingly with the death of Sister Shannon, she later returned and appeared in another ongoing series, ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 4 though this was written mostly by Craig Babiar.\n\nThe current series is ''Warrior Nun Lazarus''.\n\nSister Shannon will be appearing in an upcoming ''War of the Independents'' tie-in issue, centering on her and Sean Koury's ''Bounty Hunter'' character, as well as appearing in ''War of the Independents'' itself.  She can be seen on the cover of issue one, as well as in the group shot at the end of the issue.\n\n==Sister Shannon Masters==\nSister Shannon Masters, the Warrior Nun Areala, given the serial nature of her adventures has developed a wide circle of heroes around her making them into a family she otherwise would not have. That is seen in her foster sister joining the Warrior Nuns and her looking at her fellow Sisters as just that, sisters. Initially uncertain of herself she has developed as a character though she has never lost her idealism or her love of God and Jesus Christ. She has formed strong bonds of affection with her surrogate sisters, Sasuki, Mary, and Sarah; her surrogate son, Jason; her parent figures, Father Gomez and Mother Superion; and with them has fought a wide variety of foes such as Demon Foster, Julius Salvius, and Helga.\n\nHer story begins in 1066 when the original Sister Areala was met by the angel who would become her namesake. An American, Shannon Masters was born after 1959 and was orphaned at the age of four where on she was left at the steps of the Our Lady of the Virgin Mary [[convent]].<ref>Since that would make Sister Shannon 48 years old as of 2007 and since the series employs a [[floating timeline]]--for example, ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2 #6 was published in May 1998, but refers to events happening in ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 1 # 2 published in April 1995 as having happened a year ago--, her birth date will likely be [[retconned]] at a future date. Even so, there are still potential time discrepancies concerning her childhood. In one story, ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2 #6, she said she was lived in Japan until she was eleven but later it was revealed in ''Warrior Nun Areala: Resurrection'' #3 that she stayed at the St. Thomas Academy for sixteen years which would have made her twenty seven, hardly the teenager both words and pictures portray her as.</ref> She stayed there until she was adopted by the Yoma family of Japan. She lived in Japan with the Yomas until she was eleven years old but after showing exceptional academic and athletic abilities, she was chosen for the Silver Cross Program and was raised to be a Warrior Nun at upper New York State's Saint Thomas Academy. Thus her experience at the [[Orphan Schools|orphan school]] was more of a [[boarding school]].\n\nGrowing up at the Saint Thomas Academy, she wrestled with feelings of self-worth over how she had been orphaned. However, she over came those doubts and found a purpose for her life in her service to the Church as did her adopted sister, Sasuki Yoma of Japan. It was while she trained there under a young Mother Superion, then Sister Katherine, that she first met and befriended the future Sister Sarah, her best friend; Father David Crowe, her future love interest; and Shotgun Mary. It was at this time that she visited Quagmire High School, also called Ninja High School, though at the time she yet to take her vows and was referred to simply as Shannon and not Sister Shannon. After this, received final training from Mother Superion her at [[Vatican City]].\n\nThough a [[rookie]], Sister Shannon training was completed and she reported to the New York City [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|archdiocese]]. There, she patrolled two sectors from her assigned [[parish]], Saint Thomas Church in [[Manhattan]] on the grounds that she was assigned to an area where there had not been demonic activity since the Purge of 1985. Replacing Sisters Sanguine and Hannah<!-- While it is not worth inserting a link, [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] is also the name of a Biblical character -->, she soon saw a sustained surge in New York City's demonic activity after her arrival. (A stock situation in comic books wherein the [[supervillain]]s can appear only after a hero shows up.) She soon received her calling from the first Sister Areala after she was nearly killed in a battle with minions of [[Satanist]] and [[arms dealer]] Julius Salvius. On recognizing her as the Chosen One of that generation, the original Sister Areala gave Sister Shannon her name and awakened her latent power. It was made official when ''the'' Areala confirmed her as her avatar after a battle against the avatar of mad valkyrie Helga.\n\n==Supporting cast==\n{{Main|Characters in Warrior Nun Areala}}\nSister Shannon Masters, the Warrior Nun Areala, given the serial nature of her adventures has developed a wide circle of heroes around her making them into a family she otherwise would not have. That is seen in her foster sister joining the Warrior Nuns and her looking at her fellow Sisters as just that, sisters. Initially uncertain of herself she has developed as a character though she has never lost her idealism or her love of God and Jesus Christ. She has formed strong bonds of affection with her surrogate sisters, Sasuki, Mary, and Sarah; her surrogate son, Jason; her parent figures, Father Gomez and Mother Superion; and with them has fought a wide variety of foes such as Demon Foster, Julius Salvius, and Helga.\n\n==Heaven and Hell in ''Warrior Nun Areala''==\nAs might be expected, the crux of the story is the battle between good and evil.\nGod created space-time along with all reality an indefinite time ago and created out of love for those who would be His children. Ruling from Heaven on high and \"working in mysterious ways\", He guides Creation to the ultimate good of His creations. All beings are His creations and He looks at them all as His children. Indeed, His Christian worshippers refer to Him as Father. However, not all wish to accept His love and even reject Him and His goodness altogether. In the beginning, one of His creations, Lucifer rejected God's wisdom and, thinking that he could be a superior leader than his omniscient Creator, sought to take the throne of Heaven. Lucifer's War of Heaven and rebellion against God and His goodness led to the creation of evil. To delilver His children whom He so loved of evil, He sent Jesus, His only begotten Son and even sacrificed His life so that whoever believes in Him should not die but have eternal life. Afterwards, God made His will known through the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church that His Son established on Saint Peter.\n\n===Catholic Corps===\nThus, Areala shows a \"cold war\" has been fought between Heaven and Hell, with human souls of at stake. At the moment, Heaven is content to leave Hell alone as long as it does not transgress its boundaries or harm the innocent. When that does happen, the Church's Catholic Corps is the means by which Heaven fights a proxy war. While preceded by earlier miracle workers and martial saints, the Corps has its roots in 1066 with the creation of the first Areala and later in 1212 when Pope Gregory VII authorized a new order to train those blessed by God with power to either use them as miracle workers or as warriors. The Corps is the most visible sign of the Church and by extension God on Earth.\n\n==Controversy==\nWhile ''Warrior Nun Areala'' in its various incarnations has had its loyal followers, there has been controversy over its use of religious imagery. Some, including comic book fans (including Areala fans) have charged Antarctic press with \"[[nunsploitation]]\" in the character of Areala. There were times when Ben Dunn himself considered changing the name to something more \"palatable.\"<ref>[http://www.apforums.com/view_topic.php?id=289&forum_id=16 Warrior Nun Areala. Is it the title?] Antarctic Press Forums. Accessed 6/01/07</ref>\n\nIn his review for [[Daisuke Moriyama]]'s similarly themed [[anime]]/[[manga]] ''[[Chrono Crusade]]'', manga critic Mike Toole likens such ideas to \"the old standby of nuns with guns\" and makes explicit comparisons between it and Dunn's comic book. Toole states that Dunn's idea of a \"woman who slays monsters in a [[Religious habit|habit]] and... a [[bikini]]\" is novel but that it \"just doesn't make any goddamned sense.\" Quite differently, he writes that Moriyama is more restrained and while his fully clothed heroine nun [[Rosette Christopher]] may be somewhat comical that she and her fellow characters \"otherwise seem vaguely authentic.\"<ref>[http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=503 Anime Jump] Vaguely authentic, it incorporates [[Marian apparitions]], the [[Three Secrets of Fatima]], the [[1981 Pope John Paul II assassination attempt]], the [[stigmata]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and other things explaining them in depth with mini-documentaries called [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Azmaria%27s+Extra+Classes|Azmaria's Extra Classes].\n\nCatholic blogger and comic reviewer D.G.D. Davidson follows a similar train of thought. He acknowledges that Catholicism with its \"[[Catholic imagination|imagination]]\", large size, and vast hierarchy lends itself more easily to for use in such things, though he admits the overuse.\n\n{{quote|For one thing, we've already got the monster-fighting equipment: as I write this, I have a full bottle of [[holy water]] at my elbow in case the [[vampires]] or [[zombies]] show up, I have several [[icon]]s nearby, and I can lay my hands on a [[rosary]] or [[crucifix]] pretty quickly if the situation calls for it. It's also easier to imagine the Catholic Church with a supercomputer and demon-tracking satellite network than it is to imagine, say, the [[Conservative Baptist Association]].}}\n\nHowever, he nonetheless criticises ''Areala'' as being mere gimmickry and for being disrespectful of women with the early costumes. He also criticises to for not having done sufficient research and on not taking advantage of Catholicism's rich history.\n\n{{quote|The story could have been significantly cooler if Dunn did a little research. Apparently, Warrior Nuns govern certain \"sectors\" in which they are responsible for keeping demonic activity in check. If Dunn referred to [[dioceses]], [[deaneries]], and [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parishes]] instead of sectors, I might have believed he knew what he was talking about. A few references to [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|actual Catholic practices]] or maybe a little use of [[Politics of the Vatican City|Vatican politics]] might have enriched the story immensely. For example, instead of creating an oddly named order of Magic Priests, Dunn could have assigned magic powers to our [[Exorcist#Catholicism|exorcists]], who already have less spectacular demon-fighting rituals.}} Please see [http://holyheroes.blogspot.com/2007/10/warrior-nun-areala.html Holy Heroes: Warrior Nun Areala]</ref>\n\nDunn made it a point to focus on escapist storytelling and after Antarctic Press' failed attempts at a \"serious version\" backfired this was reinforced. The man they chose for this was [[Barry Lyga]] who wrote the second series. He wrote of that experience, \"The original three series were very tongue-in-cheek... Unfortunately, the audience for the book liked the more tongue-in-cheek approach, and by mutual agreement, I left the series after six issues.\" Indeed, Lyga's willful decision to reject monster attacks out of hand and focus of \"realism\" led to less-than-successful issues that were never even completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://barrylyga.com/new/comicBooks.html |title=Other Work |publisher=Barrylyga.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>\n\nDespite this, some people{{who|date=November 2019}} wrote in commenting on and requesting stories dealing with current issues in the Catholic Church such as the [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases|abuse cases]]. As a result, Lyga's second series featured Sister Shannon asking herself if she should protect the Church from a man seeking revenge for alleged church involvement with the [[Ratlines (history)|ratlines]]. One person noted that the characters' \"complaints about the magic priests having more money\u2014even though the warrior nuns, not the magic priests, are on the front lines against demons\u2014ring true after seeing the stories last year [source quoted in 1997] about people \"adopting\" elderly nuns to help a convent stay afloat or articles about burial costs for nuns being subsidized by the state.\"<ref name=\"comicsutra.com\"/> Or, when one of Sister Shannon's fellow nuns asked why they could not receive the Magic Priests' training in the supernatural, she replied that it was for the same reason the Church forbids the [[ordination of women]],<ref>''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> something that causes controversy within the fictional Church of ''Warrior Nun Areala'' as it does in the real Church.\n\n===Catholic criticism===\nSuch sentiments also extend to members of the real Roman Catholic Church.<ref name=Current>[[Rick Klaw|Klaw, Rick]].

In July\u2013August 1997, the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|US Catholic League]] stated that \"it does object to the comic strip characters that appear in the Warrior Nuns comic strip, a product of Antarctic Press.\"<ref>[http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst/1997_catalyst/797catalyst.htm] Catholic League-NUNOGRAPHY \"NINETIES STYLE\"</ref> In another example Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a speaker for [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] stated that Areala's costume is \"offensive. The habit is something sacred.\"<ref>\"Super sister fights evil\". ''[[USA Today]]'', May 5, 1997</ref> That is seen in early issues with how the upper half of the muscled, [[buxom]] Sister Shannon's ultra-low cut battle habit would show [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] and/or show perpetually erect [[nipple]]s through the cloth while the lower half consists of a [[loin cloth]], if that much in other Warrior Nuns. It was a seeming contradiction in terms with how a nun's habit is meant to hide the body in order to discourage [[lust]]. In fact, Ben Dunn wrote that the reason he did that was that \"nipples sell\". Regardless, Dunn stated the loin cloth is \"for mobility\" and that is the official [[Continuity (fiction)|in-continuity]] explanation that the modest Sister Shannon herself unapologetically espoused when confronted on her seeming lack of modesty.<ref name=\"Warrior Nun Areala Vol. 2 #6\" /> (This was resolved by having Sister Shannon's superior assign the Warrior Nuns new more modest battle habits that covered their [[breasts]] in the second series to replace the previous ones that she felt were \"a bit too revealing!\"<ref>''Warrior Nun Areala: Rituals'' #5</ref>) Dunn himself ultimately did say that perhaps \"I think I did go a little overboard\" in the earlier issues.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OC&p_theme=oc&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF40BCD8BBC21F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM \"COMICS' `BAD GIRLS' BUSTIN' LOOSE PUBLISHING: The swashbuckling vixens are adding some excitement to a sluggish industry beset with dwindling sales\"] by Kelly Baron ''[[Orange County Register]]'' August 9, 1996</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Never even read the book.jpg|200px|thumb|Areala's at the [[Big Apple Convention]].]] -->\nHowever, this was addressed in an issue that bordered on breaking the [[fourth wall]] where Sister Shannon took her ward Jason to the [[Big Apple Con]] [[comics convention]] where he bought a copy of \"Battle Nun [[Areola]]\".

However, in addition to the standard look, there was also an anime look based on a failed attempt by Ben Dunn and Antarctic Press to make a ''Warrior Nun Areala'' [[Anime-influenced animation|American anime]] in 1994. There were high hopes and would have been partially fan funded with contributors donating $125 in exchange for their names in the credits. However, that never panned out with the money necessary for [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], the hoped for animation studio, to make the series being about $200,000. In 2001 another attempt was made by Darkain Arts though that too failed. The anime was never completed and only the [[opening credits]] are known to exist; they were created by the animators of the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]].<ref>[http://www.apforums.com/view_topic.php?id=81&forum_id=10 Antarctic Pres Forums] accessed 6/1/07</ref> The opening credits can be seen on [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=warrior+nun+areala YouTube].\n\n===Television===\nOn September 28, 2018, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had approved a [[Warrior Nun (TV series)|television adaptation]] of the comic book series, with a series order for a first season.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-adds-three-new-series-to-thrilling-sci-fi-drama-slate-including-the-i-land-october-faction-and-warrior-nun|title=Netflix adds three new series to thrilling sci-fi drama slate including THE I-LAND, OCTOBER FACTION and WARRIOR NUN|work=Netflix Media Center|date=September 28, 2018|accessdate=March 19, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Current /> The series was created by [[Simon Barry]], who is credited as an executive producer alongside [[Stephen Hegyes]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\"/> On March 18, 2019, it was announced that Alba Baptista, Toya Turner, [[Tristan Ulloa]], [[Thekla Reuten]], Kristina Tonteri-Young, Lorena Andrea and Emilio Sakraya would star in the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Petski|first=Denise|url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/warrior-nun-alba-baptista-star-toya-turner-tristan-ulloa-cast-netflix-drama-series-1202577231/|title=\u2018Warrior Nun\u2019: Alba Baptista To Star, Toya Turner, Tristan Ulloa, Thekla Reuten Among Six More Cast In Netflix Series|date=March 18, 2019|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* Antarctic Press has claimed{{cn|date=November 2019}} that ''Warrior Nun Areala'' launched a mini-genre, with other comic books, manga, films, and television show imitating its central conceit:\n** ''[[Avengelyne]]'' ([[Maximum Press]])\u2014Although she never served the Catholic Church in an official capacity as it had no anti-demonic program, she was befriended by Catholic priest Father Clifton and stayed with him at St. Augustine Church\n** The Inquisition from ''[[Magdalena (comics)|Magdalena]]'' ([[Top Cow Productions]])\n** The Department of Inquisition and the Department of Foreign Affairs' milder AX from ''[[Trinity Blood]]'' ([[Kadokawa Shoten]])\n** The Order of Magdela from ''[[Chrono Crusade]]'' ([[Kadokawa Shoten]])\n** [[Iscariot (Hellsing)|Iscariot XIII]] from ''[[Hellsing]]'' ([[Sh\u014dnen Gah\u014dsha]])\n** The Burial Agency from ''[[Tsukihime]]'' ([[Type-Moon]])\n** Solomon from ''[[Witch Hunter Robin]]'' ([[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]])\n** The Holy Order from ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'' ([[Universal Studios]])\n\n* [[Montague Summers]]\u2014a real and very eccentric self-professed clerical monster hunter, who research shows was never a Catholic priest as he claimed to be\n* Father [[Gabriele Amorth]] of the [[International Association of Exorcists]]\u2014the Vatican's real chief clerical monster hunter\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.antarctic-press.com/html/version_01/index.php Antarctic Press]\n* [http://www.antarctic-press.com/html/version_01/store.php?id=Warrior+Nun&display_all=1 Warrior Nun Areala at Antarctic Press]\n* [http://www.sjgames.com/in-nomine/articles/new/GMs/resources/warriornuns.html Description at In Nomine]\n* [http://www.comicsutra.com/cs/stripped/strippedv1i30.htm Cheap?

The story revolves around Sister Shannon Masters, a [[Joan of Arc]]-like heroine of the Order of the Cruciform Sword, a fictional [[Military order (society)|military order]] of [[Warrior]] [[Nun]]s and [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Priest]]s in service of the [[Catholic Church]]. The order was created in 1066 when a [[Valkyrie]] named Auria renounced her pagan ways and turned to [[Jesus Christ]] for salvation; ever since then, Auria, now Areala, has chosen an avatar every generation to carry on the mission. In modern times, this has grown to a world-spanning organization in the service of the Catholic Church with the current Areala, Sister Shannon Masters, as the best and brightest of all. With her friends beside her, Sister Shannon has led the forces of good against those of evil, ever serving the Lord with faith and humility. Appearing on and off for 20 years since her first appearance, Warrior Nun Areala is creator Ben Dunn's favorite character.<ref name=\"Warrior Nun Areala Vol. 2 #6\">''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nWith strong continuity telling storylines in a serialized manner, Sister Shannon Masters' cast, powers, and trappings have slowly expanded throughout the years thus creating an entire society within the Church. There has been some controversy regarding the character from both religious and non-religious people, the former for appropriating Catholic imagery and the latter for how the comic book unapologetically shows the Catholic Church as a force for good. While there have been other comic books emphasizing Christianity and [[superheroes]] utilizing Christian imagery, ''Warrior Nun Areala'' is unique in that it is a mainstream, albeit [[Alternative comics|independent comic]] that approaches its subject matter with respect and takes its idea seriously.\n\nWebsite Comicsutra states \"That's what makes Warrior Nun Areala so special. At its core, it portrays people who have unshakable faith in God and their religion. .. Its affection for nuns is also evident \u2014 and sometimes returned. One real nun asked about Warrior Nun Areala noted that she and her colleagues give poor children college prep-level educations \u2014 that they are superheroes. Amen, sister.\"<ref name=\"comicsutra.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsutra.com/cs/stripped/strippedv1i30.htm |title=Cheap? Exploitive? Hypocritical? Nun of the Above |publisher=Comicsutra.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Creation===\nThe creation of ''Areala'' has its roots in the [http://www.fraternitenotredame.com/Pages/EN_Pages/IndexEN.html Fraternite Notre Dame], or the Fraternity of Our Lady, a [[traditionalist Catholic]] organization. In 1991, a chapter was established in New York City's [[East Harlem]] in order to found a [[soup kitchen]]. It was in New York that Sister Marie Chantel who had been a [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Judo]] learned [[Taekwondo]] under a [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] martial arts master. Her fellow nuns, including the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]], also learned self-defense hearing that the neighborhoods were dangerous, though they insist that their martial arts training is mostly for sport and that they have had no problems with the surrounding neighborhoods. Their story was ultimately picked up and reported by ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>\"Black Belts and Blessings for East Harlem Nuns, ''[[New York Times]]'', by David Gonzales. February 2, 1994</ref>\n\nBen Dunn, who attended [[Catholic school]]s, read that article and was inspired. He states that \"Other superheroes, you never know what their faith is. Batman or Spider-Man or Superman, they do all these great things, but what do they believe in?\"<ref>\"Super sister fights evil\", ''[[USA Today]]'', by Leslie Miller. May 5, 1997. Actually, according to [http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/comic_book_religion.html The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Characters] Batman is a lapsed Catholic or [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]; Superman, a [[Christ figure]], is a [[Methodism#Methodism in the United States|Methodist]]; and Spider-Man seems to be a [[Protestant]] of unidentified denomination. According to this \"Spider-Man was one of 33 characters who were identified as the most religious superheroes in the Marvel Universe.\"</ref> While not a true Christian comic book as its emphasis is not on directly calling readers to repentance or propagating the faith but on [[superheroes]] utilizing Christian imagery and on Christian-based [[speculative fiction]], ''Warrior Nun Areala'' takes its idea very seriously.\n\nPart of this was due to the power Ben Dunn sees the Vatican as possessing. He at one point wrote that it may not speak of itself as being a world power but it is. That is because despite being the smallest country on Earth the Vatican's influence on world affairs is disproportionately immense by virtue of its moral and spiritual authority as the headquarters of Earth's largest religion. With over a billion adherents, a headquarters that is a [[Sovereign nation]], [[Pope|a leader]] that is a world leader, it ''is'' a force in the world. Thus, it was only a small step to grant the (fictionalized) church also has a military force that would serve as Heaven's proxy if demons were to attack. In further explaining the concept, he added that \"If [[Hell]] were an actual physical place with physical manifestations then they would be subject to some of the physical laws of nature would they not? Of course that would mean [[Heaven]] too would be physical place. While this may not be so in our world it certainly is so in WNA's world. Therefore, things would progress differently. To the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] in WNA's world 'thou shalt kick [[Satan]]'s ass!'.\"<ref>Letter column ''Warrior Nun Areala: Rituals #4''</ref> However, in creating the character, Dunn sought to distinguish Areala from scantily clad [[Bad Girl Art|bad girl]] antiheroines with which she might be confused. He was also desirous of creating a true hero, not an anti-hero. \"I made it a very strong point that she doesn't kill people, only demons\", and that \"She believes everybody &ndash; no matter how bad they've been &ndash; can be saved.\"<ref>[http://www.smallbytes.net/~bobkat/nun.html \"Super sister fights evil,\"] ''[[USA Today]]'' (May 5, 1997).</ref>\n\n===Publication===\nThe first appearance of the character Sister Shannon Masters was in ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 1 #1. Beginning in December 1994 and ending in April 1995, it was a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] that established the world of Areala, introduced several key characters, and served as her origin story. She was shown having just completed her training in a time when there had been no demonic activity for years and the Warrior Nuns were in danger of being disbanded. Even so, she was assigned to New York City and saw that Satan's minions of Earth were planning an assault on Heaven. She foiled their plans of course.\n\nThis was then followed by other ''Warrior Nun Areala'' mini series some written by Ben Dunn and some not, such as ''Rituals'' (1995\u20131996), ''Scorpio Rose'' (1996\u20131997), and ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2. Published every two months, they expanded the world and provided more information and depth concerning the characters. There were also [[One-shot (comics)|one shots]] such as [[Intercompany crossover|crossovers]] with heroines of other companies such as [[Glory (comics)|Glory]] and [[Avengelyne]]. At the time there were other mini-series set in the Warrior Nun Areala universe that were not directly related to Sister Shannon Masters but instead widened the scope of the fictional world. Focusing on other Nuns of her order from past, present, and future; they include but are not limited to ''Crimson Nun'' (1997), ''Warrior Nun Frenzy'' (1998), and ''Warrior Nun Dei'' (1997\u20131999), respectively. There was also an ongoing [[anthology]] series, ''Warrior Nun Black and White'' that focused on the whole of the Warrior Nun universe.\n\nIt was not until 1999 that Sister Shannon gained her own series. The miniseries ''Areala: Angel of War'' which detailed the original Areala and ''Warrior Nun Areala: Resurrection'' led up to it. Running from 1999 to 2001, it was simply titled ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 3. It concerned an ongoing threat by Areala's most persistent foe, Helga, as she tried to destroy the Vatican itself. In a battle that put to the test, the promise that the gates of Hell would not prevail. Though it climaxed seemingly with the death of Sister Shannon, she later returned and appeared in another ongoing series, ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 4 though this was written mostly by Craig Babiar.\n\nThe current series is ''Warrior Nun Lazarus''.\n\nSister Shannon will be appearing in an upcoming ''War of the Independents'' tie-in issue, centering on her and Sean Koury's ''Bounty Hunter'' character, as well as appearing in ''War of the Independents'' itself.  She can be seen on the cover of issue one, as well as in the group shot at the end of the issue.\n\n==Sister Shannon Masters==\nSister Shannon Masters, the Warrior Nun Areala, given the serial nature of her adventures has developed a wide circle of heroes around her making them into a family she otherwise would not have. That is seen in her foster sister joining the Warrior Nuns and her looking at her fellow Sisters as just that, sisters. Initially uncertain of herself she has developed as a character though she has never lost her idealism or her love of God and Jesus Christ. She has formed strong bonds of affection with her surrogate sisters, Sasuki, Mary, and Sarah; her surrogate son, Jason; her parent figures, Father Gomez and Mother Superion; and with them has fought a wide variety of foes such as Demon Foster, Julius Salvius, and Helga.\n\nHer story begins in 1066 when the original Sister Areala was met by the angel who would become her namesake. An American, Shannon Masters was born after 1959 and was orphaned at the age of four where on she was left at the steps of the Our Lady of the Virgin Mary [[convent]].<ref>Since that would make Sister Shannon 48 years old as of 2007 and since the series employs a [[floating timeline]]--for example, ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2 #6 was published in May 1998, but refers to events happening in ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 1 # 2 published in April 1995 as having happened a year ago--, her birth date will likely be [[retconned]] at a future date. Even so, there are still potential time discrepancies concerning her childhood. In one story, ''Warrior Nun Areala'' Vol. 2 #6, she said she was lived in Japan until she was eleven but later it was revealed in ''Warrior Nun Areala: Resurrection'' #3 that she stayed at the St. Thomas Academy for sixteen years which would have made her twenty seven, hardly the teenager both words and pictures portray her as.</ref> She stayed there until she was adopted by the Yoma family of Japan. She lived in Japan with the Yomas until she was eleven years old but after showing exceptional academic and athletic abilities, she was chosen for the Silver Cross Program and was raised to be a Warrior Nun at upper New York State's Saint Thomas Academy. Thus her experience at the [[Orphan Schools|orphan school]] was more of a [[boarding school]].\n\nGrowing up at the Saint Thomas Academy, she wrestled with feelings of self-worth over how she had been orphaned. However, she over came those doubts and found a purpose for her life in her service to the Church as did her adopted sister, Sasuki Yoma of Japan. It was while she trained there under a young Mother Superion, then Sister Katherine, that she first met and befriended the future Sister Sarah, her best friend; Father David Crowe, her future love interest; and Shotgun Mary. It was at this time that she visited Quagmire High School, also called Ninja High School, though at the time she yet to take her vows and was referred to simply as Shannon and not Sister Shannon. After this, received final training from Mother Superion her at [[Vatican City]].\n\nThough a [[rookie]], Sister Shannon training was completed and she reported to the New York City [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|archdiocese]]. There, she patrolled two sectors from her assigned [[parish]], Saint Thomas Church in [[Manhattan]] on the grounds that she was assigned to an area where there had not been demonic activity since the Purge of 1985. Replacing Sisters Sanguine and Hannah<!-- While it is not worth inserting a link, [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] is also the name of a Biblical character -->, she soon saw a sustained surge in New York City's demonic activity after her arrival. (A stock situation in comic books wherein the [[supervillain]]s can appear only after a hero shows up.) She soon received her calling from the first Sister Areala after she was nearly killed in a battle with minions of [[Satanist]] and [[arms dealer]] Julius Salvius. On recognizing her as the Chosen One of that generation, the original Sister Areala gave Sister Shannon her name and awakened her latent power. It was made official when ''the'' Areala confirmed her as her avatar after a battle against the avatar of mad valkyrie Helga.\n\n==Supporting cast==\n{{Main|Characters in Warrior Nun Areala}}\nSister Shannon Masters, the Warrior Nun Areala, given the serial nature of her adventures has developed a wide circle of heroes around her making them into a family she otherwise would not have. That is seen in her foster sister joining the Warrior Nuns and her looking at her fellow Sisters as just that, sisters. Initially uncertain of herself she has developed as a character though she has never lost her idealism or her love of God and Jesus Christ. She has formed strong bonds of affection with her surrogate sisters, Sasuki, Mary, and Sarah; her surrogate son, Jason; her parent figures, Father Gomez and Mother Superion; and with them has fought a wide variety of foes such as Demon Foster, Julius Salvius, and Helga.\n\n==Heaven and Hell in ''Warrior Nun Areala''==\nAs might be expected, the crux of the story is the battle between good and evil.\nGod created space-time along with all reality an indefinite time ago and created out of love for those who would be His children. Ruling from Heaven on high and \"working in mysterious ways\", He guides Creation to the ultimate good of His creations. All beings are His creations and He looks at them all as His children. Indeed, His Christian worshippers refer to Him as Father. However, not all wish to accept His love and even reject Him and His goodness altogether. In the beginning, one of His creations, Lucifer rejected God's wisdom and, thinking that he could be a superior leader than his omniscient Creator, sought to take the throne of Heaven. Lucifer's War of Heaven and rebellion against God and His goodness led to the creation of evil. To delilver His children whom He so loved of evil, He sent Jesus, His only begotten Son and even sacrificed His life so that whoever believes in Him should not die but have eternal life. Afterwards, God made His will known through the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church that His Son established on Saint Peter.\n\n===Catholic Corps===\nThus, Areala shows a \"cold war\" has been fought between Heaven and Hell, with human souls of at stake. At the moment, Heaven is content to leave Hell alone as long as it does not transgress its boundaries or harm the innocent. When that does happen, the Church's Catholic Corps is the means by which Heaven fights a proxy war. While preceded by earlier miracle workers and martial saints, the Corps has its roots in 1066 with the creation of the first Areala and later in 1212 when Pope Gregory VII authorized a new order to train those blessed by God with power to either use them as miracle workers or as warriors. The Corps is the most visible sign of the Church and by extension God on Earth.\n\n==Controversy==\nWhile ''Warrior Nun Areala'' in its various incarnations has had its loyal followers, there has been controversy over its use of religious imagery. Some, including comic book fans (including Areala fans) have charged Antarctic press with \"[[nunsploitation]]\" in the character of Areala. There were times when Ben Dunn himself considered changing the name to something more \"palatable.\"<ref>[http://www.apforums.com/view_topic.php?id=289&forum_id=16 Warrior Nun Areala. Is it the title?] Antarctic Press Forums. Accessed 6/01/07</ref>\n\nIn his review for [[Daisuke Moriyama]]'s similarly themed [[anime]]/[[manga]] ''[[Chrono Crusade]]'', manga critic Mike Toole likens such ideas to \"the old standby of nuns with guns\" and makes explicit comparisons between it and Dunn's comic book. Toole states that Dunn's idea of a \"woman who slays monsters in a [[Religious habit|habit]] and... a [[bikini]]\" is novel but that it \"just doesn't make any goddamned sense.\" Quite differently, he writes that Moriyama is more restrained and while his fully clothed heroine nun [[Rosette Christopher]] may be somewhat comical that she and her fellow characters \"otherwise seem vaguely authentic.\"<ref>[http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=503 Anime Jump] Vaguely authentic, it incorporates [[Marian apparitions]], the [[Three Secrets of Fatima]], the [[1981 Pope John Paul II assassination attempt]], the [[stigmata]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and other things explaining them in depth with mini-documentaries called [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Azmaria%27s+Extra+Classes|Azmaria's Extra Classes].\n\nCatholic blogger and comic reviewer D.G.D. Davidson follows a similar train of thought. He acknowledges that Catholicism with its \"[[Catholic imagination|imagination]]\", large size, and vast hierarchy lends itself more easily to for use in such things, though he admits the overuse.\n\n{{quote|For one thing, we've already got the monster-fighting equipment: as I write this, I have a full bottle of [[holy water]] at my elbow in case the [[vampires]] or [[zombies]] show up, I have several [[icon]]s nearby, and I can lay my hands on a [[rosary]] or [[crucifix]] pretty quickly if the situation calls for it. It's also easier to imagine the Catholic Church with a supercomputer and demon-tracking satellite network than it is to imagine, say, the [[Conservative Baptist Association]].}}\n\nHowever, he nonetheless criticises ''Areala'' as being mere gimmickry and for being disrespectful of women with the early costumes. He also criticises to for not having done sufficient research and on not taking advantage of Catholicism's rich history.\n\n{{quote|The story could have been significantly cooler if Dunn did a little research. Apparently, Warrior Nuns govern certain \"sectors\" in which they are responsible for keeping demonic activity in check. If Dunn referred to [[dioceses]], [[deaneries]], and [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parishes]] instead of sectors, I might have believed he knew what he was talking about. A few references to [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|actual Catholic practices]] or maybe a little use of [[Politics of the Vatican City|Vatican politics]] might have enriched the story immensely. For example, instead of creating an oddly named order of Magic Priests, Dunn could have assigned magic powers to our [[Exorcist#Catholicism|exorcists]], who already have less spectacular demon-fighting rituals.}} Please see [http://holyheroes.blogspot.com/2007/10/warrior-nun-areala.html Holy Heroes: Warrior Nun Areala]</ref>\n\nDunn made it a point to focus on escapist storytelling and after Antarctic Press' failed attempts at a \"serious version\" backfired this was reinforced. The man they chose for this was [[Barry Lyga]] who wrote the second series. He wrote of that experience, \"The original three series were very tongue-in-cheek... Unfortunately, the audience for the book liked the more tongue-in-cheek approach, and by mutual agreement, I left the series after six issues.\" Indeed, Lyga's willful decision to reject monster attacks out of hand and focus of \"realism\" led to less-than-successful issues that were never even completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://barrylyga.com/new/comicBooks.html |title=Other Work |publisher=Barrylyga.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>\n\nDespite this, some people{{who|date=November 2019}} wrote in commenting on and requesting stories dealing with current issues in the Catholic Church such as the [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases|abuse cases]]. As a result, Lyga's second series featured Sister Shannon asking herself if she should protect the Church from a man seeking revenge for alleged church involvement with the [[Ratlines (history)|ratlines]].

It was a seeming contradiction in terms with how a nun's habit is meant to hide the body in order to discourage [[lust]]. In fact, Ben Dunn wrote that the reason he did that was that \"nipples sell\". Regardless, Dunn stated the loin cloth is \"for mobility\" and that is the official [[Continuity (fiction)|in-continuity]] explanation that the modest Sister Shannon herself unapologetically espoused when confronted on her seeming lack of modesty.<ref name=\"Warrior Nun Areala Vol. 2 #6\" /> (This was resolved by having Sister Shannon's superior assign the Warrior Nuns new more modest battle habits that covered their [[breasts]] in the second series to replace the previous ones that she felt were \"a bit too revealing!\"<ref>''Warrior Nun Areala: Rituals'' #5</ref>) Dunn himself ultimately did say that perhaps \"I think I did go a little overboard\" in the earlier issues.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OC&p_theme=oc&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF40BCD8BBC21F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM \"COMICS' `BAD GIRLS' BUSTIN' LOOSE PUBLISHING: The swashbuckling vixens are adding some excitement to a sluggish industry beset with dwindling sales\"] by Kelly Baron ''[[Orange County Register]]'' August 9, 1996</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Never even read the book.jpg|200px|thumb|Areala's at the [[Big Apple Convention]].]] -->\nHowever, this was addressed in an issue that bordered on breaking the [[fourth wall]] where Sister Shannon took her ward Jason to the [[Big Apple Con]] [[comics convention]] where he bought a copy of \"Battle Nun [[Areola]]\".

J. Annila. The film was to take all the main characters and mythology that author Ben Dunn provided and re-imagine it in a modernistic setting.  The filmmaking team included concept designers on Hollywood blockbusters like ''[[The Hobbit]]'' trilogy, ''[[Spiderman 2]]'' and Brian Singer's ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''.\n\nBen Dunn's involvement included doing storyboards for the film as well as designing the opening sequence which will blend animation and live action. Vancouver based production company<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perfect-circle.ca|title=Perfect Circle Productions|publisher=}}</ref> has been developing the film and the official website can be found at [http://www.warriornun.com  WarriorNun.com].\n\nIn October 2015, there were talks of a live-action ''Warrior Nun'' movie from ''Perfect Circle Productions'' and is intended to be the first of a trilogy.

However, in addition to the standard look, there was also an anime look based on a failed attempt by Ben Dunn and Antarctic Press to make a ''Warrior Nun Areala'' [[Anime-influenced animation|American anime]] in 1994. There were high hopes and would have been partially fan funded with contributors donating $125 in exchange for their names in the credits. However, that never panned out with the money necessary for [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], the hoped for animation studio, to make the series being about $200,000. In 2001 another attempt was made by Darkain Arts though that too failed.

Bennett and Boyd decided to create a women's fraternity and sought members \"not only for literary work, but also for social development\", beginning with their friend Mary Moore Stewart.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tessier, Denise, \"History 2000: Kappa Kappa Gamma Throughout the Years\". 2000</ref> Stewart, Boyd, and Bennett met in the Amateurs des Belles Lettres Hall, a literary society of which the women were active members, to plan their new society.<ref>William Urban et al., ''Monmouth College, a history through its fifth quarter century''. Monmouth College, 1979</ref> They recruited three additional women, Anna Elizabeth Willits, Martha Louisa Stevenson, and Susan Burley Walker, to join in founding the fraternity.[[File:Minnie Stewart House.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Minnie Stewart House]] in Monmouth, where the sorority was founded|alt=|left]]\n\nThe six founders met at Willit's home to begin work on establishing the Alpha Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma. They chose a golden key as their badge and had badges crafted by Bennett's family jeweler for their official debut. A formal charter for the fraternity was drawn up by Stewart's father, who was an attorney in the state of Illinois. On October 13, 1870, the founders publicized their intention to organize as a women's fraternity by entering the Monmouth Chapel, a public campus venue, wearing their golden key badges in their hair. Although the groundwork of the organization began as early as 1869, the 1876 Convention voted to recognize October 13, 1870 as the official Founders Day as no earlier charter date could be determined.\n\nIn 1871, the fraternity chartered its Beta chapter at nearby [[St. Mary's Seminary]]. The next year, the fraternity opened its Gamma chapter at Smithson College and Delta chapter at [[Indiana University]]. Though the Beta and Gamma chapters failed to survive more than a few years, the Delta chapter became the fraternity's oldest continuously active chapter (Alpha was temporarily closed in 1874 but later re-established) and contributed a great deal to the organization of the fraternity in its early years.\n\nIn 1882, Kappa Kappa Gamma was the first women's fraternity to publish a quarterly [[Magazine|journal]],''The Key''. Today, it is published triennially through Watkins Printing Company.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bairdsmanualame00bairgoog|quote=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities.|title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities|last1=Baird|first1=William Raimond|last2=Brown|first2=James Taylor|publisher=G.

This meeting resulted in the organization of the first inter-fraternity association and the first intergroup organization on college campuses.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Kappa Kappa Gamma as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Rules America?|last=Domhoff|first=G. William|publisher=McGraw Hill College|year=2015|edition=Seventh|page=57|oclc=912380768|authorlink=G. William Domhoff|title-link=Who Rules America?}}</ref>\n\nOn January 2, 2018, Kappa Kappa Gamma moved their headquarters from 530 East Town Street in [[Columbus, Ohio ]]to their new location at 6640 Riverside Drive in [[Dublin, Ohio]].\n\n==Symbols==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nKappa Kappa Gamma's official colors are light blue and dark blue, with the [[owl]] as its official mascot. The fraternity flower, the [[fleur-de-lis]], combines the fraternity's colors of dark blue and light blue. Since the fleur-de-lis is a mythical symbol, the [[iris]] is often substituted for practical purposes. The fraternity jewel is the blue [[sapphire]]. The sapphire is recognized as a symbol of truth, sincerity, and constancy. The fraternity [[Coat of Arms]] combines all of the fraternity's symbols: the key, the Greek letters, the new-member pin, the fleur-de-lis, the owl, and the head of Minerva.\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma used \"Tradition of Leadership\" as a tagline in many previous fraternity publications, but, as of June 2012, the new fraternity tagline was changed to \"Aspire to Be\".\n\nIn June 2018, an announcement was made that a new brand would be rolled out during the 2018-2019 academic year with the tag line \"Dream Boldly, Live Fully\".\n\n===Badges===\nThe badge of membership is the golden key. The standard badge is one inch in length and is sometimes jeweled with [[sapphires]], [[pearls]] or [[diamonds]]. On the front of the key are the Greek letters \u039a\u039a\u0393 (on the stem) and \u0391\u03a9\u039f (on the ward). Often the initials and initiation date of the member to whom the badge belongs are inscribed on the back of the badge. The original keys were larger and were not standardized; many were specially made to the member's specifications, sometimes including stones such as [[opals]]. They were also worn on members' lapels, foreheads or hair, whereas today, badges are uniformly worn on the left side of the chest. The badge is worn strictly as an emblem of membership by initiated members. The fraternity encourages badges to be returned to the headquarters upon a member's death. \n\nNew, uninitiated members of Kappa Kappa Gamma wear a different badge, which is a sigma within a delta enameled on silver in the two colors of the fraternity, dark blue and light blue. The new member pin is only worn during the new member period, after which it is returned to the initiating chapter.\n\n== Programs ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Philanthropy===\nKappa Kappa Gamma supports a three-part Philanthropy program, often referred to as \"Philanthropy 1-2-3\".\n\n* The first branch of philanthropy supports the \"Kappa family\" through the Kappa Kappa Gamma  Foundation, which provides funding for Kappa museums, members-only scholarships, educational and leadership programming, and the Rose McGill fund, which provides emergency financial aid to sisters in need.\n* The second branch supports the local community by encouraging chapters and alumnae associations to volunteer and raise money for charities in their regions.\n* The third branch encompasses the entire fraternity through its national philanthropy, [[Reading is Fundamental]] (RIF). The fraternity officially adopted RIF, which works to promote literacy in children, as the national philanthropy in 2004.\n\nLocal KKG chapters may support other foundations or philanthropies individually.\n\n===Leadership===\nCollegiate chapters contain a governing body of members that include a President, Treasurer, Secretary and officers assigned to chapter functions such as membership, standards, events, and philanthropy. Often these officers supervise committees as well. The chapter officers are advised by and report to alumnae volunteers who serve as chapter advisors, traveling Leadership Consultants, and Fraternity Council officers.\n\nThe national Fraternity Council consists of six elected alumnae (the President, four Vice Presidents, and Treasurer) and two non-voting members (the National Panhellenic Conference Delegate, and the Fraternity Executive Director). Their work is supported by 11 Content Directors, 14 District Directors, dozens of Content Specialists, various committees, and Kappa Kappa Gamma Headquarters staff. As of January 2018, the Fraternity moved their headquarters from Columbus, Ohio to a new facility in Dublin, Ohio.\n\nIn 2004, Leadership Academy began offering undergraduate and alumna members intensive leadership development at an outdoor weekend retreat. Programming for the Leadership Academy has been developed in partnership with The Tompeters! Company and Bradford Woods, an [[outdoor education]] facility in Indiana. More recently, Leadership Academy has taken place at [http://www.heartlandretreat.com Heartland Conference Retreat Center] in Marengo, Ohio, near the Fraternity Headquarters.\n\n===The Monmouth Duo===\nThe women's fraternity [[Pi Beta Phi]] was founded as I.C. Sorosis at [[Monmouth College]] in 1867. Kappa Kappa Gamma was founded at the college in 1870, and in 1888 I.C. Sorosis adopted Greek letters and changed its name to Pi Beta Phi. Because both fraternities have their origins at the same college within three years of one another, they are often called \"The Monmouth Duo\". On campuses with Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters, the groups often hold joint social and philanthropic events.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Hazing===\n{{further|List of hazing deaths in the United States}}\nIn 1997 the television show ''20/20'' featured an expos\u00e9 on [[hazing]] in the sorority system<ref name=\"Haz2020\">{{cite web|date= May 3, 1999\n| url=http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/hazenews/haze15.htm\n| title=20/20 Transcript}}</ref> that included a hazing by three members of Kappa Kappa Gamma at [[DePauw University]] and a local sorority [[Lambda Delta Sigma (Concordia)|Lambda Delta Sigma]] at [[Concordia College (Minnesota)|Concordia College]].

They must also have a minimum [[Grading in education|grade point average]] to be considered eligible. Women must participate in sorority recruitment and if they are issued an invitation to join, they enter the New Member period, the first of three phases of membership. After six to eight weeks, New Members are initiated and enter the second phase of membership as active collegiate members. Upon graduation, members enter the third and final phase of membership and become alumnae. Alumnae have the opportunity to join local alumna associations and remain active participants in fraternity life by engaging in social and philanthropic events, volunteering as advisers to collegiate chapters, and serving as fraternity council officers.\n\n===Collegiate chapters===\n{{Main|List of Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters}}\n\n* Kappa Kappa Gamma has chartered a total of 161 chapters, 30 of which the fraternity has closed. Eight of the 30 closed chapters have been rechartered, and none of the rechartered chapters have been closed.\n* Active chapters exist in 41 of the 50 states and in the [[District of Columbia]] as well as in three of the 10 Canadian provinces.\n* The state with the largest number of active chapters is [[California]], with 17 active chapters and one inactive chapter. Kappa has had active chapters at all nine of the [[University of California]] undergraduate campuses.\n* The fraternity's most expansionary year was 1929, with six new chapters chartered.\n* The fraternity's most expansionary decades were the 1980s, in which 19 chapters were chartered, and the 1920s, in which 18 chapters where chartered and one chapter was rechartered.\n* The fraternity's least expansionary decades were the 1890s, in which five chapters were chartered and one chapter was rechartered, and the 1960s, in which six chapters were chartered.\n* The decade with the largest number of chapter closures was the 1880s, with six chapters closed.\n\n===Notable Alumnae===\n{{Main|List of Kappa Kappa Gamma sisters}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.kappakappagamma.org/ Kappa Kappa Gamma Website]\n* [http://associations.kappakappagamma.org/ Association Websites of Kappa Kappa Gamma]\n\n{{National Panhellenic Conference}}\n{{Fraternities and Sororities |collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Kappa Kappa Gamma| ]]\n[[Category:1870 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Companies based in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Monmouth College]]\n[[Category:National Panhellenic Conference]]\n[[Category:Student organizations established in 1870]]\n[[Category:Student societies in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Fraternity\n|letters= \u039a\u039a\u0393\n|name= Kappa Kappa Gamma\n|crest= File:Kappa_Kappa_Gamma_crest.gif\n|founded= {{start date and years ago|1870|10|13}}\n|birthplace= [[Monmouth College]], ([[Monmouth, Illinois]])\n{{Coord|40|06|09.8|N|83|06|35.7|W|display=inline,title}}\n|type= Social\n|emphasis=\n|scope= International\n|mission=\n|vision=\n|motto=Dream Boldly.

Bennett and Boyd decided to create a women's fraternity and sought members \"not only for literary work, but also for social development\", beginning with their friend Mary Moore Stewart.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tessier, Denise, \"History 2000: Kappa Kappa Gamma Throughout the Years\". 2000</ref> Stewart, Boyd, and Bennett met in the Amateurs des Belles Lettres Hall, a literary society of which the women were active members, to plan their new society.<ref>William Urban et al., ''Monmouth College, a history through its fifth quarter century''. Monmouth College, 1979</ref> They recruited three additional women, Anna Elizabeth Willits, Martha Louisa Stevenson, and Susan Burley Walker, to join in founding the fraternity.[[File:Minnie Stewart House.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Minnie Stewart House]] in Monmouth, where the sorority was founded|alt=|left]]\n\nThe six founders met at Willit's home to begin work on establishing the Alpha Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma. They chose a golden key as their badge and had badges crafted by Bennett's family jeweler for their official debut. A formal charter for the fraternity was drawn up by Stewart's father, who was an attorney in the state of Illinois. On October 13, 1870, the founders publicized their intention to organize as a women's fraternity by entering the Monmouth Chapel, a public campus venue, wearing their golden key badges in their hair. Although the groundwork of the organization began as early as 1869, the 1876 Convention voted to recognize October 13, 1870 as the official Founders Day as no earlier charter date could be determined.\n\nIn 1871, the fraternity chartered its Beta chapter at nearby [[St. Mary's Seminary]]. The next year, the fraternity opened its Gamma chapter at Smithson College and Delta chapter at [[Indiana University]]. Though the Beta and Gamma chapters failed to survive more than a few years, the Delta chapter became the fraternity's oldest continuously active chapter (Alpha was temporarily closed in 1874 but later re-established) and contributed a great deal to the organization of the fraternity in its early years.\n\nIn 1882, Kappa Kappa Gamma was the first women's fraternity to publish a quarterly [[Magazine|journal]],''The Key''. Today, it is published triennially through Watkins Printing Company.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bairdsmanualame00bairgoog|quote=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities.|title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities|last1=Baird|first1=William Raimond|last2=Brown|first2=James Taylor|publisher=G.

This meeting resulted in the organization of the first inter-fraternity association and the first intergroup organization on college campuses.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Kappa Kappa Gamma as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Rules America?|last=Domhoff|first=G. William|publisher=McGraw Hill College|year=2015|edition=Seventh|page=57|oclc=912380768|authorlink=G. William Domhoff|title-link=Who Rules America?}}</ref>\n\nOn January 2, 2018, Kappa Kappa Gamma moved their headquarters from 530 East Town Street in [[Columbus, Ohio ]]to their new location at 6640 Riverside Drive in [[Dublin, Ohio]].\n\n==Symbols==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nKappa Kappa Gamma's official colors are light blue and dark blue, with the [[owl]] as its official mascot. The fraternity flower, the [[fleur-de-lis]], combines the fraternity's colors of dark blue and light blue. Since the fleur-de-lis is a mythical symbol, the [[iris]] is often substituted for practical purposes. The fraternity jewel is the blue [[sapphire]]. The sapphire is recognized as a symbol of truth, sincerity, and constancy. The fraternity [[Coat of Arms]] combines all of the fraternity's symbols: the key, the Greek letters, the new-member pin, the fleur-de-lis, the owl, and the head of Minerva.\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma used \"Tradition of Leadership\" as a tagline in many previous fraternity publications, but, as of June 2012, the new fraternity tagline was changed to \"Aspire to Be\".\n\nIn June 2018, an announcement was made that a new brand would be rolled out during the 2018-2019 academic year with the tag line \"Dream Boldly, Live Fully\".\n\n===Badges===\nThe badge of membership is the golden key. The standard badge is one inch in length and is sometimes jeweled with [[sapphires]], [[pearls]] or [[diamonds]]. On the front of the key are the Greek letters \u039a\u039a\u0393 (on the stem) and \u0391\u03a9\u039f (on the ward). Often the initials and initiation date of the member to whom the badge belongs are inscribed on the back of the badge. The original keys were larger and were not standardized; many were specially made to the member's specifications, sometimes including stones such as opals. They were also worn on members' lapels, foreheads or hair, whereas today, badges are uniformly worn on the left side of the chest. The badge is worn strictly as an emblem of membership and only by initiated members. Members are encouraged to return their badges to fraternity headquarters upon their death.\n\nNew members of Kappa Kappa Gamma wear a different badge: a sigma within a delta enameled on silver in the two colors of the fraternity, dark blue and light blue. The new member pin is only worn during the new member period, after which it is returned to the chapter.\n\n== Programs ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Philanthropy===\nKappa Kappa Gamma supports a three-part Philanthropy program, often referred to as \"Philanthropy 1-2-3\".\n\n* The first branch of philanthropy supports the \"Kappa family\" through the Kappa Kappa Gamma  Foundation, which provides funding for Kappa museums, members-only scholarships, educational and leadership programming, and the Rose McGill fund, which provides emergency financial aid to sisters in need.\n* The second branch supports the local community by encouraging chapters and alumnae associations to volunteer and raise money for charities in their regions.\n* The third branch encompasses the entire fraternity through its national philanthropy, [[Reading is Fundamental]] (RIF). The fraternity officially adopted RIF, which works to promote literacy in children, as the national philanthropy in 2004.\n\nLocal KKG chapters may support other foundations or philanthropies individually.\n\n===Leadership===\nCollegiate chapters contain a governing body of members that include a President, Treasurer, Secretary and officers assigned to chapter functions such as membership, standards, events, and philanthropy. Often these officers supervise committees as well. The chapter officers are advised by and report to alumnae volunteers who serve as chapter advisors, traveling Leadership Consultants, and Fraternity Council officers.\n\nThe national Fraternity Council consists of six elected alumnae (the President, four Vice Presidents, and Treasurer) and two non-voting members (the National Panhellenic Conference Delegate, and the Fraternity Executive Director). Their work is supported by 11 Content Directors, 14 District Directors, dozens of Content Specialists, various committees, and Kappa Kappa Gamma Headquarters staff. As of January 2018, the Fraternity moved their headquarters from Columbus, Ohio to a new facility in Dublin, Ohio.\n\nIn 2004, Leadership Academy began offering undergraduate and alumna members intensive leadership development at an outdoor weekend retreat. Programming for the Leadership Academy has been developed in partnership with The Tompeters! Company and Bradford Woods, an [[outdoor education]] facility in Indiana. More recently, Leadership Academy has taken place at [http://www.heartlandretreat.com Heartland Conference Retreat Center] in Marengo, Ohio, near the Fraternity Headquarters.\n\n===The Monmouth Duo===\nThe women's fraternity [[Pi Beta Phi]] was founded as I.C. Sorosis at [[Monmouth College]] in 1867. Kappa Kappa Gamma was founded at the college in 1870, and in 1888 I.C. Sorosis adopted Greek letters and changed its name to Pi Beta Phi. Because both fraternities have their origins at the same college within three years of one another, they are often called \"The Monmouth Duo\". On campuses with Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters, the groups often hold joint social and philanthropic events.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Hazing===\n{{further|List of hazing deaths in the United States}}\nIn 1997 the television show ''20/20'' featured an expos\u00e9 on [[hazing]] in the sorority system<ref name=\"Haz2020\">{{cite web|date= May 3, 1999\n| url=http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/hazenews/haze15.htm\n| title=20/20 Transcript}}</ref> that included a hazing by three members of Kappa Kappa Gamma at [[DePauw University]] and a local sorority [[Lambda Delta Sigma (Concordia)|Lambda Delta Sigma]] at [[Concordia College (Minnesota)|Concordia College]].

He is a multiple-time world champion, and the first Puerto Rican boxer to win [[quadruple champion|world titles in four weight classes]]. In 2007 and 2009, he reached a peak active [[The Ring magazine Pound for Pound|pound for pound]] ranking of seventh by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine. Cotto started out his career as a hard-hitting [[pressure fighter]], but evolved over the years into a more refined [[boxer-puncher]] as he moved up in weight.\n\nAs an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Cotto represented Puerto Rico in the [[lightweight]] and [[light welterweight]] divisions at various international events, including the [[1999 Pan American Games]], the [[2000 Olympics]], and the [[1998 Junior World Boxing Championships|1998 Junior World Championships]]; the latter in which he won a lightweight silver medal. Having begun his professional career in 2001, Cotto defeated [[Kelson Pinto]] for the WBO light welterweight title in 2004. He made six successful defenses before vacating the title to move up in weight. In his first [[welterweight]] fight, in 2006, Cotto defeated [[Carlos Quintana (boxer)|Carlos Quintana]] for the vacant [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] title. He successfully defended it four times before a career first loss to [[Antonio Margarito]] in 2008. The following year, Cotto won the vacant WBO welterweight title and defended it once before losing it to [[Manny Pacquiao]] in the same year.\n\nIn 2010 he moved up to [[light middleweight]] and won the WBA title from [[Yuri Foreman]]. Having been promoted by the WBA to [[WBA (Super)|Super champion]] status, Cotto won a 2011 rematch against Margarito. He lost the WBA (Super) title in 2012 to [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], in one of the most anticipated fights in modern boxing history. The year would end on a further sour note for Cotto, as he lost in an upset to [[Austin Trout]]. Two years later, Cotto defeated [[Sergio Mart\u00ednez (boxer)|Sergio Mart\u00ednez]] to win the unified [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], ''Ring'', and [[lineal championship|lineal]] [[middleweight]] titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|title=The Lineal Middleweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia|access-date=2016-11-11|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hNmEqTuN?url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|archive-date=2009-06-08|url-status=live}}</ref> In doing so, he became the first four-weight world champion from Puerto Rico.

The fight started off with Cotto establishing himself as the fight's aggressor, but with Mayweather winning the first two rounds using effective counter-punching and body movement to block most of Cotto's punches. However, in the third round Cotto seemed to successfully swarm Mayweather and land decent flurries to steal himself the round. Then from rounds 4-9 the action was closely contested, with both fighters using their partially contrasting styles in attempts to one-up the other. Ultimately though, Mayweather managed to adjust to Cotto's new rhythm of attacking in flurries and used his now-newly tweaked counter-punching style to win a lot of the final rounds, in what people thought had secured Mayweather the decision victory. Cotto had Mayweather against the ropes many times, resulting in some damage and a lot of bleeding from Mayweather's nose. Cotto's eyes had some partial swelling.

He is a multiple-time world champion, and the first Puerto Rican boxer to win [[quadruple champion|world titles in four weight classes]]. In 2007 and 2009, he reached a peak active [[The Ring magazine Pound for Pound|pound for pound]] ranking of seventh by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine. Cotto started out his career as a hard-hitting [[pressure fighter]], but evolved over the years into a more refined [[boxer-puncher]] as he moved up in weight.\n\nAs an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Cotto represented Puerto Rico in the [[lightweight]] and [[light welterweight]] divisions at various international events, including the [[1999 Pan American Games]], the [[2000 Olympics]], and the [[1998 Junior World Boxing Championships|1998 Junior World Championships]]; the latter in which he won a lightweight silver medal. Having begun his professional career in 2001, Cotto defeated [[Kelson Pinto]] for the WBO light welterweight title in 2004. He made six successful defenses before vacating the title to move up in weight. In his first [[welterweight]] fight, in 2006, Cotto defeated [[Carlos Quintana (boxer)|Carlos Quintana]] for the vacant [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] title. He successfully defended it four times before a career first loss to [[Antonio Margarito]] in 2008. The following year, Cotto won the vacant WBO welterweight title and defended it once before losing it to [[Manny Pacquiao]] in the same year.\n\nIn 2010 he moved up to [[light middleweight]] and won the WBA title from [[Yuri Foreman]]. Having been promoted by the WBA to [[WBA (Super)|Super champion]] status, Cotto won a 2011 rematch against Margarito. He lost the WBA (Super) title in 2012 to [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], in one of the most anticipated fights in modern boxing history. The year would end on a further sour note for Cotto, as he lost in an upset to [[Austin Trout]]. Two years later, Cotto defeated [[Sergio Mart\u00ednez (boxer)|Sergio Mart\u00ednez]] to win the unified [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], ''Ring'', and [[lineal championship|lineal]] [[middleweight]] titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|title=The Lineal Middleweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia|access-date=2016-11-11|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hNmEqTuN?url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|archive-date=2009-06-08|url-status=live}}</ref> In doing so, he became the first four-weight world champion from Puerto Rico.

The fight started off with Cotto establishing himself as the fight's aggressor, but with Mayweather winning the first two rounds using effective counter-punching and body movement to block most of Cotto's punches. However, in the third round Cotto seemed to successfully swarm Mayweather and land decent flurries to steal himself the round. Then from rounds 4-9 the action was closely contested, with both fighters using their partially contrasting styles in attempts to one-up the other. Ultimately though, Mayweather managed to adjust to Cotto's new rhythm of attacking in flurries and used his now-newly tweaked counter-punching style to win a lot of the final rounds, in what people thought had secured Mayweather the decision victory. Cotto had Mayweather against the ropes many times, resulting in some damage and a lot of bleeding from Mayweather's nose. Cotto's eyes had some partial swelling. Mayweather won via unanimous decision with scores of 117\u2013111, 117\u2013111, and 118\u2013110.

Beginning his career as an interpreter and land agent, Carroll was elected to the Eastern Maori seat in [[1887 New Zealand general election|1887]]. He was acting [[Colonial Secretary (New Zealand)|Colonial Secretary]] (equivalent to the Minister of Internal Affairs) from 1897 to 1899. He was the first M\u0101ori to hold the cabinet position of [[Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs|Minister of Native Affairs]], which he held between 1899 and 1912. He was held in high regard within the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and was acting prime minister in 1909 and 1911.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Carroll was born at [[Wairoa]], one of eight children of Joseph Carroll, born in [[Sydney]] of Irish descent, and Tapuke, a M\u0101ori woman of the Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu iwi. He was educated both at [[whare wananga]] (traditional M\u0101ori college) and the Wairoa native school but left early to be a farm worker. In 1870, while no more than thirteen, he was part of the M\u0101ori force pursuing [[Te Kooti]] in the Urewera, and his bravery was mentioned in dispatches. He became a cadet for the Native Department in [[Hawke's Bay region|Hawke's Bay]] and later in [[Wellington]] but was back on a farm by 1875.

Taken at [[Huntly, New Zealand]] in 1898]]\n\nCarroll first stood for Parliament in 1884, unsuccessfully contesting the [[Eastern Maori]] electorate against [[Wi Pere]].<ref name=\"DNZB Carroll\"/> By the [[1887 New Zealand general election|1887 election]], [[John Ballance]]'s  paternalistic Native Land Administration Act of 1886, which proposed leasing M\u0101ori lands through a government commissioner, was a major issue. Carroll, an opponent of the act, won the electorate. He was confirmed in the next election in {{NZ election link year|1890}}. In the {{NZ election link|1893}}, he stood in the [[Waiapu (New Zealand electorate)|Waiapu]] electorate. From {{NZ election link year|1908}}, he represented the {{NZ electorate link|Gisborne}} electorate, until he was defeated in 1919.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=188}}\n\nEntering [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], Carroll wanted to create equality for M\u0101ori by allowing them to lease land and use the revenue to invest in their own farms. The settler preference was for freehold title, and this solution was favoured by the [[Harry Atkinson|Atkinson]] Government. He was appointed in March 1892 a member of the Executive Council representing the native race, and had to support the government in compulsory acquisition.\n\n[[Te Kotahitanga]] M\u0101ori MPs crtitcised Carroll's stance, and he decided to stand for the General  Electorate of [[Waiapu (New Zealand electorate)|Waiapu]]. He won this seat in 1893, the first time a M\u0101ori was elected to a General Electorate seat.\n\nTe Kotahitanga continued to promote a separate law-making assembly for M\u0101ori, and Carroll travelled to M\u0101ori communities speaking out against separatism. In 1899, he became Native Minister in the Liberal Government, the first person of M\u0101ori descent to hold this office. He established the M\u0101ori Councils Act, which allowed  local M\u0101ori committees to deal with health, sanitation and liquor control, and the M\u0101ori land councils, controlled by M\u0101ori and which could sell or lease land.\n\nThe settler view was that much of the North Island under M\u0101ori control should be developed, and Carroll as Native Minister to 1912 was under pressure to allow more land sales. Many M\u0101ori consider that he made too many concessions, but he always fought for the rights of M\u0101ori at a time when there was little support for his views.\n\nTwice in the Liberal Government, Carroll acted as Prime Minister, and his status was confirmed by the awarding in 1911 of the [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], becoming the first Maori to be knighted. Carroll continued to represent the general electorate of [[Gisborne (New Zealand electorate)|Gisborne]] until 1919, when he was defeated by [[Douglas Lysnar]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=213}}\n\nOn 2 September 1921, Carroll was appointed to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by Prime Minister [[William Massey]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=151}} From the Upper House of New Zealand, he was able to support [[\u0100pirana Ngata]] and other rising M\u0101ori leaders.<ref name=\"DNZB Carroll\" />\n\nHe died suddenly in Auckland from kidney failure on 18 October 1926. His body was returned to Gisborne, where he was buried at Makaraka.<ref name=\"DNZB Carroll\" />\n\nFarmer and politician [[Turi Carroll]] was a nephew.\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{citation |first = R.

Beginning his career as an interpreter and land agent, Carroll was elected to the Eastern Maori seat in [[1887 New Zealand general election|1887]]. He was acting [[Colonial Secretary (New Zealand)|Colonial Secretary]] (equivalent to the Minister of Internal Affairs) from 1897 to 1899. He was the first M\u0101ori to hold the cabinet position of [[Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs|Minister of Native Affairs]], which he held between 1899 and 1912. He was held in high regard within the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and was acting prime minister in 1909 and 1911.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Carroll was born at [[Wairoa]], one of eight children of Joseph Carroll, born in [[Sydney]] of Irish descent, and Tapuke, a M\u0101ori woman of the Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu tribe. He was educated both at [[whare wananga]] (traditional M\u0101ori college) and the Wairoa native school but left early to be a farm worker. In 1870, while no more than thirteen, he was part of the M\u0101ori force pursuing [[Te Kooti]] in the Urewera, and his bravery was mentioned in dispatches. He became a cadet for the Native Department in [[Hawke's Bay region|Hawke's Bay]] and later in [[Wellington]] but was back on a farm by 1875. In 1881 he married [[Heni Materoa Carroll|Heni Materoa]] and they settled in [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]].

Taken at [[Huntly, New Zealand]] in 1898]]\n\nCarroll first stood for Parliament in 1884, unsuccessfully contesting the [[Eastern Maori]] electorate against [[Wi Pere]].<ref name=\"DNZB Carroll\"/> By the [[1887 New Zealand general election|1887 election]], [[John Ballance]]'s  paternalistic Native Land Administration Act of 1886, which proposed leasing M\u0101ori lands through a government commissioner, was a major issue. Carroll, an opponent of the act, won the electorate. He was confirmed in the next election in {{NZ election link year|1890}}. In the {{NZ election link|1893}}, he stood in the [[Waiapu (New Zealand electorate)|Waiapu]] electorate. From {{NZ election link year|1908}}, he represented the {{NZ electorate link|Gisborne}} electorate, until he was defeated in 1919.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=188}}\n\nEntering [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], Carroll wanted to create equality for M\u0101ori by allowing them to lease land and use the revenue to invest in their own farms. The settler preference was for freehold title, and this solution was favoured by the [[Harry Atkinson|Atkinson]] Government. He was appointed in March 1892 a member of the Executive Council representing the native race, and had to support the government in compulsory acquisition.\n\n[[Te Kotahitanga]] M\u0101ori MPs crtitcised Carroll's stance, and he decided to stand for the General  Electorate of [[Waiapu (New Zealand electorate)|Waiapu]]. He won this seat in 1893, the first time a M\u0101ori was elected to a General Electorate seat.\n\nTe Kotahitanga continued to promote a separate law-making assembly for M\u0101ori, and Carroll travelled to M\u0101ori communities speaking out against separatism. In 1899, he became Native Minister in the Liberal Government, the first person of M\u0101ori descent to hold this office. He established the M\u0101ori Councils Act, which allowed  local M\u0101ori committees to deal with health, sanitation and liquor control, and the M\u0101ori land councils, controlled by M\u0101ori and which could sell or lease land.\n\nThe settler view was that much of the North Island under M\u0101ori control should be developed, and Carroll as Native Minister to 1912 was under pressure to allow more land sales. Many M\u0101ori consider that he made too many concessions, but he always fought for the rights of M\u0101ori at a time when there was little support for his views.\n\nTwice in the Liberal Government, Carroll acted as Prime Minister, and his status was confirmed by the awarding in 1911 of the [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], becoming the first Maori to be knighted. Carroll continued to represent the general electorate of [[Gisborne (New Zealand electorate)|Gisborne]] until 1919, when he was defeated by [[Douglas Lysnar]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=213}}\n\nOn 2 September 1921, Carroll was appointed to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by Prime Minister [[William Massey]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=151}} From the Upper House of New Zealand, he was able to support [[\u0100pirana Ngata]] and other rising M\u0101ori leaders.<ref name=\"DNZB Carroll\" />\n\nHe died suddenly in Auckland from kidney failure on 18 October 1926. His body was returned to Gisborne, where he was buried at Makaraka.<ref name=\"DNZB Carroll\" />\n\nFarmer and politician [[Turi Carroll]] was a nephew.\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{citation |first = R.
