S., Moore M. L., Shanahan K. J., Horky A., Mack B.(2015): Creepy marketing: three dimensions of perceived excessive online privacy violation, Marketing Management Journal, Vol.25</ref> described what aspect of marketing participants considered creepy. The main three reasons are the following: using invasive tactics, causing discomfort and violating of norms. Invasive tactics are practiced by marketers that know so much about the consumer that the ads are \u201ccreepily\u201d personalised. Secondly, some ads create discomfort by making the consumer question \u201cthe motives of the company advertising the product\u201d . Finally, some ads violate social norms by having inappropriate content, for example by unnecessarily sexualizing it.<ref name=\"Moore\" />{{rp|48}}\nIt is marketing\u2019s extensive knowledge used in an improper way and that creates a feeling of creepiness, together with a certain loss of control over our data. <ref name=\"Moore\" />{{rp|44}} \n\nAnother creepy aspect of technology is human looking AI: this phenomenon is called the [[uncanny valley]].\nHumans find robots creepy when they start resembling humans excessively. It has been hypothesised that the reason why they are viewed as creepy is because they violate our notion of how a robot should look. A study focusing on children's responses to this phenomenon found evidence to support the hypothesis.<ref>Brink K. A., Gray K. and Wellman H.M. (2019): Creepiness Creeps In: Uncanny Valley Feelings Are Acquired in Childhood, Child Dev, Vol.90</ref>{{rp|1210}}\n\n\n\n\n==Evolutionary explanation==\nSeveral studies have hypothesized that creepiness is an evolutionary response to potentially dangerous situations.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}}   It could be linked to a mechanism called [[agency detection]] which makes individuals expect malignant agents to be responsible for small changes in our environment. McAndrew et al. illustrates the idea with the example of a person hearing some noises while walking in a dark alley. That person would go in high alert, fearing that some dangerous individual was there. If that wasn\u2019t the case the loss would be small. If, on the other hand, a dangerous individual was actually in the alley and the person had not been alerted by this creepy feeling, the loss could have been significant.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|11}} \n\nCreepiness would therefore serve the purpose of alerting us in situations in which the danger isn\u2019t outright obvious but rather ambiguous. In this case, ambiguity both refers to the possible presence of a threat and to its nature, sexual or physical for example.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}} Creepiness \u201cmay reside in between the unknowing and the fear\u201d<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|58}} in the sense that individuals experiencing it are unsure if there truly is something to fear or not. Truth is that creepy characteristics are not simply caused by threat potential: in fact, [[ectomorphic]] body types are not the most powerful bodies and facial expressions are not a proxy of physical strength either.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|63}} Therefore, creepiness isn\u2019t only related to how threatening a characteristic is, in the sense of how dangerous and strong the individual can be. There are more facets to consider.\n\nAnother characteristic of creepiness is unpredictable behaviour.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|12}} Unpredictability links back to this idea of ambiguity.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|11}} When an individual is unpredictable it isn\u2019t possible to tell when his behaviour will turn violent: this adds to the ambiguity of a potentially dangerous situation. This theory is endorsed by studies. Not only is unpredictability directly listed as a creepy characteristic<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|13}}, but other behaviours, such as norm-breaking behaviours are indirectly linked with unpredictability. Such behaviours show that the individual doesn\u2019t conform to some social standards we would expect in a given situation. <ref name=\"Leander\">Leander N. P., Chartrand T. L., Bargh J. A.

The male [[North Island]] subspecies has black head, back, wings (with a white wing-bar), and a white belly. The subspecies from [[South Island]], the [[Chatham Islands]], and [[Auckland Islands]] are similar, but have a yellow band across the breast between the black head and white belly. The females are brown instead of black. The [[Snares Island]] subspecies is entirely black, and is known as the black tit.<ref name = \"Heather\">Heather, B & Robertson, H. (1996) ''The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand'' Auckland:Viking {{ISBN|0-14-302040-4}}</ref>\n\nThe island subspecies of tomtits show a striking variation in body size, being considerably larger than their mainland relatives, a tendency known as the [[Foster's rule]] or the island effect. Birds from the main islands weigh around 11g, compared with birds from Snares Island, which weigh in at 20&nbsp;g.\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Bul01Bird239b.jpg|thumb|Illustration of South Island tomtit nests (1888)]]\n\nThe tomtit is mostly an [[insectivore]], feeding on small invertebrates, such as [[beetle]]s, caterpillars, [[spider]]s, [[moth]]s, [[weta]], [[earthworm]]s, and flies. Fruit is taken during the winter and autumn. Most subspecies feed in vegetation, waiting on a perch and watching for [[prey]]. [[Insect]]s are also gleaned from branches and leaves.

The species was once thought to have been descended from the [[scarlet robin]],<ref>C.A. Fleming, (1950) New Zealand flycatchers of the genus ''Petroica Swainson'' (Aves), Parts I and II, ''Trans. Roy. Soc. NZ'' '''78''', pp. 14\u201347 126\u2013160.</ref> although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event, and the [[black robin]] and tomtit from another.<ref name = \"Miller\">Miller, Hilary C. & Lambert, David M. (2006): A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand\u2019s Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences. ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''40'''(3): 844-855.</ref>\n\nThere are five subspecies of the tomtit, with each subspecies being restricted to one of the following islands or island groups: North Island, South Island, the Snares Islands, the Chatham Islands, and the Auckland Islands. Four of these five subspecies have been elevated to full species in the past (the Chatham subspecies was retained with the South Island tomtit),<ref>R.N. Holdaway, T.H. Worthy and A.J.D. Tennyson,(2001) \"A working list of breeding bird species of the New Zealand region at first human contact/\" ''NZ J. Zool.'' '''28''': pp. 119\u2013187</ref> but genetic studies have shown that these subspecies diverged relatively recently.<ref name = \"Miller\"/> The [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] name of the North Island tomtit is '''miromiro''', while the South Island tomtit is known as '''ngirungiru'''.\n\n*North Island tomtit ''P. m. toitoi''\n*South Island tomtit  ''P. m. macrocephala''\n*[[Chatham tomtit]] ''P. m. chathamensis''\n*Auckland tomtit ''P. m. marrineri''\n*Snares tomtit ''P. m. dannefaerdi''\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Tomtit fem - New Zealand (25419832238).jpg|thumb|Female tomtits have a browner plumage than the males]]\nThe tomtit is a small (13&nbsp;cm, 11&nbsp;g) bird with a large head and a short [[beak|bill]]. The male [[North Island]] subspecies has black head, back, wings (with a white wing-bar), and a white belly. The subspecies from [[South Island]], the [[Chatham Islands]], and [[Auckland Islands]] are similar, but have a yellow band across the breast between the black head and white belly. The females are brown instead of black. The [[Snares Island]] subspecies is entirely black, and is known as the black tit.<ref name = \"Heather\">Heather, B & Robertson, H. (1996) ''The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand'' Auckland:Viking {{ISBN|0-14-302040-4}}</ref>\n\nThe island subspecies of tomtits show a striking variation in body size, being considerably larger than their mainland relatives, a tendency known as the [[Foster's rule]] or the island effect. Birds from the main islands weigh around 11g, compared with birds from Snares Island, which weigh in at 20&nbsp;g.\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Bul01Bird239b.jpg|thumb|Illustration of South Island tomtit nests (1888)]]\n\nThe tomtit is mostly an [[insectivore]], feeding on small invertebrates, such as [[beetle]]s, caterpillars, [[spider]]s, [[moth]]s, [[weta]], [[earthworm]]s, and flies. Fruit is taken during the winter and autumn. Most subspecies feed in vegetation, waiting on a perch and watching for [[prey]]. [[Insect]]s are also gleaned from branches and leaves. The Snares subspecies feeds on the ground as well, in a similar fashion to the [[New Zealand robin (disambiguation)|New Zealand robin]].<ref name = \"Heather\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|Birds}}\n* {{Portal-inline|New Zealand}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Petroica macrocephala}}\n* {{cite web |title = Chatham Island fantail, Chatham Island tomtit and Chatham Island warbler recovery plan 2001\u20132011 | url = http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and-technical/TSRP46.pdf | year = 2001| publisher = Department of Conservation, Wellington, New Zealand | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-04}}\n\n{{Petroicidae}}\n{{Birds of New Zealand}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q139526}}\n\n[[Category:Birds described in 1789]]\n[[Category:Birds of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Chatham Islands]]\n[[Category:Petroica]]\n", "name_user": "Rogermccart", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBehaviour:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomtit"}

It is largely surrounded by the commune of [[Meersburg]], with a short border with [[Uhldingen-M\u00fchlhofen]] to the north.\n\n==History==\nDaisendorf was first settled in the 8th Century. Given its isolation through marshy terrain and hills, it was only first documented in 1222 when the [[Salem Abbey|Abbot of Salem]] purchased the tithes of the village from the Lords of [[House of Vaz|Vaz]]. The sovereignty over the village, however, always belonged to the [[Prince-Bishopric of Constance]]. The conflict of rights between the abbot and the prince-bishop led to a series of disputes that were mediated by town jurors; the first of which occurred in 1295. Plague, crop failures, and a decrease in the price of grain devastated the community in the 14th Century, and slowly the prince-bishopric lost influence in the region. These difficulties induced the prince-bishop to transfer Daisendorf to the Free City of [[\u00dcberlingen]] in 1334. The prince-bishop reclaimed Daisendorf for 400 guilders in 1507. \n\nIn the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]] of 1803, in which the principalities of the ecclesiastic rulers were dispersed to the counts and princes of the empire, Daisendorf was given to the [[Electorate of Baden]].\n\n==Economy==\nDaisendorf is a popular tourist destination in the Lake of Constance region, featuring nice views of the [[Swiss Alps]] ([[S\u00e4ntis]]region) and the lake, as well as the charming flair of a diverse rural community.\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n\n=== Edifices ===\n[[File:Kapelle St. Martin (Daisendorf).jpg|thumb|left|Saint Martin Chapel in Daisendorf.]]\nThe village has an ancient [[chapel]] [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin]], which was built in 1508 and holds unique fresques of the renaissance age.\n\n=== Regular events ===\n[[File:Narrenbaum mit Kind.jpg|thumb|left|This is the fools tree (in allemannic: \"Narrebom\") with a green wreath and a child climbing the tree]]\n\nDaisendorf features several yearly happenings. \n* Carnival season.
