It is a conglomerate history of several ethnic groups of [[Chin people]] who migrated from [[Chin State]] of [[Burma]]. But information of their patterns of westward migration are based on [[oral history]] and [[archaeological]] inferences, hence nothing definite can be said. The [[recorded history]] started relatively recently around the mid-19th century when the adjoining regions were [[Crown colony|occupied by the British monarchy]]. The land is now inhabited by a mixture of people from [[Chin Hills]] and [[Bangladesh]] and its history is therefore largely reflected by those of [[Lusei people|Lusei]], [[Hmar people|Hmar]], [[Lai people|Lai]], [[Mara people|Mara]] and [[Chakma people|Chakmas]] tribes. Following religious, political and cultural revolutions in the mid-20th century majority of the people agglomerated into a super tribe, [[Mizo people|Mizo]]. Hence the officially recognised settlement of the Mizos became Mizoram.\n\nThe earliest documented records of Mizoram were from the British military officers in the 1850s, when they encountered series of raids in their official jurisdiction in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] from the neighbouring natives. By then they referred the land to as Lushai Hills. As a consequence of relentless tribal encroachment and often resulting in human mortality, British rulers were compelled to subjugate the [[tribal chiefdom]]s. Punitive British military expeditions in 1871 and 1889 forced the annexation of the entire Lushai Hills. After the [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] from [[British Empire]] in 1947, the land became Lushai Hills district under the [[Government of Assam]]. In 1972 the district was declared a [[union territory]] and was given a more culturally inclusive name Mizoram. Ultimately Mizoram became a full-fledged [[federated state|federal state]] of [[Indian Union]] in 1986.\n\n==Origin of the inhabitants==\n\nThe ancestors of Mizos were without any form of [[written language]] before the advent of British. They were [[anthropology|anthropologically]] identified as members of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman ethnicity]]. Folk legends unanimously claim that there was [[Sinlung|Chhinlung or Sinlung]] at the cradle of the Mizos. Oral history provided contrasting accounts on the origin.\n# One popular legend tells that the Mizos emerged from under a large covering rock known as ''[[Sinlung|Chhinlung]]'' (literally \"rock cover\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Zama|first=Margaret|title=Mizo Folklore|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:2EDmkf0Sg4UJ:wiki.indianfolklore.org/images/2/2f/IFL_34.pdf+&hl=en&gl=in&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShb5by6pbTUKLHeWrgItGfrwQ_W1KFl-xF7dTkqx7vhOJ_MNadwtLp2oR-Tg0G3TLjzR5jYsGtVB4pu7jNNKeH8M83frWgyev890ErSGsvmad_eS9aw0S_GkYuJfl3R5QnHH4fx&sig=AHIEtbT9WD0HbdoWV7JLKju9xTU6Rl5b6A|publisher=.indianfolklore.org|accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n# Another version says that Chhinlung refers to the [[China|Chinese]] city of Sinlung or Chinlingsang situated close on the Sino-Burmese border.

The Lushais were the last of the Mizo tribes to migrate to the [[Lushai Hills]]. By the time they crossed the [[Tiau River]] bordering [[Myanmar]], the descendants of Zahmuaka, who came to be known as the ruling Sailo clan, had proven their mettle as able and assertive chiefs. The traditional system of village administration, too, had been perfected. As the head of the village, the Chief or Lal allocated lands for cultivation, settled all disputes in the villages, fed and cared for the poor and offered shelter to anyone seeking refuge. The Mizo history in the 18th and 19th centuries is marked by many instances of tribal raids and retaliatory expeditions.<ref>{{cite book|last=T.

The chief, in the Mizo and other indigenous tribes enjoyed an eminent position in the society. Some chiefs were even raised to the position of a paramount chief or a paramount ruler or king. Under a paramount chief, there were a number of chiefs, of which most of them were brothers and there were few who were adopted as sons by a paramount chief. The position of chieftainship and paramount chieftainship (ruler) is based entirely on hereditary. The youngest son of the paramount chief (king) inherited the land, properties and tributes given to his father and his father's slaves, while the elder brothers got independent rule from their father at different areas of the neighbouring land. His elder brothers who got independent were expected to give warriors to the paramount chief (king) when called for by the paramount chief (king). Warriors of the sons of the paramount chief were called upon, especially when invading other lands. When a tributary chief failed to comply with the request of the paramount chief (king) or failed to pay tributes, their lands were invaded by the combined sons of the paramount chief. Invasion of the British Indian region during the 17th to 19th Century were also carried out by warriors of a paramount chief. These invasions to the British subjects were the result of the British expansion to the elephant hunting grounds of the Mizos. If the paramount chief(king) or chief died before his youngest son was becoming of age, the wife of the paramount chief or wife of the chief would rule the land as regent. Among the Mizo chiefs, the Sailos grew to paramountcy and ruled most of the land of the present day of Mizoram, including various parts of Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Myanmar and Bangladesh. When the British invaded their land, they successfully subjugated every paramount chiefs and chiefs as a result of advancement of the British. The various clans and subclans practiced slash-and-burn, locally called ''[[Jhum cultivation|jhum]]'' cultivation - a form of [[subsistence agriculture]]. The chiefs were the absolute rulers within their territories (''ram''), the chief and their warriors claimed their territories and also increased their territories by conquest. While claiming their land, the mizo warrior would always invade some parts of modern Assam, Tripura and Manipur. The British Administrators and authors often wrote about the Head-hunting practices of the Mizos. Most of the territories claimed by the mizo chiefs are present in the state of Mizoram. But some territories are in the present Assam, Tripura, Manipur, Bangladesh and Myanmar. There were many instances of tribal raids and head-hunting led by the village chieftains. Head-hunting was a practice which involved ambushing, taking slaves and decapitating heads of fighters from the enemy tribe, bringing it back home, and displaying it at the entrance of the tribal village.\n\n==British rule==\n\n===Initial encounters===\n\nBy the mid-19th century [[British Empire]] had [[imperialism|occupied]] all the surrounding [[Chittagong]] and [[Burma]] but had little or no interest in the tribes or their hilly land.

The campaign consisted two columns, the right advancing from Chittagong and the left from Cachar. General Brownlow, C.B., commanded the former, with Captain T.H. Lewin, Superintendent of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as Civil Officer. The Cachar column was led by General Bourchier, C.B., with Mr. Edgar, Deputy Commissioner, Cachar, as Civil Officer. In addition, a contingent of Manipuris accompanied by Colonel James Nuttall, the Political Agent of Manipur, made a demonstration across the southern border to co-operate with General Bourchier's portion of the expedition. The expedition started on 15 December 1871. The Mizo villages were crushed one by one, and Mary Winchester was rescued. Mizo chiefs made a truce not to make further attacks. Frontier posts were built to protect the border and bazaars were opened to encourage the Lushais to trade After a decade the truce was broken, and there erupted intermittent raids again. In 1889 British military organised another punitive expedition code named \"The Expedition of 1889\". It was commanded b Col. F.V.C. Tregear. From their camping site at Chawngte they started on 19 December 1888. They easily penetrated the southern villages with little resistance. They fortified at Lunglei and prepared locations and roads for the next expedition. After their completing their mission, they returned in April 1889. Then the major campaign called The Chin-Lushai Expedition 1889-90 immediately followed. Again divided into two columns, Chittagong column was commanded by Col. Tregear, and Cachar column by W.W. Daly. The Chittagong column occupied most of the southern region including Chin Hills by the end of 1889. The Cachar column camped at Aijal (now Aizawl) on 30 January 1890.

North and south hills were united into [[Lushai Hills]] district in 1898 with Aizawl as its headquarters. The process of the consolidation of the British administration in tribal dominated area in Assam started in 1919 when Lushai Hills, along with some of the other hill districts, was declared a \"Backward Tract\" under the 1919 [[Government of India Act 1919|Government of India Act]]. The tribal districts of Assam including Lushai Hills were declared \"Excluded Area\" in 1935. It was during the British regime that a political awakening among the Mizos in Lushai Hills started taking shape the first political party, the Mizo Common People's Union was formed on 9 April 1946. The Party was later renamed the [[Mizo Union]]. As the day of Independence drew nearer, the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] set up an advisory committee to deal with matters relating to the minorities and the tribal members. A sub-committee, under the chairmanship of [[Gopinath Bordoloi]] was formed to advise the Constituent Assembly on the tribal affairs in the North East. The Mizo Union submitted a resolution of this Sub-committee demanding inclusion of all Mizo-inhabited areas adjacent to Lushai Hills. However, a new party called the [[United Mizo Freedom Organisation]] (UMFO) came up to demand that Lushai Hills join Burma after [[Partition of India|Independence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Chaterjee|first=Suhas|title=Mizoram under the British rule|year=1985|publisher=Mittal Publication|page=225}}</ref>\n\n==Christianity and education==\n\nThe Mizo ancestors had no written language and in terms of religion they worshiped nature and revered natural phenomena.

The tribal leaders in the northeast were laboriously unhappy with the SRC recommendations. They met in Aizawl in 1955 and formed a new political party, Eastern India Union (EITU) and raised their demand for a separate state comprising all the hill districts of Assam.

It is a conglomerate history of several ethnic groups of [[Chin people]] who migrated from [[Chin State]] of [[Burma]]. But information of their patterns of westward migration are based on [[oral history]] and [[archaeological]] inferences, hence nothing definite can be said. The [[recorded history]] started relatively recently around the mid-19th century when the adjoining regions were [[Crown colony|occupied by the British monarchy]]. The land is now inhabited by a mixture of people from [[Chin Hills]] and [[Bangladesh]] and its history is therefore largely reflected by those of [[Lusei people|Lusei]], [[Hmar people|Hmar]], [[Lai people|Lai]], [[Mara people|Mara]] and [[Chakma people|Chakmas]] tribes. Following religious, political and cultural revolutions in the mid-20th century majority of the people agglomerated into a super tribe, [[Mizo people|Mizo]]. Hence the officially recognised settlement of the Mizos became Mizoram.\n\nThe earliest documented records of Mizoram were from the British military officers in the 1850s, when they encountered series of raids in their official jurisdiction in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] from the neighbouring natives. By then they referred the land to as Lushai Hills. As a consequence of relentless tribal encroachment and often resulting in human mortality, British rulers were compelled to subjugate the [[tribal chiefdom]]s. Punitive British military expeditions in 1871 and 1889 forced the annexation of the entire Lushai Hills. After the [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] from [[British Empire]] in 1947, the land became Lushai Hills district under the [[Government of Assam]]. In 1972 the district was declared a [[union territory]] and was given a more culturally inclusive name Mizoram. Ultimately Mizoram became a full-fledged [[federated state|federal state]] of [[Indian Union]] in 1986.\n\n==Origin of the inhabitants==\n\nThe ancestors of Mizos were without any form of [[written language]] before the advent of British. They were [[anthropology|anthropologically]] identified as members of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman ethnicity]]. Folk legends unanimously claim that there was [[Sinlung|Chhinlung or Sinlung]] at the cradle of the Mizos. Oral history provided contrasting accounts on the origin.\n# One popular legend tells that the Mizos emerged from under a large covering rock known as ''[[Sinlung|Chhinlung]]'' (literally \"rock cover\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Zama|first=Margaret|title=Mizo Folklore|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:2EDmkf0Sg4UJ:wiki.indianfolklore.org/images/2/2f/IFL_34.pdf+&hl=en&gl=in&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShb5by6pbTUKLHeWrgItGfrwQ_W1KFl-xF7dTkqx7vhOJ_MNadwtLp2oR-Tg0G3TLjzR5jYsGtVB4pu7jNNKeH8M83frWgyev890ErSGsvmad_eS9aw0S_GkYuJfl3R5QnHH4fx&sig=AHIEtbT9WD0HbdoWV7JLKju9xTU6Rl5b6A|publisher=.indianfolklore.org|accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n# Another version says that Chhinlung refers to the [[China|Chinese]] city of Sinlung or Chinlingsang situated close on the Sino-Burmese border.

By the time they crossed the [[Tiau River]] bordering [[Myanmar]], the descendants of Zahmuaka, who came to be known as the ruling Sailo clan, had proven their mettle as able and assertive chiefs. The traditional system of village administration, too, had been perfected. As the head of the village, the Chief or Lal allocated lands for cultivation, settled all disputes in the villages, fed and cared for the poor and offered shelter to anyone seeking refuge. The Mizo history in the 18th and 19th centuries is marked by many instances of tribal raids and retaliatory expeditions.<ref>{{cite book|last=T.

The chief, in the Mizo and other indigenous tribes enjoyed an eminent position in the society. Some chiefs were even raised to the position of a paramount chief or a paramount ruler or king. Under a paramount chief, there were a number of chiefs, of which most of them were brothers and there were few who were adopted as sons by a paramount chief. The position of chieftainship and paramount chieftainship (ruler) is based entirely on hereditary. The youngest son of the paramount chief (king) inherited the land, properties and tributes given to his father and his father's slaves, while the elder brothers got independent rule from their father at different areas of the neighbouring land. His elder brothers who got independent were expected to give warriors to the paramount chief (king) when called for by the paramount chief (king). Warriors of the sons of the paramount chief were called upon, especially when invading other lands. When a tributary chief failed to comply with the request of the paramount chief (king) or failed to pay tributes, their lands were invaded by the combined sons of the paramount chief. Invasion of the British Indian region during the 17th to 19th Century were also carried out by warriors of a paramount chief. These invasions to the British subjects were the result of the British expansion to the elephant hunting grounds of the Mizos. If the paramount chief(king) or chief died before his youngest son was becoming of age, the wife of the paramount chief or wife of the chief would rule the land as regent. Among the Mizo chiefs, the Sailos grew to paramountcy and ruled most of the land of the present day of Mizoram, including various parts of Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Myanmar and Bangladesh. When the British invaded their land, they successfully subjugated every paramount chiefs and chiefs as a result of advancement of the British. The various clans and subclans practiced slash-and-burn, locally called ''[[Jhum cultivation|jhum]]'' cultivation - a form of [[subsistence agriculture]]. The chiefs were the absolute rulers within their territories (''ram''), the chief and their warriors claimed their territories and also increased their territories by conquest. While claiming their land, the mizo warrior would always invade some parts of modern Assam, Tripura and Manipur. The British Administrators and authors often wrote about the Head-hunting practices of the Mizos. Most of the territories claimed by the mizo chiefs are present in the state of Mizoram. But some territories are in the present Assam, Tripura, Manipur, Bangladesh and Myanmar. There were many instances of tribal raids and head-hunting led by the village chieftains. Head-hunting was a practice which involved ambushing, taking slaves and decapitating heads of fighters from the enemy tribe, bringing it back home, and displaying it at the entrance of the tribal village.\n\n==British rule==\n\n===Initial encounters===\n\nBy the mid-19th century [[British Empire]] had [[imperialism|occupied]] all the surrounding [[Chittagong]] and [[Burma]] but had little or no interest in the tribes or their hilly land.

The campaign consisted two columns, the right advancing from Chittagong and the left from Cachar. General Brownlow, C.B., commanded the former, with Captain T.H. Lewin, Superintendent of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as Civil Officer. The Cachar column was led by General Bourchier, C.B., with Mr. Edgar, Deputy Commissioner, Cachar, as Civil Officer. In addition, a contingent of Manipuris accompanied by Colonel James Nuttall, the Political Agent of Manipur, made a demonstration across the southern border to co-operate with General Bourchier's portion of the expedition. The expedition started on 15 December 1871. The Mizo villages were crushed one by one, and Mary Winchester was rescued. Mizo chiefs made a truce not to make further attacks. Frontier posts were built to protect the border and bazaars were opened to encourage the Lushais to trade After a decade the truce was broken, and there erupted intermittent raids again. In 1889 British military organised another punitive expedition code named \"The Expedition of 1889\". It was commanded b Col. F.V.C. Tregear. From their camping site at Chawngte they started on 19 December 1888. They easily penetrated the southern villages with little resistance. They fortified at Lunglei and prepared locations and roads for the next expedition. After their completing their mission, they returned in April 1889. Then the major campaign called The Chin-Lushai Expedition 1889-90 immediately followed. Again divided into two columns, Chittagong column was commanded by Col. Tregear, and Cachar column by W.W. Daly. The Chittagong column occupied most of the southern region including Chin Hills by the end of 1889. The Cachar column camped at Aijal (now Aizawl) on 30 January 1890.

North and south hills were united into [[Lushai Hills]] district in 1898 with Aizawl as its headquarters. The process of the consolidation of the British administration in tribal dominated area in Assam started in 1919 when Lushai Hills, along with some of the other hill districts, was declared a \"Backward Tract\" under the 1919 [[Government of India Act 1919|Government of India Act]]. The tribal districts of Assam including Lushai Hills were declared \"Excluded Area\" in 1935. It was during the British regime that a political awakening among the Mizos in Lushai Hills started taking shape the first political party, the Mizo Common People's Union was formed on 9 April 1946. The Party was later renamed the [[Mizo Union]]. As the day of Independence drew nearer, the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] set up an advisory committee to deal with matters relating to the minorities and the tribal members. A sub-committee, under the chairmanship of [[Gopinath Bordoloi]] was formed to advise the Constituent Assembly on the tribal affairs in the North East. The Mizo Union submitted a resolution of this Sub-committee demanding inclusion of all Mizo-inhabited areas adjacent to Lushai Hills. However, a new party called the [[United Mizo Freedom Organisation]] (UMFO) came up to demand that Lushai Hills join Burma after [[Partition of India|Independence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Chaterjee|first=Suhas|title=Mizoram under the British rule|year=1985|publisher=Mittal Publication|page=225}}</ref>\n\n==Christianity and education==\n\nThe Mizo ancestors had no written language and in terms of religion they worshiped nature and revered natural phenomena.

The tribal leaders in the northeast were laboriously unhappy with the SRC recommendations. They met in Aizawl in 1955 and formed a new political party, Eastern India Union (EITU) and raised their demand for a separate state comprising all the hill districts of Assam.

The NTSB determined that the flight crew mismanaged the initial approach and that the airplane was well above the desired glidepath. In response, the captain selected an inappropriate autopilot mode (FLCH, or Flight Level Change) that, without the captain's awareness, resulted in the autothrottle no longer controlling airspeed. The aircraft then descended below the desired glidepath with the crew unaware of the decreasing airspeed. The attempted go-around was conducted below 100&nbsp;feet, by which time it was too late. Over-reliance on automation and lack of systems understanding by the pilots were cited as major factors contributing to the accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2014/140624.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625133742/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2014/140624.html |archivedate=June 25, 2014  }}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB further determined that the pilot's faulty mental model of the airplane's automation logic led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. In addition, Asiana's automation policy emphasized the full use of all automation and did not encourage manual flight during line operations. The flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's vertical profile during the initial approach led to a period of increased workload that reduced the pilot monitoring's awareness of the pilot flying's actions around the time of the unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control. Insufficient flight crew monitoring of airspeed indications during the approach likely resulted from expectancy, increased workload, fatigue, and automation reliance.  Lack of compliance with [[standard operating procedure]]s and [[crew resource management]] were cited as additional factors.<ref name=\"ntsb.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html|title=Crash of Asiana Flight 214 Accident Report Summary |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625051127/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html |archivedate=June 25, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB reached the following final conclusion:\n\n{{quote|The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the flight crew's inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the flight crew's delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances. Contributing to the accident were (1) the complexities of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing's documentation and Asiana's  pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error; (2) the flight crew's nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems; (3) the pilot flying's inadequate training on the planning and executing of visual approaches; (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the pilot flying; and (5) flight crew fatigue, which likely degraded their performance.<ref name=\"AAR-14-01 Final Report\"/>{{rp|129}}}}\n\n=== Timeline of the accident ===\n[[File:Asiana Flight 214 Crash NTSB Animation.ogv|thumb|NTSB animation reconstructing the failed descent]]\n[[File:NTSBAsiana214MapFlightOverview.jpg|thumb|Descent flight path]]\nAccording to the NTSB, the weather was fair and the aircraft was cleared for a visual approach.<ref name=\"NYTimesWater\"/><ref name=\"YoutubeNTSB070813\"/>\n\nThe [[instrument landing system]]'s vertical guidance (glide slope) on runway 28L was out of service, as scheduled, beginning on June 1 (and a [[NOTAM|Notice To Airmen]] (NOTAM) to that effect had been issued);<ref>{{cite web|title=KSFO San Francisco Intl |work=PilotWeb |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |quote=06/005 SFO navigation instrument landing system Runway 28L glide path out of service with effect from or effective from 1306011400-1308222359 |url=https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/notamRetrievalByICAOAction.do?method=displayByICAOs&formatType=ICAO&retrieveLocId=KSFO&reportType=RAW&actionType=notamRetrievalByICAOs |accessdate=July 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929162007/https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/notamRetrievalByICAOAction.do?method=displayByICAOs&formatType=ICAO&retrieveLocId=KSFO&reportType=RAW&actionType=notamRetrievalByICAOs |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> therefore, a precision [[Instrument approach|ILS approach]] to this runway was not possible.\n\nPreliminary analysis indicated that the plane's approach was too slow and too low.

The NTSB determined that the flight crew mismanaged the initial approach and that the airplane was well above the desired glidepath. In response, the captain selected an inappropriate autopilot mode (FLCH, or Flight Level Change) that, without the captain's awareness, resulted in the autothrottle no longer controlling airspeed. The aircraft then descended below the desired glidepath with the crew unaware of the decreasing airspeed. The attempted go-around was conducted below 100&nbsp;feet, by which time it was too late. Over-reliance on automation and lack of systems understanding by the pilots were cited as major factors contributing to the accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2014/140624.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625133742/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2014/140624.html |archivedate=June 25, 2014  }}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB further determined that the pilot's faulty mental model of the airplane's automation logic led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. In addition, Asiana's automation policy emphasized the full use of all automation and did not encourage manual flight during line operations. The flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's vertical profile during the initial approach led to a period of increased workload that reduced the pilot monitoring's awareness of the pilot flying's actions around the time of the unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control. Insufficient flight crew monitoring of airspeed indications during the approach likely resulted from expectancy, increased workload, fatigue, and automation reliance.  Lack of compliance with [[standard operating procedure]]s and [[crew resource management]] were cited as additional factors.<ref name=\"ntsb.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html|title=Crash of Asiana Flight 214 Accident Report Summary |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625051127/http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html |archivedate=June 25, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe NTSB reached the following final conclusion:\n\n{{quote|The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the flight crew's inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the flight crew's delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances. Contributing to the accident were (1) the complexities of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing's documentation and Asiana's  pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error; (2) the flight crew's nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems; (3) the pilot flying's inadequate training on the planning and executing of visual approaches; (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the pilot flying; and (5) flight crew fatigue, which likely degraded their performance.<ref name=\"AAR-14-01 Final Report\"/>{{rp|129}}}}\n\n=== Timeline of the accident ===\n[[File:Asiana Flight 214 Crash NTSB Animation.ogv|thumb|NTSB animation reconstructing the failed descent]]\n[[File:NTSBAsiana214MapFlightOverview.jpg|thumb|Descent flight path]]\nAccording to the NTSB, the weather was fair and the aircraft was cleared for a visual approach.<ref name=\"NYTimesWater\"/><ref name=\"YoutubeNTSB070813\"/>\n\nThe [[instrument landing system]]'s vertical guidance (glide slope) on runway 28L was out of service, as scheduled, beginning on June 1 (and a [[NOTAM|Notice To Airmen]] (NOTAM) to that effect had been issued);<ref>{{cite web|title=KSFO San Francisco Intl |work=PilotWeb |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |quote=06/005 SFO navigation instrument landing system Runway 28L glide path out of service with effect from or effective from 1306011400-1308222359 |url=https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/notamRetrievalByICAOAction.do?method=displayByICAOs&formatType=ICAO&retrieveLocId=KSFO&reportType=RAW&actionType=notamRetrievalByICAOs |accessdate=July 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929162007/https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/PilotWeb/notamRetrievalByICAOAction.do?method=displayByICAOs&formatType=ICAO&retrieveLocId=KSFO&reportType=RAW&actionType=notamRetrievalByICAOs |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> therefore, a precision [[Instrument approach|ILS approach]] to this runway was not possible.\n\nPreliminary analysis indicated that the plane's approach was too slow and too low.

The theory that light waves can be acted upon the same way as radio waves is now a popular idea among scientists. The agent can be compared to a stone in a river, around which water passes, but slightly down-stream leaves no trace of the stone. Comparing light waves to the water, and whatever object that is being \"cloaked\" to the stone, the goal is to have light waves pass around that object, leaving no visible aspects of it, possibly not even a shadow.<ref>{{cite news | first = Adrian | last = Cho | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/312/5777/1120a | title = High-Tech Materials Could Render Objects Invisible | work = Science | page = 1120 |date=2006-05-26 | accessdate = 2006-08-01}}</ref> This is the technique depicted in the 2000 television portrayal of [[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]].\n\nTwo teams of scientists worked separately to create two \"Invisibility Cloaks\" from '[[metamaterials]]' engineered at the [[nanoscale]] level. They demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional (3-D) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar, light or other waves around an object. While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the [[University of California]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] said: \"In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock. An observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it, making it seem to disappear.\"\n\n[[UC Berkeley]] researcher Jason Valentine's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum, in a region used in fibre optics: 'Instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water, it would actually appear to be above the water's surface. It's kind of weird. For a metamaterial to produce negative refraction, it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used.\" Valentine's team created their 'fishnet' material by stacking silver and metal dielectric layers on top of each other and then punching holes through them. The other team used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This material refracts visible light.\n\nThe [[Imperial College London]] research team achieved results with [[microwaves]]. An invisibility cloak layout of a copper cylinder was produced in May, 2008, by physicist Professor Sir [[John Pendry]]. Scientists working with him at [[Duke University]] in the US put the idea into practice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |website=themoneytimes.com |title=Scientists Turn Fiction Into Reality, Closer to Make Objects \"Invisible\" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816035413/http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |archive-date=2008-08-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/11/secrets-of-invisibility-discovered-115875-20692852/ |website=mirror.co.uk |title=Secrets of invisibility discovered}}</ref>\n\nPendry, who theorized the invisibility cloak \"as a joke\" to illustrate the potential of metamaterials, said in an interview in August 2011 that grand, theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown: \"I think it\u2019s pretty sure that any cloak that Harry Potter would recognize is not on the table. You could dream up some theory, but the very practicality of making it would be so impossible. But can you hide things from light? Yes. Can you hide things which are a few centimeters across? Yes. Is the cloak really flexible and flappy? No. Will it ever be? No. So you can do quite a lot of things, but there are limitations.

The agent can be compared to a stone in a river, around which water passes, but slightly down-stream leaves no trace of the stone. Comparing light waves to the water, and whatever object that is being \"cloaked\" to the stone, the goal is to have light waves pass around that object, leaving no visible aspects of it, possibly not even a shadow.<ref>{{cite news | first = Adrian | last = Cho | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/312/5777/1120a | title = High-Tech Materials Could Render Objects Invisible | work = Science | page = 1120 |date=2006-05-26 | accessdate = 2006-08-01}}</ref> This is the technique depicted in the 2000 television portrayal of [[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]].\n\nTwo teams of scientists worked separately to create two \"Invisibility Cloaks\" from '[[metamaterials]]' engineered at the [[nanoscale]] level. They demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional (3-D) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar, light or other waves around an object. While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the [[University of California]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] said: \"In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock. An observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it, making it seem to disappear.\"\n\n[[UC Berkeley]] researcher Jason Valentine's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum, in a region used in fibre optics: 'Instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water, it would actually appear to be above the water's surface. It's kind of weird. For a metamaterial to produce negative refraction, it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used.\" Valentine's team created their 'fishnet' material by stacking silver and metal dielectric layers on top of each other and then punching holes through them. The other team used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This material refracts visible light.\n\nThe [[Imperial College London]] research team achieved results with [[microwaves]]. An invisibility cloak layout of a copper cylinder was produced in May, 2008, by physicist Professor Sir [[John Pendry]]. Scientists working with him at [[Duke University]] in the US put the idea into practice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |website=themoneytimes.com |title=Scientists Turn Fiction Into Reality, Closer to Make Objects \"Invisible\" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816035413/http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |archive-date=2008-08-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/11/secrets-of-invisibility-discovered-115875-20692852/ |website=mirror.co.uk |title=Secrets of invisibility discovered}}</ref>\n\nPendry, who theorized the invisibility cloak \"as a joke\" to illustrate the potential of metamaterials, said in an interview in August 2011 that grand, theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown: \"I think it\u2019s pretty sure that any cloak that Harry Potter would recognize is not on the table. You could dream up some theory, but the very practicality of making it would be so impossible. But can you hide things from light? Yes. Can you hide things which are a few centimeters across? Yes.

But since the character is not truly invisible, the effect could be betrayed by mirrors or other reflective surfaces.\n\nWhere [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] invisibility is concerned, the issue may arise of whether the [[clothing]] worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible.

Miyoshi merged with neighboring villages in 1906 to reach its present geographic borders and was raised to town status on April 1, 1958. During 2003\u20132005, discussions were held to merge Miyoshi with the city of Toyota, but the merger proposal was strongly opposed by the majority of the inhabitants of Miyoshi. As a result, the merger did not take place, and instead Miyoshi was elevated to city status on January 4, 2010. With its change in status, Miyoshi changed the spelling of its name from ''[[kanji]]'' (\u4e09\u597d) to ''[[hiragana]]'' (\u307f\u3088\u3057)\n\n==Government==\nMiyoshi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 20 members. The city contributes one member to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly.

Miyoshi Village was created within [[Nishikamo District, Aichi|Nishikamo District]], Aichi Prefecture on October 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system in the early [[Meiji period]]. Miyoshi merged with neighboring villages in 1906 to reach its present geographic borders and was raised to town status on April 1, 1958. During 2003-2005, discussions were held to merge Miyoshi with the city of Toyota, but the merger proposal was strongly opposed by the majority of the inhabitants of Miyoshi. As a result, the merger did not take place, and instead Miyoshi was elevated to city status on January 4, 2010. With its change in status, Miyoshi changed the spelling of its name from ''[[kanji]]'' (\u4e09\u597d) to ''[[hiragana]]'' (\u307f\u3088\u3057)\n\n==Government==\nMiyoshi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 20 members. The city contributes one member to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly.  In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aichi District 11 of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].\n\n==Economy==\nMiyoshi is a regional commercial center, and has a very industrial economy, with many factories producing automobiles or automotive-related components, mostly connected with [[Toyota]] Corporation.

This history is pieced together from evidence retrieved from archaeological excavations and, after the introduction of writing in the late 4th millennium BC, an increasing amount of historical sources. While in the Paleolithic and early Neolithic periods only parts of Upper Mesopotamia were occupied, the southern alluvium was settled during the late Neolithic period. Mesopotamia has been home to many of the oldest major civilizations, entering history from the [[Early Bronze Age]], for which reason it is often dubbed the [[cradle of civilization]].\n\n==Short outline of Mesopotamia==\n{{Main|Mesopotamia|Geography of Mesopotamia}}\n[[File:Fertile crescent Neolithic B circa 7500 BC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Area of the [[Fertile Crescent]], circa 7500 BC, with main archaeological sites of the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] period.

Clay was all around and the main material; often modelled figures were painted with black decoration. Carefully crafted and dyed pots, especially jugs and bowls,  were traded.

This is strengthened by the find of a sealing at Jemdet Nasr that lists a number of cities that can be identified, including [[Ur]], [[Uruk]] and [[Larsa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Matthews|2002|pp=33\u201337}}</ref>\n\n===Early Dynastic period===\n{{Main|Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)}}\n[[File:Golden helmet of Meskalamdug in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Golden helmet of [[Meskalamdug]], possible founder of the [[First Dynasty of Ur]], 26th century BCE.]]\nThe entire Early Dynastic period is generally dated to 2900\u20132350 BC according to the [[Middle chronology|Middle Chronology]], or 2800\u20132230 BC according to the [[Short chronology timeline|Short Chronology]].<ref name=pruss2004>{{harvnb|Pru\u00df|2004}}</ref> The [[Sumer]]ians were firmly established in Mesopotamia by the middle of the 4th millennium BC, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived.<ref>{{harvnb|Woolley|1965|p=9}}</ref> It is hard to tell where the Sumerians might have come from because the Sumerian language is a [[language isolate]], unrelated to any other known language. Their [[Mesopotamian mythology|mythology]] includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been there for a long time. The [[Sumerian language]] is identifiable from its initially [[logograph]]ic [[history of writing|script]] which arose last half of the 4th millennium BC.\n\nBy the 3rd millennium BC, these [[city|urban centers]] had developed into increasingly complex societies. Irrigation and other means of exploiting food sources were being used to amass large surpluses. Huge building projects were being undertaken by rulers, and political organization was becoming ever more sophisticated. Throughout the millennium, the various [[city-states]] [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], Uruk, Ur and Lagash vied for power and gained hegemony at various times. [[Nippur]] and [[Girsu]] were important religious centers, as was Eridu at this point. This was also the time of [[Gilgamesh]], a semi-historical king of Uruk, and the subject of the famous ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. By 2600 BC, the logographic script had developed into a decipherable [[cuneiform]] [[syllabary|syllabic]] script.\n\n[[File:Mesopotamian Chronology 2-2011-29-03.png|thumb|left|Chronology of the main dominations]]\nThe chronology of this era is particularly uncertain due to difficulties in our understanding of the text, our understanding of the material culture of the Early Dynastic period and a general lack of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] for sites in Iraq. Also, the multitude of city-states makes for a confusing situation, as each has its own history. The [[Sumerian king list]] is one record of the political history of the period. It starts with mythological figures with improbably long reigns, but later rulers have been authenticated with [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence. The first of these is [[Enmebaragesi]] of Kish, c. 2600 BC, said by the king list to have subjected neighboring [[Elam]]. However, one complication of the Sumerian king list is that although dynasties are listed in sequential order, some of them actually ruled at the same time over different areas.\n\n[[File:Mesopotamia, Periodo proto-dinastico, placca con scena di banchetto, da khafajah, 2650-2550 ac ca.jpg|thumb|Banquet scene, [[Khafajah]], c. 2650-2550 BC.]]\n[[Enshakushanna]] of Uruk conquered all of Sumer, Akkad, and [[Hamazi]], followed by [[Eannatum]] of Lagash who also conquered Sumer. His methods were force and intimidation (see the [[Stele of the Vultures]]), and soon after his death, the cities rebelled and the empire again fell apart. Some time later, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] created the first, if short-lived, empire to extend west of Mesopotamia, at least according to historical accounts dated centuries later. The last native Sumerian to rule over most of Sumer before [[Sargon of Akkad]] established supremacy was [[Lugal-Zage-Si]].\n\nDuring the 3rd millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name=Deutscher>{{harvnb|Deutscher|2007|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> The influence of Sumerian on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name=Deutscher/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name=Deutscher/>\n\nAkkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name=woods>{{harvnb|Woods|2006}}</ref> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.\n\n===Akkadian Empire===\n{{Main|Akkadian Empire}}\n[[File:Empire akkad.svg|260px|thumb|Map of the [[Akkadian Empire]] (brown) and the directions in which military campaigns were conducted (yellow arrows)]]\n[[File:Ur III.svg|260px|thumb|Map of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III]] state (brown) and its influence sphere (red)]]\nThe Akkadian period is generally dated to 2350\u20132170 BC according to the [[Middle Chronology]], or 2230\u20132050 BC according to the [[Short chronology timeline|Short Chronology]].<ref name=pruss2004/> Around 2334 BC, Sargon became ruler of Akkad in northern [[Mesopotamia]]. He proceeded to conquer an area stretching from the [[Persian Gulf]] into modern-day [[Syria]]. The Akkadians were a [[Semitic people]] and the [[Akkadian language]] came into widespread use as the [[lingua franca]] during this period, but literacy remained in the Sumerian language. The Akkadians further developed the Sumerian irrigation system with the incorporation of large [[weirs]] and [[Dams|diversion dams]] into the design to facilitate the reservoirs and canals required to transport water vast distances.<ref>http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115CH17oldirrigation.html</ref> The dynasty continued until around c. 2154 BC, and reached its zenith under [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], who began the trend for rulers to claim divinity for themselves.\n\nThe Akkadian Empire lost power after the reign of Naram-Sin, and eventually was invaded by the [[Gutian dynasty of Sumer|Guti]] from the [[Zagros Mountains]]. For half a century the Guti controlled Mesopotamia, especially the south, but they left few inscriptions, so they are not well understood. The Guti hold loosened on southern Mesopotamia, where the second dynasty of Lagash came into prominence. Its most famous ruler was [[Gudea]], who left many statues of himself in temples across Sumer.\n\n===Ur III period===\n{{Main|Third Dynasty of Ur}}\nEventually the Guti were overthrown by [[Utu-hengal]] of Uruk, and the various city-states again vied for power. Power over the area finally went to the city-state of Ur, when [[Ur-Nammu]] founded the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III Empire]] (2112\u20132004 BC) and conquered the Sumerian region. Under his son [[Shulgi]], state control over industry reached a level never again seen in the region. Shulgi may have devised the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], one of the earliest known [[Cuneiform law|law codes]] (three centuries before the more famous [[Code of Hammurabi]]). Around 2000 BC, the power of Ur waned, and the [[Amorites]] came to occupy much of the area, although it was Sumer's long-standing rivals to the east, the Elamites, who finally overthrew Ur. In the north, Assyria remained free of Amorite control until the very end of the 19th century BC. This marked the end of city-states ruling empires in Mesopotamia, and the end of Sumerian dominance, but the succeeding rulers adopted much of Sumerian civilization as their own.\n\n==Second millennium BC==\n\n===Old Assyrian Period===\nOf the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. The [[Assyrian King List]] mentions rulers going back to the 23rd and 22nd century BC. The earliest king named [[Tudiya]], who was a contemporary of [[Ibrium]] of [[Ebla]], appears to have lived in the mid-23rd century BC, according to the king list. Tudiya concluded a treaty with Ibrium for the use of a trading post in [[the Levant]] officially controlled by Ebla. Apart from this reference to trading activity, nothing further has yet been discovered about Tudiya. He was succeeded by [[Adamu (Assyrian king)|Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers about all of whom nothing is yet known. These early kings from the 23rd to late 21st centuries BC, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'' were likely to have been semi nomadic pastoralist rulers, nominally independent but subject to the Akkadian Empire, who dominated the region and at some point during this period became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Assur|Ashur]].<ref>Saggs, ''The Might'', 24.</ref> A king named [[Ushpia]] (c. 2030 BC) is credited with dedicating temples to [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] in the home city of the god. In around 1975 BC [[Puzur-Ashur I]] founded a new dynasty, and his successors such as [[Shalim-ahum]], [[Ilushuma]] (1945\u20131906 BC), [[Erishum I]] (1905\u20131867 BC), [[Ikunum]] (1867\u20131860 BC), [[Sargon I]], [[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Sin]] and [[Puzur-Ashur II]] left inscriptions regarding the building of temples to [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], [[Adad]] and [[Ishtar]] in Assyria. [[Ilushuma]] in particular appears to have been a powerful king and the dominant ruler in the region, who made many raids into southern [[Mesopotamia]] between 1945 BC and 1906 BC, attacking the independent [[Sumero-Akkadian]] city states of the region such as [[Isin]], and founding colonies in [[Asia Minor]]. This was to become a pattern throughout the history of ancient Mesopotamia with the future rivalry between Assyria and Babylonia. However, Babylonia did not exist at this time, but was founded in 1894 BC by an [[Amorite]] prince named [[Sumuabum]] during the reign of Erishum I.\n\n===Isin-Larsa, Old Babylonian and Shamshi-Adad I===\n[[File:Cylinder seal and modern impression Presentation scene,ca. 2000\u20131750 B.C.

This period also marked a growth in power in the north of Mesopotamia. An [[Assyria]]n king named [[Ilushuma]] (1945\u20131906 BC) became a dominant figure in Mesopotamia, raiding the southern city states and founding colonies in [[Asia Minor]]. [[Eshnunna]] and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], two [[Amorite]] ruled states also became important in the north.\n\n[[Babylonia]] was founded as an independent state by an [[Amorite]] chieftain named [[Sumuabum]] in 1894 BC. For over a century after its founding, it was a minor and relatively weak state, overshadowed by older and more powerful states such as [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Assyria]] and [[Elam]]. However, [[Hammurabi]] (1792 BC to 1750 BC), the Amorite ruler of [[Babylon]], turned Babylon into a major power and eventually conquered Mesopotamia and beyond. He is famous for his [[code of Hammurabi|law code]] and conquests, but he is also famous due to the large amount of records that exist from the period of his reign. After the death of Hammurabi, the first Babylonian dynasty lasted for another century and a half, but his empire quickly unravelled, and Babylon once more became a small state. The Amorite dynasty ended in 1595 BC, when Babylonia fell to the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Mursili I|Mursilis]], after which the [[Kassites]] took control.\n\nUnlike the south of Mesopotamia, the native Akkadian kings of Assyria repelled Amorite advances during the 20th and 19th centuries BC. However this changed in 1813 BC when an Amorite king named [[Shamshi-Adad I]] usurped the throne of Assyria. Although claiming descendency from the native Assyrian king [[Ushpia]], he was regarded as an interloper. Shamshi-Adad I created a regional empire in Assyria, maintaining and expanding the established colonies in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]]. His son [[Ishme-Dagan I]] continued this process, however his successors were eventually conquered by [[Hammurabi]], a fellow Amorite from Babylon. The three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan were vassals of Hammurabi, but after his death, a native Akkadian vice regent [[Puzur-Sin]] overthrew the Amorites of Babylon and a period of civil war with multiple claimants to the throne ensued, ending with the succession of king [[Adasi]] c. 1720 BC.\n\n===Middle Assyrian Period and Empire===\nThe Middle Assyrian period begins c. 1720 BC with the ejection of Amorites and Babylonians from Assyria by a king called [[Adasi]]. The nation remained relatively strong and stable, peace was made with the Kassite rulers of Babylonia, and Assyria was free from Hittite, Hurrian, Gutian, Elamite and Mitanni threat. However a period of [[Mitanni]] domination occurred from the mid-15th to early 14th centuries BC. This was ended by [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392 BC - 1366), and his successor [[Ashur-uballit I]] completely overthrew the [[Mitanni]] Empire and founded a powerful [[Assyrian Empire]] that came to dominate Mesopotamia and much of the ancient [[Near East]] (including [[Babylonia]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Iran]], the [[Levant]] and parts of the [[Caucasus]] and [[Arabia]]), with Assyrian armies campaigning from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]], and from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Arabia]]. The empire endured until 1076 BC with the death of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period Assyria became a major power, overthrowing the [[Mitanni]] Empire, annexing swathes of [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Hurrian]] and [[Amorite]] land, sacking and dominating [[Babylon]], [[Canaan]]/[[Phoenicia]] and becoming a rival to [[Egypt]].\n\n===Kassite dynasty of Babylon===\n{{Main|Kassites}}\nAlthough the Hittites overthrew Babylon, another people, the [[Kassites]], took it as their capital (c. 1650\u20131155 BC (short chronology)). They have the distinction of being the longest lasting dynasty in Babylon, reigning for over four centuries. They left few records, so this period is unfortunately obscure. They are of unknown origin; what little we have of their language suggests it is a [[language isolate]]. Although Babylonia maintained its independence through this period, it was not a power in the Near East, and mostly sat out the large wars fought over the [[Levant]] between [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Hittite Empire]], and [[Mitanni]] (see below), as well as independent peoples in the region. [[Assyria]] participated in these wars toward the end of the period, overthrowing the [[Mitanni]] Empire and besting the [[Hittites]] and [[Phrygians]], but the Kassites in Babylon did not. They did, however, fight against their longstanding rival to the east, Elam (related by some linguists to the [[Dravidian languages]] in modern India). Babylonia found itself under Assyrian and Elamite domination for much of the later Kassite period. In the end, the [[Elamites]] conquered Babylon, bringing this period to an end.\n\n===Hurrians===\n[[File:Cylinder seal,ca. 16th\u201315th century BC Mitanni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal,ca. 16th\u201315th century BC, Mitanni]]\n{{Main|Mitanni}}\nThe [[Hurrians]] were a people who settled in northwestern Mesopotamia and southeast Anatolia in 1600 BC. By 1450 BC they established a medium-sized empire under a [[Mitanni]] ruling class, and temporarily made tributary vassals out of kings in the west, making them a major threat for the [[Pharaoh]] in Egypt until their overthrow by Assyria. The [[Hurrian language]] is related to the later [[Urartian language|Urartian]], but there is no conclusive evidence these two languages are related to any others.\n\n===Hittites===\n{{Main|Hittites}}\nBy 1300 BC the Hurrians had been reduced to their homelands in [[Asia Minor]] after their power was broken by the Assyrians and Hittites, and held the status of vassals to the \"Hatti\", the [[Hittites]], a western [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] people (belonging to the linguistic \"kentum\" group) who dominated most of [[Asia Minor]] (modern [[Turkey]]) at this time from their capital of [[Hattusa]]. The Hittites came into conflict with the Assyrians from the mid-14th to the 13th centuries BC, losing territory to the Assyrian kings of the period. However they endured until being finally swept aside by the [[Phrygians]], who conquered their homelands in Asia Minor. The Phrygians were prevented from moving south into Mesopotamia by the Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. The Hittites fragmented into a number of small [[Neo-Hittite]] states, which endured in the region for many centuries.\n\n===Bronze Age collapse===\n{{Main|Bronze Age collapse}}\nRecords from the 12th and 11th centuries BC are sparse in Babylonia, which had been overrun with new [[Semitic people|Semitic]] settlers, namely the [[Arameans]], [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]] and [[Shutu|Sutu]]. Assyria however, remained a compact and strong nation, which continued to provide much written record. The 10th century BC is even worse for Babylonia, with very few inscriptions. Mesopotamia was not alone in this obscurity: the Hittite Empire fell at the beginning of this period and very few records are known from Egypt and Elam. This was a time of invasion and upheaval by many new people throughout the Near East, North Africa, The Caucasus, Mediterranean, Childwall and Balkan regions.\n\n==First millennium BC==\n\n===Neo-Assyrian Empire===\n{{Main|Neo-Assyrian Empire}}\n[[File:Assyrian Crown-Prince MET DP-13006-005.jpg|thumb|Assyrian Crown-Prince, ca. 704\u2013681 BC. [[Nineveh]], Mesopotamia. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]\nThe Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of Adad-nirari II, in 911 BC, lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the Babylonians, Medes, Scythians and Cimmerians in 612 BC. The empire was the largest and most powerful the world had yet seen. At its height Assyria conquered the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty Egypt]] (and expelled its [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] dynasty) as well as [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites]], [[Hurrians]], northern [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]] and parts of [[Ancient Greece]] (such as [[Cyprus]]), and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimea|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others.\n\n===Neo-Babylonian Empire===\n{{Main|Neo-Babylonian Empire}}\nThe Neo-Babylonian Empire or Second Babylonian Empire was a period of Mesopotamian history which began in 620 BC and ended in 539 BC. During the preceding three centuries, Babylonia had been ruled by their fellow [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] speakers and northern neighbours, [[Assyria]]. The Assyrians had managed to maintain Babylonian loyalty through the Neo-Assyrian period, whether through granting of increased privileges, or militarily, but that finally changed after 627 BC with the death of the last strong Assyrian ruler, [[Ashurbanipal]], and Babylonia rebelled under [[Nabopolassar]] a [[Chaldean people|Chaldean]] chieftain the following year. In alliance with king [[Cyaxares]] of the Medes, and with the help of the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] the city of [[Nineveh]] was sacked in 612 BC, Assyria fell by 605 BC and the seat of empire was transferred to Babylonia for the first time since [[Hammurabi]].\n\n===Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity===\nAfter the death of [[Ashurbanipal]] in 627 BC, the Assyrian empire descended into a series of bitter civil wars, allowing its former vassals to free themselves. [[Cyaxares]] reorganized and modernized the Median Army, then joined with King [[Nabopolassar]] of Babylon. These allies, together with the [[Scythians]], overthrew the Assyrian Empire and destroyed Nineveh in 612 BC. After the final victory at [[Carchemish]] in 605 BC the Medes and Babylonians ruled Assyria. Babylon and Media fell under [[Persia]]n rule in the 6th century BC ([[Cyrus the Great]]).\n\nFor two centuries of Achaemenid rule both Assyria and Babylonia flourished, [[Achaemenid Assyria]] in particular becoming a major source of manpower for the army and a breadbasket for the economy. [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] remained the ''lingua franca'' of the Achaemenid Empire, much as it had done in Assyrian times. Mesopotamia fell to [[Alexander the Great]] in 330 BC, and remained under [[Hellenistic]] rule for another two centuries, with [[Seleucia]] as capital from 305 BC. In the 1st century BC, Mesopotamia was in constant turmoil as the Seleucid Empire was weakened by [[Parthia]] on one hand and the [[Mithridatic Wars]] on the other. The [[Parthian Empire]] lasted for five centuries, into the 3rd century AD, when it was succeeded by the [[Sassanids]]. After constant wars between Romans and first Parthians, later Sassanids; the western part of Mesopotamia was passed to the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Christianity]] as well as [[Mandeism]] entered Mesopotamia from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD, and flourished, particularly in Assyria ([[Assuristan]] in Sassanid Persian), which became the center of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and a flourishing Syriac Christian tradition which remains to this day. A number of Neo-Assyrian kingdoms arose, in particular [[Adiabene]]. The Sassanid Empire and Byzantine Mesopotamia finally fell to the [[Rashidun army]] under [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] in the 630s. After the [[Arab]]-[[Islamic]] [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquest]] of the mid-7th century AD, Mesopotamia saw an influx of non native [[Arabs]]<nowiki/> and later also [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples. The city of [[Assur]] was still occupied until the 14th century, and Assyrians possibly still formed the majority in northern Mesopotamia until the Middle Ages. Assyrians retain Eastern Rite Christianity whereas the Mandaeans retain their ancient gnostic religion and Mesopotamian Aramaic as a mother tongue and written script to this day. Among these peoples, the giving of traditional Mesopotamian names is still common.\n* [[Classical Antiquity]]\n** Median and Babylonian Assyria (605 to 549 BC)\n** [[Babylonia (Persian province)|Persian Babylonia]],\n** [[Achaemenid Assyria]] (6th to 4th centuries BC)\n** [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] Mesopotamia (4th to 3rd centuries BC)\n** [[Asuristan|Parthian Asuristan]] ([[Assyria]] (3rd century BC to 3rd century AD)\n** [[Osroene]] (2nd century BC to 3rd century AD)\n** [[Adiabene]] (1st to 2nd centuries AD)\n** [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Roman Mesopotamia]] (2nd to 7th centuries AD), [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Assyria]] (2nd century AD)\n* [[Late Antiquity]]\n** [[Asuristan|Sassanid Asuristan]] ([[Assyria]]) (3rd to 7th centuries AD)\n** [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] conquest of Mesopotamia, dissolution of [[Assyria]] (633\u2013651 AD)\n\n==Classical writers== \n\nA now-lost History of Babylonia was written in Greek by [[Berossus]] in the third century BC.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia|Iraq}}\n* [[History of Iraq]]\n* [[History of Syria]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|title=The Archaeology of Syria.

In archaeology, relative chronologies are established by carefully excavating [[archaeological site]]s and reconstructing their [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] \u2013 the order in which layers were deposited.

Their [[Mesopotamian mythology|mythology]] includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been there for a long time. The [[Sumerian language]] is identifiable from its initially [[logograph]]ic [[history of writing|script]] which arose last half of the 4th millennium BC.\n\nBy the 3rd millennium BC, these [[city|urban centers]] had developed into increasingly complex societies. Irrigation and other means of exploiting food sources were being used to amass large surpluses. Huge building projects were being undertaken by rulers, and political organization was becoming ever more sophisticated. Throughout the millennium, the various [[city-states]] [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], Uruk, Ur and Lagash vied for power and gained hegemony at various times. [[Nippur]] and [[Girsu]] were important religious centers, as was Eridu at this point. This was also the time of [[Gilgamesh]], a semi-historical king of Uruk, and the subject of the famous ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. By 2600 BC, the logographic script had developed into a decipherable [[cuneiform]] [[syllabary|syllabic]] script.\n\n[[File:Mesopotamian Chronology 2-2011-29-03.png|thumb|left|Chronology of the main dominations]]\nThe chronology of this era is particularly uncertain due to difficulties in our understanding of the text, our understanding of the material culture of the Early Dynastic period and a general lack of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] for sites in Iraq. Also, the multitude of city-states makes for a confusing situation, as each has its own history. The [[Sumerian king list]] is one record of the political history of the period. It starts with mythological figures with improbably long reigns, but later rulers have been authenticated with [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence. The first of these is [[Enmebaragesi]] of Kish, c. 2600 BC, said by the king list to have subjected neighboring [[Elam]]. However, one complication of the Sumerian king list is that although dynasties are listed in sequential order, some of them actually ruled at the same time over different areas.\n\n[[File:Mesopotamia, Periodo proto-dinastico, placca con scena di banchetto, da khafajah, 2650-2550 ac ca.jpg|thumb|Banquet scene, [[Khafajah]], c. 2650-2550 BC.]]\n[[Enshakushanna]] of Uruk conquered all of Sumer, Akkad, and [[Hamazi]], followed by [[Eannatum]] of Lagash who also conquered Sumer. His methods were force and intimidation (see the [[Stele of the Vultures]]), and soon after his death, the cities rebelled and the empire again fell apart. Some time later, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] created the first, if short-lived, empire to extend west of Mesopotamia, at least according to historical accounts dated centuries later. The last native Sumerian to rule over most of Sumer before [[Sargon of Akkad]] established supremacy was [[Lugal-Zage-Si]].\n\nDuring the 3rd millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name=Deutscher>{{harvnb|Deutscher|2007|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> The influence of Sumerian on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name=Deutscher/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name=Deutscher/>\n\nAkkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name=woods>{{harvnb|Woods|2006}}</ref> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.\n\n===Akkadian Empire===\n{{Main|Akkadian Empire}}\n[[File:Empire akkad.svg|260px|thumb|Map of the [[Akkadian Empire]] (brown) and the directions in which military campaigns were conducted (yellow arrows)]]\n[[File:Ur III.svg|260px|thumb|Map of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III]] state (brown) and its influence sphere (red)]]\nThe Akkadian period is generally dated to 2350\u20132170 BC according to the [[Middle Chronology]], or 2230\u20132050 BC according to the [[Short chronology timeline|Short Chronology]].<ref name=pruss2004/> Around 2334 BC, Sargon became ruler of Akkad in northern [[Mesopotamia]]. He proceeded to conquer an area stretching from the [[Persian Gulf]] into modern-day [[Syria]]. The Akkadians were a [[Semitic people]] and the [[Akkadian language]] came into widespread use as the [[lingua franca]] during this period, but literacy remained in the Sumerian language. The Akkadians further developed the Sumerian irrigation system with the incorporation of large [[weirs]] and [[Dams|diversion dams]] into the design to facilitate the reservoirs and canals required to transport water vast distances.<ref>http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115CH17oldirrigation.html</ref> The dynasty continued until around c. 2154 BC, and reached its zenith under [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], who began the trend for rulers to claim divinity for themselves.\n\nThe Akkadian Empire lost power after the reign of Naram-Sin, and eventually was invaded by the [[Gutian dynasty of Sumer|Guti]] from the [[Zagros Mountains]]. For half a century the Guti controlled Mesopotamia, especially the south, but they left few inscriptions, so they are not well understood. The Guti hold loosened on southern Mesopotamia, where the second dynasty of Lagash came into prominence. Its most famous ruler was [[Gudea]], who left many statues of himself in temples across Sumer.\n\n===Ur III period===\n{{Main|Third Dynasty of Ur}}\nEventually the Guti were overthrown by [[Utu-hengal]] of Uruk, and the various city-states again vied for power. Power over the area finally went to the city-state of Ur, when [[Ur-Nammu]] founded the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III Empire]] (2112\u20132004 BC) and conquered the Sumerian region. Under his son [[Shulgi]], state control over industry reached a level never again seen in the region. Shulgi may have devised the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], one of the earliest known [[Cuneiform law|law codes]] (three centuries before the more famous [[Code of Hammurabi]]). Around 2000 BC, the power of Ur waned, and the [[Amorites]] came to occupy much of the area, although it was Sumer's long-standing rivals to the east, the Elamites, who finally overthrew Ur. In the north, Assyria remained free of Amorite control until the very end of the 19th century BC. This marked the end of city-states ruling empires in Mesopotamia, and the end of Sumerian dominance, but the succeeding rulers adopted much of Sumerian civilization as their own.\n\n==Second millennium BC==\n\n===Old Assyrian Period===\nOf the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. The [[Assyrian King List]] mentions rulers going back to the 23rd and 22nd century BC. The earliest king named [[Tudiya]], who was a contemporary of [[Ibrium]] of [[Ebla]], appears to have lived in the mid-23rd century BC, according to the king list. Tudiya concluded a treaty with Ibrium for the use of a trading post in [[the Levant]] officially controlled by Ebla. Apart from this reference to trading activity, nothing further has yet been discovered about Tudiya. He was succeeded by [[Adamu (Assyrian king)|Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers about all of whom nothing is yet known. These early kings from the 23rd to late 21st centuries BC, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'' were likely to have been semi nomadic pastoralist rulers, nominally independent but subject to the Akkadian Empire, who dominated the region and at some point during this period became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Assur|Ashur]].<ref>Saggs, ''The Might'', 24.</ref> A king named [[Ushpia]] (c. 2030 BC) is credited with dedicating temples to [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] in the home city of the god. In around 1975 BC [[Puzur-Ashur I]] founded a new dynasty, and his successors such as [[Shalim-ahum]], [[Ilushuma]] (1945\u20131906 BC), [[Erishum I]] (1905\u20131867 BC), [[Ikunum]] (1867\u20131860 BC), [[Sargon I]], [[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Sin]] and [[Puzur-Ashur II]] left inscriptions regarding the building of temples to [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], [[Adad]] and [[Ishtar]] in Assyria. [[Ilushuma]] in particular appears to have been a powerful king and the dominant ruler in the region, who made many raids into southern [[Mesopotamia]] between 1945 BC and 1906 BC, attacking the independent [[Sumero-Akkadian]] city states of the region such as [[Isin]], and founding colonies in [[Asia Minor]]. This was to become a pattern throughout the history of ancient Mesopotamia with the future rivalry between Assyria and Babylonia. However, Babylonia did not exist at this time, but was founded in 1894 BC by an [[Amorite]] prince named [[Sumuabum]] during the reign of Erishum I.\n\n===Isin-Larsa, Old Babylonian and Shamshi-Adad I===\n[[File:Cylinder seal and modern impression Presentation scene,ca. 2000\u20131750 B.C.

This period also marked a growth in power in the north of Mesopotamia. An [[Assyria]]n king named [[Ilushuma]] (1945\u20131906 BC) became a dominant figure in Mesopotamia, raiding the southern city states and founding colonies in [[Asia Minor]]. [[Eshnunna]] and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], two [[Amorite]] ruled states also became important in the north.\n\n[[Babylonia]] was founded as an independent state by an [[Amorite]] chieftain named [[Sumuabum]] in 1894 BC. For over a century after its founding, it was a minor and relatively weak state, overshadowed by older and more powerful states such as [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Assyria]] and [[Elam]]. However, [[Hammurabi]] (1792 BC to 1750 BC), the Amorite ruler of [[Babylon]], turned Babylon into a major power and eventually conquered Mesopotamia and beyond. He is famous for his [[code of Hammurabi|law code]] and conquests, but he is also famous due to the large amount of records that exist from the period of his reign. After the death of Hammurabi, the first Babylonian dynasty lasted for another century and a half, but his empire quickly unravelled, and Babylon once more became a small state. The Amorite dynasty ended in 1595 BC, when Babylonia fell to the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Mursili I|Mursilis]], after which the [[Kassites]] took control.\n\nUnlike the south of Mesopotamia, the native Akkadian kings of Assyria repelled Amorite advances during the 20th and 19th centuries BC. However this changed in 1813 BC when an Amorite king named [[Shamshi-Adad I]] usurped the throne of Assyria. Although claiming descendency from the native Assyrian king [[Ushpia]], he was regarded as an interloper. Shamshi-Adad I created a regional empire in Assyria, maintaining and expanding the established colonies in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]]. His son [[Ishme-Dagan I]] continued this process, however his successors were eventually conquered by [[Hammurabi]], a fellow Amorite from Babylon. The three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan were vassals of Hammurabi, but after his death, a native Akkadian vice regent [[Puzur-Sin]] overthrew the Amorites of Babylon and a period of civil war with multiple claimants to the throne ensued, ending with the succession of king [[Adasi]] c. 1720 BC.\n\n===Middle Assyrian Period and Empire===\nThe Middle Assyrian period begins c. 1720 BC with the ejection of Amorites and Babylonians from Assyria by a king called [[Adasi]]. The nation remained relatively strong and stable, peace was made with the Kassite rulers of Babylonia, and Assyria was free from Hittite, Hurrian, Gutian, Elamite and Mitanni threat. However a period of [[Mitanni]] domination occurred from the mid-15th to early 14th centuries BC. This was ended by [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392 BC - 1366), and his successor [[Ashur-uballit I]] completely overthrew the [[Mitanni]] Empire and founded a powerful [[Assyrian Empire]] that came to dominate Mesopotamia and much of the ancient [[Near East]] (including [[Babylonia]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Iran]], the [[Levant]] and parts of the [[Caucasus]] and [[Arabia]]), with Assyrian armies campaigning from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]], and from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Arabia]]. The empire endured until 1076 BC with the death of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period Assyria became a major power, overthrowing the [[Mitanni]] Empire, annexing swathes of [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Hurrian]] and [[Amorite]] land, sacking and dominating [[Babylon]], [[Canaan]]/[[Phoenicia]] and becoming a rival to [[Egypt]].\n\n===Kassite dynasty of Babylon===\n{{Main|Kassites}}\nAlthough the Hittites overthrew Babylon, another people, the [[Kassites]], took it as their capital (c. 1650\u20131155 BC (short chronology)). They have the distinction of being the longest lasting dynasty in Babylon, reigning for over four centuries. They left few records, so this period is unfortunately obscure. They are of unknown origin; what little we have of their language suggests it is a [[language isolate]]. Although Babylonia maintained its independence through this period, it was not a power in the Near East, and mostly sat out the large wars fought over the [[Levant]] between [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Hittite Empire]], and [[Mitanni]] (see below), as well as independent peoples in the region. [[Assyria]] participated in these wars toward the end of the period, overthrowing the [[Mitanni]] Empire and besting the [[Hittites]] and [[Phrygians]], but the Kassites in Babylon did not. They did, however, fight against their longstanding rival to the east, Elam (related by some linguists to the [[Dravidian languages]] in modern India). Babylonia found itself under Assyrian and Elamite domination for much of the later Kassite period. In the end, the [[Elamites]] conquered Babylon, bringing this period to an end.\n\n===Hurrians===\n[[File:Cylinder seal,ca. 16th\u201315th century BC Mitanni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal,ca. 16th\u201315th century BC, Mitanni]]\n{{Main|Mitanni}}\nThe [[Hurrians]] were a people who settled in northwestern Mesopotamia and southeast Anatolia in 1600 BC. By 1450 BC they established a medium-sized empire under a [[Mitanni]] ruling class, and temporarily made tributary vassals out of kings in the west, making them a major threat for the [[Pharaoh]] in Egypt until their overthrow by Assyria. The [[Hurrian language]] is related to the later [[Urartian language|Urartian]], but there is no conclusive evidence these two languages are related to any others.\n\n===Hittites===\n{{Main|Hittites}}\nBy 1300 BC the Hurrians had been reduced to their homelands in [[Asia Minor]] after their power was broken by the Assyrians and Hittites, and held the status of vassals to the \"Hatti\", the [[Hittites]], a western [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] people (belonging to the linguistic \"kentum\" group) who dominated most of [[Asia Minor]] (modern [[Turkey]]) at this time from their capital of [[Hattusa]]. The Hittites came into conflict with the Assyrians from the mid-14th to the 13th centuries BC, losing territory to the Assyrian kings of the period. However they endured until being finally swept aside by the [[Phrygians]], who conquered their homelands in Asia Minor. The Phrygians were prevented from moving south into Mesopotamia by the Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. The Hittites fragmented into a number of small [[Neo-Hittite]] states, which endured in the region for many centuries.\n\n===Bronze Age collapse===\n{{Main|Bronze Age collapse}}\nRecords from the 12th and 11th centuries BC are sparse in Babylonia, which had been overrun with new [[Semitic people|Semitic]] settlers, namely the [[Arameans]], [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]] and [[Shutu|Sutu]]. Assyria however, remained a compact and strong nation, which continued to provide much written record. The 10th century BC is even worse for Babylonia, with very few inscriptions. Mesopotamia was not alone in this obscurity: the Hittite Empire fell at the beginning of this period and very few records are known from Egypt and Elam. This was a time of invasion and upheaval by many new people throughout the Near East, North Africa, The Caucasus, Mediterranean and Balkan regions.\n\n==First millennium BC==\n\n===Neo-Assyrian Empire===\n{{Main|Neo-Assyrian Empire}}\n[[File:Assyrian Crown-Prince MET DP-13006-005.jpg|thumb|Assyrian Crown-Prince, ca. 704\u2013681 BC. [[Nineveh]], Mesopotamia. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]\nThe Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of Adad-nirari II, in 911 BC, lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the Babylonians, Medes, Scythians and Cimmerians in 612 BC. The empire was the largest and most powerful the world had yet seen. At its height Assyria conquered the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty Egypt]] (and expelled its [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] dynasty) as well as [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites]], [[Hurrians]], northern [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]] and parts of [[Ancient Greece]] (such as [[Cyprus]]), and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimea|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others.\n\n===Neo-Babylonian Empire===\n{{Main|Neo-Babylonian Empire}}\nThe Neo-Babylonian Empire or Second Babylonian Empire was a period of Mesopotamian history which began in 620 BC and ended in 539 BC. During the preceding three centuries, Babylonia had been ruled by their fellow [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] speakers and northern neighbours, [[Assyria]]. The Assyrians had managed to maintain Babylonian loyalty through the Neo-Assyrian period, whether through granting of increased privileges, or militarily, but that finally changed after 627 BC with the death of the last strong Assyrian ruler, [[Ashurbanipal]], and Babylonia rebelled under [[Nabopolassar]] a [[Chaldean people|Chaldean]] chieftain the following year. In alliance with king [[Cyaxares]] of the Medes, and with the help of the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] the city of [[Nineveh]] was sacked in 612 BC, Assyria fell by 605 BC and the seat of empire was transferred to Babylonia for the first time since [[Hammurabi]].\n\n===Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity===\nAfter the death of [[Ashurbanipal]] in 627 BC, the Assyrian empire descended into a series of bitter civil wars, allowing its former vassals to free themselves. [[Cyaxares]] reorganized and modernized the Median Army, then joined with King [[Nabopolassar]] of Babylon. These allies, together with the [[Scythians]], overthrew the Assyrian Empire and destroyed Nineveh in 612 BC. After the final victory at [[Carchemish]] in 605 BC the Medes and Babylonians ruled Assyria. Babylon and Media fell under [[Persia]]n rule in the 6th century BC ([[Cyrus the Great]]).\n\nFor two centuries of Achaemenid rule both Assyria and Babylonia flourished, [[Achaemenid Assyria]] in particular becoming a major source of manpower for the army and a breadbasket for the economy. [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] remained the ''lingua franca'' of the Achaemenid Empire, much as it had done in Assyrian times. Mesopotamia fell to [[Alexander the Great]] in 330 BC, and remained under [[Hellenistic]] rule for another two centuries, with [[Seleucia]] as capital from 305 BC. In the 1st century BC, Mesopotamia was in constant turmoil as the Seleucid Empire was weakened by [[Parthia]] on one hand and the [[Mithridatic Wars]] on the other. The [[Parthian Empire]] lasted for five centuries, into the 3rd century AD, when it was succeeded by the [[Sassanids]]. After constant wars between Romans and first Parthians, later Sassanids; the western part of Mesopotamia was passed to the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Christianity]] as well as [[Mandeism]] entered Mesopotamia from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD, and flourished, particularly in Assyria ([[Assuristan]] in Sassanid Persian), which became the center of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and a flourishing Syriac Christian tradition which remains to this day. A number of Neo-Assyrian kingdoms arose, in particular [[Adiabene]]. The Sassanid Empire and Byzantine Mesopotamia finally fell to the [[Rashidun army]] under [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] in the 630s. After the [[Arab]]-[[Islamic]] [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquest]] of the mid-7th century AD, Mesopotamia saw an influx of non native [[Arabs]]<nowiki/> and later also [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples. The city of [[Assur]] was still occupied until the 14th century, and Assyrians possibly still formed the majority in northern Mesopotamia until the Middle Ages. Assyrians retain Eastern Rite Christianity whereas the Mandaeans retain their ancient gnostic religion and Mesopotamian Aramaic as a mother tongue and written script to this day. Among these peoples, the giving of traditional Mesopotamian names is still common.\n* [[Classical Antiquity]]\n** Median and Babylonian Assyria (605 to 549 BC)\n** [[Babylonia (Persian province)|Persian Babylonia]],\n** [[Achaemenid Assyria]] (6th to 4th centuries BC)\n** [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] Mesopotamia (4th to 3rd centuries BC)\n** [[Asuristan|Parthian Asuristan]] ([[Assyria]] (3rd century BC to 3rd century AD)\n** [[Osroene]] (2nd century BC to 3rd century AD)\n** [[Adiabene]] (1st to 2nd centuries AD)\n** [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Roman Mesopotamia]] (2nd to 7th centuries AD), [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Assyria]] (2nd century AD)\n* [[Late Antiquity]]\n** [[Asuristan|Sassanid Asuristan]] ([[Assyria]]) (3rd to 7th centuries AD)\n** [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] conquest of Mesopotamia, dissolution of [[Assyria]] (633\u2013651 AD)\n\n==Classical writers== \n\nA now-lost History of Babylonia was written in Greek by [[Berossus]] in the third century BC.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia|Iraq}}\n* [[History of Iraq]]\n* [[History of Syria]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|title=The Archaeology of Syria.

The city was founded on April 1, 1924.\n\nAs of June 1, 2019, the city has an estimated [[population]] of 161,137, with 70,549 [[household]]s and a [[population density]] of 247 per km\u00b2. The total area is 653.36&nbsp;km\u00b2 making it the largest city in the prefecture in terms of area.\n\nOn January 1, 2006, the towns of [[Takajo, Miyazaki|Takaj\u014d]], [[Takazaki, Miyazaki|Takazaki]], [[Yamada, Miyazaki|Yamada]] and [[Yamanokuchi, Miyazaki|Yamanokuchi]] (all from [[Kitamorokata District, Miyazaki|Kitamorokata District]]) were merged into Miyakonoj\u014d.\n\n==History==\nMiyakonoj\u014d is known as the birthplace of the [[Shimazu Estate]], the largest [[sh\u014den]] (estate or manor) of medieval Japan. In the 1020s, a powerful official named [[Taira no Suemoto]] developed a small manor named Shimazu-in. Expanded substantially in the first half of the 12th century, it eventually covered large portions of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]], [[\u014csumi Province|\u014csumi]] and [[Hy\u016bga Province]]s. In 1185, [[Shimazu Tadahisa|Koremune no Tadahisa]] was appointed as ''[[jit\u014d]]'' of the Shimazu Estate and thereafter claimed [[Shimazu clan|the clan name of Shimazu]]. It is said that one of Tadahisa's residences, called [[Iwayoshi Gosho]], was located at Miyakonoj\u014d. Between the [[Muromachi period]] and [[Edo period]], the [[H\u014dng\u014d family]], which was a branch family of the Shimazus, controlled the area. After the [[Boshin War]], it became one of the cities to [[abolition of the han system|abolish the han system]]. In 1871, it became a prefecture for a year.\n\n==Industry==\nMany of Miyakonoj\u014d's citizens work as farmers. They produce [[Arctium lappa|''gob\u014d'']], meat, and [[bell pepper]]s.  Miyakonoj\u014d is also home to some agriculture-related [[manufacturing]].\n\nMiyakonoj\u014d is also famous for producing traditional Japanese [[Bow (weapon)|archery bows]] from the abundant [[bamboo]] in the area.<ref>[http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/attractions/facilities/traditional_handicrafts/83dn3a000000elvr.html Miyakonojo daikyu (archery bows)], [[Japan National Tourist Organization]].</ref>\n\n{{stack|[[File:Miyakonojo City Office.jpg|thumb|Miyakonoj\u014d City Office]]}}\n\n==Schools==\nMiyakonoj\u014d has 35 elementary schools and 19 junior high schools.\n\n==Notable residents==\n*[[Tomoji Tanabe]], the [[Oldest people|world's oldest man]] 1895\u20132009, was born and lived in Miyakonoj\u014d.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7000487.stm Oldest man marks 112th birthday], ''[[BBC News]]'', 18 September 2007.</ref>\n*[[K\u014dsei Inoue]], Olympic Gold Medalist in Judo.\n*[[G\u014dgen Yamaguchi]], known as \"The Cat\", was a renowned [[martial arts]] master of the [[G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b]] style of [[Karate]].\n*[[J\u016bz\u014d Yamasaki]], the [[Mangaka|manga artist]] was born in Miyakonoj\u014d.\n*[[Hideo Higashikokubaru]], a famous comedian and the former Governor of Miyazaki.\n*[[Yuya Yanagi]], a professional baseball player for the [[Chunichi Dragons]].\n\n==Nearby municipalities==\n\n[[File:ISS034-E-027139.jpg|thumb|300px|An image taken from the International Space Station showing Miyakonoj\u014d and its surroundings on January 10, 2013]]\n*[[Miyazaki, Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]\n*[[Nichinan, Miyazaki|Nichinan]]\n*[[Kobayashi, Miyazaki|Kobayashi]]\n*[[Kushima, Miyazaki|Kushima]]\n*[[Mimata, Miyazaki|Mimata]]\n*[[Takaharu, Miyazaki|Takaharu]]\n*[[Soo, Kagoshima|Soo]]\n*[[Kirishima, Kagoshima|Kirishima]]\n*[[Shibushi, Kagoshima|Shibushi]]\n\n==Climate==\nMiyakonoj\u014d has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), but is cooler than other cities in Miyazaki.
