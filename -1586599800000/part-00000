There were only two main characters, namely Gran and her grandson, Jim, and they were lucky and kind.\n\nDespite moderate popularity with young audiences in the mid-1980s, the series has not been seen on UK television since being repeated as part of the [[Tiny Living]] broadcasting block on [[Sky Living|Living TV]] in the late 1990s, and no further episodes were made. [[Universal Pictures]] released all 13 episodes on Region 2 [[DVD]] in the U.K. on 7 March 2005, but the release has since been discontinued.<ref>[http://www.bva.org.uk/node/507443 ''Gran'' Series 1 DVD listing on British Video Association]</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nAt first glance you may think Gran is like any other Grandma, but she's not. Along with her grandson Jim, she takes part in different crazy adventures. Each episode sees Gran performing weird and wacky tasks - growing her runner beans up a dinosaurs skeleton, hang gliding, knitting a giant scarf to wrap around her house in the winter, and cross country motorbike racing. But one thing's for sure - she'll always be wearing her pink slippers.\n\n==Production and broadcast==\n\nThe programme made by [[Woodland Animations]] was created and written by [[Michael Cole (writer)|Michael]] and [[Joanne Cole]].<ref>http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/563704/</ref> Ivor Wood produced thirteen five-minute episodes in 1982 and the series was broadcast on the [[BBC]] between 17 February 1983 and 12 May 1983,<ref>[http://www.toonhound.com/gran.htm ''Gran'' at Toonhound.com]</ref> and was repeated in both 1986 and 1992. Children's books based on the series, written by [[Michael Cole (writer)|Michael]] and illustrated by [[Joanne Cole]] were also released in 1983. The shorts were also shown in the United States as part of the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Eureeka's Castle]]'' and in the Latin American version as stand-alone program, release on Cartoon Network's sister channel [[Boomerang (Latin American TV channel)|Boomerang]]. and also, the Canada version, release on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[Teletoon]] \n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n<!-- |total_width     = -->\n |background      = \n |overall         = 10\n |title           = 60\n<!-- |director        = \n |writer          = -->\n |airdate         = 30\n |airdateR        = \n<!-- |prodcode        = \n |prodcodeR       = -->\n |country         = UK\n |episodes        =\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |Title           = Gran Gliding\n<!--  Hiding, for now, as this information is not currently available...\n |DirectedBy      = \n |WrittenBy       = -->\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1983|2|17|df=y}}\n<!-- |ProdCode        = -->\n |ShortSummary    = Jim visits his Gran and persuades her to come with him to fly his kite.

There were only two main characters, namely Gran and her grandson, Jim, and they were lucky and kind.\n\nDespite moderate popularity with young audiences in the mid-1980s, the series has not been seen on UK television since being repeated as part of the [[Tiny Living]] broadcasting block on [[Sky Living|Living TV]] in the late 1990s, and no further episodes were made. [[Universal Pictures]] released all 13 episodes on Region 2 [[DVD]] in the U.K. on 7 March 2005, but the release has since been discontinued.<ref>[http://www.bva.org.uk/node/507443 ''Gran'' Series 1 DVD listing on British Video Association]</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nAt first glance you may think Gran is like any other Grandma, but she's not. Along with her grandson Jim, she takes part in different crazy adventures. Each episode sees Gran performing weird and wacky tasks - growing her runner beans up a dinosaurs skeleton, hang gliding, knitting a giant scarf to wrap around her house in the winter, and cross country motorbike racing. But one thing's for sure - she'll always be wearing her pink slippers.\n\n==Production and broadcast==\n\nThe programme made by [[Woodland Animations]] was created and written by [[Michael Cole (writer)|Michael]] and [[Joanne Cole]].<ref>http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/563704/</ref> Ivor Wood produced thirteen five-minute episodes in 1982 and the series was broadcast on the [[BBC]] between 17 February 1983 and 12 May 1983,<ref>[http://www.toonhound.com/gran.htm ''Gran'' at Toonhound.com]</ref> and was repeated in both 1986 and 1992. Children's books based on the series, written by [[Michael Cole (writer)|Michael]] and illustrated by [[Joanne Cole]] were also released in 1983. The shorts were also shown in the United States as part of the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Eureeka's Castle]]'' and in the Latin American version as stand-alone program, release on Cartoon Network's sister channel [[Boomerang (Latin American TV channel)|Boomerang]]. and also, the Canada version, release on [[Teletoon]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n<!-- |total_width     = -->\n |background      = \n |overall         = 10\n |title           = 60\n<!-- |director        = \n |writer          = -->\n |airdate         = 30\n |airdateR        = \n<!-- |prodcode        = \n |prodcodeR       = -->\n |country         = UK\n |episodes        =\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |Title           = Gran Gliding\n<!--  Hiding, for now, as this information is not currently available...\n |DirectedBy      = \n |WrittenBy       = -->\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1983|2|17|df=y}}\n<!-- |ProdCode        = -->\n |ShortSummary    = Jim visits his Gran and persuades her to come with him to fly his kite.

It is part of the ''[[Finnpusku]]'' [[integrated tug and barge]] system developed in the 1980s by [[Finnlines]], a Finnish shipping company that also managed the vessel until 2003, in co-operation with [[Rautaruukki]] for the transportation needs of the steel company. ''Rautaruukki'', built by [[Hollming]] in [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], Finland, was delivered on 30 October 1986 and has since been used mainly to supply raw materials to the [[Raahe Steel Works]].\n\n''Rautaruukki'' has an identical sister vessel, [[Steel (pusher)|''Steel'']], which was delivered in 1987 as ''Finn''. The vessel capsized in 1990, but was rebuilt, renamed and returned to service in 1991.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n{{Main|Finnpusku}}\n\nThe development of the ''Finnpusku'' system dates back to the 1960s when Finnlines developed the first version of the icegoing pusher-barge system. While the concept was not pursued further due to various problems, an upgraded version was developed in the 1970s.<ref name=\"finnlines1972\">Holma, H.: Proomukuljetukset. Oy Finnlines Ltd, 1972.</ref> In the late 1970s Rautaruukki Oy began transporting raw materials to the [[steel mill]] in [[Raahe]] by towed barges and found them suitable for the steel company's transportation needs. However, due to the poor maneuverability of the barges and their inability to operate in winter conditions, Rautaruukki decided to investigate if it would be possible to design a pusher-barge system that could also be operated in ice conditions. When Finnlines was consulted, it presented the ''Finnpusku'' system it had developed and the two companies signed a development contract. Later Finnlines performed several feasibility studies which showed that a pusher-barge system would be the most economical and efficient method of transporting bulk cargoes on the relatively short routes of the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\">von Bruun-Riegels, U. Raaka-ainekuljetukset proomuilla. Rautaruukki Oy, 1991.</ref>\n\nThe initial plan was to establish shipping companies for each vessel of the ''Finnpusku'' system under the joint ownership of several large Finnish industrial and shipping companies, including Rautaruukki and Finnlines, which would also manage the vessels. However, due to delays in negotiations Rautaruukki, concerned about the continuous supply of raw materials to the Raahe Steel Works, decided to order one pusher and two barges for itself and signed a building contract with Hollming on 29 September 1984.<ref>A revolutionary pusher-barge system. Navigator 1985.</ref> The first pusher of the ''Finnpusku'' system, ''Rautaruukki'', was laid down on 27 June and launched on 20 December 1985.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" />\n\nPusher ''Rautaruukki'' and barges [[Kalla (barge)|''Kalla'']] and [[Tasku (barge)|''Tasku'']], built by a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] shipyard [[Estaleiros Navais de Setubal]] in [[Set\u00fabal]] and outfitted in Rauma, were delivered to Rautaruukki on 31 October 1986.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" /> When the two pushers and five barges of the ''Finnpusku'' system entered service in 1986\u20131987, it was estimated that they would carry one third of the ten million tons of [[bulk cargo]] arriving in Finland by sea every year.<ref name=\"navigator1186\">Mauno, J. Finnpusku minimoi satama-ajan. Navigator 11/86.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n[[File:Rautaruukki-kalla 20110314.jpg|thumb|left|''Rautaruukki'' and [[Kalla (barge)|''Kalla'']] outside [[Lule\u00e5]], [[Sweden]].]]\n\nWhile the jointly owned pusher ''Finn'' was [[Chartering (shipping)|time-chartered]] by the transportation department of Rautaruukki only when the steel company required additional capacity, ''Rautaruukki'' was used since the beginning solely to supply the Raahe Steel Works with raw materials. The pusher-barge combinations transported different bulk cargoes from various ports of the Baltic Sea, such as limestone from the port of [[Kappelshamn|Storugns]] in [[Gotland]], iron ore concentrate from [[Lule\u00e5]], [[Sweden]], and coal from various [[Eastern Europe]]an ports.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" /><ref name=\"navigator1186\" />\n\nAfter initial issues were solved, the ''Finnpusku'' system was found out to be suitable for the transportation needs of Rautaruukki in both port-to-port transport and [[Ship-to-ship cargo transfer|lightening]] large [[bulk carrier]]s outside the port of Raahe. By the end of 1987 the amount of cargo transported by the ''Finnpusku'' system, 7.5 million tons per year, had grown beyond the capability of the transportation department that was under the central administration of the steel company, so on 1 May 1988 a subsidiary company, [[JIT-Trans]], was established to deal with both the parent company's own cargoes and external shipping business.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" />\n\nIn 1989, JIT-Trans signed a long-term contract with [[SSAB]] for the transportation of iron ore concentrate and pellets from Lule\u00e5 to [[Oxel\u00f6sund]].

It has the highest [[Finnish-Swedish ice class]], 1A Super, which means that the pusher is designed to operate in difficult ice conditions both alone and when coupled to a barge mainly without icebreaker assistance.<ref name=\"DNV Exchange\" /> While usually connected to a barge, ''Rautaruukki'' is also capable of operating independently. However, the low [[metacentric height]] of the pusher, only {{convert|0.5|-|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the vessel very uncomfortable in severe weather.<ref name=\"motorship1986\" /> For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when it is absolutely necessary.<ref name=\"tm2008\" />\n\nThe ''Finnpusku'' system uses a unique rigid coupling system, [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Marine Locomotive]], which consists of two hydraulic locking pins, one on each side of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo.<ref name=\"motorship1986\" /> In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.<ref name=\"onnettomuus1990\" />\n\nOne of the most prominent features of the pusher is the high superstructure rising {{convert|22|m|ft|0|abbr=out}} from the waterline. In addition to accommodation, mess and dayroom for the crew of nine, it initially housed two [[Bridge (nautical)|bridges]] at different levels. The lower bridge on the third deck was originally intended to be used when the pusher is operating on its own without a barge, allowing more comfortable conditions for the crew \u2014 the chairs in the upper bridge on the seventh deck were equipped with seatbelts due to the large motions of the vessel when operating independently. However, the lower bridge was rarely used and the space was later converted to an office. The upper bridge, with bridge wings extending beyond the pusher's breadth, is equipped to allow one man bridge operation.<ref name=\"motorship1986\" />\n\n=== Power and propulsion ===\n\nPropulsion power is provided by two six-cylinder [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] 6ZAL40 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, manufactured under licence by [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]], each with a maximum continuous output of {{convert|3840|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 380 rpm, giving the combination a service speed of {{convert|13.4|kn}}.<ref name=\"navigator1184\">Rohkea investointi.

It is part of the ''[[Finnpusku]]'' [[integrated tug and barge]] system developed in the 1980s by [[Finnlines]], a Finnish shipping company that also managed the vessel until 2003, in co-operation with [[Rautaruukki]] for the transportation needs of the steel company. ''Rautaruukki'', built by [[Hollming]] in [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], Finland, was delivered on 30 October 1986 and has since been used mainly to supply raw materials to the [[Raahe Steel Works]].\n\n''Rautaruukki'' has an identical sister vessel, [[Steel (pusher)|''Steel'']], which was delivered in 1987 as ''Finn''. The vessel capsized in 1990, but was rebuilt, renamed and returned to service in 1991.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n{{Main|Finnpusku}}\n\nThe development of the ''Finnpusku'' system dates back to the 1960s when Finnlines developed the first version of the icegoing pusher-barge system. While the concept was not pursued further due to various problems, an upgraded version was developed in the 1970s.<ref name=\"finnlines1972\">Holma, H.: Proomukuljetukset. Oy Finnlines Ltd, 1972.</ref> In the late 1970s Rautaruukki Oy began transporting raw materials to the [[steel mill]] in [[Raahe]] by towed barges and found them suitable for the steel company's transportation needs. However, due to the poor maneuverability of the barges and their inability to operate in winter conditions, Rautaruukki decided to investigate if it would be possible to design a pusher-barge system that could also be operated in ice conditions. When Finnlines was consulted, it presented the ''Finnpusku'' system it had developed and the two companies signed a development contract. Later Finnlines performed several feasibility studies which showed that a pusher-barge system would be the most economical and efficient method of transporting bulk cargoes on the relatively short routes of the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\">von Bruun-Riegels, U. Raaka-ainekuljetukset proomuilla. Rautaruukki Oy, 1991.</ref>\n\nThe initial plan was to establish shipping companies for each vessel of the ''Finnpusku'' system under the joint ownership of several large Finnish industrial and shipping companies, including Rautaruukki and Finnlines, which would also manage the vessels. However, due to delays in negotiations Rautaruukki, concerned about the continuous supply of raw materials to the Raahe Steel Works, decided to order one pusher and two barges for itself and signed a building contract with Hollming on 29 September 1984.<ref>A revolutionary pusher-barge system. Navigator 1985.</ref> The first pusher of the ''Finnpusku'' system, ''Rautaruukki'', was laid down on 27 June and launched on 20 December 1985.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" />\n\nPusher ''Rautaruukki'' and barges [[Kalla (barge)|''Kalla'']] and [[Tasku (barge)|''Tasku'']], built by a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] shipyard [[Estaleiros Navais de Setubal]] in [[Set\u00fabal]] and outfitted in Rauma, were delivered to Rautaruukki on 31 October 1986.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" /> When the two pushers and five barges of the ''Finnpusku'' system entered service in 1986\u20131987, it was estimated that they would carry one third of the ten million tons of [[bulk cargo]] arriving in Finland by sea every year.<ref name=\"navigator1186\">Mauno, J.

The pusher-barge combinations transported different bulk cargoes from various ports of the Baltic Sea, such as limestone from the port of [[Kappelshamn|Storugns]] in [[Gotland]], iron ore concentrate from [[Lule\u00e5]], [[Sweden]], and coal from various [[Eastern Europe]]an ports.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" /><ref name=\"navigator1186\" />\n\nAfter initial issues were solved, the ''Finnpusku'' system was found out to be suitable for the transportation needs of Rautaruukki in both port-to-port transport and [[Ship-to-ship cargo transfer|lightening]] large [[bulk carrier]]s outside the port of Raahe. By the end of 1987 the amount of cargo transported by the ''Finnpusku'' system, 7.5 million tons per year, had grown beyond the capability of the transportation department that was under the central administration of the steel company, so on 1 May 1988 a subsidiary company, [[JIT-Trans]], was established to deal with both the parent company's own cargoes and external shipping business.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" />\n\nIn 1989, JIT-Trans signed a long-term contract with [[SSAB]] for the transportation of iron ore concentrate and pellets from Lule\u00e5 to [[Oxel\u00f6sund]]. Since Finland and Sweden had no [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] agreement for [[cabotage]], part of the ''Finnpusku'' system had to be transferred to the [[Swedish Register of Ships]]. Rautaruukki sold pusher ''Rautaruukki'' and barges ''Kalla'' and ''Tasku'' to new joint shipping companies formed by the Finnish companies' Swedish subsidiaries. Despite the changes in ownership and flag Finnlines retained the management of the vessels through its Swedish subsidiary.<ref name=\"bruunriegels1991\" />\n\n''Rautaruukki'' returned under the Finnish flag in 1996 after the ownership was transferred to a Finnish financial institution Merita Rahoitus (nowadays known as [[Nordea]] Rahoitus).<ref name=\"equasis\" /><ref name=\"DNV Exchange\" />\n\n[[File:Rautaruukki and Tasku in Helsinki on 26 June 2011.jpg|thumb|''Rautaruukki'' and [[Tasku (barge)|''Tasku'']] at [[Arctech Helsinki Shipyard]] on 26 June 2011.]]\n\nIn July 2003 a seven-year contract for the transportation of raw materials in the Baltic Sea was signed between JIT-Trans and [[Aspo (company)|Aspo Group]].<ref name=\"aspo2003\">[http://web.lib.hse.fi/FI/yrityspalvelin/pdf/2003/Faspo2003.pdf Toimintakertomus 2003].

However, the low [[metacentric height]] of the pusher, only {{convert|0.5|-|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the vessel very uncomfortable in severe weather.<ref name=\"motorship1986\" /> For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when it is absolutely necessary.<ref name=\"tm2008\" />\n\nThe ''Finnpusku'' system uses a unique rigid coupling system, [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Marine Locomotive]], which consists of two hydraulic locking pins, one on each side of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo.<ref name=\"motorship1986\" /> In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.<ref name=\"onnettomuus1990\" />\n\nOne of the most prominent features of the pusher is the high superstructure rising {{convert|22|m|ft|0|abbr=out}} from the waterline. In addition to accommodation, mess and dayroom for the crew of nine, it initially housed two [[Bridge (nautical)|bridges]] at different levels. The lower bridge on the third deck was originally intended to be used when the pusher is operating on its own without a barge, allowing more comfortable conditions for the crew \u2014 the chairs in the upper bridge on the seventh deck were equipped with seatbelts due to the large motions of the vessel when operating independently. However, the lower bridge was rarely used and the space was later converted to an office. The upper bridge, with bridge wings extending beyond the pusher's breadth, is equipped to allow one man bridge operation.<ref name=\"motorship1986\" />\n\n=== Power and propulsion ===\n\nPropulsion power is provided by two six-cylinder [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] 6ZAL40 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, manufactured under licence by [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]], each with a maximum continuous output of {{convert|3840|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 380 rpm, giving the combination a service speed of {{convert|13.4|kn}}.<ref name=\"navigator1184\">Rohkea investointi.

A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to [[slamming]] in heavy weather while a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance.<ref name=\"kujala\">Kujala, P and Riska, K: Talvimerenkulku (TKK-AM-13). Department of Applied Mechanics, Helsinki University of Technology, 2010.</ref> However, already in the late 1800s captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that sometimes it was easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. This was because the forward-facing propellers generated a water flow that lowered the resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice.<ref name=\"arcticaborg\">Aker Arctic Technology Inc.: [http://www.akerarctic.fi/publications/pdf/aker%20arc_arctica.pdf Icebreaking Supply Vessels Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718163440/http://www.akerarctic.fi/publications/pdf/aker%20arc_arctica.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2010-02-08 }}</ref> These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], but as forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main operating mode for merchant ships.<ref name=\"poac95\">Juurmaa, K et al.: [http://www.akerarctic.fi/publications/pdf/Poac95NewDAT.pdf New ice breaking tanker concept for the arctic (DAT)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303021749/http://www.akerarctic.fi/publications/pdf/Poac95NewDAT.pdf |date=2012-03-03 }}.

The superiority of podded propulsion in icebreaking merchant ships, especially when running astern, was proved when Finnish [[product tanker]]s [[MT Varzuga|''Uikku'']] and [[MT Indiga|''Lunni'']] were converted to Azipod propulsion in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Even though the ships were originally designed with icebreaking capability in mind, after the conversion ice resistance in level ice when running astern was only 40% of that when breaking ice ahead despite the ships being equipped with an icebreaking bow and not designed to break ice astern.<ref name=\"poac95\" /><ref name=\"dat\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\nFollowing the successful operation of the Azipod-converted tankers ''Uikku'' and ''Lunni'' in the [[Northern Sea Route]], [[Aker Arctic|Kv\u00e6rner Masa-Yards Arctic Research Centre]] developed the first double acting tanker concept in the early 1990s. The 90,000 DWT tankers were designed to transport oil and gas condensate from the [[Pechora Sea]] in the [[Russia]]n [[Arctic]], where ice conditions during winter can be considered moderate and the ships would operate mainly in astern mode, first to [[Murmansk]] and then [[Rotterdam]], where most of the distance can be travelled in open water year round.<ref name=\"poac95\" /> Other early double acting concepts included a similar ship with an icebreaking bow that would be utilized in summer time when the ship was traveling in areas with low ice concentration but with a risk of colliding with multi-year ice blocks.<ref name=\"dat\" />\n\nIn early 2000s Fortum Shipping, the transportation arm of the Finnish energy company [[Fortum]], started a major fleet renewal program to increase the efficiency and reduce the average age of its vessels.<ref name=\"refine206\">NextStop - Merten valtiaat.

The old ships had traffic restrictions during the worst part of the winter because of their lower [[ice class]] of 1C and could not deliver their cargo all the way to the refineries in Porvoo and Naantali because they were denied icebreaker assistance. When this happened, the oil had to be transported to smaller ships of higher ice class at the edge of the ice \u2014 a practice that was both uneconomical and hazardous.<ref name=\"dat\" />\n\nTo solve these problems Kv\u00e6rner Masa-Yards Arctic Research Centre developed a new 100,000 DWT Aframax tanker concept together with Fortum Shipping, which ordered two vessels from [[Sumitomo Heavy Industries]] in 2001. The new ships were designed to the highest [[Finnish-Swedish ice class]], 1A Super, and to be capable of operating in all ice conditions encountered in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The possibility to operate in the Pechora Sea was also taken into account in the design process. Extensive ice model tests confirmed the vessel's operational capability in level ice, rubble fields, ice channels and ridges.<ref name=\"dat\" />\n\nThe world's first double acting tanker and the largest 1A Super class oil tanker at that time, ''Tempera'', was delivered from [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka shipyard]] in late August 2002.<ref name=\"themotorship\">[http://www.motorship.com/news101/tempera-tanker-double-act TEMPERA Tanker double act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331042251/http://www.motorship.com/news101/tempera-tanker-double-act |date=2012-03-31 }}.

A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to [[slamming]] in heavy weather while a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance.<ref name=\"kujala\">Kujala, P and Riska, K: Talvimerenkulku (TKK-AM-13). Department of Applied Mechanics, Helsinki University of Technology, 2010.</ref> However, already in the late 1800s captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that sometimes it was easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. This was because the forward-facing propellers generated a water flow that lowered the resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice.<ref name=\"arcticaborg\">Aker Arctic Technology Inc.: [http://www.akerarctic.fi/publications/pdf/aker%20arc_arctica.pdf Icebreaking Supply Vessels Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718163440/http://www.akerarctic.fi/publications/pdf/aker%20arc_arctica.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2010-02-08 }}</ref> These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], but as forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main operating mode for merchant ships.<ref name=\"poac95\">Juurmaa, K et al.: [http://www.akerarctic.fi/publications/pdf/Poac95NewDAT.pdf New ice breaking tanker concept for the arctic (DAT)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303021749/http://www.akerarctic.fi/publications/pdf/Poac95NewDAT.pdf |date=2012-03-03 }}.

The superiority of podded propulsion in icebreaking merchant ships, especially when running astern, was proved when Finnish [[product tanker]]s [[MT Varzuga|''Uikku'']] and [[MT Indiga|''Lunni'']] were converted to Azipod propulsion in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Even though the ships were originally designed with icebreaking capability in mind, after the conversion ice resistance in level ice when running astern was only 40% of that when breaking ice ahead despite the ships being equipped with an icebreaking bow and not designed to break ice astern.<ref name=\"poac95\" /><ref name=\"dat\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\nFollowing the successful operation of the Azipod-converted tankers ''Uikku'' and ''Lunni'' in the [[Northern Sea Route]], [[Aker Arctic|Kv\u00e6rner Masa-Yards Arctic Research Centre]] developed the first double acting tanker concept in the early 1990s. The 90,000 DWT tankers were designed to transport oil and gas condensate from the [[Pechora Sea]] in the [[Russia]]n [[Arctic]], where ice conditions during winter can be considered moderate and the ships would operate mainly in astern mode, first to [[Murmansk]] and then [[Rotterdam]], where most of the distance can be travelled in open water year round.<ref name=\"poac95\" /> Other early double acting concepts included a similar ship with an icebreaking bow that would be utilized in summer time when the ship was traveling in areas with low ice concentration but with a risk of colliding with multi-year ice blocks.<ref name=\"dat\" />\n\nIn early 2000s Fortum Shipping, the transportation arm of the Finnish energy company [[Fortum]], started a major fleet renewal program to increase the efficiency and reduce the average age of its vessels.<ref name=\"refine206\">NextStop - Merten valtiaat.

The old ships had traffic restrictions during the worst part of the winter because of their lower [[ice class]] of 1C and could not deliver their cargo all the way to the refineries in Porvoo and Naantali because they were denied icebreaker assistance. When this happened, the oil had to be transported to smaller ships of higher ice class at the edge of the ice \u2014 a practice that was both uneconomical and hazardous.<ref name=\"dat\" />\n\nTo solve these problems Kv\u00e6rner Masa-Yards Arctic Research Centre developed a new 100,000 DWT Aframax tanker concept together with Fortum Shipping, which ordered two vessels from [[Sumitomo Heavy Industries]] in 2001. The new ships were designed to the highest [[Finnish-Swedish ice class]], 1A Super, and to be capable of operating in all ice conditions encountered in the [[Baltic Sea]].

The moulded breadth and depth of her hull are {{convert|44.0|m|ft}} and {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}, respectively, and from keel to mast she measured {{convert|53.1|m|ft}}. Her [[gross tonnage]] is 64,259 and [[net tonnage]] 30,846, and the [[deadweight tonnage]] corresponding to the [[summer draft|draft at summer freeboard]], {{convert|15.3|m|ft}}, is 106,208 tons, slightly more than in ''Tempera''. In ballast ''Mastera'' draws only {{convert|8.6|m|ft}} of water.<ref name=\"nesteoil\" />\n\nThe foreship of ''Mastera'' is designed for open water performance with a [[bulbous bow]] to maximize the hydrodynamic efficiency. The ship is, just like any other ice-strengthened vessel, also capable of running ahead in light ice conditions. The stern is, however, shaped like an icebreaker's bow, and ''Mastera'' is designed to operate independently in the most severe ice conditions of the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=\"akerarctic\" /> For this purpose the ship is also equipped with two [[Bridge (nautical)|bridges]] for navigating in both directions.<ref name=\"nesteoil\" /> The ship is served by a crew of 15 to 20 depending on operating conditions during winter and maintenance work during summer.<ref name=\"vapaavahti42010\" /><ref name=\"refine107\" />\n\n''Mastera'' is classified by [[Lloyd's Register of Shipping]].<ref name=\"nesteoil\" />\n\n=== Cargo tanks and handling ===\n\n''Mastera'' has six pairs of heated, partially epoxy-coated cargo tanks and one pair of fully coated [[slop tank]]s, all divided by a longitudinal center bulkhead and protected by [[double hull]], with a combined capacity of {{convert|121,158.2|m3}} at 98% filling. For cargo handling she has three electrically driven cargo oil pumps with a capacity of 3,500 m<sup>3</sup>/h \u00d7 130 m and one cargo oil stripping pump rated for 300 m<sup>3</sup>/h \u00d7 130 m. The cargo can be loaded in 10 hours and discharged in 12 hours. Each cargo tank has two and both slop tanks one [[automated tank cleaning machine]]s as well as holes for portable tank cleaning machines.<ref name=\"nesteoil\" />\n\nThe ship's ballast water capacity of {{convert|46922.4|m3}} is divided into sixteen segregated ballast tanks, six pairs located in the double hull around the cargo tanks, two fore peak tanks and two aft peak tanks.<ref name=\"themotorship\" /> She has two electrically driven ballast pumps rated at 2,500 m<sup>3</sup>/h \u00d7 35 m and 3,000 m<sup>3</sup>/h \u00d7 70 m.<ref name=\"nesteoil\" /> The ballast capacity is needed to maintain correct trim especially during drydocking \u2014 the empty ship has an aft trim of {{convert|3|m|ft}} and an uneven weight distribution may damage the hull girder.<ref name=\"vapaavahti42010\">Tempera telakalla.

The main engines are equipped with [[exhaust gas economizer]]s. In addition ''Mastera'' has one auxiliary diesel generator that can be used when the ship is at port. The auxiliary generator, six-cylinder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 6L26A, has an output of {{convert|1.7|MW|hp|abbr=on}}. While underway at {{convert|13.5|kn}}, the fuel consumption of the ship's main engines is 56 tons of [[heavy fuel oil]] per day when loaded and 40 tons per day in ballast. Her tanks can store {{convert|2890.1|m3}} of heavy fuel oil for the main engines, {{convert|308.2|m3}} of diesel oil for the auxiliary generator, steam boilers and [[inert gas system]], and {{convert|63.2|m3}} of lubrication oil.<ref name=\"nesteoil\" />\n\n''Mastera'' and her sister ship are the first tankers propelled by ABB Azipod electric [[azimuth thruster]]s capable of rotating 360 degrees around the vertical axis.
