This was the first yearbook published by the Holy See itself, but its compilation was entrusted to the newspaper ''[[Giornale di Roma]]''.

In 1912, it resumed the title ''Annuario Pontificio''.

The magazine ran for eleven years, and the strength of its message inspired two pioneering ''ROCKRGRL'' conferences that showcased, celebrated, and addressed the state of the music industry for female artists.\n\nIn December 2008, the ROCKRGRL Magazine and conference archives were acquired by [[Schlesinger Library]] at the [[Radcliffe Institute]], Harvard University, to be included in their collection of American Women's History artifacts.<ref name=Library>Brodeur, Nicole.[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nicolebrodeur/2008674654_brodeur27m.html \u201cROCKRGRL to Play On at Harvard\u201d] January 27, 2009.</ref>\n\n==''ROCKRGRL'' magazine==\n\n===History===\n''ROCKRGRL'' was started by Carla DeSantis (aka Carla DeSantis Black) in 1994 in [[San Mateo, California]] as part of the [[zine]] movement to provide a [[third-wave feminist]] perspective on women in music.<ref name=Library/>\n\nCommenting on the magazine's founding, DeSantis recalled, \u201cOne issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was about Women Who Rock, and the writer asked everyone what their favorite perfume was, not music.

The magazine ran for eleven years, and the strength of its message inspired two pioneering ''ROCKRGRL'' conferences that showcased, celebrated, and addressed the state of the music industry for female artists.\n\nIn December 2008, the ROCKRGRL Magazine and conference archives were acquired by [[Schlesinger Library]] at the [[Radcliffe Institute]], Harvard University, to be included in their collection of American Women's History artifacts.<ref name=Library>Brodeur, Nicole.[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nicolebrodeur/2008674654_brodeur27m.html \u201cROCKRGRL to Play On at Harvard\u201d] January 27, 2009.</ref>\n\n==''ROCKRGRL'' magazine==\n\n===History===\n''ROCKRGRL'' was started by Carla DeSantis (aka Carla DeSantis Black) in 1994 in [[San Mateo, California]] as part of the [[zine]] movement to provide a [[third-wave feminist]] perspective on women in music.<ref name=Library/>\n\nCommenting on the magazine's founding, DeSantis recalled, \u201cOne issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was about Women Who Rock, and the writer asked everyone what their favorite perfume was, not music.

No beauty tips or guilt trips here \u2014 just shop talk with fascinating artists.\"\n\nFrom its inception, ''ROCKRGRL'' created an atmosphere for women to address music industry sexism head-on.

After his father died in 1892, M\u00fcller had to leave school due to financial difficulties and began an apprenticeship (''kaufm\u00e4nnische Lehre'') at Frankfurt.

He was member of the local parliament (''Stadtverordneter'', 1903 to 1906) and a party functionary (''Unterbezirksvorsitzender''). [[August Bebel]] nominated him in 1905 (without success) and 1906 (successfully) for membership of the board of the national SPD.\nAt that time, M\u00fcller changed from a left-wing Social Democrat to a \"centrist\", who argued against both the \"revisionists\" and against the radical left around [[Rosa Luxemburg]].\nTogether with [[Friedrich Ebert]] M\u00fcller succeeded in 1909 in creating the ''Parteiausschuss'' that was to deal with internal arguments in between the party conventions. Known for his calm, industriousness, integrity and rationality, M\u00fcller lacked charisma. In 1909, he tried but failed to prevent [[Otto Braun]]'s election to the board, laying the foundation for a long-running animosity between the two.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAs a result of his foreign language skills, M\u00fcller was the representative of the SPD at the [[Second International]] and at the conventions of socialist parties in other countries in western Europe. In late July 1914, M\u00fcller was sent to Paris to negotiate with the French socialists over a common stance towards the respective countries' war loan proposals. No agreement was reached, however, and before M\u00fcller was able to report back, the SPD had already decided to support the first war loans in the Reichstag.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], M\u00fcller supported the [[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]].<ref name=\"DHM\"/> He was used by the SPD leadership to deal with arguments with the party's left wing and as an in-house censor for the party newspaper ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' to avoid an outright ban by the military authorities. M\u00fcller was close to the group around [[Eduard David]] and supported both the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with Russia and the entry of the SPD into the [[Cabinet Baden|government]] of [[Max von Baden]] in October 1918.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nFirst elected in a by-election in 1916, M\u00fcller was a member of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] until 1918.<ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\n===1918 to 1920===\nIn the [[German Revolution of 1918-19]], M\u00fcller was a member of the Greater Berlin executive council (''Vollzugsrat der Arbeiter- und Soldatenr\u00e4te'') where he represented the position of the SPD leadership, arguing in favour of elections to the [[Weimar National Assembly]]. He later published a book on his experience during the revolution.<ref name=\"Bio\"/><ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\nIn January 1919, M\u00fcller was elected to the National Assembly. In February 1919, Ebert became president of Germany and appointed [[Philipp Scheidemann]] as ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'' (head of government). These two had been the joint chairmen of the SPD and now replacements had to be found. M\u00fcller and [[Otto Wels]] were elected with 373 and 291 out of 376 votes, respectively. Wels focused on internal leadership and organization, whilst M\u00fcller was the external representative of the party. In 1919 and 1920\u201328, M\u00fcller was also leader of the parliamentary fraction (''Fraktionsvorsitzender '') in the National Assembly and then the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. He was nominated as the chairman of the Reichstags' Committee on Foreign Affairs. After 1920, he was a candidate for the Reichstag for [[Franconia]] and changed his name to M\u00fcller-Franken, to distinguish himself from other members named M\u00fcller.<ref name=\"Bio\"/><ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\nAfter Scheidemann resigned in June 1919, M\u00fcller was offered to become his successor as head of government but declined. Under the new ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'' and later Chancellor [[Gustav Bauer]], M\u00fcller became ''Reichsau\u00dfenminister'' (Foreign Minister) on 21 June 1919. In this capacity, he went to Versailles and with Colonial Minister [[Johannes Bell]] signed the [[Treaty of Versailles|peace treaty]] for Germany on 29 June 1919.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAfter the resignation of the [[Cabinet Bauer]], which followed on the [[Kapp Putsch|Kapp-L\u00fcttwitz Putsch]] in March 1920, M\u00fcller accepted Ebert's offer of becoming chancellor and formed a new [[Cabinet M\u00fcller I|government]]. Under his leadership, the government suppressed the left-wing uprisings like that in the [[Red Ruhr Army|Ruhr area]] and urged the disarmament of paramilitary ''Einwohnerwehren'' demanded by the Allies. The newly created second ''Sozialisierungskommission '' (commission on socialization) admitted some members from the left-wing [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]] because M\u00fcller felt that only that way would the workers be willing to accept the commission's decisions.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> In social policy, M\u00fcller's time as chancellor saw the passage of a number of progressive social reforms.

The SPD suffered a defeat at the polls, with the number of people voting for them almost dropping by half compared to the January 1919 election. Discouraged, M\u00fcller only half-heartedly negotiated with the USPD about a coalition. However, he was turned down anyway, as the USPD was unwilling to join any coalition including non-socialist parties and one in which the USPD was not the majority party. On the other side of the political spectrum, M\u00fcller was opposed to working with [[Gustav Stresemann]]'s [[German People's Party]] (DVP), considering them a mouthpiece for corporate interests and doubting their loyalty to the republican constitution.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\n===1920 to 1928===\nThe SPD now was in the opposition regarding the domestic agenda of the new government while supporting its foreign policy, in particular regarding reparations to the Allies. M\u00fcller was  an early advocate of joining the [[League of Nations]] and of moving politically closer to the West. He was critical of the [[Soviet Union]]'s authoritarian system of government, its revolutionary goals and its support for the radical left in Germany. However, he opposed a blockade of the Soviet Union by the western Allies.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nInitially, M\u00fcller favoured diplomatic relations with the Soviets only as far as they would help in preventing an integration of [[Upper Silesia]] into the new Polish state. He viewed the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)]] as a true peace treaty, but one that only had meaning within the context of a successful diplomatic policy towards the western powers, not as an alternative to it. M\u00fcller warned against attaching too much hope to the potential economic gains from the treaty, arguing that only the US would be in a position to provide effective aid for the [[economic reconstruction]] of post-World War I Europe.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nDuring the period in office of the governments led by [[Joseph Wirth]] in 1921/22 and in which the SPD participated, M\u00fcller demanded as parliamentary leader of the SPD that budget consolidation would involve first and foremost the higher taxation of wealth rather than of consumption. This led to confrontations with the \"bourgeois\" parties. Similarly, the reunification of SPD and USPD resulted in a move to the left of the new SPD. Arguments between SPD and DVP about economic issues like the eight-hour work day introduced in late 1918 (but opposed by the DVP) finally caused the coalition's end in November 1922.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nRecognizing a national emergency when the [[Occupation of the Ruhr|French seized the Ruhr]] and inflation spiraled out of control in 1923, M\u00fcller was ready to enter into a \"Grand Coalition\" led by Gustav Stresemann (August to November 1923). However, differences in economic and social policies strained relations between the SPD and the other members of the coalition. M\u00fcller did support the emergency measures taken after October 1923, but the biased way the Reich government dealt with the socialist provincial governments in Thuringia and Saxony on the one hand and the right-wing regime in Bavaria on the other, caused the SPD to leave the coalition in November 1923.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAt the party convention in 1924, M\u00fcller said that the SPD's stance towards coalitions was less based on principles than on tactics. The goal was to supply a Reichstag majority to the foreign policy that the Social Democrats thought was right. Although they were in the opposition, the SPD supported a policy of reconciliation with the western powers (as exemplified by the [[Locarno Treaties]] and entry to the League of Nations). In late 1926, another \"Grand Coalition\" seemed likely, but was scuppered by intrigues from inside the Defence Ministry and by the right wing of the DVP.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\n===After 1928===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-06408, Hermann M\u00fcller.jpg|thumb|left|M\u00fcller in August 1928.]]\nIn 1928, Prussian ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'' Otto Braun said that he was not interested in becoming chancellor. When the SPD turned out to be the clear winner of the [[1928 German federal election|May 1928 elections]], the Social Democrats thus designated M\u00fcller as chancellor. However, the other parties proved reluctant to compromise and it took a personal intervention by Stresemann for a government to be formed on 28 June 1928. The coalition\u2014of Social Democrats, Zentrum, DDP and DVP\u2014only managed to settle on a written agreement on the government's policies in spring 1929. In particular domestic policy differences between SPD and DVP dominated the government's work. Its continued existence was mainly due to the mutual personal esteem in which M\u00fcller and Foreign minister Stresemann held each other. Relations between the parties were strained by the arguments over ''Panzerkreuzer A'' (construction of a battleship), during which the SPD forced its ministers to vote against the allocation of funds to the project in the Reichstag although they had endorsed it in cabinet meetings. In addition, the ''Ruhreisenstreit'' was a bone of contention, as the DVP refused to provide financial support even to those only indirectly affected by the strike. Financing the budget 1929 and the external liabilities of the Reich was a huge problem, and an agreement was only possible by counting on negotiating more lenient conditions with the Allies. M\u00fcller himself had been the leader of the delegation to the League of Nations in the summer of 1928 where he\u2014despite a heated argument with French Foreign Minister [[Aristide Briand]] over German rearmament\u2014had laid the groundwork for concessions by the Allies. By January 1930, the government had succeeded in negotiating a reduction in reparation payments (the [[Young Plan]] signed in August 1929) and a promise by the Allies to completely remove the [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupation forces from the Rhineland]] by May 1930.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, M\u00fcller's cabinet also had to deal with diplomatic problems with Poland over trade and ethnic minority questions. German-Soviet relations also reached a nadir, as the Soviet government blamed the cabinet for violence between communist demonstrators and the police in Berlin in May 1929. At that point, the bourgeois parties were looking for ways to end the coalition with the SPD. There were attempts to stop the Young Plan via a [[1929 German referendum|referendum]] and the coalition parties disagreed on the issue of [[unemployment insurance]]. M\u00fcller himself was unable to participate in the political arena for several months due to a life-threatening illness.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAlthough M\u00fcller was able to resume his duties in the fall of 1929, he was physically weakened and unable to control the centrifugal forces at work. The coalition finally fell apart in a disagreement about budgetary issues. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the unemployment insurance required an injection of taxpayer money by the Reich, but the parties could not agree on how to raise the funds. M\u00fcller was willing to accept a compromise offer by [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] (Zentrum), but he was overruled by the SPD parliamentary group which refused to make any further concessions. On the suggestion of his advisors, ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]] refused to provide M\u00fcller's government with the emergency powers of [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]], forcing M\u00fcller to resign on 27 March 1930.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nNevertheless, a number of progressive reforms were implemented under M\u00fcller's last government.

After his father died in 1892, M\u00fcller had to leave school due to financial difficulties and began an apprenticeship (''kaufm\u00e4nnische Lehre'') at Frankfurt. He worked at Frankfurt and [[Breslau]] and in 1893 joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD).<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz66522.html|title=Biografie Hermann M\u00fcller(-Franken) (German)|publisher=Bayerische Nationalbibliothek|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=DHM>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/MuellerHermann/index.html |title=Biografie Hermann M\u00fcller (German) |publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum |accessdate=16 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410112617/http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/MuellerHermann/index.html |archivedate=April 10, 2014 }}</ref> Hermann M\u00fcller, a Social Democrat heavily influenced by his father-an advocate of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s views-is the only German chancellor who was not a member of any religion.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Before 1918===\nFrom 1899 to 1906, M\u00fcller worked as an editor at the Socialist newspaper ''[[G\u00f6rlitzer Volkswacht]]''. He was member of the local parliament (''Stadtverordneter'', 1903 to 1906) and a party functionary (''Unterbezirksvorsitzender''). [[August Bebel]] nominated him in 1905 (without success) and 1906 (successfully) for membership of the board of the national SPD.\nAt that time, M\u00fcller changed from a left-wing Social Democrat to a \"centrist\", who argued against both the \"revisionists\" and against the radical left around [[Rosa Luxemburg]].\nTogether with [[Friedrich Ebert]] M\u00fcller succeeded in 1909 in creating the ''Parteiausschuss'' that was to deal with internal arguments in between the party conventions. Known for his calm, industriousness, integrity and rationality, M\u00fcller lacked charisma. In 1909, he tried but failed to prevent [[Otto Braun]]'s election to the board, laying the foundation for a long-running animosity between the two.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAs a result of his foreign language skills, M\u00fcller was the representative of the SPD at the [[Second International]] and at the conventions of socialist parties in other countries in western Europe. In late July 1914, M\u00fcller was sent to Paris to negotiate with the French socialists over a common stance towards the respective countries' war loan proposals. No agreement was reached, however, and before M\u00fcller was able to report back, the SPD had already decided to support the first war loans in the Reichstag.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], M\u00fcller supported the [[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]].<ref name=\"DHM\"/> He was used by the SPD leadership to deal with arguments with the party's left wing and as an in-house censor for the party newspaper ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' to avoid an outright ban by the military authorities. M\u00fcller was close to the group around [[Eduard David]] and supported both the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with Russia and the entry of the SPD into the [[Cabinet Baden|government]] of [[Max von Baden]] in October 1918.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nFirst elected in a by-election in 1916, M\u00fcller was a member of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] until 1918.<ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\n===1918 to 1920===\nIn the [[German Revolution of 1918-19]], M\u00fcller was a member of the Greater Berlin executive council (''Vollzugsrat der Arbeiter- und Soldatenr\u00e4te'') where he represented the position of the SPD leadership, arguing in favour of elections to the [[Weimar National Assembly]]. He later published a book on his experience during the revolution.<ref name=\"Bio\"/><ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\nIn January 1919, M\u00fcller was elected to the National Assembly. In February 1919, Ebert became president of Germany and appointed [[Philipp Scheidemann]] as ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'' (head of government). These two had been the joint chairmen of the SPD and now replacements had to be found. M\u00fcller and [[Otto Wels]] were elected with 373 and 291 out of 376 votes, respectively. Wels focused on internal leadership and organization, whilst M\u00fcller was the external representative of the party. In 1919 and 1920\u201328, M\u00fcller was also leader of the parliamentary fraction (''Fraktionsvorsitzender '') in the National Assembly and then the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. He was nominated as the chairman of the Reichstags' Committee on Foreign Affairs. After 1920, he was a candidate for the Reichstag for [[Franconia]] and changed his name to M\u00fcller-Franken, to distinguish himself from other members named M\u00fcller.<ref name=\"Bio\"/><ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\nAfter Scheidemann resigned in June 1919, M\u00fcller was offered to become his successor as head of government but declined. Under the new ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'' and later Chancellor [[Gustav Bauer]], M\u00fcller became ''Reichsau\u00dfenminister'' (Foreign Minister) on 21 June 1919. In this capacity, he went to Versailles and with Colonial Minister [[Johannes Bell]] signed the [[Treaty of Versailles|peace treaty]] for Germany on 29 June 1919.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAfter the resignation of the [[Cabinet Bauer]], which followed on the [[Kapp Putsch|Kapp-L\u00fcttwitz Putsch]] in March 1920, M\u00fcller accepted Ebert's offer of becoming chancellor and formed a new [[Cabinet M\u00fcller I|government]]. Under his leadership, the government suppressed the left-wing uprisings like that in the [[Red Ruhr Army|Ruhr area]] and urged the disarmament of paramilitary ''Einwohnerwehren'' demanded by the Allies. The newly created second ''Sozialisierungskommission '' (commission on socialization) admitted some members from the left-wing [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]] because M\u00fcller felt that only that way would the workers be willing to accept the commission's decisions.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> In social policy, M\u00fcller's time as chancellor saw the passage of a number of progressive social reforms.

The SPD suffered a defeat at the polls, with the number of people voting for them almost dropping by half compared to the January 1919 election. Discouraged, M\u00fcller only half-heartedly negotiated with the USPD about a coalition. However, he was turned down anyway, as the USPD was unwilling to join any coalition including non-socialist parties and one in which the USPD was not the majority party. On the other side of the political spectrum, M\u00fcller was opposed to working with [[Gustav Stresemann]]'s [[German People's Party]] (DVP), considering them a mouthpiece for corporate interests and doubting their loyalty to the republican constitution.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\n===1920 to 1928===\nThe SPD now was in the opposition regarding the domestic agenda of the new government while supporting its foreign policy, in particular regarding reparations to the Allies. M\u00fcller was  an early advocate of joining the [[League of Nations]] and of moving politically closer to the West. He was critical of the [[Soviet Union]]'s authoritarian system of government, its revolutionary goals and its support for the radical left in Germany. However, he opposed a blockade of the Soviet Union by the western Allies.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nInitially, M\u00fcller favoured diplomatic relations with the Soviets only as far as they would help in preventing an integration of [[Upper Silesia]] into the new Polish state. He viewed the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)]] as a true peace treaty, but one that only had meaning within the context of a successful diplomatic policy towards the western powers, not as an alternative to it. M\u00fcller warned against attaching too much hope to the potential economic gains from the treaty, arguing that only the US would be in a position to provide effective aid for the [[economic reconstruction]] of post-World War I Europe.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nDuring the period in office of the governments led by [[Joseph Wirth]] in 1921/22 and in which the SPD participated, M\u00fcller demanded as parliamentary leader of the SPD that budget consolidation would involve first and foremost the higher taxation of wealth rather than of consumption. This led to confrontations with the \"bourgeois\" parties. Similarly, the reunification of SPD and USPD resulted in a move to the left of the new SPD. Arguments between SPD and DVP about economic issues like the eight-hour work day introduced in late 1918 (but opposed by the DVP) finally caused the coalition's end in November 1922.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nRecognizing a national emergency when the [[Occupation of the Ruhr|French seized the Ruhr]] and inflation spiraled out of control in 1923, M\u00fcller was ready to enter into a \"Grand Coalition\" led by Gustav Stresemann (August to November 1923). However, differences in economic and social policies strained relations between the SPD and the other members of the coalition. M\u00fcller did support the emergency measures taken after October 1923, but the biased way the Reich government dealt with the socialist provincial governments in Thuringia and Saxony on the one hand and the right-wing regime in Bavaria on the other, caused the SPD to leave the coalition in November 1923.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAt the party convention in 1924, M\u00fcller said that the SPD's stance towards coalitions was less based on principles than on tactics. The goal was to supply a Reichstag majority to the foreign policy that the Social Democrats thought was right. Although they were in the opposition, the SPD supported a policy of reconciliation with the western powers (as exemplified by the [[Locarno Treaties]] and entry to the League of Nations). In late 1926, another \"Grand Coalition\" seemed likely, but was scuppered by intrigues from inside the Defence Ministry and by the right wing of the DVP.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\n===After 1928===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-06408, Hermann M\u00fcller.jpg|thumb|left|M\u00fcller in August 1928.]]\nIn 1928, Prussian ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'' Otto Braun said that he was not interested in becoming chancellor. When the SPD turned out to be the clear winner of the [[1928 German federal election|May 1928 elections]], the Social Democrats thus designated M\u00fcller as chancellor. However, the other parties proved reluctant to compromise and it took a personal intervention by Stresemann for a government to be formed on 28 June 1928. The coalition\u2014of Social Democrats, Zentrum, DDP and DVP\u2014only managed to settle on a written agreement on the government's policies in spring 1929. In particular domestic policy differences between SPD and DVP dominated the government's work. Its continued existence was mainly due to the mutual personal esteem in which M\u00fcller and Foreign minister Stresemann held each other. Relations between the parties were strained by the arguments over ''Panzerkreuzer A'' (construction of a battleship), during which the SPD forced its ministers to vote against the allocation of funds to the project in the Reichstag although they had endorsed it in cabinet meetings. In addition, the ''Ruhreisenstreit'' was a bone of contention, as the DVP refused to provide financial support even to those only indirectly affected by the strike. Financing the budget 1929 and the external liabilities of the Reich was a huge problem, and an agreement was only possible by counting on negotiating more lenient conditions with the Allies. M\u00fcller himself had been the leader of the delegation to the League of Nations in the summer of 1928 where he\u2014despite a heated argument with French Foreign Minister [[Aristide Briand]] over German rearmament\u2014had laid the groundwork for concessions by the Allies. By January 1930, the government had succeeded in negotiating a reduction in reparation payments (the [[Young Plan]] signed in August 1929) and a promise by the Allies to completely remove the [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupation forces from the Rhineland]] by May 1930.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, M\u00fcller's cabinet also had to deal with diplomatic problems with Poland over trade and ethnic minority questions. German-Soviet relations also reached a nadir, as the Soviet government blamed the cabinet for violence between communist demonstrators and the police in Berlin in May 1929. At that point, the bourgeois parties were looking for ways to end the coalition with the SPD. There were attempts to stop the Young Plan via a [[1929 German referendum|referendum]] and the coalition parties disagreed on the issue of [[unemployment insurance]]. M\u00fcller himself was unable to participate in the political arena for several months due to a life-threatening illness.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAlthough M\u00fcller was able to resume his duties in the fall of 1929, he was physically weakened and unable to control the centrifugal forces at work. The coalition finally fell apart in a disagreement about budgetary issues. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the unemployment insurance required an injection of taxpayer money by the Reich, but the parties could not agree on how to raise the funds. M\u00fcller was willing to accept a compromise offer by [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] (Zentrum), but he was overruled by the SPD parliamentary group which refused to make any further concessions. On the suggestion of his advisors, ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]] refused to provide M\u00fcller's government with the emergency powers of [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]], forcing M\u00fcller to resign on 27 March 1930.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nNevertheless, a number of progressive reforms were implemented under M\u00fcller's last government.

Initially allowing insurgent-faction members advocating communism into both their parties as an ally against colonialism, both later developed hostile relations with the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP) and [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), expelling the leftists from their ranks. Thus, the PAP and UMNO had co-operated closely for some time to work towards eliminating the MCP insurgency and achieving independence from colonialism.\n\nSuch co-operation culminated in 1963 with the merger of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia alongside Sabah and Sarawak.\n\n==Merger==\n{{Politics of Singapore}}\nThere are many factors that led the UMNO and the PAP to agree to a merger. Negotiations for merger began in 1960, and initially, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the prime minister of Malaya, refused. However, fears of the MCP-backed insurgency taking over Singapore and using it as a base against Malaya gave reason for the Malayan government to admit Singapore as a member state, and for Singapore, the promise of independence from British colonial rule and economic growth with a guaranteed common market between the two nations gave the city-state reason enough to join the federation.\n\nOn 24 April 1961 Lee Kuan Yew proposed the idea of forming Malaysia during a meeting to Tunku Abdul Rahman, after which Tunku invited Lee to prepare a paper elaborating on this idea. On 9 May, Lee sent the final version of the paper to Tunku and then deputy Malayan Prime Minister Abdul Razak. In the paper , Lee wrote : \"Therefore, a plan to create a federation of these three territories must be tactfully and gradually introduced into the minds of the peoples of the three territories, and should be presented as a desire of the peoples living in this region, and not initiated by the British.<ref>The Making of Federation of Malaysia , A J Stockwell</ref> There were doubts about the practicality of the idea but Lee assured the Malayan government of continued Malay political dominance in the new federation. Razak supported the idea of the new federation and worked to convince Tunku to back it.\n\nOn 27 May 1961, Abdul Rahman announced the idea of forming \"Malaysia\", which would consist of Brunei, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore, all except Malaya still under British rule. It was states that this would allow the central government to better control and combat communist activities, especially in Singapore. It was also feared that if Singapore became independent, it would become a base for Chinese chauvinists to threaten Malayan sovereignty. The proposed inclusion of British territories besides Singapore was intended to keep the ethnic composition of the new nation similar to that of Malaya, with the Malay and indigenous populations of the other territories cancelling out the Chinese majority in Singapore\n\nSingapore became part of Malaysia after [[1962 Merger Referendum of Singapore|a national referendum was held]], under the conditions that all Singaporean citizens would automatically become citizens of Malaysia. Singapore would also retain a degree of autonomy and state rights, such as over labour and [[education in Singapore|education]], as well as the right to keep all four of its official languages: [[Singaporean English|English]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The Federation of Malaysia was established on 16 September 1963 under those conditions.\n\n==Ideological differences==\nInitially, all appeared well. However, both nations developed different ideological lines on racial issues, especially concerning the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese race]] and the [[Malay race]], mainly marked by UMNO's belief in the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputera]] policy of helping Malays as the original settlers of Malaya who were mostly poor during post independence and it was thought by PAP as a positive [[racial discrimination]].\n\nUMNO saw this as much needed [[affirmative action]] for Malays, who had supposedly been put at a disadvantage by the heavy presence of immigrants, mainly Chinese, who had entered the Malay Archipelago during British colonial rule; many of them had the opportunity to be businessmen living in the city, while Malays were left as coolies in rural areas. The PAP staunchly opposed this as unjustified and racist. The PAP, along with several other Malaysian minority parties, epitomised this view with the cry of a ''\"[[Malaysian Malaysia]]!\"'', a policy to serve the entire Malaysian ''nationality'', which Singapore at that time was included in, as opposed to just the Malay ''race''.\n\nThis was driven by the fact that Singaporean Chinese were facing increasing political, legal, and economic discrimination. One of the initial solutions proposed was to have the PAP join UMNO and later on participate in the federal government, but the [[Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) feared that the PAP would replace them, and opposed the PAP, seeing it as a radical socialist movement. The MCA urged the UMNO to prevent the PAP from becoming too influential in the federal government. From this point on, the relationship between the UMNO and the PAP became increasingly cool, falling little short of hostile.\n\n==Conflict between the parties==\nDuring this period, racial tensions grew between the Chinese and the Malays, allegedly partially incited earlier by the [[Malayan Communist Party|MCP]], such as during the [[Hock Lee bus riots]], but with growing blame put on UMNO by the PAP. This was not an unfounded allegation, as many Malay newspapers, such as the partisan newspaper [[Utusan Melayu]], continued to allege that the PAP had been mistreating the Malay race, citing the relocation of Malays from the [[kampungs]] for redevelopment. An increasingly heated debate on both sides sprung up, inciting racial tensions to such an extent that [[race riots]] occurred, culminating with [[1964 Race Riots|two riots]] on and after [[Muhammad]]'s birthday in 1964.\n\nBoth parties continued to escalate the tension with scathing verbal attacks on each other, accusing each other of being the cause of the riots. In what was seen by the PAP as a violation of previous agreements to confine their political role to their respective states<ref>{{cite book |last1=Noordin Sopiee |first1=Mohamed |title=From Malayan Union to Singapore separation : political unification in the Malaysia region, 1945-65 |publisher=University Malaya Press |isbn=9789831001943 |edition=2nd}}</ref>, Singapore UMNO ([[Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura|SUMNO]]) competed in the [[1963 Elections of Singapore|1963 state elections]] in Singapore on 21 September 1963  as part of the [[Singapore Alliance Party]]. Despite failing to win any seats, even in Malay-dominant constituencies, it was seen as an attack on the PAP's power base<ref name=\"Lepoer\">{{cite book |last1=Lepoer |first1=Barbara |title=Singapore: A Country Study |date=1989 |publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress |location=Washington |url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/10.htm}}</ref>.\n\nEventually, the PAP decided to challenge the policies of the Central Government directly, both as a retaliatory measure and to further its ideological grounds. It ran in the [[1964 Malaysian general election|April 1964 Malaysian federal elections]] in coalition with other parties under the [[Malaysian Solidarity Council]]. The PAP was now a legitimate opposition party in the federal elections, and campaigned on a platform of eliminating racialism and a Malaysian Malaysia. Their rallies attracted large crowds. They decided to contest a minority of the seats however, to avoid any perception that they were trying to undermine the ruling party or being seen as agents of instability. The PAP only won one seat and 2.05% of the vote<ref name=\"Lepoer\" />.\n\nUMNO saw this as spite, and felt threatened by the fact that the PAP had even contested any seats at all, and was alarmed by the seat the PAP managed to win. [[Tan Siew Sin]], the finance minister at this time, demeaningly commented, \"How can these ''kachang puteh'' parties pose a threat?\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Omar |first1=Rusdi |title=Malaysia Singapore Relations |date=20 Jul 2014 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290810822_Malaysia_Singapore_Relations}}</ref>. The sharp highlight of the degenerating situation was a vow by UMNO to oust the PAP from the Singapore government when the next set of state elections occurred, perhaps before the PAP could do likewise at the next federal election.\n\nIn addition to racial unrest, thorny issues concerning Singapore's rights as an autonomous state further put a dent in relations, such as the failure of a [[free trade|common market]] to be set up between the Federation and Singapore, and the heavy tax burden placed on Singapore, which was seen as unfair. Such issues catalysed the impending secession: On 7 August 1965, Tunku Abdul Rahman announced to the Malaysian Parliament in [[Kuala Lumpur]] that the Parliament should vote yes on the resolution to have Singapore expelled from the Federation, choosing to ''\"sever all ties with a State Government that showed no measure of loyalty to its Central Government\"'' as opposed to the undesirable method of suppressing the PAP for its actions. Singapore's [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|separation and independence became official on 9 August 1965.]]\n\n''[[De jure]]'', Singapore withdrew of its own accord. ''De facto'', however, the PAP had no true authority to influence whether Singapore should leave or not, despite having pressured Tunku Abdul Rahman not to take such a course of action. The separation agreement was signed to maintain friendly relations, trade agreements, and mutual defence ties. These were left intact, although federal ties to Singapore as a state were cut off.\n\n==Post-separation==\nThe complex relationship continued with the issue of trade and other agreements between the now separate entities of Malaysia and Singapore. At times both parties have heavily criticised each other for their policies, to the extent of issuing threats. At present, both have had their countries issue bans on some of the other's media, for example, the ''[[New Straits Times]]'', a Malaysian newspaper publication, is banned in Singapore, and ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the corresponding newspaper publication for Singapore, is banned in Malaysia (though as recent as June 2005 there have been talks to lift the bans on both sides of the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway|Causeway]]). This heavy exchange of words is epitomised by the former prime ministers of both countries, [[Lee Kuan Yew]] of the PAP, and Dr. [[Mahathir]] of the UMNO.\n\nPAP\u2013UMNO relations were volatile at several points in history, and there are still long-running disputes. However, Malaysia and Singapore remain relatively close allies. The two countries' relations with each other are stronger than their (generally warm) relations with other countries in the region, for example, the members of Southeast Asian regional-bloc [[ASEAN]]. For example, there is a strong law enforcement co-operation on both sides of the Causeway.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore relations]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*Goh, Jenny (23 July 1997).
