The centre of origin is probably peninsular India, where the closest wild relatives (''Cajanus cajanifolia'') occur in tropical deciduous woodlands.<ref>Van der Maeson, L. J. G.

Berkeley: University of California Press</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\nToday, pigeon pea is widely cultivated in all tropical and semitropical regions of both the [[Old World|Old]] and the New Worlds.\n\nWorld production of pigeon peas is estimated at 4.49 million tons.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> About 63% of this production comes from India. Africa is the secondary centre of diversity and at present it contributes about 21% of global production with 1.05 million tons. Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda are the major producers in Africa.\n\nThe total number of hectares grown to pigeon pea is estimated at 5.4 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> India accounts for 72% of area grown to pigeon pea or 3.9 million hectares.\n\nPigeon pea is an important [[legume]] crop of rainfed agriculture in the semiarid tropics. The Indian subcontinent, eastern Africa and Central America, in that order, are the world's three main pigeon pea-producing regions. Pigeon peas are cultivated in more than 25 tropical and subtropical countries, either as a sole crop or intermixed with [[cereal]]s, such as [[sorghum]] (''Sorghum bicolor''), [[pearl millet]] (''Pennisetum glaucum''), or [[maize]] (''Zea mays''), or with other legumes, such as [[peanut]]s (''Arachis hypogaea''). Being a legume capable of [[symbiosis]] with [[Rhizobia]], the bacteria associated with the pigeon pea enrich soils through symbiotic [[nitrogen fixation]].\n\nPigeon peas can be of a perennial variety, in which the crop can last three to five years (although the seed yield drops considerably after the first two years), or an annual variety more suitable for seed production.\n\nThe crop is cultivated on marginal land by resource-poor farmers, who commonly grow traditional medium- and long-duration (5\u201311 months) [[landrace]]s. Short-duration pigeon peas (3\u20134 months) suitable for multiple cropping have recently been developed. Traditionally, the use of such input as fertilizers, weeding, irrigation, and pesticides is minimal, so present yield levels are low (average = 700&nbsp;kg/ha). Greater attention is now being given to managing the crop because it is in high demand at remunerative prices.\n\nPigeon peas are very drought-resistant and can be grown in areas with less than 650&nbsp;mm annual rainfall. With the maize crop failing three out of five years in drought-prone areas of [[Kenya]], a consortium led by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] (ICRISAT) aimed to promote the pigeon pea as a drought-resistant, nutritious alternative crop. Successive projects encouraged commercialization of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20\u201325% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialization of the pigeon pea is now enabling farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.\n\n[[John Spence (scientist)|John Spence]], a [[botanist]] and politician from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], developed several varieties of dwarf pigeon peas which can be harvested by machine, instead of by hand.<ref name=\"niherst\">{{cite news|url=http://www.niherst.gov.tt/icons/tt-icons-1/69-john-spence.htm|title=John Spence (1929) Plant Pathologist|date=|work=[[National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology]]|accessdate=2015-02-24|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Seeds and chafe==\n===Dehulling methods=== \nDehulling pigeon peas is an age-old practice in India. In earlier days hand pounding was common. Several traditional methods are used that can be broadly classified under two categories:\n\n====Wet method==== \nInvolves water soaking, sun drying and dehulling.\n\n====Dry method==== \nInvolves oil/water application, drying in the sun, and dehulling. Depending on the magnitude of operation, large-scale commercial dehulling of large quantities of pigeon pea into its deskinned, split version, known as toor [[dal]] in Hindi, is done in mechanically operated mills.<ref>[http://www.ikisan.com/tg-redgram-harvesting-storage.html ''Harvesting And Storage'']</ref><ref>[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 ''Pigeonpea in Eastern and Southern Africa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718193632/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 |date=2014-07-18 }}, [[ICRISAT]] Posted 10 October 2012.

In combination with [[cereals]], pigeon peas make a well-balanced meal and hence are favoured by nutritionists as an essential ingredient for balanced diets. The dried peas may be sprouted briefly, then cooked, for a flavor different from the green or dried peas. Sprouting also enhances the digestibility of dried pigeon peas via the reduction of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in the cooked dried peas.<ref>[http://www.bioline.org.br/request?ja06052 \"Effect of Sprouting on invitro digestibility of some locally consumed leguminous seeds\".] ''Journal of Applied Sciences and Environmental Management''.

A dish made of rice and green pigeon peas (called ''moro de guandules'') is a traditional food in the Dominican Republic. Pigeon peas are also made as a stew, with [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] balls. In [[Puerto Rico]], ''[[arroz con gandules]]'' is made with [[rice]] and pigeon peas and is a traditional dish, especially during Christmas season.

Tomatoes and tomato paste are added.  Then water is added along with the peas and rice, and slow boiled until tender. The dish becomes a medium-dark brown color, resulting from absorbing the colors of the browned initial ingredients and the cooked tomato paste. The pigeon peas themselves absorb the same, becoming a much darker brown, providing some contrast while still complementing the distinctive \"browned\" theme of the dish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trubahamianfoodtours.com/bites-of-nassau-food-tour/bahamian-must-eats-peas-n-rice/|title=Tru Bahamian Must Eats: Peas & Rice|website=Tru Bahamian Food Tours|accessdate=12 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042143/http://trubahamianfoodtours.com/bites-of-nassau-food-tour/bahamian-must-eats-peas-n-rice/|archivedate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Thailand]], pigeon peas are grown as a host for [[scale insect]]s which produce [[lac]], the key ingredient in [[shellac]].\n\nPigeon peas are in some areas an important crop for [[green manure]], providing up to 90&nbsp;kg nitrogen per hectare.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adu-Gyamfi|first=Joseph J.|last2=Myaka|first2=Fidelis A.|last3=Sakala|first3=Webster D.|last4=Odgaard|first4=Rie|last5=Vesterager|first5=Jens M.|last6=Jensen|first6=Henning H\u00f8gh|date=2007|title=Biological nitrogen fixation and nitrogen and phosphorus budgets in farmer-managed intercrops of maize-pigeonpea in semi-arid southern and eastern Africa|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=295|issue=1\u20132|pages=127\u2013136|doi=10.1007/s11104-007-9270-0|issn=0032-079X}}</ref> The woody stems of pigeon peas can also be used as firewood, fencing and thatch.\n\nIt is an important ingredient of animal feed used in West Africa, especially in Nigeria, where it is also grown.

''Cajanus cajan'' (Pigeonpea)\", ''Series of Crop Specific Biology Documents'' published by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Comittee of the Government of India</ref> is a perennial [[legume]] from the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Fabaceae]]. Since its [[domestication]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] at least 3,500 years ago, its seeds have become a common [[food]] in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is consumed on a very large scale in [[South Asia]] and is a major source of [[protein]] for the population of the Indian subcontinent. It is the primary accompaniment to rice or [[roti]] (flat bread) and has the status of [[staple diet]] throughout the length and breadth of India.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Pigeon pea flower at Sydney 2019.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pigeon pea flower at Sydney 2019]]\n[[File:Cajanus cajan.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Pigeon pea is a perennial which can grow into a small tree.]]\n[[File:Cajanus cajan MHNT.BOT.2015.2.47.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Cajanus cajan'' \u2013 [[MHNT]]]]\n[[File:Cajanus cajan, flowers.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Pigeon pea flowers]]\n\nThe cultivation of the pigeon pea goes back at least 3,500 years. The centre of origin is probably peninsular India, where the closest wild relatives (''Cajanus cajanifolia'') occur in tropical deciduous woodlands.<ref>Van der Maeson, L. J. G.

Berkeley: University of California Press</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\nToday, pigeon pea is widely cultivated in all tropical and semitropical regions of both the [[Old World|Old]] and the New Worlds.\n\nWorld production of pigeon peas is estimated at 4.49 million tons.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> About 63% of this production comes from India. Africa is the secondary centre of diversity and at present it contributes about 21% of global production with 1.05 million tons. Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda are the major producers in Africa.\n\nThe total number of hectares grown to pigeon pea is estimated at 5.4 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> India accounts for 72% of area grown to pigeon pea or 3.9 million hectares.\n\nPigeon pea is an important [[legume]] crop of rainfed agriculture in the semiarid tropics. The Indian subcontinent, eastern Africa and Central America, in that order, are the world's three main pigeon pea-producing regions. Pigeon peas are cultivated in more than 25 tropical and subtropical countries, either as a sole crop or intermixed with [[cereal]]s, such as [[sorghum]] (''Sorghum bicolor''), [[pearl millet]] (''Pennisetum glaucum''), or [[maize]] (''Zea mays''), or with other legumes, such as [[peanut]]s (''Arachis hypogaea''). Being a legume capable of [[symbiosis]] with [[Rhizobia]], the bacteria associated with the pigeon pea enrich soils through symbiotic [[nitrogen fixation]].\n\nPigeon peas can be of a perennial variety, in which the crop can last three to five years (although the seed yield drops considerably after the first two years), or an annual variety more suitable for seed production.\n\nThe crop is cultivated on marginal land by resource-poor farmers, who commonly grow traditional medium- and long-duration (5\u201311 months) [[landrace]]s. Short-duration pigeon peas (3\u20134 months) suitable for multiple cropping have recently been developed. Traditionally, the use of such input as fertilizers, weeding, irrigation, and pesticides is minimal, so present yield levels are low (average = 700&nbsp;kg/ha). Greater attention is now being given to managing the crop because it is in high demand at remunerative prices.\n\nPigeon peas are very drought-resistant and can be grown in areas with less than 650&nbsp;mm annual rainfall. With the maize crop failing three out of five years in drought-prone areas of [[Kenya]], a consortium led by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] (ICRISAT) aimed to promote the pigeon pea as a drought-resistant, nutritious alternative crop. Successive projects encouraged commercialization of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20\u201325% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialization of the pigeon pea is now enabling farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.\n\n[[John Spence (scientist)|John Spence]], a [[botanist]] and politician from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], developed several varieties of dwarf pigeon peas which can be harvested by machine, instead of by hand.<ref name=\"niherst\">{{cite news|url=http://www.niherst.gov.tt/icons/tt-icons-1/69-john-spence.htm|title=John Spence (1929) Plant Pathologist|date=|work=[[National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology]]|accessdate=2015-02-24|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Seeds and chafe==\n===Dehulling methods=== \nDehulling pigeon peas is an age-old practice in India. In earlier days hand pounding was common. Several traditional methods are used that can be broadly classified under two categories:\n\n====Wet method==== \nInvolves water soaking, sun drying and dehulling.\n\n====Dry method==== \nInvolves oil/water application, drying in the sun, and dehulling. Depending on the magnitude of operation, large-scale commercial dehulling of large quantities of pigeon pea into its deskinned, split version, known as toor [[dal]] in Hindi, is done in mechanically operated mills.<ref>[http://www.ikisan.com/tg-redgram-harvesting-storage.html ''Harvesting And Storage'']</ref><ref>[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 ''Pigeonpea in Eastern and Southern Africa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718193632/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 |date=2014-07-18 }}, [[ICRISAT]] Posted 10 October 2012.

In combination with [[cereals]], pigeon peas make a well-balanced meal and hence are favoured by nutritionists as an essential ingredient for balanced diets. The dried peas may be sprouted briefly, then cooked, for a flavor different from the green or dried peas. Sprouting also enhances the digestibility of dried pigeon peas via the reduction of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in the cooked dried peas.<ref>[http://www.bioline.org.br/request?ja06052 \"Effect of Sprouting on invitro digestibility of some locally consumed leguminous seeds\".] ''Journal of Applied Sciences and Environmental Management''.

In regions where it grows, fresh young pods are eaten as a vegetable in dishes such as [[Sambar (dish)|''sambar'']]. Whole pigeon peas are called ''arhar dal'' in [[Hindi]]. In [[Ethiopia]], not only the pods, but also the young shoots and leaves are cooked and eaten.<ref>Zemede Asfaw, [http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Web_version/500/ch08.htm \"Conservation and use of traditional vegetables in Ethiopia\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707210646/http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Web_version/500/ch08.htm |date=2012-07-07 }}, ''Proceedings of the IPGRI International Workshop on Genetic Resources of Traditional Vegetables in Africa'' (Nairobi, 29\u201331 August 1995)</ref>\n[[File:Shelling pigeonpeas, Kenya.jpg|thumb|right|Kenyans shelling pigeon peas]]\nIn some places, such as the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Panama]] and Hawaii, pigeon peas are grown for canning and consumption. A dish made of rice and green pigeon peas (called ''moro de guandules'') is a traditional food in the Dominican Republic. Pigeon peas are also made as a stew, with [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] balls. In [[Puerto Rico]], ''[[arroz con gandules]]'' is made with [[rice]] and pigeon peas and is a traditional dish, especially during Christmas season. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Grenada]] have their own variant, called ''[[pelau]]'', which includes either beef or chicken, and occasionally pumpkin and pieces of cured pig tail. In the [[Atl\u00e1ntico Department|Atl\u00e1ntico department]] of Colombia, the [[sopa de guand\u00fa con carne salada]] (or simply \"gandules\") is made with pigeon peas.\n\nUnlike in some other parts of the Greater Caribbean, in [[The Bahamas]] the light brown colored dried seeds of the pigeon pea plant are used (instead of the fresh green pigeon peas used elsewhere) to make the heartier, heavier, signature Bahamian staple dish \"Peas 'n Rice.\" A slab of partially cubed or diced pork \"fatback\" lard with skin on (bacon is a common substitute), diced onions and sweet pepper, and a mixture of spices are all sauteed in the bottom of a deep pot. Tomatoes and tomato paste are added.  Then water is added along with the peas and rice, and slow boiled until tender. The dish becomes a medium-dark brown color, resulting from absorbing the colors of the browned initial ingredients and the cooked tomato paste. The pigeon peas themselves absorb the same, becoming a much darker brown, providing some contrast while still complementing the distinctive \"browned\" theme of the dish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trubahamianfoodtours.com/bites-of-nassau-food-tour/bahamian-must-eats-peas-n-rice/|title=Tru Bahamian Must Eats: Peas & Rice|website=Tru Bahamian Food Tours|accessdate=12 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042143/http://trubahamianfoodtours.com/bites-of-nassau-food-tour/bahamian-must-eats-peas-n-rice/|archivedate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Thailand]], pigeon peas are grown as a host for [[scale insect]]s which produce [[lac]], the key ingredient in [[shellac]].\n\nPigeon peas are in some areas an important crop for [[green manure]], providing up to 90&nbsp;kg nitrogen per hectare.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adu-Gyamfi|first=Joseph J.|last2=Myaka|first2=Fidelis A.|last3=Sakala|first3=Webster D.|last4=Odgaard|first4=Rie|last5=Vesterager|first5=Jens M.|last6=Jensen|first6=Henning H\u00f8gh|date=2007|title=Biological nitrogen fixation and nitrogen and phosphorus budgets in farmer-managed intercrops of maize-pigeonpea in semi-arid southern and eastern Africa|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=295|issue=1\u20132|pages=127\u2013136|doi=10.1007/s11104-007-9270-0|issn=0032-079X}}</ref> The woody stems of pigeon peas can also be used as firewood, fencing and thatch.\n\nIt is an important ingredient of animal feed used in West Africa, especially in Nigeria, where it is also grown.

{"title_page": "Drunk drivers", "text_new": "{{short description|People driving under the influence of alcohol}}\n[[File:Fieldsobrietytest usa ct.jpg|thumb|right|Field sobriety test]]\nPeople [[driving under the influence]] of [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] are referred to as '''drunk drivers''' or '''drink-drivers'''.  \n\nIn the U.S, 17,000 people die in alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents each year.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> A small increase in the [[blood alcohol content]] increases the [[relative risk]] of a motor vehicle crash.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" />\n\n== Effects of alcohol on cognitive processes ==\n{{main|Short-term effects of alcohol consumption}}\nAlcohol has a very significant effect on the functions of the body which are vital to driving and being able to function.  Alcohol is a depressant, which mainly affects the function of the brain. Alcohol first affects the most vital components of the brain and \"when the brain cortex is released from its functions of integrating and control, processes related to judgment and behavior occur in a disorganized fashion and the proper operation of behavioral tasks becomes disrupted.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\">{{cite book|last1=Mattila|first1=Maurice J.|title=Encyclopedia of drugs, alcohol and addictive behavior|date=2001|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=0028655419|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofdr0000unse}}</ref> In all actuality alcohol weakens a variety of skills that are necessary to perform everyday tasks.\n\nOne of the main effects of alcohol is severely impairing a person's ability to shift attention from one thing to another, \"without significantly impairing sensory motor functions.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/> This indicates that people who are intoxicated are not able to properly shift their attention without affecting the senses.  People that are intoxicated also have a much more narrow area of usable vision than people who are sober.  The information the brain receives from the eyes \"becomes disrupted if eyes must be turned to the side to detect stimuli, or if eyes must be moved quickly from one point to another.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/>\n\nSeveral testing mechanisms are used to gauge a person's ability to drive, which indicate levels of intoxication.  One of these is referred to as a tracking task, testing hand\u2013eye coordination, in which \"the task is to keep an object on a prescribed path by controlling its position through turning a steering wheel.  Impairment of performance is seen at BACs of as little as 0.7 milligrams per milliliter (mg/ml).\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/> Another form of tests is a choice reaction task, which deals more primarily with cognitive function.  In this form of testing both hearing and vision are tested and drivers must give a \"response according to rules that necessitate mental processing before giving the answer.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/> This is a useful gauge because in an actual driving situation drivers must divide their attention \"between a tracking task and surveillance of the environment.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/> It has been found that even \"very low BACs are sufficient to produce significant impairment of performance\" in this area of thought process.<ref name=\"Mattila\"/>\n\n===Grand Rapids Dip===\n{{See also|Driving under the influence#Grand Rapids Dip}}\n\nStudies suggest that a BAC of 0.01\u20130.04% would slightly lower the risk, referred to as the ''Grand Rapids Effect'' or ''Grand Rapids Dip'',<ref name=\"grandrapids\">[http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/t95/paper/s9p2.html Grand Rapids Effects Revisited: Accidents, Alcohol and Risk], H.-P.

Borkenstein Courses], Indiana U.</ref>\n\nSome literature has attributed the ''Grand Rapids Effect'' to erroneous data or asserted (without support) that it was possibly due to drivers exerting extra caution  at low BAC levels or to \"experience\" in drinking.  Other explanations are that this effect is at least in part the blocking effect of ethanol [[excitotoxicity]] and the effect of alcohol in [[essential tremor]] and other movement disorders,<ref name=\"pmid20721919\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mostile G, Jankovic J | title = Alcohol in essential tremor and other movement disorders | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 14 | pages = 2274\u201384 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20721919 | doi = 10.1002/mds.23240 }}</ref> but this remains speculative.\n\n=== Perceived recovery rate ===\nA direct effect of alcohol on a person's brain is an overestimation of how quickly their body is recovering from the effects of alcohol.  A study, discussed in the article \"Why drunk drivers may get behind the wheel\", was done with college students in which the students were tested with \"a hidden maze learning task as their [[Blood alcohol content|BAC]] [Blood Alcohol Content] both rose and fell over an 8-hour period.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|title=Why drunk drivers may get behind the wheel|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100817171607.htm|website=Science Daily|accessdate=2 July 2017|date=18 August 2010}}</ref> The researchers found through the study that as the students became more drunk there was an increase in their mistakes \"and the recovery of the underlying cognitive impairments that lead to these errors is slower, and more closely tied to the actual blood alcohol concentration, than the more rapid reduction in participants' subjective feeling of drunkenness.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe participants believed that they were recovering from the adverse effects of alcohol much more quickly than they actually were.  This feeling of perceived recovery is a plausible explanation of why so many people feel that they are able to safely operate a motor vehicle when they are not yet fully recovered from the alcohol they have consumed, indicating that the recovery rates do not coincide.\n\nThis thought process and brain function that is lost under the influence of alcohol is a very key element in regards to being able to drive safely, including \"making judgments in terms of traveling through intersections or changing lanes when driving.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> These essential driving skills are lost while a person is under the influence of alcohol.\n\n== Characteristics of drunk drivers ==\n=== Personality traits ===\nAlthough situations differ and each person is unique, some common traits have been identified among drunk drivers.  In the study \"personality traits and mental health of severe drunk drivers in Sweden\", 162 Swedish DUI offenders of all ages were studied to find links in psychological factors and characteristics.  There are a wide variety of characteristics common among DUI offenders which are discussed, including: \"anxiety, depression, inhibition, low assertiveness, neuroticism and introversion\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Huckba|first1=B.|title=Personality traits and mental health of severe drunk drivers in Sweden|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|date=July 2010|volume=45|issue=7|pages=723\u201331|pmid=19730762|doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0111-8}}</ref> There is also a more specific personality type found, typically more antisocial, among repeat DUI offenders.  It is not uncommon for them to actually be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder ([[ASPD]]) and exhibit some of the following personality traits: \"low social responsiveness, lack of self-control, hostility, poor decision-making lifestyle, low emotional adjustment, aggression, sensation seeking and impulsivity\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIt is also common for offenders to use drinking as a coping mechanism, not necessarily for social or enjoyment reasons, when they are antisocial in nature and have a father with a history of alcoholism. Offenders who begin drinking at an earlier age for thrills and \"fun\" are more likely to be antisocial later in their lives. The majority of the sample, 72%, came from what is considered more \"normal\" circumstances. This group was older when they began drinking, came from families without a history of alcoholism, were relatively well-behaved as children, were not as physically and emotionally affected by alcohol when compared with the rest of the study, and had the less emotional complications, such as anxiety and depression. The smaller portion of the sample, 28%, comes from what is generally considered less than desirable circumstances, or \"not normal\".  They tended to start drinking heavily earlier in life and \"exhibited more premorbid risk factors, had a more severe substance abuse and psychosocial impairment.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nVarious characteristics associated with drunk drivers were found more often in one gender than another.  Females were more likely to be affected by both mental and physical health problems, have family and social problems, have a greater drug use, and were frequently unemployed.  However, the females tended to have less legal issues than the typical male offender.  Some specific issues females dealt with were that \"almost half of the female alcoholics had previously attempted to commit suicide, and almost one-third had suffered from anxiety disorder.\" In contrast with females, males were more likely to have in-depth problems and more involved complications, such as \"a more complex problem profile, i.e. more legal, psychological, and work-related problems when compared with female alcoholics.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In general the sample, when paralleled with control groups, was tested to be much more impulsive in general.\n\nAnother commonality among the whole group was that the DUI offenders were more underprivileged when compared with the general population of drivers. A correlation has been found between lack of conscientiousness and accidents, meaning that \"low conscientiousness drivers were more often involved in driving accidents than other drivers.\" When tested the drivers scored very high in the areas of \"depression, vulnerability (to stress), [[gregariousness]], modesty, tender mindedness\", but significantly lower in the areas of \"ideas (intellectual curiosity), competence, achievement striving and self-discipline.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The sample also tested considerably higher than the norm in \"[[somatization]], [[obsessions]]-[[compulsions]], interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, [[paranoia]], [[psychoticism]]\", especially in the area of depression.  Through this testing a previously overlooked character trait of DUI offenders was uncovered by the \"low scores on the openness to experience domain.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This area \"includes intellectual curiosity, receptivity to the inner world of fantasy and imagination, appreciation of art and beauty, openness to inner emotions, values, and active experiences.\"  In all these various factors, there is only one which indicates relapses for driving under the influence: depression.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Cognitive processes ===\nNot only can personality traits of DUI offenders be dissimilar from the rest of the population, but so can their thought processes, or cognitive processes. They are unique in that \"they often drink despite the severity of legal and financial sanctions imposed on them by society.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Scheier|first1=L. M.|last2=Lapham|first2=S. C.|last3=C\u2019de Baca|first3=J.|title=Cognitive predictors of alcohol involvement and alcohol-related consequences in a sample of drunk-driving offenders|journal=Substance Use & Misuse|date=2008|volume=43|issue=14|pages=2089\u20132115|url=http://larsri.org/publications/|accessdate=2 July 2017|doi=10.1080/10826080802345358}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these societal restraints, DUI offenders ignore their own personal experience, including both social and physical consequences.  The study \"Cognitive Predictors of Alcohol Involvement and Alcohol consumption-Related Consequences in a Sample of Drunk-Driving Offenders\" was performed in Albuquerque, New Mexico on the [[cognitive]], or mental, factors of DUI offenders. Characteristics such as gender, marital status, and age of these DWI offenders were similar to those in other populations. Approximately 25% of female and 21% of male offenders had received \"a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse\" and 62% of females and 70% of males \"received a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> All of the offenders had at least one DWI and males were more likely to have multiple citations.  In terms of drinking patterns approximately 25% stated that \"they had drunk alcohol with in the past day, while an additional 32% indicated they had drunk within the past week.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In regards to domestic drinking, \"25% of the sample drank at least once per week in their own homes.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Different items were tested to see if they played a role in the decision to drink alcohol, which includes socializing, the expectation that drinking is enjoyable, financial resources to purchase alcohol, and liberation from stress at the work place.  The study also focused on two main areas, \"[[intrapersonal]] cues\", or internal cues, that are reactions \"to internal psychological or physical events\" and \"[[interpersonal]] cues\" that result from \"social influences in drinking situations.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The two largest factors between tested areas were damaging alcohol use and its correlation to \"drinking urges/triggers.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Once again different behaviors are characteristic of male and female.  Males are \"more likely to abuse alcohol, be arrested for DWI offenses, and report more adverse alcohol-related consequences.\" However, effects of alcohol on females vary because the female metabolism processes alcohol significantly when compared to males, which increases their chances for intoxication.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The largest indicator for drinking was situational cues which comprised \"indicators tapping [[psychological]] (e.g. letting oneself down, having an argument with a friend, and getting angry at something), social (e.g. relaxing and having a good time), and [[Somatic theory|somatic]] cues (e.g. how good it tasted, passing by a liquor store, and heightened sexual enjoyment).\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIt may be that internal forces are more likely to drive DWI offenders to drink than external, which is indicated by the fact that the brain and body play a greater role than social influences. This possibility seems particularly likely in repeat DWI offenders, as repeat offences (unlike first-time offences) are not positively correlated with the availability of alcohol.<ref name=\"SchofieldDenson2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Schofield|first1=Timothy B.|last2=Denson|first2=Thomas F.|title=Temporal Alcohol Availability Predicts First-Time Drunk Driving, but Not Repeat Offending|journal=PLOS ONE|date=7 August 2013|volume=8|issue=8|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071169|accessdate=2 July 2017|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0071169|page=e71169|pmc=3737138}}</ref> Another cognitive factor may be that of using alcohol to cope with problems.  It is becoming increasingly apparent that the DWI offenders do not use proper [[coping skill|coping mechanisms]] and thus turn to alcohol for the answer.  Examples of such issues \"include fights, arguments, and problems with people at work, all of which imply a need for adaptive coping strategies to help the high-risk drinker to offset pressures or demands.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> DWI offenders would typically prefer to turn to alcohol than more healthy coping mechanisms and alcohol can cause more anger which can result in a vicious circle of drinking more alcohol to deal with alcohol-related issues. This is a not the way professionals tell people how to best deal with the struggles of everyday life and calls for \"the need to develop internal control and self-regulatory mechanisms that attenuate stress, mollify the influence of relapse-based cues, and dampen urges to drink as part of therapeutic interventions.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n== Implied consent laws ==\n{{main|Implied consent}}\nThere are laws in place to protect citizens from drunk drivers, called implied consent laws. Drivers of any motor vehicle automatically consent to these laws, which include the associated testing, when they begin driving.\n\nIn most jurisdictions (with the notable exception of a few, such as Brazil), refusing consent is a different crime than a DWI itself and has its own set of consequences.  There have been cases where drivers were \"acquitted of the DWI offense and convicted of the refusal (they are separate offenses), often with significant consequences (usually license suspension)\".<ref name=\"Ogundiipe2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Ogundipe|first1=K.

These laws have thus far been shown to be in compliance with the Constitution and are legal.  Implied consent laws typically result in civil law consequences (but applying criminal penalties), such as a driver's license suspension.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Blood Alcohol Testing in Drunk and Impaired Driving Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/drunk_driving/Drunk_Blood_Alcohol.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=30 October 2017|date=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn order to invoke implied consent, the police must establish ''probable cause''.  [[field sobriety test|Field Sobriety Tests]] (FSTs or SFSTs), [[Breathalyzer#Law enforcement|Preliminary Breath Tests (PBTs)]] are often used to obtain such ''probable cause'' evidence, necessary for arrest or invoking implied consent.<ref name=\"Ogundiipe2009\"/>\n\nSome states have passed laws that impose criminal penalties based upon principles of implied consent.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Soronen|first1=Lisa|title=Blood Alcohol Testing: No Consent, No Warrant, No Crime?|url=http://www.ncsl.org/blog/2016/01/12/blood-alcohol-testing-no-consent-no-warrant-no-crime.aspx|website=NCSL|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=30 October 2017|date=12 January 2016}}</ref> However, in 2016, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that Kansans who refuse to submit to either a breath or blood test in DUI investigations cannot be criminally prosecuted for that refusal. The court found unconstitutional a state law making it a crime to refuse such a test when no court-ordered warrant exists. In its 6-1 ruling, the court found that the tests were in essence searches and the law punishes people for exercising their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rizzo|first1=Tony|title=Kansas DUI law that makes test refusal a crime is ruled unconstitutional|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article62645617.html|accessdate=2 July 2017|publisher=Kansas City Star|date=26 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Birchfield v. North Dakota====\n{{main|Birchfield v. North Dakota}}\n\nSubsequently, the US Supreme Court, in [[Birchfield v. North Dakota]] held that a breath test, but not a blood test, may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving.  The Court [[Birchfield v. North Dakota|stated]], \"Because  breath  tests  are significantly  less  intrusive  than  blood  tests  and  in  most  cases  amply serve  law  enforcement  interests,  a  breath  test,  but  not  a  blood  test,  may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving.\"  The Court held that no warrant is needed for an evidentiary breath testing, but that a warrant is required for ''criminal'' prosecution for a blood test refusal.  [[Birchfield v.

Alcohol is a depressant, which mainly affects the function of the brain. Alcohol first affects the most vital components of the brain and \"when the brain cortex is released from its functions of integrating and control, processes related to judgment and behavior occur in a disorganized fashion and the proper operation of behavioral tasks becomes disrupted.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\">{{cite book|last1=Mattila|first1=Maurice J.|title=Encyclopedia of drugs, alcohol and addictive behavior|date=2001|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=0028655419|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofdr0000unse}}</ref> In all actuality alcohol weakens a variety of skills that are necessary to perform everyday tasks.\n\nOne of the main effects of alcohol is severely impairing a person's ability to shift attention from one thing to another, \"without significantly impairing sensory motor functions.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/> This indicates that people who are intoxicated are not able to properly shift their attention without affecting the senses.  People that are intoxicated also have a much more narrow area of usable vision than people who are sober.  The information the brain receives from the eyes \"becomes disrupted if eyes must be turned to the side to detect stimuli, or if eyes must be moved quickly from one point to another.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/>\n\nSeveral testing mechanisms are used to gauge a person's ability to drive, which indicate levels of intoxication.  One of these is referred to as a tracking task, testing hand\u2013eye coordination, in which \"the task is to keep an object on a prescribed path by controlling its position through turning a steering wheel.  Impairment of performance is seen at BACs of as little as 0.7 milligrams per milliliter (mg/ml).\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/> Another form of tests is a choice reaction task, which deals more primarily with cognitive function.  In this form of testing both hearing and vision are tested and drivers must give a \"response according to rules that necessitate mental processing before giving the answer.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/> This is a useful gauge because in an actual driving situation drivers must divide their attention \"between a tracking task and surveillance of the environment.\"<ref name=\"Mattila\"/> It has been found that even \"very low BACs are sufficient to produce significant impairment of performance\" in this area of thought process.<ref name=\"Mattila\"/>\n\n===Grand Rapids Dip===\n{{See also|Driving under the influence#Grand Rapids Dip}}\n\nStudies suggest that a BAC of 0.01\u20130.04% would slightly lower the risk, referred to as the ''Grand Rapids Effect'' or ''Grand Rapids Dip'',<ref name=\"grandrapids\">[http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/t95/paper/s9p2.html Grand Rapids Effects Revisited: Accidents, Alcohol and Risk], H.-P.

Borkenstein Courses], Indiana U.</ref>\n\nSome literature has attributed the ''Grand Rapids Effect'' to erroneous data or asserted (without support) that it was possibly due to drivers exerting extra caution  at low BAC levels or to \"experience\" in drinking.  Other explanations are that this effect is at least in part the blocking effect of ethanol [[excitotoxicity]] and the effect of alcohol in [[essential tremor]] and other movement disorders,<ref name=\"pmid20721919\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mostile G, Jankovic J | title = Alcohol in essential tremor and other movement disorders | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 14 | pages = 2274\u201384 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20721919 | doi = 10.1002/mds.23240 }}</ref> but this remains speculative.\n\n=== Perceived recovery rate ===\nA direct effect of alcohol on a person's brain is an overestimation of how quickly their body is recovering from the effects of alcohol.  A study, discussed in the article \"Why drunk drivers may get behind the wheel\", was done with college students in which the students were tested with \"a hidden maze learning task as their [[Blood alcohol content|BAC]] [Blood Alcohol Content] both rose and fell over an 8-hour period.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|title=Why drunk drivers may get behind the wheel|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100817171607.htm|website=Science Daily|accessdate=2 July 2017|date=18 August 2010}}</ref> The researchers found through the study that as the students became more drunk there was an increase in their mistakes \"and the recovery of the underlying cognitive impairments that lead to these errors is slower, and more closely tied to the actual blood alcohol concentration, than the more rapid reduction in participants' subjective feeling of drunkenness.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe participants believed that they were recovering from the adverse effects of alcohol much more quickly than they actually were.  This feeling of perceived recovery is a plausible explanation of why so many people feel that they are able to safely operate a motor vehicle when they are not yet fully recovered from the alcohol they have consumed, indicating that the recovery rates do not coincide.\n\nThis thought process and brain function that is lost under the influence of alcohol is a very key element in regards to being able to drive safely, including \"making judgments in terms of traveling through intersections or changing lanes when driving.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> These essential driving skills are lost while a person is under the influence of alcohol.\n\n== Characteristics of drunk drivers ==\n=== Personality traits ===\nAlthough situations differ and each person is unique, some common traits have been identified among drunk drivers.  In the study \"personality traits and mental health of severe drunk drivers in Sweden\", 162 Swedish DUI offenders of all ages were studied to find links in psychological factors and characteristics.  There are a wide variety of characteristics common among DUI offenders which are discussed, including: \"anxiety, depression, inhibition, low assertiveness, neuroticism and introversion\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Huckba|first1=B.|title=Personality traits and mental health of severe drunk drivers in Sweden|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|date=July 2010|volume=45|issue=7|pages=723\u201331|pmid=19730762|doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0111-8}}</ref> There is also a more specific personality type found, typically more antisocial, among repeat DUI offenders.  It is not uncommon for them to actually be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder ([[ASPD]]) and exhibit some of the following personality traits: \"low social responsiveness, lack of self-control, hostility, poor decision-making lifestyle, low emotional adjustment, aggression, sensation seeking and impulsivity\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIt is also common for offenders to use drinking as a coping mechanism, not necessarily for social or enjoyment reasons, when they are antisocial in nature and have a father with a history of alcoholism. Offenders who begin drinking at an earlier age for thrills and \"fun\" are more likely to be antisocial later in their lives. The majority of the sample, 72%, came from what is considered more \"normal\" circumstances. This group was older when they began drinking, came from families without a history of alcoholism, were relatively well-behaved as children, were not as physically and emotionally affected by alcohol when compared with the rest of the study, and had the less emotional complications, such as anxiety and depression. The smaller portion of the sample, 28%, comes from what is generally considered less than desirable circumstances, or \"not normal\".  They tended to start drinking heavily earlier in life and \"exhibited more premorbid risk factors, had a more severe substance abuse and psychosocial impairment.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nVarious characteristics associated with drunk drivers were found more often in one gender than another.  Females were more likely to be affected by both mental and physical health problems, have family and social problems, have a greater drug use, and were frequently unemployed.  However, the females tended to have less legal issues than the typical male offender.  Some specific issues females dealt with were that \"almost half of the female alcoholics had previously attempted to commit suicide, and almost one-third had suffered from anxiety disorder.\" In contrast with females, males were more likely to have in-depth problems and more involved complications, such as \"a more complex problem profile, i.e. more legal, psychological, and work-related problems when compared with female alcoholics.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In general the sample, when paralleled with control groups, was tested to be much more impulsive in general.\n\nAnother commonality among the whole group was that the DUI offenders were more underprivileged when compared with the general population of drivers. A correlation has been found between lack of conscientiousness and accidents, meaning that \"low conscientiousness drivers were more often involved in driving accidents than other drivers.\" When tested the drivers scored very high in the areas of \"depression, vulnerability (to stress), [[gregariousness]], modesty, tender mindedness\", but significantly lower in the areas of \"ideas (intellectual curiosity), competence, achievement striving and self-discipline.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The sample also tested considerably higher than the norm in \"[[somatization]], [[obsessions]]-[[compulsions]], interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, [[paranoia]], [[psychoticism]]\", especially in the area of depression.  Through this testing a previously overlooked character trait of DUI offenders was uncovered by the \"low scores on the openness to experience domain.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This area \"includes intellectual curiosity, receptivity to the inner world of fantasy and imagination, appreciation of art and beauty, openness to inner emotions, values, and active experiences.\"  In all these various factors, there is only one which indicates relapses for driving under the influence: depression.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Cognitive processes ===\nNot only can personality traits of DUI offenders be dissimilar from the rest of the population, but so can their thought processes, or cognitive processes. They are unique in that \"they often drink despite the severity of legal and financial sanctions imposed on them by society.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Scheier|first1=L.

The study \"Cognitive Predictors of Alcohol Involvement and Alcohol consumption-Related Consequences in a Sample of Drunk-Driving Offenders\" was performed in Albuquerque, New Mexico on the [[cognitive]], or mental, factors of DUI offenders. Characteristics such as gender, marital status, and age of these DWI offenders were similar to those in other populations. Approximately 25% of female and 21% of male offenders had received \"a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse\" and 62% of females and 70% of males \"received a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> All of the offenders had at least one DWI and males were more likely to have multiple citations.  In terms of drinking patterns approximately 25% stated that \"they had drunk alcohol with in the past day, while an additional 32% indicated they had drunk within the past week.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In regards to domestic drinking, \"25% of the sample drank at least once per week in their own homes.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Different items were tested to see if they played a role in the decision to drink alcohol, which includes socializing, the expectation that drinking is enjoyable, financial resources to purchase alcohol, and liberation from stress at the work place.  The study also focused on two main areas, \"[[intrapersonal]] cues\", or internal cues, that are reactions \"to internal psychological or physical events\" and \"[[interpersonal]] cues\" that result from \"social influences in drinking situations.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The two largest factors between tested areas were damaging alcohol use and its correlation to \"drinking urges/triggers.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Once again different behaviors are characteristic of male and female.  Males are \"more likely to abuse alcohol, be arrested for DWI offenses, and report more adverse alcohol-related consequences.\" However, effects of alcohol on females vary because the female metabolism processes alcohol significantly when compared to males, which increases their chances for intoxication.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The largest indicator for drinking was situational cues which comprised \"indicators tapping [[psychological]] (e.g. letting oneself down, having an argument with a friend, and getting angry at something), social (e.g. relaxing and having a good time), and [[Somatic theory|somatic]] cues (e.g. how good it tasted, passing by a liquor store, and heightened sexual enjoyment).\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIt may be that internal forces are more likely to drive DWI offenders to drink than external, which is indicated by the fact that the brain and body play a greater role than social influences. This possibility seems particularly likely in repeat DWI offenders, as repeat offences (unlike first-time offences) are not positively correlated with the availability of alcohol.<ref name=\"SchofieldDenson2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Schofield|first1=Timothy B.|last2=Denson|first2=Thomas F.|title=Temporal Alcohol Availability Predicts First-Time Drunk Driving, but Not Repeat Offending|journal=PLOS ONE|date=7 August 2013|volume=8|issue=8|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071169|accessdate=2 July 2017|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0071169|page=e71169|pmc=3737138}}</ref> Another cognitive factor may be that of using alcohol to cope with problems.  It is becoming increasingly apparent that the DWI offenders do not use proper [[coping skill|coping mechanisms]] and thus turn to alcohol for the answer.  Examples of such issues \"include fights, arguments, and problems with people at work, all of which imply a need for adaptive coping strategies to help the high-risk drinker to offset pressures or demands.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> DWI offenders would typically prefer to turn to alcohol than more healthy coping mechanisms and alcohol can cause more anger which can result in a vicious circle of drinking more alcohol to deal with alcohol-related issues. This is a not the way professionals tell people how to best deal with the struggles of everyday life and calls for \"the need to develop internal control and self-regulatory mechanisms that attenuate stress, mollify the influence of relapse-based cues, and dampen urges to drink as part of therapeutic interventions.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n== Implied consent laws ==\n{{main|Implied consent}}\nThere are laws in place to protect citizens from drunk drivers, called implied consent laws. Drivers of any motor vehicle automatically consent to these laws, which include the associated testing, when they begin driving.\n\nIn most jurisdictions (with the notable exception of a few, such as Brazil), refusing consent is a different crime than a DWI itself and has its own set of consequences.  There have been cases where drivers were \"acquitted of the DWI offense and convicted of the refusal (they are separate offenses), often with significant consequences (usually license suspension)\".<ref name=\"Ogundiipe2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Ogundipe|first1=K.

In its 6-1 ruling, the court found that the tests were in essence searches and the law punishes people for exercising their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rizzo|first1=Tony|title=Kansas DUI law that makes test refusal a crime is ruled unconstitutional|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article62645617.html|accessdate=2 July 2017|publisher=Kansas City Star|date=26 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Birchfield v. North Dakota====\n{{main|Birchfield v. North Dakota}}\n\nSubsequently, the US Supreme Court, in [[Birchfield v. North Dakota]] held that a breath test, but not a blood test, may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving.  The Court [[Birchfield v. North Dakota|stated]], \"Because  breath  tests  are significantly  less  intrusive  than  blood  tests  and  in  most  cases  amply serve  law  enforcement  interests,  a  breath  test,  but  not  a  blood  test,  may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving.\"  The Court held that no warrant is needed for an evidentiary breath testing, but that a warrant is required for ''criminal'' prosecution for a blood test refusal.  [[Birchfield v.

Another opinion, supported by Botticelli, was that the sculpture should be situated on or near the cathedral.\n\nIn June 1504, ''David'' was installed next to the entrance to the Palazzo Vecchio, replacing Donatello's [[bronze sculpture]] of [[Judith and Holofernes (Donatello)|''Judith and Holofernes'']], which embodied a comparable theme of heroic resistance. It took four days to move the statue the half mile from Michelangelo's workshop into the Piazza della Signoria.

His brow is drawn, his neck tense, and the veins bulge out of his lowered right hand. His left hand holds a sling that is draped over his shoulder and down to his right hand, which holds a rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michelangelo-gallery.com/david.aspx|title=David Sculpture, Michelango's David, Michelangelo Gallery}}</ref> The twist of his body effectively conveys to the viewer the feeling that he is in motion, an impression heightened with [[contrapposto]]. The statue is a Renaissance interpretation of a common ancient Greek theme of the standing heroic male nude. In the High Renaissance, contrapposto poses were thought of as a distinctive feature of antique sculpture. This is typified in ''David'', as the figure stands with one leg holding its full weight and the other leg forward. This classic pose causes the figure's hips and shoulders to rest at opposing angles, giving a slight s-curve to the entire torso. The contrapposto is emphasized by the turn of the head to the left, and by the contrasting positions of the arms.\n\nMichelangelo's ''David'' has become one of the most recognized works of Renaissance sculpture, a symbol of strength and youthful beauty.\n[[File:'David' by Michelangelo JBU08.JPG|thumb|left|''David''{{'s}} right hand.]]\nThe colossal size of the statue alone impressed Michelangelo's contemporaries. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] described it as \"certainly a miracle that of Michelangelo, to restore to life one who was dead,\" and then listed all of the largest and most grand of the ancient statues that he had ever seen, concluding that Michelangelo's work surpassed \"all ancient and modern statues, whether Greek or Latin, that have ever existed.\"<ref>Giorgio Vasari, ''Le vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori nelle redazioni del 1550 e 1568,'' ed. Rosanna Bettarini and Paola Barocchi, Florence, 1966\u201387, 6: 21.</ref>\n\nThe proportions of the ''David'' are atypical of Michelangelo's work; the figure has an unusually large head and hands (particularly apparent in the right hand). The small size of the genitals, though, is in line with his other works and with Renaissance conventions in general, perhaps referencing the ancient Greek ideal of pre-pubescent male nudity. These enlargements may be due to the fact that the statue was originally intended to be placed on the cathedral roofline, where the important parts of the sculpture may have been accentuated in order to be visible from below. The statue is unusually slender (front to back) in comparison to its height, which may be a result of the work done on the block before Michelangelo began carving it.\n\nIt is possible that the ''David'' was conceived as a political statue before Michelangelo began to work on it.<ref>Levine, 45\u201346.</ref> Certainly David the giant-killer had long been seen as a political figure in Florence, and images of the Biblical hero already carried political implications there.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Butterfield | first1 = Andrew | year = 1995 | title = New Evidence for the Iconography of David in Quattrocento Florence | url = | journal = I Tatti Studies | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 115\u2013133 }}</ref> Donatello's bronze ''David,'' made for the Medici family, perhaps {{circa}} 1440, had been appropriated by the [[Signoria]] in 1494, when the Medici were exiled from Florence, and the statue was installed in the courtyard of the [[Palazzo Vecchio|Palazzo della Signoria]], where it stood for the Republican government of the city. By placing Michelangelo's statue in the same general location, the Florentine authorities ensured that ''David'' would be seen as a political parallel as well as an artistic response to that earlier work. These political overtones led to the statue being attacked twice in its early days. Protesters pelted it with stones the year it debuted, and, in 1527, an anti-Medici riot resulted in its left arm being broken into three pieces.\n\nCommentators have noted the presence of [[foreskin]] on ''David''{{'s}} penis, which is at odds with the [[Brit milah|Judaic practice]] of [[circumcision]], but is consistent with the conventions of Renaissance art.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1279184 | pmid=12356979 | volume=95 | issue=10 | title=Michelangelo and medicine | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=514\u20135 | last1 = Strauss | first1 = RM | last2 = Marzo-Ortega | first2 = H | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.10.514 | year=2002}}</ref><ref>Coonin, 2014, pp. 105-108.</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nDuring World War II, ''David'' was entombed in brick to protect it from damage from airborne bombs.\n[[File:Detail of David's damaged left foot..jpg|thumb|Detail of ''David''{{'}}s damaged left foot, caused by exposure to the elements and in 1991 when a deranged man hit it with a concealed hammer.]]\nIn 1991, the foot of the statue was damaged by a man with a hammer.<ref name=damage/> The samples obtained from that incident allowed scientists to determine that the [[marble]] used was obtained from the Fantiscritti [[quarry|quarries]] in [[Miseglia]], the central of three small valleys in [[Carrara]].

Another opinion, supported by Botticelli, was that the sculpture should be situated on or near the cathedral.\n\nIn June 1504, ''David'' was installed next to the entrance to the Palazzo Vecchio, replacing Donatello's [[bronze sculpture]] of [[Judith and Holofernes (Donatello)|''Judith and Holofernes'']], which embodied a comparable theme of heroic resistance. It took four days to move the statue the half mile from Michelangelo's workshop into the Piazza della Signoria.

His brow is drawn, his neck tense, and the veins bulge out of his lowered right hand. His left hand holds a sling that is draped over his shoulder and down to his right hand, which holds a rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michelangelo-gallery.com/david.aspx|title=David Sculpture, Michelango's David, Michelangelo Gallery}}</ref> The twist of his body effectively conveys to the viewer the feeling that he is in motion, an impression heightened with [[contrapposto]]. The statue is a Renaissance interpretation of a common ancient Greek theme of the standing heroic male nude. In the High Renaissance, contrapposto poses were thought of as a distinctive feature of antique sculpture. This is typified in ''David'', as the figure stands with one leg holding its full weight and the other leg forward. This classic pose causes the figure's hips and shoulders to rest at opposing angles, giving a slight s-curve to the entire torso. The contrapposto is emphasized by the turn of the head to the left, and by the contrasting positions of the arms.\n\nMichelangelo's ''David'' has become one of the most recognized works of Renaissance sculpture, a symbol of strength and youthful beauty.\n[[File:'David' by Michelangelo JBU08.JPG|thumb|left|''David''{{'s}} right hand.]]\nThe colossal size of the statue alone impressed Michelangelo's contemporaries. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] described it as \"certainly a miracle that of Michelangelo, to restore to life one who was dead,\" and then listed all of the largest and most grand of the ancient statues that he had ever seen, concluding that Michelangelo's work surpassed \"all ancient and modern statues, whether Greek or Latin, that have ever existed.\"<ref>Giorgio Vasari, ''Le vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori nelle redazioni del 1550 e 1568,'' ed. Rosanna Bettarini and Paola Barocchi, Florence, 1966\u201387, 6: 21.</ref>\n\nThe proportions of the ''David'' are atypical of Michelangelo's work; the figure has an unusually large head and hands (particularly apparent in the right hand). The small size of the genitals, though, is in line with his other works and with Renaissance conventions in general, perhaps referencing the ancient Greek ideal of pre-pubescent male nudity. These enlargements may be due to the fact that the statue was originally intended to be placed on the cathedral roofline, where the important parts of the sculpture may have been accentuated in order to be visible from below. The statue is unusually slender (front to back) in comparison to its height, which may be a result of the work done on the block before Michelangelo began carving it.\n\nIt is possible that the ''David'' was conceived as a political statue before Michelangelo began to work on it.<ref>Levine, 45\u201346.</ref> Certainly David the giant-killer had long been seen as a political figure in Florence, and images of the Biblical hero already carried political implications there.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Butterfield | first1 = Andrew | year = 1995 | title = New Evidence for the Iconography of David in Quattrocento Florence | url = | journal = I Tatti Studies | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 115\u2013133 }}</ref> Donatello's bronze ''David,'' made for the Medici family, perhaps {{circa}} 1440, had been appropriated by the [[Signoria]] in 1494, when the Medici were exiled from Florence, and the statue was installed in the courtyard of the [[Palazzo Vecchio|Palazzo della Signoria]], where it stood for the Republican government of the city. By placing Michelangelo's statue in the same general location, the Florentine authorities ensured that ''David'' would be seen as a political parallel as well as an artistic response to that earlier work. These political overtones led to the statue being attacked twice in its early days. Protesters pelted it with stones the year it debuted, and, in 1527, an anti-Medici riot resulted in its left arm being broken into three pieces.\n\nCommentators have noted the presence of [[foreskin]] on ''David''{{'s}} penis, which is at odds with the [[Brit milah|Judaic practice]] of [[circumcision]], but is consistent with the conventions of Renaissance art.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1279184 | pmid=12356979 | volume=95 | issue=10 | title=Michelangelo and medicine | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=514\u20135 | last1 = Strauss | first1 = RM | last2 = Marzo-Ortega | first2 = H | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.10.514 | year=2002}}</ref><ref>Coonin, 2014, pp. 105-108.</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nDuring World War II, ''David'' was entombed in brick to protect it from damage from airborne bombs.\n[[File:Detail of David's damaged left foot..jpg|thumb|Detail of ''David''{{'}}s damaged left foot, caused by exposure to the elements and in 1991 when a deranged man hit it with a concealed hammer.]]\nIn 1991, the foot of the statue was damaged by a man with a hammer.<ref name=damage/> The samples obtained from that incident allowed scientists to determine that the [[marble]] used was obtained from the Fantiscritti [[quarry|quarries]] in [[Miseglia]], the central of three small valleys in [[Carrara]]. The marble in question contains many microscopic holes that cause it to deteriorate faster than other marbles. Because of the marble's degradation, from 2003 to 2004 the statue was given its first major cleaning since 1843. Some experts opposed the use of water to clean the statue, fearing further deterioration.

The second part, thus entails a reversal of the first part: death and defeat are followed by birth and creation, finally resulting in the establishment of Devnarayan's cult amongst his followers.<ref name=\"presentation5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ignca.nic.in/devnp005.htm#Syno|title=The Rajasthani oral narrative of Devnarayan-Presentation mode, Synopsis of the epic, thematic content|publisher=Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts}}</ref>\n\n===Bagaravat Bharat===\n[[File:SawaibhojGurjar.jpg.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of Gurjar Sri Savai Bhoj Bagaravat, one of the Bagaravat brothers and the father of Devnarayan bhagawan]]\nThe narrative begins with a prelude at a time ([[Satya Yuga]]), when Brahma was performing a Vedic sacrifice (''jug'') in [[Pushkar]]. Brahma invited all the gods and [[Rishi|Rsis]] to his sacrifice. Among them is a group of twenty-four Rsis living in the ''Nag Pahad'', a mountain chain running parallel to Pushkar. The Rsis were disciples of Sankar ([[Shiva|Shankara]]). Sankar forbade them from attending the sacrifice, but they insisted on going because they had received invitations from Brahma. Suddenly, Sankar grew ravenously hungry. The Rsis suggested eating the fruits growing in the forest which they consume for a living. But Sankar said that would not satisfy him. He wanted more than plain fruit. But nothing else was available in the forest. There was no cereal or grain either. So, he turned to his disciples and began consuming them one after another. After he had eaten them and satiated his hunger, he went to visit Brahma's sacrifice himself. The sacrifice came to a halt because of the sin Sankar had committed. He asks Brahma how he should atone for his sin, whereupon Brahma informed him that the only means would be to offer the Rsis his own body in a future existence, in which the Rsis are to be born as the twenty-four sons of a single father. This prelude is normally spoken and not sung.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to a more historical time ([[Kali yuga]]). During the reign of [[Vishal Dev Chauhan]], the populace is being terrorized by a tiger that feeds on one individual every night. On one particular night, Hariram Gurjar offers to take the place of a boy whose turn it is to be eaten by the tiger. He sets up a trap for the tiger and beheads it. Then in order to wash the blood off his sword and to cleanse himself of the sin of slaughter, as it was a tradition among Gurjars, he goes to the holy lake of [[Pushkar]] carrying the lion's head on his shoulder. It is a full moon night ([[Full Moon|purnima]]). Exactly at the same time on the opposite bank of [[Pushkar]] Lake, daughter of Gurjar king Jagjan, Lila Sevri who has taken a vow never to see the face of a man is performing ablutions and bathing in the lake. While bathing, she sees the reflection of a man's body with the head of a tiger on the surface of the lake, and conceive. \n\nJagjan then allowed both to marry and also gifts half of his kingdom to Hariram Gurjar. After nine months their son is born. He has the head of a tiger and the body of a man and is named Baghji. Later because of his unusual and fearsome appearance, no one is willing to marry his daughter to him. He lives alone in a garden attended by a Brahman cook. Once, on the day of the [[Tij Festival|festival of ''savan tij'']] (swings), a number of young girls of various Gurjar[[Gotra]]s come to the garden attracted by Baghji's silken swing. The Brahman allows them to use the swing on the condition that each of them circumambulate Baghji. While they are doing this, the Brahman performs the necessary engagement rites. Unknowingly they are engaged to Baghji.\n\nLater Baghji Gurjar marries twelve of them namely ''Kanta Kalas'', ''Ganiyanvanti Kalas'', ''Lakmade Rathod'', ''Jyanta Saradana'', ''Lali Saradana'', ''Balma Saradana'', ''Barnavanti Chad'', ''Bindka Chad'', ''Dhanvantari Chechi'', ''Gauri Chechi'', ''Rama Awana'' and ''Bindra Awana''.\nKalas, Rathod, Saradana, Chad, Chechi and [[Awana (Gurjar lineage)|Awana]] all are [[:en:List of Gurjar clans|Gurjar Clans]] (or [[Gotra]]s).<ref>{{cite book|title=Devnarayan Ki Katha-Bagaravat Bharat|author=Anandaram Phagna|publisher=Archana Prakashan Ajmer|page=38}}</ref> Each of his wives gives birth to two sons who are collectively called the Bagaravats.\n\nAccording to written literature by anandaram phagna Baghji (Father of Bagaravats ) belonged to Baisla gotra of Gurjars. Savai Bhoj is the most well-known and courageous of the twenty-four Bagaravats. Each day Savai Bhoj takes the Bagaravats cattle herds to graze on the slopes of Nag Pahad. One of the cows regularly leaves the herd and returns on its own in the evening. One day Savai Bhoj follows the cow and discovers that it is being milked by the ''jogi'' (ascetic) Rupnath. As compensation for milking their cow, Rupnath gives Savai Bhoj a sack full of grain. But the brothers have no use for the small quantity of grain, so they feed it to birds. The next morning, Nevaji, one of the youngest brothers, discovers that the few grains left sticking to the seam of the sack have turned into gems. They realize their folly and Savai Bhoj returns to Rupnath to become his disciple. \n\nOne day, being instructed by Rupnath, Savai Bhoj heats a cauldron of oil and circles it, while Rupnath follows. While they are circling the cauldron, Rupnath tries to push Savai Bhoj into the boiling oil, but Savai Bhoj leaps over with the help of his cowherd's staff. In the next round, Savai Bhoj follows Rupnath and pushes him into the cauldron. Not so agile, Rupnath falls into the boiling oil. Instantly his body turns into a solid gold nugget. While Savai Bhoj stands there repenting his crime, the ''jogi'' reappears in the hermitage as though nothing had taken place. He explains that the golden nugget is a gift that will grant the Bagaravats unending wealth for a period of twelve years after which both wealth (maya) and life (kaya) shall come to an end. He also gives Savai Bhoj the gifts of a mare-Bavli, a cow-Suremata, and an elephant-Jaimangala, all of which have special powers. Savai Bhoj returns to his home. The brothers ask Tejaji, the eldest among them, what should they do with their newly acquired wealth. Tejaji advises them to bury the money in the ground and heard it. But, Nevaji suggests that they do good deeds with the money, like building wells and temples, distributing the wealth and make a name for themselves since both the wealth and their lives will end after twelve years. The brothers choose the latter alternative. Soon their fame spreads far and wide. In due course, they meet their future enemy, Durjansal, the king ''Rana'' (or ''Ravji'') (ruler) of Ran City. \n\nThe Rana and the Bagaravats become ''Dharam''-brothers. In an extended drinking session in a garden named ''naulakha bagh'' near Ran city, they overturn jars laden with wine onto a hillside flooding the earth to such an extent that the wine actually flows down into the kingdom of Basak Nag ([[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]]), serpent lord of the netherworld, who holds the earth on his hood. Angered, king Basak deposits the earth temporarily on a bull's horns and goes to Bhagavan([[Vishnu]])'s court to complain about the Bagaravats. But neither Basak, nor Hanuman, nor Bhagavan can do anything to remedy the situation because the Bagaravats are so powerful. Finally, Bhagavan assumes the form of the mendicant (''jogi'') and visits Sadu Mata, the wife of Savai Bhoj, begging for alms. Sadu, who has just completed performing ablutions and bathing, appears in front of the mendicant covered only by her long tresses. Struck by her devotion, the mendicant (Bhagavan) grants her a boon. Sadu desires that Bhagavan is born as her son. Bhagavan promises to be born as her son on the 13th day after the Bagaravats have been killed.\n\nAfter his return, Bhagavan requests ''Sakti'' ([[Durga]] or [[Bhavani]]), who agrees to go to earth to fulfill the task of destroying the Bagaravats. She manifests herself as an infant girl (later known as Jaimati) in a forest where she is discovered by the King of Bhual, who adopts her. Exactly at the time of her birth, her maidservant Hira is born. Jaimati grows up unusually fast. And, soon Brahmans are sent out to find a suitable bridegroom for her. She insists that they find someone belonging to a family in which one father has 24 sons. After a long and frustrating search, the Brahmans find the Bagaravats. They arrange to have the queen married to Savai Bhoj. But because they already married, the Bagaravats suggest that the queen is married to their 'dharam''-brother, the Rana. Thus, arrangements are made for the Rana to marry Jaimati. When the marriage procession sets out, Savai Bhoj instead of the Rana leads it. In the meanwhile Jaimati orders the ''toran'' to be hung in a high place that the Rana, who is 120 years old and feeble cannot reach up to. Instead of the Rana, Savai Bhoj strikes down the ''toran''. \n\nWhen the marriage procession arrives, the queen pretends she has a high fever. She asks her maidservant to bring Savai Bhoj's sword that is supposed to have healing powers. In the inner chambers of the palace, she then circles the sword, thereby secretly marrying Savai Bhoj. In public, however, she marries the Rana. At the end of the ceremonies, when she is to accompany the Rana to her new home, she insists on staying with the Bagaravats. The Bagaravats coax her into going with the Rana, promising to fetch her after a period of six months. Upon arriving in Rana's palace, however, the queen says she will not play dice with the Rana till he has constructed a new palace for her. The construction of the palace, of course, takes a long time, and six months are soon over. In the meanwhile, the Bagaravats - even against the advice of their wives - prepare to fetch the queen. The queen elopes with the Bagaravats. The Rana is patient, advising the Bagaravats in a brotherly manner to send the queen back to him. But, the Bagaravats stick to their decision. Finally, the Rana gathers together the armies to fifty-two forts on the banks of the Khari river. \n\nJaimati, who now has assumed her true form, Bhavani promises to accompany the Bagaravats only on the condition if they fight Rana's army one at a time. She also demands that the brothers offer their heads to her. The Bagaravats willingly agree to her grotesque demands. A ''Bharat'' (great war) is fought. In the battle, some of the brothers continue fighting even after their heads have been severed by the Goddess's discus. But in the end, all of them are slain and the Rana is victorious. The Goddess assumes her ''Virat Rup'' (awesome, terrifying form). Amidst the corpses of slain warriors, she squats on the battleground, dripping with blood, stringing a necklace of the Bagaravats' severed heads. After their deaths, the Bagaravats' wives with the exception of Savai Bhoj's wife, Sadu Mata, commit ''sati'' (self-immolation).<ref name=\"presentation\"/>\n\n===Shri Devnarayan Katha===\n[[File:Shri Devnarayan Bhagwan the imperialGurjar.jpg|thumb|right|Sri Devnarayan]]\nThis half of the narrative begins with Sadu Mata's severe ''tapas''(penance) on a hill near the battlefield. After eleven days, when her honour and life is about to be threatened by the Rana, she calls out to Bhagavan, who has promised to be born as her son. Devnarayan, who is playing a game of dice at the time with king Basak, rises up on a stream of water that splits apart the rock on which Sadu is seated. Borne on that jet of water in a lotus blossom, the infant Devnarayan falls into Sadu Mata's lap.\n\nThreatened by the Rana, Sadu Mata decides to flee to her natal home in [[Malwa]]. Devnarayan spends his childhood there without any knowledge of past events. After eleven years, one-day Chochu Bhat, the [[bard]] and genealogist of the 24 Bagaravat brothers comes to Malwa in search of Devnarayan. Sadu Mata who knows of his intentions tries to get him killed by poisoning, but Devnarayan revives him. Chochu Bhat then informs him of the battle between the Bagaravats and the Rana. Devnarayan then decides against his mother's will to return to his fathers ancestral land and take revenge on the Rana. While returning to the region of Bhilwara and his capital town of Causla Kheda, Devnarayan marries three princesses, one the daughter of a ''det'' ([[daitya]]), another the niece of a netherworld serpent king, and the third the daughter of the Gurjar ruler of [[Ujjain]]-Pipalde. While returning Devnarayan also meets up with his four cousins, Mehnduji, Madanji, Kanh Bhangi and Bhunaji, who likewise have grown up unaware of each other's existence. Whereas Mehnduji have been under the protection of the Bagaravat's ally, the king of Ajmer, Bhangi has grown up as a Nath Jogi in the company of the Bagaravats' guru Baba Rupnath. \n\nMadanji has been growing up with his father Tejaji Gurjar. Bhunaji, whose name has been changed to Khanderav, has been adopted by the Rana himself. But once the cousins realize their true origins, they join up with Devnarayan to launch an assault against the Rana. Before the final encounter takes place, Devnarayan releases his herd of 980,000 cows and buffaloes in the royal fields in order to destroy the Rana's crops. In the end, the cousins catch up with the Rana who is trying to escape. He is beheaded by Devnarayan's bow-string. But when Devnarayan sees that Bhunaji is sad over the death of his foster father, he revives the Rana only after Chochu Bhat has extracted the Bagaravats' revenge from the Rana's stomach.Thereafter  Devnarayan instructs the revived Rana to establish the city of [[Udaipur]], which according to the narrative is named after one of Devnarayan's names, Ud.Bhagwaan Dev Narayan was born on Shanivaar, Saptami Shukla Paksh of Maagh month and the year was Vikrami Samwat 968 (911 AD). Bhagwaan Dev Narayan lived a very short life of 31 years on earth.He went to BaikunthDhaam on Akshya Tritiya Shukla Paksh of Baisakh month in Vikrami Samwat 999 (942 AD).This was the time when Samrat Mahedra Pal divided his vast Empire between his two sons and loyalty of Gurjar feudatories like Gurjar [[Chauhans]], Gurjar Parmars, Gurjar Chandillas etc. were divided.\n\nUltimately around 915AD Samrat Mahi Pal established himself on the throne of the Gurjar Empire but a great clan of Bagarawat Chauhans of Gurjars was already sacrificed due to this division of loyalties of various feudatory kings and their vassals to these two [[Gurjar Pratihar]] Princes.\n\nAfter Devnarayan has accomplished taking revenge on the Rana, he decides to depart to ''Baikunth'' (heaven). But his Queen Pipalde requests him not to leave her childless. A boy Bila and a girl, Bili are born to her. Bili is quick to realize her father's divinity. But Bila is stubborn and refuses to acknowledge his father's authority. After many unhappy incidents including being befallen by leprosy, Bila begins to realize the divine power of his father. He then agrees to look after Devnarayan's very first shrine and become Devnarayan's first priest from which the lineage of priests follow. Then, having established a place of worship, a lineage of priests, and a community of devotees, Devnarayan finally returns in his celestial chariot to Baikunth.<ref name=\"presentation\"/>\n\nAccording to the epic, Infant Devnarayan was suckled by a lioness.That gave rise to famous Rajasthani Proverb ''Gurjari Jaayan, Nahari Jaayan'', which translated as ''Son of a [[Gurjar]] is no less than a Lion.''\n\n==Devnarayan shrines and phad==\nThe principal shrine of Devnaryan is located at Sawai Bhoj near [[Asind]] town, the battlefield of ''Bagravat Bharat''. Other significant shrines are at Demali, which is believed as the earliest shrine founded by Devnarayan himself and Malasari, where Devnarayan was born. Devnarayan is worshiped in these shrines in the form of an upright row of large sized bricks. The bricks are often kept bare, but sometimes the multi-colored tinsel is pasted over them.\n\nAnother significant shrine of Devnarayan is located at [[Jodhpuriya]] near Mashi dam in [[Tonk district]]. Two fairs are organized each year near this shrine.\n\n[[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]] was great devotee of Shri Devnarayan and he is said to have built a temple in memory of Deoji.<ref>{{cite book|title=Census of India, 1961, Volume 14, Issue 5|author=(Republic) Office of the Registrar General, India|publisher=Manager of Publications|year=1972|page=36}}</ref>\n\n===Devnarayan phad===\n{{main|Devnarayan Ki Par}}\n\nDevnarayan is also worshiped by the [[Bhopa]]s, the priest-singers by means of a scroll known as ''phad'', depicting various episodes of the narrative of the life of Devnaryan. This scroll, ''Devnarayan phad'', is used as a mobile temple and the Bhopas carry it with them. The Joshi families of Bhilwara and [[Shahpura, Bhilwara|Shahpura]] are the traditional artists of the ''Devnarayan phad''s. A ''phad'' consists of an image of Devnarayan in the attire of a king seated on his \"python\" throne in his court faced by the serpent king Basak and his four cousins at the centre. The whole ''phad'' is painted with various scenes related to the narrative of Devnarayan according to a traditional scheme. No place is left vacant. These phads are normally about 30 feet in length. One of the earliest surviving Devnarayan phad is in the collection of Rupayan Sansthan, the Rajasthan Institute of Folklore in Jodhpur. This phad is signed by Surajmal and Bagtavarchand and dated Vikram Samvat 1924 (1867).<ref>Smith, John D. (2005). ''The Epic of Pabuji'', New Delhi: Katha, {{ISBN|81-87649-83-6}}, p.39</ref>\n\nA Bhopa, usually erects the phad shortly after nightfall in the villages where he is invited to sing different episodes from the epical narrative of Devnarayan in front of the ''phad'' during the ''jagaran''s (night-wakes). Before the performance begins, the ground beneath is swept clean, incense is burnt and the offerings of grains and money are made in front of the ''phad''. During the performance, a ''jantar'' (a type of fretted [[veena]] with two resonators of gourd or wood) is played to accompany the songs.  Usually, there are two Bhopas who recite the epic, one is the main Bhopa, the ''Patavi'', and the other is his assistant, the ''Diyala''. When the ''Patavi Bhopa'' sings a particular episode of the epic, his junior partner, the ''Diyala Bhopa'' holds an oil lamp to illuminate the particular part of the ''phad'', where the particular episode which is being sung is depicted. He also sings along with his senior partner some parts of the episodes.\nThe phad of devnarayan ji issue a post ticket on 2 September 1992\n\n==Recognition==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DevnarayanPostCard.jpg|thumb|left|Devnarayan on a postcard stamp]] -->\nA commemorative stamp was issued by India post on 2 Sep 1992 of denomination INR 5.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Devmali]]\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n# Anandaram Phagana (1971, in Hindi Month Falgun Vikram samvat, 2027).

Brahma invited all the gods and [[Rishi|Rsis]] to his sacrifice. Among them is a group of twenty-four Rsis living in the ''Nag Pahad'', a mountain chain running parallel to Pushkar. The Rsis were disciples of Sankar ([[Shiva|Shankara]]). Sankar forbade them from attending the sacrifice, but they insisted on going because they had received invitations from Brahma. Suddenly, Sankar grew ravenously hungry. The Rsis suggested eating the fruits growing in the forest which they consume for a living. But Sankar said that would not satisfy him. He wanted more than plain fruit. But nothing else was available in the forest. There was no cereal or grain either. So, he turned to his disciples and began consuming them one after another. After he had eaten them and satiated his hunger, he went to visit Brahma's sacrifice himself. The sacrifice came to a halt because of the sin Sankar had committed. He asks Brahma how he should atone for his sin, whereupon Brahma informed him that the only means would be to offer the Rsis his own body in a future existence, in which the Rsis are to be born as the twenty-four sons of a single father. This prelude is normally spoken and not sung.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to a more historical time ([[Kali yuga]]). During the reign of [[Vishal Dev Chauhan]], the populace is being terrorized by a tiger that feeds on one individual every night. On one particular night, Hariram Gurjar offers to take the place of a boy whose turn it is to be eaten by the tiger. He sets up a trap for the tiger and beheads it. Then in order to wash the blood off his sword and to cleanse himself of the sin of slaughter, as it was a tradition among Gurjars, he goes to the holy lake of [[Pushkar]] carrying the lion's head on his shoulder. It is a full moon night ([[Full Moon|purnima]]). Exactly at the same time on the opposite bank of [[Pushkar]] Lake, daughter of Gurjar king Jagjan, Lila Sevri who has taken a vow never to see the face of a man is performing ablutions and bathing in the lake. While bathing, she sees the reflection of a man's body with the head of a tiger on the surface of the lake, and conceive. \n\nJagjan then allowed both to marry and also gifts half of his kingdom to Hariram Gurjar. After nine months their son is born. He has the head of a tiger and the body of a man and is named Baghji. Later because of his unusual and fearsome appearance, no one is willing to marry his daughter to him. He lives alone in a garden attended by a Brahman cook. Once, on the day of the [[Tij Festival|festival of ''savan tij'']] (swings), a number of young girls of various Gurjar[[Gotra]]s come to the garden attracted by Baghji's silken swing. The Brahman allows them to use the swing on the condition that each of them circumambulate Baghji. While they are doing this, the Brahman performs the necessary engagement rites. Unknowingly they are engaged to Baghji.\n\nLater Baghji Gurjar marries twelve of them namely ''Kanta Kalas'', ''Ganiyanvanti Kalas'', ''Lakmade Rathod'', ''Jyanta Saradana'', ''Lali Saradana'', ''Balma Saradana'', ''Barnavanti Chad'', ''Bindka Chad'', ''Dhanvantari Chechi'', ''Gauri Chechi'', ''Rama Awana'' and ''Bindra Awana''.\nKalas, Rathod, Saradana, Chad, Chechi and [[Awana (Gurjar lineage)|Awana]] all are [[:en:List of Gurjar clans|Gurjar Clans]] (or [[Gotra]]s).<ref>{{cite book|title=Devnarayan Ki Katha-Bagaravat Bharat|author=Anandaram Phagna|publisher=Archana Prakashan Ajmer|page=38}}</ref> Each of his wives gives birth to two sons who are collectively called the Bagaravats.\n\nAccording to written literature by anandaram phagna Baghji (Father of Bagaravats ) belonged to Chhatrapatti [[Chauhan]] gotra of Gurjars. Savai Bhoj is the most well-known and courageous of the twenty-four Bagaravats. Each day Savai Bhoj takes the Bagaravats cattle herds to graze on the slopes of Nag Pahad. One of the cows regularly leaves the herd and returns on its own in the evening. One day Savai Bhoj follows the cow and discovers that it is being milked by the ''jogi'' (ascetic) Rupnath. As compensation for milking their cow, Rupnath gives Savai Bhoj a sack full of grain. But the brothers have no use for the small quantity of grain, so they feed it to birds. The next morning, Nevaji, one of the youngest brothers, discovers that the few grains left sticking to the seam of the sack have turned into gems. They realize their folly and Savai Bhoj returns to Rupnath to become his disciple. \n\nOne day, being instructed by Rupnath, Savai Bhoj heats a cauldron of oil and circles it, while Rupnath follows. While they are circling the cauldron, Rupnath tries to push Savai Bhoj into the boiling oil, but Savai Bhoj leaps over with the help of his cowherd's staff. In the next round, Savai Bhoj follows Rupnath and pushes him into the cauldron. Not so agile, Rupnath falls into the boiling oil. Instantly his body turns into a solid gold nugget. While Savai Bhoj stands there repenting his crime, the ''jogi'' reappears in the hermitage as though nothing had taken place. He explains that the golden nugget is a gift that will grant the Bagaravats unending wealth for a period of twelve years after which both wealth (maya) and life (kaya) shall come to an end. He also gives Savai Bhoj the gifts of a mare-Bavli, a cow-Suremata, and an elephant-Jaimangala, all of which have special powers. Savai Bhoj returns to his home. The brothers ask Tejaji, the eldest among them, what should they do with their newly acquired wealth. Tejaji advises them to bury the money in the ground and heard it. But, Nevaji suggests that they do good deeds with the money, like building wells and temples, distributing the wealth and make a name for themselves since both the wealth and their lives will end after twelve years. The brothers choose the latter alternative. Soon their fame spreads far and wide. In due course, they meet their future enemy, Durjansal, the king ''Rana'' (or ''Ravji'') (ruler) of Ran City. \n\nThe Rana and the Bagaravats become ''Dharam''-brothers. In an extended drinking session in a garden named ''naulakha bagh'' near Ran city, they overturn jars laden with wine onto a hillside flooding the earth to such an extent that the wine actually flows down into the kingdom of Basak Nag ([[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]]), serpent lord of the netherworld, who holds the earth on his hood. Angered, king Basak deposits the earth temporarily on a bull's horns and goes to Bhagavan([[Vishnu]])'s court to complain about the Bagaravats. But neither Basak, nor Hanuman, nor Bhagavan can do anything to remedy the situation because the Bagaravats are so powerful. Finally, Bhagavan assumes the form of the mendicant (''jogi'') and visits Sadu Mata, the wife of Savai Bhoj, begging for alms. Sadu, who has just completed performing ablutions and bathing, appears in front of the mendicant covered only by her long tresses. Struck by her devotion, the mendicant (Bhagavan) grants her a boon. Sadu desires that Bhagavan is born as her son. Bhagavan promises to be born as her son on the 13th day after the Bagaravats have been killed.\n\nAfter his return, Bhagavan requests ''Sakti'' ([[Durga]] or [[Bhavani]]), who agrees to go to earth to fulfill the task of destroying the Bagaravats. She manifests herself as an infant girl (later known as Jaimati) in a forest where she is discovered by the King of Bhual, who adopts her. Exactly at the time of her birth, her maidservant Hira is born. Jaimati grows up unusually fast. And, soon Brahmans are sent out to find a suitable bridegroom for her. She insists that they find someone belonging to a family in which one father has 24 sons. After a long and frustrating search, the Brahmans find the Bagaravats. They arrange to have the queen married to Savai Bhoj. But because they already married, the Bagaravats suggest that the queen is married to their 'dharam''-brother, the Rana. Thus, arrangements are made for the Rana to marry Jaimati. When the marriage procession sets out, Savai Bhoj instead of the Rana leads it. In the meanwhile Jaimati orders the ''toran'' to be hung in a high place that the Rana, who is 120 years old and feeble cannot reach up to. Instead of the Rana, Savai Bhoj strikes down the ''toran''. \n\nWhen the marriage procession arrives, the queen pretends she has a high fever. She asks her maidservant to bring Savai Bhoj's sword that is supposed to have healing powers. In the inner chambers of the palace, she then circles the sword, thereby secretly marrying Savai Bhoj. In public, however, she marries the Rana. At the end of the ceremonies, when she is to accompany the Rana to her new home, she insists on staying with the Bagaravats. The Bagaravats coax her into going with the Rana, promising to fetch her after a period of six months. Upon arriving in Rana's palace, however, the queen says she will not play dice with the Rana till he has constructed a new palace for her. The construction of the palace, of course, takes a long time, and six months are soon over. In the meanwhile, the Bagaravats - even against the advice of their wives - prepare to fetch the queen. The queen elopes with the Bagaravats. The Rana is patient, advising the Bagaravats in a brotherly manner to send the queen back to him. But, the Bagaravats stick to their decision. Finally, the Rana gathers together the armies to fifty-two forts on the banks of the Khari river. \n\nJaimati, who now has assumed her true form, Bhavani promises to accompany the Bagaravats only on the condition if they fight Rana's army one at a time. She also demands that the brothers offer their heads to her. The Bagaravats willingly agree to her grotesque demands. A ''Bharat'' (great war) is fought. In the battle, some of the brothers continue fighting even after their heads have been severed by the Goddess's discus. But in the end, all of them are slain and the Rana is victorious. The Goddess assumes her ''Virat Rup'' (awesome, terrifying form). Amidst the corpses of slain warriors, she squats on the battleground, dripping with blood, stringing a necklace of the Bagaravats' severed heads. After their deaths, the Bagaravats' wives with the exception of Savai Bhoj's wife, Sadu Mata, commit ''sati'' (self-immolation).<ref name=\"presentation\"/>\n\n===Shri Devnarayan Katha===\n[[File:Shri Devnarayan Bhagwan the imperialGurjar.jpg|thumb|right|Sri Devnarayan]]\nThis half of the narrative begins with Sadu Mata's severe ''tapas''(penance) on a hill near the battlefield. After eleven days, when her honour and life is about to be threatened by the Rana, she calls out to Bhagavan, who has promised to be born as her son. Devnarayan, who is playing a game of dice at the time with king Basak, rises up on a stream of water that splits apart the rock on which Sadu is seated. Borne on that jet of water in a lotus blossom, the infant Devnarayan falls into Sadu Mata's lap.\n\nThreatened by the Rana, Sadu Mata decides to flee to her natal home in [[Malwa]]. Devnarayan spends his childhood there without any knowledge of past events. After eleven years, one-day Chochu Bhat, the [[bard]] and genealogist of the 24 Bagaravat brothers comes to Malwa in search of Devnarayan. Sadu Mata who knows of his intentions tries to get him killed by poisoning, but Devnarayan revives him. Chochu Bhat then informs him of the battle between the Bagaravats and the Rana. Devnarayan then decides against his mother's will to return to his fathers ancestral land and take revenge on the Rana. While returning to the region of Bhilwara and his capital town of Causla Kheda, Devnarayan marries three princesses, one the daughter of a ''det'' ([[daitya]]), another the niece of a netherworld serpent king, and the third the daughter of the Gurjar ruler of [[Ujjain]]-Pipalde. While returning Devnarayan also meets up with his four cousins, Mehnduji, Madanji, Kanh Bhangi and Bhunaji, who likewise have grown up unaware of each other's existence. Whereas Mehnduji have been under the protection of the Bagaravat's ally, the king of Ajmer, Bhangi has grown up as a Nath Jogi in the company of the Bagaravats' guru Baba Rupnath. \n\nMadanji has been growing up with his father Tejaji Gurjar. Bhunaji, whose name has been changed to Khanderav, has been adopted by the Rana himself. But once the cousins realize their true origins, they join up with Devnarayan to launch an assault against the Rana. Before the final encounter takes place, Devnarayan releases his herd of 980,000 cows and buffaloes in the royal fields in order to destroy the Rana's crops. In the end, the cousins catch up with the Rana who is trying to escape. He is beheaded by Devnarayan's bow-string. But when Devnarayan sees that Bhunaji is sad over the death of his foster father, he revives the Rana only after Chochu Bhat has extracted the Bagaravats' revenge from the Rana's stomach.Thereafter  Devnarayan instructs the revived Rana to establish the city of [[Udaipur]], which according to the narrative is named after one of Devnarayan's names, Ud.Bhagwaan Dev Narayan was born on Shanivaar, Saptami Shukla Paksh of Maagh month and the year was Vikrami Samwat 968 (911 AD). Bhagwaan Dev Narayan lived a very short life of 31 years on earth.He went to BaikunthDhaam on Akshya Tritiya Shukla Paksh of Baisakh month in Vikrami Samwat 999 (942 AD).This was the time when Samrat Mahedra Pal divided his vast Empire between his two sons and loyalty of Gurjar feudatories like Gurjar [[Chauhans]], Gurjar Parmars, Gurjar Chandillas etc. were divided.\n\nUltimately around 915AD Samrat Mahi Pal established himself on the throne of the Gurjar Empire but a great clan of Bagarawat Chauhans of Gurjars was already sacrificed due to this division of loyalties of various feudatory kings and their vassals to these two [[Gurjar Pratihar]] Princes.\n\nAfter Devnarayan has accomplished taking revenge on the Rana, he decides to depart to ''Baikunth'' (heaven). But his Queen Pipalde requests him not to leave her childless. A boy Bila and a girl, Bili are born to her. Bili is quick to realize her father's divinity. But Bila is stubborn and refuses to acknowledge his father's authority. After many unhappy incidents including being befallen by leprosy, Bila begins to realize the divine power of his father. He then agrees to look after Devnarayan's very first shrine and become Devnarayan's first priest from which the lineage of priests follow. Then, having established a place of worship, a lineage of priests, and a community of devotees, Devnarayan finally returns in his celestial chariot to Baikunth.<ref name=\"presentation\"/>\n\nAccording to the epic, Infant Devnarayan was suckled by a lioness.That gave rise to famous Rajasthani Proverb ''Gurjari Jaayan, Nahari Jaayan'', which translated as ''Son of a [[Gurjar]] is no less than a Lion.''\n\n==Devnarayan shrines and phad==\nThe principal shrine of Devnaryan is located at Sawai Bhoj near [[Asind]] town, the battlefield of ''Bagravat Bharat''. Other significant shrines are at Demali, which is believed as the earliest shrine founded by Devnarayan himself and Malasari, where Devnarayan was born. Devnarayan is worshiped in these shrines in the form of an upright row of large sized bricks. The bricks are often kept bare, but sometimes the multi-colored tinsel is pasted over them.\n\nAnother significant shrine of Devnarayan is located at [[Jodhpuriya]] near Mashi dam in [[Tonk district]]. Two fairs are organized each year near this shrine.\n\n[[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]] was great devotee of Shri Devnarayan and he is said to have built a temple in memory of Deoji.<ref>{{cite book|title=Census of India, 1961, Volume 14, Issue 5|author=(Republic) Office of the Registrar General, India|publisher=Manager of Publications|year=1972|page=36}}</ref>\n\n===Devnarayan phad===\n{{main|Devnarayan Ki Par}}\n\nDevnarayan is also worshiped by the [[Bhopa]]s, the priest-singers by means of a scroll known as ''phad'', depicting various episodes of the narrative of the life of Devnaryan. This scroll, ''Devnarayan phad'', is used as a mobile temple and the Bhopas carry it with them. The Joshi families of Bhilwara and [[Shahpura, Bhilwara|Shahpura]] are the traditional artists of the ''Devnarayan phad''s. A ''phad'' consists of an image of Devnarayan in the attire of a king seated on his \"python\" throne in his court faced by the serpent king Basak and his four cousins at the centre. The whole ''phad'' is painted with various scenes related to the narrative of Devnarayan according to a traditional scheme. No place is left vacant. These phads are normally about 30 feet in length. One of the earliest surviving Devnarayan phad is in the collection of Rupayan Sansthan, the Rajasthan Institute of Folklore in Jodhpur. This phad is signed by Surajmal and Bagtavarchand and dated Vikram Samvat 1924 (1867).<ref>Smith, John D. (2005). ''The Epic of Pabuji'', New Delhi: Katha, {{ISBN|81-87649-83-6}}, p.39</ref>\n\nA Bhopa, usually erects the phad shortly after nightfall in the villages where he is invited to sing different episodes from the epical narrative of Devnarayan in front of the ''phad'' during the ''jagaran''s (night-wakes). Before the performance begins, the ground beneath is swept clean, incense is burnt and the offerings of grains and money are made in front of the ''phad''. During the performance, a ''jantar'' (a type of fretted [[veena]] with two resonators of gourd or wood) is played to accompany the songs.  Usually, there are two Bhopas who recite the epic, one is the main Bhopa, the ''Patavi'', and the other is his assistant, the ''Diyala''. When the ''Patavi Bhopa'' sings a particular episode of the epic, his junior partner, the ''Diyala Bhopa'' holds an oil lamp to illuminate the particular part of the ''phad'', where the particular episode which is being sung is depicted. He also sings along with his senior partner some parts of the episodes.\nThe phad of devnarayan ji issue a post ticket on 2 September 1992\n\n==Recognition==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DevnarayanPostCard.jpg|thumb|left|Devnarayan on a postcard stamp]] -->\nA commemorative stamp was issued by India post on 2 Sep 1992 of denomination INR 5.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Devmali]]\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n# Anandaram Phagana (1971, in Hindi Month Falgun Vikram samvat, 2027).

Comparably, Judaism suffered setbacks due to the [[Jewish\u2013Roman wars|Jewish-Roman wars]], and these setbacks are remembered in the legacy of the [[Ten Martyrs]]. [[Robin Lane Fox]] traces the origin of much of the later hostility to this early period of persecution, when the Roman authorities commonly tested the faith of suspected Christians by forcing them to pay homage to the deified emperor. Jews were exempt from this requirement as long as they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], and Christians (many or mostly of Jewish origin) would say that they were Jewish but refused to pay the tax. This had to be confirmed by the local Jewish authorities, who were likely to refuse to accept the Christians as fellow Jews, often leading to their execution.<ref>In [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBqOAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&dq=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&pgis=1 ''Pagans and Christians'']</ref> The [[Birkat haMinim]] was often brought forward as support for this charge that the Jews were responsible for the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the 3rd century systematic persecution of Christians began and lasted until [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s conversion to Christianity.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 390 [[Theodosius I]] made Christianity the [[state church of the Roman Empire]].

Like most Bible passages, however, they can be and have been interpreted in a variety of ways.\n\nMainstream [[Talmud]]ic [[Rabbinical Judaism]] today directly descends from the Pharisees whom Jesus often criticized.<ref>Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1943); Jewish Encyclopedia (1905), Exhibit 264.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12087-pharisees|title=PHARISEES - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=}}</ref> During Jesus' life and at the time of his execution, the Pharisees were only one of several Jewish groups such as the [[Sadducee]]s, [[Zealot]]s, and [[Essene]]s who mostly died out not long after the period;<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia (1905)</ref> indeed, Jewish scholars such as [[Harvey Falk]] and [[Hyam Maccoby]] have suggested that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. Arguments by Jesus and his disciples against the Pharisees and what he saw as their hypocrisy were most likely examples of disputes among Jews and internal to Judaism that were common at the time, see for example [[Hillel and Shammai]].\n\n===Recent studies on antisemitism in the New Testament===\n{{Main article|Antisemitism and the New Testament}}\n\nProfessor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of ''Antisemitism in the New Testament'' ([[University Press of America]], 1994) has published a detailed study of the description of Jews in the New Testament, and the historical effects that such passages have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies of such verses have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), [[Hyam Maccoby]] (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College), and [[Michael Berenbaum]] (Georgetown University). Most rabbis feel that these verses are antisemitic, and many Christian scholars, in America and Europe, have reached the same conclusion. Another example is [[John Dominic Crossan]]'s 1995 ''book titled Who Killed Jesus? Exposing the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus''.\n\nSome biblical scholars have also been accused of holding antisemitic beliefs. [[Bruce J. Malina]], a founding member of [[The Context Group]], has come under criticism for going as far as to deny the Semitic ancestry of modern Israelis. He then ties this back to his work on first century cultural anthropology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Myles|first=Robert|author2=James Crossley |title=Biblical Scholarship, Jews and Israel: On Bruce Malina, Conspiracy Theories and Ideological Contradictions|journal=The Bible and Interpretation|date=Dec 2012|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/opeds/myl368013.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==Church Fathers==\n<!--{{Main article|Antisemitism in patristics}}-->\n{{see|Adversus Judaeos|John Chrysostom}}\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\nAfter [[Saint Paul|Paul]]'s death, Christianity emerged as a separate religion, and [[Pauline Christianity]] emerged as the dominant form of Christianity, especially after Paul, James and the other apostles agreed on a compromise set of requirements.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15}} Some Christians continued to adhere to aspects of Jewish law, but they were few in number and often considered [[Christian heresy|heretics]] by the Church.

The Catholic editor Paul Harkins wrote that [[St. John Chrysostom]]'s anti-Jewish theology \"is no longer tenable (..) For these objectively unchristian acts he cannot be excused, even if he is the product of his times.\" John Chrysostom held, as most Church Fathers did, that the sins of all Jews were communal and endless, to him his Jewish neighbours were the collective representation of all alleged crimes of all preexisting Jews. All Church Fathers applied the passages of the New Testament concerning the alleged advocation of the crucifixion of Christ to all Jews of his day, the Jews were the ultimate evil. However, John Chrysostom went so far to say that because Jews rejected the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] in human flesh, Christ, they therefore deserved to be killed: \"grew fit for slaughter.\" In citing the New Testament,{{Bibleref2c|Luke|19:27}} he claimed that Jesus was speaking about Jews when he said, \"as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and ''slay them'' before me.\"<ref name=RobertM11/>\n\n[[St. Jerome]] identified Jews with [[Judas Iscariot]] and the immoral use of money (\"Judas is cursed, that in Judas the Jews may be accursed... their prayers turn into sins\"). Jerome's homiletical assaults, that may have served as the basis for the anti-Jewish [[Good Friday prayer for the Jews|Good Friday liturgy]], contrasts Jews with the evil, and that \"the ceremonies of the Jews are harmful and deadly to Christians\", whoever keeps them was doomed to the [[devil]]: \"My enemies are the Jews; they have conspired in hatred against Me, crucified Me, heaped evils of all kinds upon Me, blasphemed Me.\"<ref name=RobertM11/>\n\n[[Ephraim the Syrian]] wrote polemics against Jews in the 4th century, including the repeated accusation that Satan dwells among them as a partner. The writings were directed at Christians who were being proselytized by Jews. Ephraim feared that they were slipping back into Judaism; thus, he portrayed the Jews as enemies of Christianity, like Satan, to emphasize the contrast between the two religions, namely, that Christianity was Godly and true and Judaism was Satanic and false. Like John Chrysostom, his objective was to dissuade Christians from reverting to Judaism by emphasizing what he saw as the wickedness of the Jews and their religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol1No2/HV1N2Palmer.html |title=Ephraim the Syrian and his polemics against Jews |publisher=Syrcom.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807105307/http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol1No2/HV1N2Palmer.html |archive-date=2012-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol5No1/HV5N1Shepardson.html |title=Analysis of Ephraim's writings |publisher=Syrcom.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807105203/http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol5No1/HV5N1Shepardson.html |archive-date=2012-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are also positive remarks from the Church Fathers on the issue, such as [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (circa. 263-340 A.D) in his Ecclesiastical History, who said, \"The race of the Hebrews is not new, but is honoured among all men for its antiquity and is itself well known to all.\"\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{Main article|Medieval antisemitism}}\n[[File:1182 french expulsion of jews.jpg|thumb|A miniature from [[Grandes Chroniques de France]] depicting the expulsion of Jews from France in 1182.]]\n[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153), a Doctor of the Catholic Church, said \"For us the Jews are Scripture's living words, because they remind us of what Our Lord suffered.

Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. Jews' association to money lending would carry on throughout history in the stereotype of Jews being greedy and perpetuating capitalism.\n\nIn the later medieval period, the number of Jews permitted to reside in certain places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s, and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nThe [[Oath More Judaico]], the form of oath required from Jewish witnesses, in some places developed bizarre or humiliating forms, e.g. in Swabian law of the 13th century,  the Jew would be required to stand on the hide of a sow or a bloody lamb.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews (and Muslims the same).\nOn many occasions, Jews were accused of a [[blood libel]], the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ritual murder in Russia, Eastern Europe, and beyond : new histories of an old accusation|publisher=|others=Avrutin, Eugene M.,, Dekel-Chen, Jonathan L.,, Weinberg, Robert|isbn=9780253026576|location=Bloomington, Indiana|pages=39\u201340|oclc=972200793|date = 2017-07-12}}</ref>\n\n===''Sicut Judaeis''===\n''[[Sicut Judaeis]]'' (the \"Constitution for the Jews\") was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later.

In the case of blood libel it was widely believed that the Jews would kill a child before Easter and needed Christian blood to bake matzo. Throughout history if a Christian child was murdered accusations of blood libel would arise no matter how small the Jewish population.

There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution during the [[Rhineland massacres]] of 1096 in Germany accompanying the lead-up to the [[First Crusade]], many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils.  In Germany the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but he was often unable to exert much influence.  In the [[Edict of Expulsion]], [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] expelled all the Jews from England in 1290 (only after ransoming some 3,000 among the most wealthy of them), on the accusation of [[usury]] and undermining loyalty to the dynasty.

Brown University historian [[David Kertzer]], working from the Vatican archive, has argued in his book ''[[The Popes Against the Jews]]'' that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between \"good antisemitism\" and \"bad antisemitism\". The \"bad\" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The \"good\" kind criticized alleged [[Jewish conspiracy|Jewish conspiracies]] to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when they were accused of promoting hatred of Jews, they would remind people that they condemned the \"bad\" kind of antisemitism.

Comparably, Judaism suffered setbacks due to the [[Jewish\u2013Roman wars|Jewish-Roman wars]], and these setbacks are remembered in the legacy of the [[Ten Martyrs]]. [[Robin Lane Fox]] traces the origin of much of the later hostility to this early period of persecution, when the Roman authorities commonly tested the faith of suspected Christians by forcing them to pay homage to the deified emperor. Jews were exempt from this requirement as long as they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], and Christians (many or mostly of Jewish origin) would say that they were Jewish but refused to pay the tax. This had to be confirmed by the local Jewish authorities, who were likely to refuse to accept the Christians as fellow Jews, often leading to their execution.<ref>In [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBqOAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&dq=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&pgis=1 ''Pagans and Christians'']</ref> The [[Birkat haMinim]] was often brought forward as support for this charge that the Jews were responsible for the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the 3rd century systematic persecution of Christians began and lasted until [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s conversion to Christianity.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 390 [[Theodosius I]] made Christianity the [[state church of the Roman Empire]].

Like most Bible passages, however, they can be and have been interpreted in a variety of ways.\n\nMainstream [[Talmud]]ic [[Rabbinical Judaism]] today directly descends from the Pharisees whom Jesus often criticized.<ref>Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1943); Jewish Encyclopedia (1905), Exhibit 264.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12087-pharisees|title=PHARISEES - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=}}</ref> During Jesus' life and at the time of his execution, the Pharisees were only one of several Jewish groups such as the [[Sadducee]]s, [[Zealot]]s, and [[Essene]]s who mostly died out not long after the period;<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia (1905)</ref> indeed, Jewish scholars such as [[Harvey Falk]] and [[Hyam Maccoby]] have suggested that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. Arguments by Jesus and his disciples against the Pharisees and what he saw as their hypocrisy were most likely examples of disputes among Jews and internal to Judaism that were common at the time, see for example [[Hillel and Shammai]].\n\n===Recent studies on antisemitism in the New Testament===\n{{Main article|Antisemitism and the New Testament}}\n\nProfessor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of ''Antisemitism in the New Testament'' ([[University Press of America]], 1994) has published a detailed study of the description of Jews in the New Testament, and the historical effects that such passages have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies of such verses have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), [[Hyam Maccoby]] (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College), and [[Michael Berenbaum]] (Georgetown University). Most rabbis feel that these verses are antisemitic, and many Christian scholars, in America and Europe, have reached the same conclusion. Another example is [[John Dominic Crossan]]'s 1995 ''book titled Who Killed Jesus? Exposing the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus''.\n\nSome biblical scholars have also been accused of holding antisemitic beliefs. [[Bruce J. Malina]], a founding member of [[The Context Group]], has come under criticism for going as far as to deny the Semitic ancestry of modern Israelis. He then ties this back to his work on first century cultural anthropology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Myles|first=Robert|author2=James Crossley |title=Biblical Scholarship, Jews and Israel: On Bruce Malina, Conspiracy Theories and Ideological Contradictions|journal=The Bible and Interpretation|date=Dec 2012|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/opeds/myl368013.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==Church Fathers==\n<!--{{Main article|Antisemitism in patristics}}-->\n{{see|Adversus Judaeos|John Chrysostom}}\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\nAfter [[Saint Paul|Paul]]'s death, Christianity emerged as a separate religion, and [[Pauline Christianity]] emerged as the dominant form of Christianity, especially after Paul, James and the other apostles agreed on a compromise set of requirements.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15}} Some Christians continued to adhere to aspects of Jewish law, but they were few in number and often considered [[Christian heresy|heretics]] by the Church. One example is the [[Ebionites]], who seem to have denied the [[Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)|virgin birth]] of Jesus, the physical [[Resurrection of Jesus]], and most of the books that were later [[biblical canon|canonized]] as the [[New Testament]]. For example, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] still continue [[Old Testament]] practices such as the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. As late as the 4th century [[Church Father]] [[John Chrysostom]] [[John Chrysostom#Homilies on Jews and Judaizing Christians|complained]] that some Christians were still attending Jewish synagogues.\n\nThe [[Church Fathers]] identified Jews and Judaism with [[Heresy#Christianity|heresy]] and declared the people of Israel to be ''extra Deum'' (lat. \"outside of God\").

As \"[[Witness People]]\", he sanctified collective punishment for the [[Jewish deicide]] and enslavement of Jews to Catholics: \"Not by bodily death, shall the ungodly race of carnal Jews perish ... 'Scatter them abroad, take away their strength. And bring them down O [[God the Son|Lord]]{{' \"}}. Augustine claimed to \"love\" the Jews but as a means to [[Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews|convert]] them to Christianity. Sometimes he identified all Jews with the evil Judas and developed the doctrine (together with [[St. Cyprian]]) that there was \"no salvation outside the Church\".<ref name=RobertM11>{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A history of Catholic antisemitism : the dark side of the church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0230111318|pages=|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=anti-semitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy#v=onepage&q=heretic&f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther Church Fathers, such as [[John Chrysostom]], went further in their condemnation. The Catholic editor Paul Harkins wrote that [[St. John Chrysostom]]'s anti-Jewish theology \"is no longer tenable (..) For these objectively unchristian acts he cannot be excused, even if he is the product of his times.\" John Chrysostom held, as most Church Fathers did, that the sins of all Jews were communal and endless, to him his Jewish neighbours were the collective representation of all alleged crimes of all preexisting Jews. All Church Fathers applied the passages of the New Testament concerning the alleged advocation of the crucifixion of Christ to all Jews of his day, the Jews were the ultimate evil. However, John Chrysostom went so far to say that because Jews rejected the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] in human flesh, Christ, they therefore deserved to be killed: \"grew fit for slaughter.\" In citing the New Testament,{{Bibleref2c|Luke|19:27}} he claimed that Jesus was speaking about Jews when he said, \"as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and ''slay them'' before me.\"<ref name=RobertM11/>\n\n[[St. Jerome]] identified Jews with [[Judas Iscariot]] and the immoral use of money (\"Judas is cursed, that in Judas the Jews may be accursed... their prayers turn into sins\"). Jerome's homiletical assaults, that may have served as the basis for the anti-Jewish [[Good Friday prayer for the Jews|Good Friday liturgy]], contrasts Jews with the evil, and that \"the ceremonies of the Jews are harmful and deadly to Christians\", whoever keeps them was doomed to the [[devil]]: \"My enemies are the Jews; they have conspired in hatred against Me, crucified Me, heaped evils of all kinds upon Me, blasphemed Me.\"<ref name=RobertM11/>\n\n[[Ephraim the Syrian]] wrote polemics against Jews in the 4th century, including the repeated accusation that Satan dwells among them as a partner. The writings were directed at Christians who were being proselytized by Jews. Ephraim feared that they were slipping back into Judaism; thus, he portrayed the Jews as enemies of Christianity, like Satan, to emphasize the contrast between the two religions, namely, that Christianity was Godly and true and Judaism was Satanic and false. Like John Chrysostom, his objective was to dissuade Christians from reverting to Judaism by emphasizing what he saw as the wickedness of the Jews and their religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol1No2/HV1N2Palmer.html |title=Ephraim the Syrian and his polemics against Jews |publisher=Syrcom.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807105307/http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol1No2/HV1N2Palmer.html |archive-date=2012-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol5No1/HV5N1Shepardson.html |title=Analysis of Ephraim's writings |publisher=Syrcom.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807105203/http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol5No1/HV5N1Shepardson.html |archive-date=2012-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are also positive remarks from the Church Fathers on the issue, such as [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (circa. 263-340 A.D) in his Ecclesiastical History, who said, \"The race of the Hebrews is not new, but is honoured among all men for its antiquity and is itself well known to all.\"\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{Main article|Medieval antisemitism}}\n[[File:1182 french expulsion of jews.jpg|thumb|A miniature from [[Grandes Chroniques de France]] depicting the expulsion of Jews from France in 1182.]]\n[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153), a Doctor of the Catholic Church, said \"For us the Jews are Scripture's living words, because they remind us of what Our Lord suffered.

Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. Jews' association to money lending would carry on throughout history in the stereotype of Jews being greedy and perpetuating capitalism.\n\nIn the later medieval period, the number of Jews permitted to reside in certain places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s, and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nThe [[Oath More Judaico]], the form of oath required from Jewish witnesses, in some places developed bizarre or humiliating forms, e.g. in Swabian law of the 13th century,  the Jew would be required to stand on the hide of a sow or a bloody lamb.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews (and Muslims the same).\nOn many occasions, Jews were accused of a [[blood libel]], the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ritual murder in Russia, Eastern Europe, and beyond : new histories of an old accusation|publisher=|others=Avrutin, Eugene M.,, Dekel-Chen, Jonathan L.,, Weinberg, Robert|isbn=9780253026576|location=Bloomington, Indiana|pages=39\u201340|oclc=972200793|date = 2017-07-12}}</ref>\n\n===''Sicut Judaeis''===\n''[[Sicut Judaeis]]'' (the \"Constitution for the Jews\") was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later.

In the case of blood libel it was widely believed that the Jews would kill a child before Easter and needed Christian blood to bake matzo. Throughout history if a Christian child was murdered accusations of blood libel would arise no matter how small the Jewish population.

There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution during the [[Rhineland massacres]] of 1096 in Germany accompanying the lead-up to the [[First Crusade]], many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East.

Brown University historian [[David Kertzer]], working from the Vatican archive, has argued in his book ''[[The Popes Against the Jews]]'' that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between \"good antisemitism\" and \"bad antisemitism\". The \"bad\" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The \"good\" kind criticized alleged [[Jewish conspiracy|Jewish conspiracies]] to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when they were accused of promoting hatred of Jews, they would remind people that they condemned the \"bad\" kind of antisemitism. Kertzer's work is not without critics. Scholar of Jewish-Christian relations [[Rabbi David G.

Under this approach, anti-Judaism is not regarded as antisemitism because it only rejects the religious beliefs of Judaism and does not involve actual hostility towards the Jewish people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nOthers believe that anti-Judaism is rejection of Judaism as a religion or opposition to Judaism's beliefs and practices ''essentially because'' of their source in [[Judaism]] or because a belief or practice is associated with the Jewish people.

In many cases, the practical tolerance towards the Jewish religion and Jews prevailed. Some Christian groups condemned verbal anti-Judaism, particularly in their early years.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==Conversion of Jews==\n{{See also|Hebrew Catholics|Messianic Judaism|Jews for Jesus}}\nSome Jewish organizations have denounced evangelistic and missionary activities which are specifically directed at Jews  by labeling them [[antisemitic]].<ref>[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/jews_for_jesus/jews_for_jesus6.html Keeping Faith.

In 1996 the SBC approved a resolution calling for efforts to seek the conversion of Jews \"as well as the salvation of 'every kindred and tongue and people and nation.'\"\n\nMost [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] agree with the SBC's position, and some of them also support efforts which specifically seek the Jews' conversion. Additionally, these Evangelical groups are among the most pro-Israel groups. (''For more information, see [[Christian Zionism]]''.)

Some of these congregations were actually founded by Jewish converts, like the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Sion]], whose members were [[nun]]s and ordained [[priest]]s. Many Catholic saints were specifically noted for their missionary zeal to convert Jews, such as [[Vincent Ferrer]]. After the [[Second Vatican Council]], many missionary orders which aimed to convert Jews to Christianity no longer actively sought to missionize (or [[proselytism|proselytize]]) them. However, [[Traditionalist Catholic|Traditionalist Roman Catholic]] groups, congregations and clergymen continue to advocate the missionizing of Jews according to traditional patterns, sometimes with success (''e.g.'', the [[Society of St. Pius X]] which has notable Jewish converts among its faithful, many of whom have become traditionalist priests).\n\n==Reconciliation between Judaism and Christian groups==\n{{Main article|Christian\u2013Jewish reconciliation}}\nIn recent years there has been much to note in the way of reconciliation between some Christian groups and the Jews.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Judaism}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]]\n* [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944\u20131946]]\n* [[Antisemitism and the New Testament]] \n* [[Antisemitism in Europe]]\n* [[Antisemitism in Islam]]\n* [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Antisemitism in the United States]]\n* [[Antisemitism in Ukraine]]\n* [[Christianity and Judaism]]\n* [[Criticisms of Christianity]]\n* [[Ecclesia et Synagoga]]\n* [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews]]\n* [[History of antisemitism in the United States]]\n* [[History of antisemitism]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Poland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Ukraine]]\n* [[History of the Jews and the Crusades]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Germany]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Hungary]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Romania]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Russia]]\n* [[Jewish deicide]]\n* [[Kishinev pogrom]]\n* [[New antisemitism]]\n* [[History of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance]]\n* [[Persecution of Jews]]\n* [[Pope John Paul II and Judaism]]\n* [[Racial antisemitism]]\n* [[Religious antisemitism]]\n* [[Timeline of antisemitism]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n\n* Beck, Norman A.

While this is far too powerful to be generated by the [[accretion disc]] of a stellar-mass [[black hole]], the source's location at a displacement of around 15 [[arcsecond]]s from the center of the galaxy also means that it cannot be powered by an [[active galactic nucleus]]. Since its discovery, NGC 5204 X-1 has been the target of several studies to try to determine the precise mechanism that is responsible for generating this and other known ULXs. The more recent of these studies were able to make use of the high-resolution capabilities of the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] to study the source in detail and firmly rule out the possibility that its unusual luminosity is the result of several weaker, but closely spaced sources.<ref name=\"liuetal2004\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2002\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2001\">{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0105307| title= The identification of an optical counterpart to the super-Eddington X-ray source, NGC 5204 X-1| date=2001 | author=T.

This theory is supported by the fact that the [[Eddington luminosity|Eddington limit]] for a source of this magnitude means that the mass of generating object cannot be less than {{Solar mass|25}}. The source's observed strength has varied by up to 50% over a 10-year span, which is also consistent with an accretion disc X-ray source.<ref name=\"liuetal2004\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2002\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2001\" />\n\n===Optical counterpart===\nAn optical counterpart to NGC 5204 X-1 was discovered in 2001 using the X-ray data from Chandra and a series of observations in the [[visible light|visible spectrum]] from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. With an [[apparent magnitude]] of 19.7 despite a distance of more than 14 million light-years, which corresponds to an [[absolute magnitude]] of -8.7, it is most likely a large [[spectral type|type]] B or type O [[supergiant]] star. A 2003 study that performed a detailed spectral analysis of the optical source determined that its surface temperature is most likely less than 25,000 [[Kelvin|K]]. If accurate, this would suggest that the counterpart is a type B0 supergiant with a mass of about {{Solar mass|25}} and a radius of about {{Solar radius|link=y|30}}, similar to [[Deneb]].<ref name=\"liuetal2004\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2001\" />\n\nBoth the X-ray source and the optical counterpart are located near the center of a massive void in the surrounding [[interstellar medium]] more than 150 parsecs (490 light-years) wide. This is probably a result of the extremely powerful [[solar wind]] that is generated by stars of this luminosity.<ref name=\"robertsetal2002\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2001\" />\n\nThe discovery of this massive star also cast some doubt on the prevailing theory that the ULX is generated by a black hole accretion disc. A calculation of the orbits of a binary system with the components detailed above suggests an orbital period of 200\u2013300 hours, depending on the exact masses involved. However, a 2006 study found no evidence of any periodic variations at all in the luminosity of the X-ray source, although the strength does vary randomly over timescales of a few days. As a result, the study advanced an alternative theory that the X-ray source is generated by the supergiant's [[stellar corona|corona]], which would be capable of generating a very powerful X-ray source because of the extreme luminosity of the parent star.

Despite its relatively diffuse distribution of stars, the galaxy does have several clusters of hot, young stars that are thought to be the location of most of the eleven known X-ray sources.<ref name=\"liuetal2004\" /><ref name=\"zezas_2010\" /> The galaxy also appears to have a larger than normal [[dark matter]] component as the estimated mass of its visible portion does not adequately explain the observed [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotation curve]] of the individual stars, even very close to its center. Although most spiral galaxies exhibit a rotation curve discrepancy, this normally does not become apparent until much farther away from the nucleus.<ref name=\"sicotteetal1996\" />\n\nNo [[supernova]]s have been observed in the galaxy to date, although three [[supernova remnant]]s have been identified.

It is located at {{RA|13|29|38.62}} {{DEC|+58|25|05.6}} and has a luminosity of around 5.2 x 10<sup>39</sup> [[erg]]/s (5.2 x 10<sup>32</sup> Watts). While this is far too powerful to be generated by the [[accretion disc]] of a stellar-mass [[black hole]], the source's location at a displacement of around 15 [[arcsecond]]s from the center of the galaxy also means that it cannot be powered by an [[active galactic nucleus]]. Since its discovery, NGC 5204 X-1 has been the target of several studies to try to determine the precise mechanism that is responsible for generating this and other known ULXs. The more recent of these studies were able to make use of the high-resolution capabilities of the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] to study the source in detail and firmly rule out the possibility that its unusual luminosity is the result of several weaker, but closely spaced sources.<ref name=\"liuetal2004\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2002\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2001\">{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0105307| title= The identification of an optical counterpart to the super-Eddington X-ray source, NGC 5204 X-1| date=2001 | author=T.

This theory is supported by the fact that the [[Eddington luminosity|Eddington limit]] for a source of this magnitude means that the mass of generating object cannot be less than {{Solar mass|25}}. The source's observed strength has varied by up to 50% over a 10-year span, which is also consistent with an accretion disc X-ray source.<ref name=\"liuetal2004\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2002\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2001\" />\n\n===Optical counterpart===\nAn optical counterpart to NGC 5204 X-1 was discovered in 2001 using the X-ray data from Chandra and a series of observations in the [[visible light|visible spectrum]] from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. With an [[apparent magnitude]] of 19.7 despite a distance of more than 14 million light-years, which corresponds to an [[absolute magnitude]] of -8.7, it is most likely a large [[spectral type|type]] B or type O [[supergiant]] star. A 2003 study that performed a detailed spectral analysis of the optical source determined that its surface temperature is most likely less than 25,000 [[Kelvin|K]]. If accurate, this would suggest that the counterpart is a type B0 supergiant with a mass of about {{Solar mass|25}} and a radius of about {{Solar radius|link=y|30}}, similar to [[Deneb]].<ref name=\"liuetal2004\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2001\" />\n\nBoth the X-ray source and the optical counterpart are located near the center of a massive void in the surrounding [[interstellar medium]] more than 150 parsecs (490 light-years) wide. This is probably a result of the extremely powerful [[solar wind]] that is generated by stars of this luminosity.<ref name=\"robertsetal2002\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2001\" />\n\nThe discovery of this massive star also cast some doubt on the prevailing theory that the ULX is generated by a black hole accretion disc. A calculation of the orbits of a binary system with the components detailed above suggests an orbital period of 200\u2013300 hours, depending on the exact masses involved. However, a 2006 study found no evidence of any periodic variations at all in the luminosity of the X-ray source, although the strength does vary randomly over timescales of a few days. As a result, the study advanced an alternative theory that the X-ray source is generated by the supergiant's [[corona]], which would be capable of generating a very powerful X-ray source because of the extreme luminosity of the parent star. Supergiant stars also known to experience large variations in luminosity more or less at random, which would heat the corona to varying degrees and explain the observed changes in X-ray emission strength.<ref name=\"robertsetal2002\" /><ref name=\"robertsetal2006\">{{cite journal| author=T.

For example, a 2009 survey conducted by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) revealed that substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was higher than children raised by their biological parents. However, the percentage of substance abuse amongst children raised by single-mothers was not only remarkably low (5.4%), but also only 1.2% higher than children raised by both their parents.<ref name=\"National Survey on Drug Use and Health\">{{cite web|url=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|title=National Survey on Drug Use and Health|website=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|date=2009}}</ref> Those rates reveal to be even smaller when compared to other demographics of the same time period. According surveys commissioned by to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] between 20%\u201330% of teenagers used/abused illicit substances, a much higher rate than single-mother households.<ref name=\"Youth Substance Abuse, NIDA\">{{cite web|url=https://drugabuse.com/library/drug-abuse-statistics/|title=Drug Abuse Statistics, NIDA|date=1997\u20132014}}</ref> Another example of poorly cited statistics to further this narrative can be found in children who have lost at least one parent. In the U.S., the rate of parental death before age 16 is 8%. The rate of parental death is disproportionately high for prisoners (30%\u201350%), however, it is also disproportionately high for high-performing scientists (26%) and US presidents (34%). Harvard's Baker Foundation Professor, Emerita, Dr. Teresa M.

However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.\n\nData from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative. Since 1999, out of 145 US school shootings committed by children/adolescents, 80% of the guns used were taken from their homes or relative's home.<ref name=\"The gun\u2019s not in the closet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/08/01/feature/school-shootings-should-parents-be-charged-for-failing-to-lock-up-guns-used-by-their-kids/|title=The gun's not in the closet|date=Aug 2018}}</ref> The availability of firearms has direct effect on the probability of initiating a school shooting.

The student insists on an inordinate degree of privacy, and parents have little information about his activities, school life, friends, or other relationships. The parents seem intimidated by their child. They may fear he will attack them physically if they confront or frustrate him, or they may be unwilling to face an emotional outburst, or they may be afraid that upsetting the child will spark an emotional crisis. Traditional family roles are reversed: for example, the child acts as if he were the authority figure, while parents act as if they were the children.\"\n\n'''\"No Limits or Monitoring of TV and Internet\"'''\n\"Parents do not supervise, limit or monitor the student's television watching or his use of the Internet. The student may have a TV in his own room or is otherwise free without any limits to spend as much time as he likes watching violent or otherwise inappropriate shows. The student spends a great deal of time watching television rather than in activities with family or friends. Similarly, parents do not monitor computer use or Internet access. The student may know much more about computers than the parents do, and the computer may be considered off limits to the parents while the student is secretive about his computer use, which may involve violent games or Internet research on violence, weapons, or other disturbing subjects.\"\n\nThis last passage includes the archaic notion that violent video games leads to school shootings. The FBI offer three cautions with their guide, 1) No trait or characteristic should be considered in isolation or given more weight than the others, 2) One bad day may not reflect a student's real personality or usual behavior, and 3) Many of these traits and behaviors are seen in adolescents with other, non-violent, issues.\n \n[[Daniel Schechter]], Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is \"every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=30762|title=Forecasting Aggression: Toward a New Interdisciplinary Understanding of What Makes Some Troubled Youth Turn Violent|website=Dana.org|date=Feb 2011}}</ref> Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from \"bad\" parents.

While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the [[nervous system]] in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, [[axons]], [[neurons]], and [[synapses]], to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. ''pruning'' (or [[apoptosis]], otherwise known as ''cell death'').<ref>Feinberg, Irwin \u2013 [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-synaptic-pruning-important-for-the-developing-brain/ Why synaptic pruning is important for the developing brain] ''[[Scientific American]]'' Accessed February 15, 2018</ref> These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the [[pre-frontal cortex]], the brain location where [[decision-making]] occurs, is the concluding area for development.

One group read an article that presented only the facts of the case. A different group read an article about the same shooting, but in it the author advocated for gun restrictions for people with mental illness. Another group read about the shooting in an article that suggested the proposal to ban large-capacity magazines, which acted to advocate that shootings could stem from a societal problem rather than an individual problem. The control group did not read anything. Participants were then all asked to fill in a questionnaire asking about their views on gun control and whether they thought there should be restrictions on high-capacity magazines. 71% of the control group thought that gun restrictions should be applied to people with mental illness, and nearly 80% of participants who read the articles agreed. Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines. This suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse. However, the link is unclear since research has shown that violence in mentally ill people occurs more in interpersonal environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Jessica|title=Mass Shootings and Mental Health Policy|journal=Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare|date=Mar 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=107\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n\nIt is also mentionable that school size contributes to the presence of School Shootings. In an article by Baird, Roellke & Zeifman from the Social Science Journal, it is presented that students who commit mass shootings in larger schools are significantly more likely to have transitioned from relatively smaller, more supportive schools. This adds important nuance to the idea that larger schools are more prone to mass violence by demonstrating that it may not be size alone, but rather the stress associated with losing the interpersonal connections and social support provided in smaller school settings that best predicts mass school shootings. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baird|first=Abigail A.|last2=Roellke|first2=Emma V.|last3=Zeifman|first3=Debra M.|date=2017-09-01|title=Alone and adrift: The association between mass school shootings, school size, and student support|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2017.01.009|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=54|issue=3|pages=261\u2013270|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2017.01.009|issn=0362-3319}}</ref>\n\n\n\nA 2016 opinion piece concluded that 22% of mass murders are committed by people who suffer from a serious mental illness, and 78% do not.

In several peer\u2010reviewed articles on mental health consequences of school shootings by Lowe & Galea, it is shown that mass shootings can bring on the onset of PTSD and continued depression. Also in the cities that are home to these kind of events, the town can experience continued paranoia and an exaggerated sense of fear due to the event happening.

A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.\n\nThe idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person's aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis (Ferguson, 2009) but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.\n\nA summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression (Anderson, 2004; Ferguson, 2007 & Spencer, 2009). Again, this supports the idea that although it is a popular opinion to link school shooters to being violent video gamers; this misconception is often attributable to third variables and has not been supported by research on the connection between aggression and gaming.\n\n==Frequency trends==\nSchool shootings are a \"modern phenomenon\".

For years, some areas in the US have allowed \"armed classrooms\" to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.\n\nMany teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. \"One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students.\" Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. \"They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do.\"\n\nTo diminish school shootings all together there are many preventative measures that can be taken such as: \n* Installing wireless panic alarms to alert law enforcement. \n* Limiting points of entry with security guarding them. \n* Strategically placing telephones for emergencies so police are always reachable at any point in the campus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Robert|last2=Duplechain|first2=Rosalind|title=New Ways To Stop Bullying|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=2002|volume=33|issue=9|pages=64}}</ref>\n* Employing school psychologists to monitor and provide mental health services for those that need help.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf|title=Now Is The Time|website=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n* Coordinating a response plan between local police and schools in the event of a threat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Deadly Dreams|last=Robertz|first=Frank|date=August 1, 2007|work=Scientific American|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 research report published by the Center for Homicide Research, they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the \"[[weapons effect]]\", which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. \"In Berkowitz & LaPage's (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students' performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks.

According to Katherine A. Fowler, PhD, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average 1,297 children die (two children per 100,000) and 5,790 are treated for injuries caused by guns each year, the study reported. Six percent of these deaths were accidental, 38% were suicides, 53% were homicides and the remaining 3% were from legal intervention or undetermined reasons. Guns injured children at a rate of 8 per 100,000 children, but this rate is likely considerably higher because of unreported injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/06/19/american-denial-about-facts-on-guns-continues-to-kill-children/#38cd87354a9a|title=Children Are Dying Because Of Americans' Denial About Guns|last=Tara|first=Haelle|date=Jun 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA preventive measure proposed for stopping school shooting has been focused on securing firearms in the home. A shooting in [[Sparks, Nevada]] on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter's home. [[Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in Newtown, [[Red Lake High School]] in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.\n\nA 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that \"from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place\". 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place. In 2005 a study was done on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents' firearms.<ref>\"Preventing school shootings starts with gun safety at home\". ''Christian Science Monitor''. October 31, 2013.</ref>\n\nMost states have Child Access Prevention Laws \u2013 laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms. Each state varies in the degree of the severity of these laws. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. There is also a wide range of laws that fall in between the two extremes. One example is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury.

The majority of individuals had rarely or never gotten into trouble at school and had a healthy social life. Some, such as [[Alan Lipman]], have warned against the dearth of empirical validity of profiling methods.\n\n===Family dynamics===\nOne assumption into the catalytic causes of school shootings comes from the \"non-traditional\" household perspective, which focuses on how family structure and family stability are related to child outcomes.<ref name=\"Marriage and Child Wellbeing\">{{cite journal|title=Marriage and Child Wellbeing|journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family|volume=72|issue=5|pages=1059\u20131077|date=Oct 2010|pmc = 3091824|last1 = Brown|first1 = S.

This perspective is found to back federal efforts such as the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] (PRWORA) of 1996<ref name=\"PRWORA\">{{cite web|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/personal-responsibility-and-work-opportunity-reconciliation-act-1996|title=PRWORA|date=November 23, 2015}}</ref> and US federal tax incentives.<ref name=\"Married Individuals Filing Joint Returns\">{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2018-10_IRB#RR-2018-06|title=Internal Revenue Bulletin- 2018-10|date=March 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these assumptions on the detrimental effects of \"non-traditional\" family structures have repeatedly been shown to be false flags, with the true issues lying within socio-economic realities.<ref name=\"Consequences of Growing Up Poor\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.russellsage.org/publications/consequences-growing-poor-1|title=Consequences of Growing Up Poor &#124; RSF|website=russellsage.org|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Growing Up with a Single Parent\">{{cite web|url=https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/textver/16.2.a/impact.txt|title=Growing Up with a Single Parent- What Hurts, What Helps|date=1995}}</ref> Longitudinal research has shown the robust, positive effects of higher incomes and higher education levels on child well-being and emotional development, which reflects on the family ''stability'', and not family structure.<ref name=\"IFS Commentary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org|title=Cohabitation, marriage, relationship stability and child outcomes: an update|date=July 2011|access-date=December 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225143544/https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Further, proponents of this hypothesis often cite family statistics for those who commit crimes, but leave out how these compare to other populations, including the general population. For example, a 2009 survey conducted by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) revealed that substance abuse amongst children raised by single mothers was higher than children raised by their biological parents. However, the percentage of substance abuse amongst children raised by single-mothers was not only remarkably low (5.4%), but also only 1.2% higher than children raised by both their parents.<ref name=\"National Survey on Drug Use and Health\">{{cite web|url=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|title=National Survey on Drug Use and Health|website=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm|date=2009}}</ref> Those rates reveal to be even smaller when compared to other demographics of the same time period. According surveys commissioned by to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] between 20%\u201330% of teenagers used/abused illicit substances, a much higher rate than single-mother households.<ref name=\"Youth Substance Abuse, NIDA\">{{cite web|url=https://drugabuse.com/library/drug-abuse-statistics/|title=Drug Abuse Statistics, NIDA|date=1997\u20132014}}</ref> Another example of poorly cited statistics to further this narrative can be found in children who have lost at least one parent. In the U.S., the rate of parental death before age 16 is 8%. The rate of parental death is disproportionately high for prisoners (30%\u201350%), however, it is also disproportionately high for high-performing scientists (26%) and US presidents (34%). Harvard's Baker Foundation Professor, Emerita, Dr. Teresa M. Amabile states, \"Those kinds of events can crush a child, they can lead to a lot of problems; they can lead to substance abuse, they can lead to various forms of emotional illness. They can also lead to incredible resilience and almost superhuman behaviors, seemingly, if people can come through those experiences intact.

Everly, Jr, of [[The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] and [[The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] outlined an accumulation of seven, recurring themes that warrant consideration regarding school shooters.<ref name=\"Profiling School Shooters\">{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/when-disaster-strikes-inside-disaster-psychology/201803/profiling-school-shooters|title=Profiling School Shooters|date=March 2018}}</ref> One factor is that school shooters tended to isolate themselves, and \"exhibited an obsessive quality that often led to detailed planning, but ironically they seemed to lack an understanding of the consequences of their behavior and thus may have a history of adverse encounters with law enforcement.\" A criticism in the media of past shooters was questioning how so much planning could commence without alerting the parents or guardians to their efforts. However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.\n\nData from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative. Since 1999, out of 145 US school shootings committed by children/adolescents, 80% of the guns used were taken from their homes or relative's home.<ref name=\"The gun\u2019s not in the closet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/08/01/feature/school-shootings-should-parents-be-charged-for-failing-to-lock-up-guns-used-by-their-kids/|title=The gun's not in the closet|date=Aug 2018}}</ref> The availability of firearms has direct effect on the probability of initiating a school shooting. This has led many to question whether parents should be held criminally negligent for their children's gun-related crimes. By 2018, a total of four parents were convicted of failing to lock up the guns that were used to shoot up US schools by their children.<ref name=\"The gun\u2019s not in the closet\"/> Such incidents may also lead to nationwide discussion on gun laws.<ref>{{cite web|title=Government Vows to Take Action Following Kauhajoki Shootings |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/govt_promises_action_following_kauhajoki_shootings/6112199 |accessdate=September 23, 2008 |work=YLE}}</ref>\n\nThe [[FBI]] offer a guide for helping to identify potential school shooters, ''The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective''.<ref name=\"The School Shooter, 1999\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/stats-services-publications-school-shooter-school-shooter/view|title=The School Shooter|date=1999}}</ref>\n\n'''\"Student 'Rules the Roost'\"'''\n\"The parents set few or no limits on the child's conduct, and regularly give in to his demands. The student insists on an inordinate degree of privacy, and parents have little information about his activities, school life, friends, or other relationships. The parents seem intimidated by their child. They may fear he will attack them physically if they confront or frustrate him, or they may be unwilling to face an emotional outburst, or they may be afraid that upsetting the child will spark an emotional crisis. Traditional family roles are reversed: for example, the child acts as if he were the authority figure, while parents act as if they were the children.\"\n\n'''\"No Limits or Monitoring of TV and Internet\"'''\n\"Parents do not supervise, limit or monitor the student's television watching or his use of the Internet. The student may have a TV in his own room or is otherwise free without any limits to spend as much time as he likes watching violent or otherwise inappropriate shows. The student spends a great deal of time watching television rather than in activities with family or friends. Similarly, parents do not monitor computer use or Internet access. The student may know much more about computers than the parents do, and the computer may be considered off limits to the parents while the student is secretive about his computer use, which may involve violent games or Internet research on violence, weapons, or other disturbing subjects.\"\n\nThis last passage includes the archaic notion that violent video games leads to school shootings. The FBI offer three cautions with their guide, 1) No trait or characteristic should be considered in isolation or given more weight than the others, 2) One bad day may not reflect a student's real personality or usual behavior, and 3) Many of these traits and behaviors are seen in adolescents with other, non-violent, issues.\n \n[[Daniel Schechter]], Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is \"every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dana.org/news/cerebrum/detail.aspx?id=30762|title=Forecasting Aggression: Toward a New Interdisciplinary Understanding of What Makes Some Troubled Youth Turn Violent|website=Dana.org|date=Feb 2011}}</ref> Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from \"bad\" parents. No more than they could come from attentive, educated, negligent, single, married, abusive, or loving parents.\n\n===Younger age===\nAccording to [[Adrian Raine|Raine]] (2002), [[Developmental age|immaturity]] is one of many identified factors increasing the likelihood of an individual committing criminal acts of [[violence]] and outbursts of [[aggression]].<ref>Raine, A (2002) \u2013 [https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_13840000000000001/attachments/280145/Issue%202-%20Criminal%20Behavior%20Biological.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Issue%202-%20Criminal%20Behavior%20Biological.pdf%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Issue%25202%252D%2520Criminal%2520Behavior%2520Biological.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJFNFXH2V2O7RPCAA%2F20180220%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20180220T005116Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=23f428ae1771a265c3e52655a7f89c172460554591678d83000da681f239993e Biological Basis for Crime in Crime: Public Policies for Crime control (J.Q.

While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the [[nervous system]] in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, [[axons]], [[neurons]], and [[synapses]], to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. ''pruning'' (or [[apoptosis]], otherwise known as ''cell death'').<ref>Feinberg, Irwin \u2013 [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-synaptic-pruning-important-for-the-developing-brain/ Why synaptic pruning is important for the developing brain] ''[[Scientific American]]'' Accessed February 15, 2018</ref> These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the [[pre-frontal cortex]], the brain location where [[decision-making]] occurs, is the concluding area for development. While the pre-frontal cortex is developing, children and teenagers might possibly rely more on the brain part known as the [[amygdala]]; involving thinking that is more emotionally active, including [[aggression]] and [[impulsiveness]]. As a consequence each individual is more likely to want to make riskier choices, and to do so more frequently.<ref>Raising children network, in collaboration with, the Centre for Adolescent Health \u2013 [http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/brain_development_teenagers.html Brain development: Teenagers] ''Australian parenting website'' Accessed February 15, 2018</ref>\n \nSteinberg (2004)<ref>Steinberg, L (2004) \u2013 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15251873 Risk taking in adolescence: what changes, and why?] [[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] Accessed February 20, 2018</ref> identified the fact of adolescents ''taking more risks'', typically, than adults; Deakin et al.

One group read an article that presented only the facts of the case. A different group read an article about the same shooting, but in it the author advocated for gun restrictions for people with mental illness. Another group read about the shooting in an article that suggested the proposal to ban large-capacity magazines, which acted to advocate that shootings could stem from a societal problem rather than an individual problem. The control group did not read anything. Participants were then all asked to fill in a questionnaire asking about their views on gun control and whether they thought there should be restrictions on high-capacity magazines. 71% of the control group thought that gun restrictions should be applied to people with mental illness, and nearly 80% of participants who read the articles agreed. Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines. This suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse. However, the link is unclear since research has shown that violence in mentally ill people occurs more in interpersonal environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Jessica|title=Mass Shootings and Mental Health Policy|journal=Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare|date=Mar 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=107\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n\nIt is also mentionable that school size contributes to the presence of School Shootings. In an article by Baird, Roellke & Zeifman from the Social Science Journal, it is presented that students who commit mass shootings in larger schools are significantly more likely to have transitioned from relatively smaller, more supportive schools. This adds important nuance to the idea that larger schools are more prone to mass violence by demonstrating that it may not be size alone, but rather the stress associated with losing the interpersonal connections and social support provided in smaller school settings that best predicts mass school shootings. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baird|first=Abigail A.|last2=Roellke|first2=Emma V.|last3=Zeifman|first3=Debra M.|date=2017-09-01|title=Alone and adrift: The association between mass school shootings, school size, and student support|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2017.01.009|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=54|issue=3|pages=261\u2013270|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2017.01.009|issn=0362-3319}}</ref>\n\n\n\nA 2016 opinion piece concluded that 22% of mass murders are committed by people who suffer from a serious mental illness, and 78% do not.

In several peer\u2010reviewed articles on mental health consequences of school shootings by Lowe & Galea, it is shown that mass shootings can bring on the onset of PTSD and continued depression. Also in the cities that are home to these kind of events, the town can experience continued paranoia and an exaggerated sense of fear due to the event happening. Lowe & Galea continue to say that continued research is necessary to pinpoint the exact mental symptoms that occur in the victims of school shootings. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Draucker |first1=Claire-Burke |title=The mental health consequences of mass school shootings: What do we need to know? |url=https://doi-org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/10.1111/jan.14258 |website=Wiley Online Library |publisher=Wiley |accessdate=5 April 2020 |ref=The presence of illness after a shooting and those characteriistics}}</ref>\n\n=== Violent video games theory ===\nIt has long been debated whether there exists a correlation between school shooting perpetrators and the type of media they consume. A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.\n\nThe idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person's aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis (Ferguson, 2009) but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.\n\nA summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression (Anderson, 2004; Ferguson, 2007 & Spencer, 2009). Again, this supports the idea that although it is a popular opinion to link school shooters to being violent video gamers; this misconception is often attributable to third variables and has not been supported by research on the connection between aggression and gaming.\n\n==Frequency trends==\nSchool shootings are a \"modern phenomenon\".

It is recommended by the department of homeland security that civilians involved in the incident take active steps to evacuate, hide, or counter the shooter and that individual law enforcement officers present or first arriving at the scene attempt immediately to engage the shooter.

It has led to the creation of hundreds of behavioral intervention teams which help access and co-ordinate institutional responses to behavioral concerns on college and university campuses.\n\n==School countermeasures==\n\n=== Armed classrooms ===\nThere has been considerable policy discussion about how to help prevent school and other types of mass shootings. One suggestion that has come up is the idea to allow firearms in the classroom. \"Since the issue of arming teachers is a relatively new topic, it has received little empirical study. Therefore, most of the literature does not come from peer reviewed sources but rather published news reports. In addition, most of these reports are not objective and clearly appear to support a specific side of the debate.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=Teachers with Guns: Firearms Discharges by School teachers, 1980\u20132012 |url= http://homicidecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Teachers-with-Guns-RESEARCH-REPORT-FINAL.pdf|website=Homicidecenter.org|accessdate=May 21, 2018 |page=3 |date=2013}}</ref> So far, data has been inconclusive as to whether or not arming teachers would have any sort of benefit for schools. For years, some areas in the US have allowed \"armed classrooms\" to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.\n\nMany teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. \"One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students.\" Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. \"They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do.\"\n\nTo diminish school shootings all together there are many preventative measures that can be taken such as: \n* Installing wireless panic alarms to alert law enforcement. \n* Limiting points of entry with security guarding them. \n* Strategically placing telephones for emergencies so police are always reachable at any point in the campus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Robert|last2=Duplechain|first2=Rosalind|title=New Ways To Stop Bullying|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=2002|volume=33|issue=9|pages=64}}</ref>\n* Employing school psychologists to monitor and provide mental health services for those that need help.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf|title=Now Is The Time|website=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n* Coordinating a response plan between local police and schools in the event of a threat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Deadly Dreams|last=Robertz|first=Frank|date=August 1, 2007|work=Scientific American|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 research report published by the Center for Homicide Research, they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the \"[[weapons effect]]\", which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. \"In Berkowitz & LaPage's (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students' performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks. This finding points to possible negative outcomes for students exposed to guns in the classroom (Simons & Turner, 1974; Turner & Simons, 1976).\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2008, [[Harrold Independent School District]] in [[Texas]] became the first public school district in the U.S. to allow teachers with state-issued firearm-carry permits to carry their arms in the classroom; special additional training and ricochet-resistant ammunition were required for participating teachers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/29texas.html?scp=2&sq=gun+control&st=nyt |first=James C. |last=McKinley Jr. |title=In Texas School, Teachers Carry Books and Guns |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 28, 2008}}</ref> Students at the [[University of Utah]] have been allowed to carry [[concealed carry|concealed pistols]] (so long as they possess the appropriate state license) since a [[State Supreme Court]] decision in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/27/america/NA-GEN-US-Campus-Guns.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219151807/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/27/america/NA-GEN-US-Campus-Guns.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 19, 2008 |title=Guns on college campuses allowed in U.S. state Utah |agency=The Associated Press |newspaper=[[Int.

According to Katherine A. Fowler, PhD, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average 1,297 children die (two children per 100,000) and 5,790 are treated for injuries caused by guns each year, the study reported. Six percent of these deaths were accidental, 38% were suicides, 53% were homicides and the remaining 3% were from legal intervention or undetermined reasons. Guns injured children at a rate of 8 per 100,000 children, but this rate is likely considerably higher because of unreported injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/06/19/american-denial-about-facts-on-guns-continues-to-kill-children/#38cd87354a9a|title=Children Are Dying Because Of Americans' Denial About Guns|last=Tara|first=Haelle|date=Jun 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA preventive measure proposed for stopping school shooting has been focused on securing firearms in the home. A shooting in [[Sparks, Nevada]] on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter's home. [[Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in Newtown, [[Red Lake High School]] in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and [[Heath High School (Kentucky)|Heath High School]] in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.\n\nA 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that \"from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place\". 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place. In 2005 a study was done on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents' firearms.<ref>\"Preventing school shootings starts with gun safety at home\". ''Christian Science Monitor''. October 31, 2013.</ref>\n\nMost states have Child Access Prevention Laws \u2013 laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms. Each state varies in the degree of the severity of these laws. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. There is also a wide range of laws that fall in between the two extremes. One example is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury. An example of a weaker law is a law that enforces liability only in the event of reckless, knowing or deliberate behavior by the adult.<ref>{{cite web|author=Randich, Cheri|title=Description of State Child Access Prevention Laws.|publisher=Law & Justice|date=December 10, 2012|url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/LAW/Documents/SummaryOfStateChildAccessPreventionLaws.pdf|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}<</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the [[United States Secret Service]] released an analysis of targeted school violence, concluding the best practice for prevention was forming a \"multidisciplinary [[threat assessment]] team, in conjunction with the appropriate policies, tools, and training\".<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/data/protection/ntac/usss-analysis-of-targeted-school-violence.pdf |title=Protecting America's Schools: A U.S. Secret Service Analysis of Targeted School Violence |date=November 2019 |publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security |author=National Threat Assessment Center, United States Secret Service |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> An earlier report published in 2018 concluded there was no single profile of a student attacker, and emphasized the importance of the threat assessment process instead.

[[V1073 Orionis]] is a B9.5 [[Orion variable]] that forms an equilateral triangle with \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Ori B and C.\n\nBizarrely, \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis C has a second entry in the Washington Double Star Catalog under the name S490.  The companion is 10th magnitude and actually lies between \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Ori B and V1073 Ori.<ref name=wds/>\n\n\u03b8<sup>1</sup> Orionis, the well known Trapezium cluster, is only 2 arc minutes away from \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis A.

The [[Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars]] includes the stars of \u03b8<sup>1</sup> and \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Ori within the same system of 13 components.\n\nThere are dozens of much fainter stars in the same field, many of them [[pre-main-sequence star]]s still forming from the [[Orion Molecular Cloud Complex]].\n\n==Properties==\nThe primary component A appears as a 5th magnitude O class [[subgiant]] over 100,000 times as luminous as the sun.  The spectral type suggests it is evolving away from the [[main sequence]], although it is thought to be less than 2 million years old.  The spectral peculiarities may be related to close companions or could be caused by the extreme youth of the star.\n\nThe 6th magnitude component B is an early B main sequence star nearly 30,000 K and over 10,000 times the luminosity of the sun.\n\nComponent C is another B class main sequence star, but cooler and less than a thousand times the luminosity of the sun.\n\n==\u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis A system==\n\u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis A is itself a [[triple star]] system.  Its spectral lines were seen to change position periodically, indicating orbital motion.  The first orbit was derived in 1924, indicating a period of 21 days. and a rather eccentric orbit.<ref name=struve>{{cite journal|bibcode=1924ApJ....60..159S|title=The orbit of the spectroscopic binary 43 theta-2 Orionis|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=60|pages=159|author1=Struve|first1=O.|year=1924|doi=10.1086/142845}}</ref>\n\n[[Speckle interferometry]] has resolved a companion about 0.3\" away, around 147 AU.

Both companions are thought to be early A or late B with masses of {{solar mass|7-9}}.  This helps to explain the high mass and visual luminosity for an O9.5 star at this distance.

[[V1073 Orionis]] is a B9.5 [[Orion variable]] that forms an equilateral triangle with \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Ori B and C.\n\nBizarrely, \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis C has a second entry in the Washington Double Star Catalog under the name S490.  The companion is 10th magnitude and actually lies between \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Ori B and V1073 Ori.<ref name=wds/>\n\n\u03b8<sup>1</sup> Orionis, the well known Trapezium cluster, is only 2 arc minutes away from \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis A.  Despite the names, \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis A is marginally brighter than the brightest star in the Trapezium.  The [[Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars]] includes the stars of \u03b8<sup>1</sup> and \u03b8<sup>2</sup> Ori within the same system of 13 components.\n\nThere are dozens of much fainter stars in the same field, many of them [[pre-main-sequence star]]s still forming from the [[Orion Molecular Cloud Complex]].\n\n==Properties==\nThe primary component A appears as a 5th magnitude O class [[subgiant]] over 100,000 times as luminous as the sun.  The spectral type suggests it is evolving away from the [[main sequence]], although it is thought to be less than 2 million years old.  The spectral peculiarities may be related to close companions or could be caused by the extreme youth of the star.\n\nThe 6th magnitude component B is an early B main sequence star nearly 30,000 K and over 10,000 times the luminosity of the sun.\n\nComponent C is another B class main sequence star, but cooler and less than a thousand times the luminosity of the sun.\n\n==\u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis A system==\n\u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis A is itself a [[triple star]] system.  Its spectral lines were seen to change position periodically, indicating orbital motion.  The first orbit was derived in 1924, indicating a period of 21 days. and a rather eccentric orbit.<ref name=struve>{{cite journal|bibcode=1924ApJ....60..159S|title=The orbit of the spectroscopic binary 43 theta-2 Orionis|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=60|pages=159|author1=Struve|first1=O.|year=1924|doi=10.1086/142845}}</ref>\n\n[[Speckle interferometry]] has resolved a companion about 0.3\" away, around 147 AU.  High resolution spectroscopy shows that there is an even closer companion, only about 0.47 AU from the primary, for a total of three stars.  Both companions are thought to be early A or late B with masses of {{solar mass|7-9}}.  This helps to explain the high mass and visual luminosity for an O9.5 star at this distance.  The three stars together have nearly the same mass as the O5.5 \u03b8<sup>1</sup> Orionis C and visually are even brighter.<ref name=schulz>{{cite journal|bibcode=2006ApJ...653..636S|arxiv=astro-ph/0608420|title=X-Ray Variability in the Young Massive Triple \u03b82 Orionis A|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=653|pages=636|author1=Schulz|first1=Norbert S.|last2=Testa|first2=Paola|last3=Huenemoerder|first3=David P.|last4=Ishibashi|first4=Kazunori|last5=Canizares|first5=Claude R.|year=2006|doi=10.1086/508625}}</ref>\n\n\u03b8<sup>2</sup> Orionis A also shows unexplained rapidly variable x-ray emission.  The x-rays cannot be explained standard mechanisms such as [[Colliding-wind binary|colliding winds]] or [[corona]]l emissions from an unseen companion.<ref name=\"mitschang\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Stars of Orion}}\n\n[[Category:Orion (constellation)]]\n[[Category:B-type main-sequence stars]]\n[[Category:Bayer objects|Orionis, Theta2]]\n[[Category:O-type subgiants]]\n[[Category:Orion variables]]\n[[Category:Triple star systems|3]]\n[[Category:Hipparcos objects|026235]]\n[[Category:HR objects|1897]]\n[[Category:Henry Draper Catalogue objects|037041]]\n[[Category:Durchmusterung objects]]\n[[Category:Flamsteed objects|Orionis, 43]]\n[[Category:Objects with variable star designations|Orionis, V361]]\n", "name_user": "Netoholic", "label": "safe", "comment": "post-move link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta2_Orionis"}

Compared to [[Hindu temple architecture]] and [[Indo-Saracenic architecture]] there was traditionally much more use of wood rather than stone, though today brick and concrete are more typical, and Indian versions of Western styles dominate in recent buildings.  \n\n==Categories==\n[[File:Jaisalmer-Patwon Ki Haveli-06-2018-gje.jpg|thumb| Sandstone [[Haveli]] with jharokha windows.]]\n[[Image:Toda Hut.JPG|thumb|A [[Toda people|Toda]] tribal hut, often compared to ancient [[Gavaksha]] roof and arch.]]\nIndian vernacular architecture has evolved organically over time through the skillful craftsmanship of the local people. Despite the diversity, this architecture can be broadly divided into three categories.\n====Kachcha====\nA ''kachcha'' is a building made of natural materials such as [[mud]] plaster, [[bamboo]], [[thatch]] and [[wood]] and is therefore a short-lived structure.  Since it is not made for endurance it requires constant maintenance and replacement. The practical limitations of the building materials available dictate the specific form which can have a simple beauty. The advantage of a ''kachcha'' is that construction materials are cheap and easily available and relatively little labor is required.\n\n====Pukka====\nA pakka is a structure made from materials resistant to wear, such as forms of stone or brick, clay tiles, metal or other durable materials, sometimes using mortar to bind, that does not need to be constantly maintained or replaced. However, such structures are expensive to construct as the materials are costly and more labor is required. A pakka (or sometimes \"pukka\") may be elaborately decorated in contrast to a kachcha.\n\n====Semi-Pukka====\nA combination of the ''kachcha'' and ''pukka'' style, the semi-''pukka'', has evolved as villagers have acquired the resources to add elements constructed of the durable materials characteristic of a ''pukka''. Architecture as always evolves organically as the needs and resources of people change. Majority of traditional vernacular architecture falls under semi-pukka.\n\n==Regional variation==\nBuilding material depends on location. In hilly country where rocky rubble, [[ashlar]], and pieces of stone are available,  these can be patched together with a mud mortar to form walls. Finer stonework veneer covers the outside. Sometimes wood beams and rafters are used with slate tiles for roofing if available. Houses on hills usually have two stories, with the livestock living on the ground floor. Often a [[verandah]] runs along the side of the house. The roof is pitched to deal with the monsoon season and the house may sit on raised platform, plinths or bamboo poles to cope with floods.\n\nOn the flat lands, adobes are usually made of mud or sun-baked bricks, then plastered inside and out, sometimes with mud mixed with hay or even cow dung and whitewashed with lime.\n\nWhere bamboo is available it is widely used for all parts of the home as it is flexible and resilient. Also widely used is [[thatch]] from plants such as elephant grass, paddy, and coconut. In the south, clay tiles are used for ''pukka'' roofing while various plant material such as coconut palm is common for the ''Kamchatka''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pole 42.jpg|Traditional decoration on wooden windows.\nFile:Pole 38.jpg|Outside of wooden ''pol'' house, Gujarat\nFile:WOODEN HAVELI.jpg|Wooden carving outside Pol house, brick & wood joinery walls with lime plaster, Gujarat\nFile:Patwon ki Haveli Jaisalmer.jpg|Rows of sandstone haveli in Rajasthan.\nFile:Kathavate Wada in Wai.jpg|Wooden ''Wada'' house courtyard, Mahatrastra.\nFile:\u0cae\u0ca8\u0cc6 \u0c85\u0c82\u0c97\u0cb3 \u0ca4\u0cc1\u0cb3\u0cb8\u0cbf \u0c95\u0c9f\u0ccd\u0c9f\u0cc6.JPG|Traditional house in southern India with courtyard.\nFile:Room At Dakshinchitra.jpg|Kitchen in southern India house, lime plaster and stone floor.\nFile:Chettinad house courtyard.jpg|Merchent Chettinad mansion in Tamil Nadu\nFile:Chettinad Mansion Kanadukathan.jpg|Row of wooden pillars and carving in Chettinad house, Tamil Nadu\nFile:Mandawa Sneh Ram Ladias Haveli - Supraporte 4.jpg|Ornamentation on wooden door, Gujarat.\nFile:Haveli in Phalodi, Rajasthan.jpg|Ornate jharokha windows.\nFile:Jodhpur Mehrangarh - Palast 4a Jharokha.jpg|Ornate jharoka with 'Do-chala' slooping roof\nFile:House construction bamboo wall IMG 8946.jpg|Construction of bamboo wall in Northeast India.\nFile:Naga hut.jpg|Reconsurtiton of Naga hut, Nagaland.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Architecture of India]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last= Thapar|first= Bindia|title= Introduction to Indian Architecture|year=2004|publisher= Periplus Editions|location= Singapore|isbn= 0-7946-0011-5}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090919051334/http://www.ethnoarchitecture.com/web/articles/article/06V29-01arts What is Vernacular Architecture?
