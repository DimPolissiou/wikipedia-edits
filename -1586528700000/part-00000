In 1947, Rabbi [[Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl|Michael Dov Weissmandl]] bought the Brewster estate in nearby [[Mount Kisco]] and moved the Nitra Yeshiva there to create a self-sustaining agricultural community known as the \"Yeshiva Farm Settlement\". At first this settlement wasn't welcomed by its neighbors, but in a town hall meeting, Mrs. Baldwin, impressed by Rabbi Weissmandl, defended its establishment and wrote a letter-to-the-editor to the ''New York Times'' regarding it. She eventually was instrumental in even getting its neighbors to donate to the Yeshiva. In this settlement which is now called the Nitra Community, she is fondly remembered for her valor and kindheartedness.\n\nBaldwin died in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]] on November 13, 1991.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Robert B.

That year, he spent four months in Europe reporting on the military preparedness for what was viewed as the coming war. One of his first major stories in 1938 was of the [[Interception of the Rex|interception of the ocean liner ''Rex'']] by U.S. [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es, in which he personally participated.\n\n==Career==\nDuring [[World War II]] he wrote from the South Pacific, North Africa and Europe.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070517080541/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1095237.html Hanson W.

They had two children; Barbara Potter and Elizabeth Crabtree. The Baldwins lived in [[Chappaqua]], New York. In 1947, Rabbi [[Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl|Michael Dov Weissmandl]] bought the Brewster estate in nearby [[Mount Kisco]] and moved the Nitra Yeshiva there to create a self-sustaining agricultural community known as the \"Yeshiva Farm Settlement\". At first this settlement wasn't welcomed by its neighbors, but in a town hall meeting, Mrs. Baldwin, impressed by Rabbi Weissmandl, defended its establishment and wrote a letter-to-the-editor to the ''New York Times'' regarding it. She eventually was instrumental in even getting its neighbors to donate to the Yeshiva. In this settlement which is now called the Nitra Community, she is fondly remembered for her valor and kindheartedness.\n\nBaldwin died in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]] on November 13, 1991.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Robert B.

It is surrounded by large tracts of forest and heathland. The nearest big towns are [[L\u00fcneburg]] (60&nbsp;km north), [[Soltau]] (30&nbsp;km west), [[Uelzen]] (45&nbsp;km east) and [[Celle]] (32&nbsp;km south). The two rivers, the [[Wietze (\u00d6rtze)|Wietze]] and the [[\u00d6rtze]] merge in M\u00fcden.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Mueden (Oertze) Heidesee.jpg|thumb|The Heidesee lake. View of the eastern shore]]\n[[File:\u00d6rtzeWietzeZus.jpg|thumb|Confluence of the Wietze (left) and \u00d6rtze]]\nThe great [[Hermannsburg]] pastor, revivalist and local historian, [[Ludwig Harms]], believed there to be a shrine to the god, [[Thor]] at the confluence of the Wietze and \u00d6rtze rivers that, according to M\u00fcden historian Ernst Sch\u00fctze, still existed around AD 800. In any case the Christianity had reached the area by the end of the 8th century and, according to Harms, there was already a wooden church in M\u00fcden in 866. The earliest written record of the village goes back to the year 1022. In the deed of gift by the Bishop of Hildesheim, [[Bernward of Hildesheim|Bernward]], dated 1 November 1022 for the abbey of [[St. Michael (Hildesheim)|St. Michael]] in Hildesheim is the following statement: ''item Mutha in pago Muthiwide'' (\"likewise M\u00fcden in the sub-district (''Untergau'') of M\u00fcndungswald\"). ''Muthiwide'', the Latinized form of the Old Saxon term ''Muthiwiddi'' (Muth = mouth) refers to the name of a sub-district in the Loingau. [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaus]] were established during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] around 793 as regional administrative units. The settlement of M\u00fcden was located on the border of the Loingau, which stretched from the area around the lower Leine river to the Sothriet, Rodau and \u00d6rtze, and had a northern border with the Bardengau. Until the middle of the 15th century the history of M\u00fcden was linked to the neighbouring village of [[Hermannsburg]], with which it formed a common parish until 1440. The region was ruled by the House of [[Billung]] until the line died out, it then went over to the [[House of Welf|Guelphs]] and until 1866 belonged to the House of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced into M\u00fcden in 1530 by order of [[Ernest the Confessor]]. The population at that time was 119.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nLittle is known about the damage caused in M\u00fcden by the [[Thirty Years War]]. From parish bills during the years 1638 to 1650 it can however be deduced that there was destruction and plundering, because damage to the church had to be repaired and new [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] items procured. In addition, the largest church bell was cracked and had to be recast.\n\nIn 1839, on the introduction of land reforms in the Kingdom of Hanover, it became possible for the M\u00fcden farmers to release themselves from their [[manorial duties]]. To do that they had to pay twenty-five times the annual tax as a release fee. Only the M\u00fcllerhof and the Martenshof were able to raise this themselves, the other farms had to continue to pay manorial dues for a long time thereafter. However this did not affect the expansion of the village. The number of inhabitants grew steadily: in 1821 there were 333, in 1890, 580. In 1852 the cemetery around the church, where there were already up to five graves layered one above the other, was closed and a new one laid out north of the village.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hanover had become a [[Prussia]]n province in 1866, and M\u00fcden became part of the district of [[Landkreis Celle|Celle]] following the district reforms of 1885. At the same time there began a gradual change in emphasis away from a pure farming village into a summer retreat. Tourism was promoted by the narratives of the writer [[Hermann L\u00f6ns]] and Richard Linde, who also drew other authors like Felicitas Rose and Diedrich Speckmann as well as the painter Fritz Flebbe to M\u00fcden. Rose and Flebbe are buried in M\u00fcden. In 1889 the ''Gasthof zur Post'' inn was opened, which grew into a busy hotel in the years that followed (today's ''Posthotel''). Another boost for tourism was the opening of the ''[[Kleinbahn]]'' railway from Celle to Munster on 23 April 1910, with a station at M\u00fcden, together with the junction to Hanover. In 1913 the electrification of the village began.\n\n=== Later modern period ===\nFor M\u00fcden the [[First World War]] saw the arrival of refugees from [[East Prussia]], the billeting of the 78th Infantry Regiment and the quartering of French and Belgian [[prisoners-of-war]]. At the end of the war, M\u00fcden itself had lost 22 soldiers. In the interwar years, tourism again became important. The number of inhabitants continued to grow and reached 822 in 1928. In 1938 the registered population was 1,162. In 1931 a youth hostel was opened; whose original [[Bauhaus]] style was heavily contested. From 1940 the youth hostel had to act as a military hospital.\n\nFrom 1944 the M\u00fcden population endured frequent air raid alarms, in response to British bombers attacking the nearby airfield at Fa\u00dfberg. On 14 April 1945 British troops advanced towards the bridges over the \u00d6rtze. When a German detachment blew up the bridge over the Wietze in front of them, British tanks that were already in the area opened fire on the village, setting alight and destroying several houses. Not until 1949 was the last damage repaired. As a result of accepting refugees from Germany's eastern territories the number of villagers had grown by 1946 to 1,746. In 1949 new streets were laid out for M\u00fcden's new citizens. In 1954, a larger cemetery was laid out on the eastern edge of the village. In 1965 the corn mill and [[sawmill]] were closed and, in 1993, the buildings were turned into a tourist and cultural centre. In order to improve the attraction of M\u00fcden, a deer park was established in 1971 and, in 1976, the \u00d6rtze was partially diverted to create an artificial lake, the ''Heidesee'' (Heath Lake). It covers an area of {{convert|6.5|ha|acre}} and is used for [[sailing]], [[angling]] and walking. With its concentration on tourism, the character of the village had completely changed inside 60 years: in 1995 there were only four agricultural concerns left in the village. Today the place advertises itself as the \"Pearl of the [[S\u00fcdheide]]\".\n\nIn 1973 M\u00fcden was absorbed into the collective municipality of Fa\u00dfberg and, on 1 January 1977 became fully incorporated into the new [[Fa\u00dfberg]] municipality. The last ''[[B\u00fcrgermeister]]'' of M\u00fcden was G\u00fcnther H. Wilmsen, who held office from 1973 to 1976.\n\n=== Economy ===\n\n==== Farming ====\nAt the beginning of the 11th century the first agricultural [[farmsteads]] appeared at the [[confluence]] of the Wietze and \u00d6rtze, such as the M\u00fcllerhof, the Martenshof and the Renkenhof, which still exist today near the church, albeit fulfilling different roles (''inter alia'' the Hotel Bauernwald). M\u00fcden had its first chapel in 1185, although it belonged to [[Hermannsburg]]. Construction on the [[Church of St. Lawrence, M\u00fcden|Church of St. Lawrence]] started in 1189 and it was completed in 1217. Not until 1444 was the parish finally separated from Hermannsburg and the village was given its own priest.\n[[File:Muedenkirche.jpg|thumb|[[Church of St. Lawrence, M\u00fcden|St. Lawrence Church]]]]\n\nFor the year 1589 we have the first reliable report about the [[farmsteads]] in M\u00fcden thanks to a tax list, the so-called ''Schatzregister'' (treasury register). This recorded that, at that time, there were six full and two half farmsteads and five so-called ''Kotenh\u00f6fe'' or cottages. Their owners had 483 sheep, 254 cattle, 92 pigs and 24 horses between them. Almost every farm also had one or more beehives. But the tax record of 1589 says nothing about the farmers' land; the first information about that appears in 1770. By then, there were twelve farms with a total of {{convert|151|ha|acre}} of land, the M\u00fcllerhof with {{convert|22|ha|acre}} owning the largest acreage. The keeping of moorland sheep (''[[Heidschnucke]]n''), typical of the region, had expanded in almost 200 years to 1,040 animals. In the years that followed, agriculture continued to be important. In 1867 there were 28 farms, but numbers reached a zenith in 1936 with 98 farms.\n\n==== Log rafting ====\nIn addition to agriculture, [[log rafting]] was also carried out on the River \u00d6rtze until 1912. Trees were felled in the nearby forests; the logs were tied together into rafts and transported downriver via the Aller to Bremen. At its peak in the last quarter of the 19th century almost 2,000 timber rafts were floated downriver each year.\n\n==== Mills ====\n[[File:M\u00fcdenM\u00fchle.jpg|thumb|Former mill in M\u00fcden, with a turbine house (left) and fish bypass (front)]]\n[[File:StromerzgFrancisTurbine.jpg|thumb|Display board on the working principle of electricity generation using a Francis shaft turbine]]\nFrom the records it is known that there was already a [[corn mill]] on the \u00d6rtze in 1438, which was driven by water power. In  1465 Ole M\u00fcller, owner of the M\u00fcllerhof was awarded royal mill rights by the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]. Around 1621 a mill was built on the spot where today the mill building dating to 1913 now stands. The mill was in service until 1973. From 1993 to 1997 the building was renovated and, today, it houses the tourist information bureau, a bookshop, a wedding room and exhibition rooms.\n\nIn an outbuilding there are two [[Francis turbine|Francis shaft turbines]] for the generation of electricity. One turbine is still in operation and has an output of 7 [[kW]]. Until 1959 electricity was generated to operate the grain mill. Today it is primarily used to supply the mill building. The superfluous electricity is fed into the public electricity network. A near-natural [[fishway]] has been laid to bypass the weir.\n\n==== Other trades ====\nFrom the middle of the 18th century the farms in the village employed many tradesmen, such as [[cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[blacksmith|smiths]], [[carpentry|carpenters]] and [[shoemaking|shoemakers]], in order to be able to use their services more cheaply than by using craftsmen from outside the village.\n\n== Local politics ==\nAccording to Lower Saxony's municipal regulations, villages that are part of another village's municipality must choose either to elect representatives (''Ortsr\u00e4te'') on the municipal council or to nominate a local parish council leader (''Ortsvorsteher'') for the duration of the voting period. The parish of Fa\u00dfberg has decided that the villages should elect their own parish council leaders. Since 1977 M\u00fcden has elected the following leaders:\n* 1977\u20131989 G\u00fcnther H. Wilmsen\n* 1989\u20132006 master painter Otto Schaper\n* November 2006 \u2013 present regular officer Volker Nickel\n\n== Sights ==\nEach year, on the second Thursday in July, the moorland sheep (''Heidschnucke'') auction takes place. The strongest young rams are presented to the breeders and spectators and the best animals win prizes. The Heidschnucke rams can be bid for at the accompanying auction.\n\nOn the second Sunday in September a mill festival (''M\u00fchlenfest'') is held at the old mill.\n\nNorth of the village there is a natural monument, an ancient oak, known as the ''Hillige Eeke'' (holy oak), which is over 600 years old. It was probably used as a ''Gerichtsbaum'', a tree under which regular court sessions were held.\n\n<gallery>\n  File:Heidschnuckentag A2005.jpg|The Heidschucke rams are assessed\n  File:Heidschnuckentag B2005.jpg|The young rams are awarded prizes\n  File:HilligeEekeM\u00fcden.jpg|The Holy Oak (''Hillige Eeke'') near M\u00fcden/\u00d6rtze <small>{{Coord|52|52|54.98|N|10|06|47.31|E|type:landmark_region:DE-NI|display=inline}}</small>\n</gallery>\n\n== Sport ==\nThe local sports club, MTV M\u00fcden/\u00d6rtze, founded in 1913, runs a variety of sports including the triathlon, handball, endurance sports, cycling, gymnastics, leisure pursuits and swimming.

It is surrounded by large tracts of forest and heathland. The nearest big towns are [[L\u00fcneburg]] (60&nbsp;km north), [[Soltau]] (30&nbsp;km west), [[Uelzen]] (45&nbsp;km east) and [[Celle]] (32&nbsp;km south). The two rivers, the [[Wietze (\u00d6rtze)|Wietze]] and the [[\u00d6rtze]] merge in M\u00fcden.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Mueden (Oertze) Heidesee.jpg|thumb|The Heidesee lake. View of the eastern shore]]\n[[File:\u00d6rtzeWietzeZus.jpg|thumb|Confluence of the Wietze (left) and \u00d6rtze]]\nThe great [[Hermannsburg]] pastor, revivalist and local historian, [[Ludwig Harms]], believed there to be a shrine to the god, [[Thor]] at the confluence of the Wietze and \u00d6rtze rivers that, according to M\u00fcden historian Ernst Sch\u00fctze, still existed around AD 800. In any case the Christianity had reached the area by the end of the 8th century and, according to Harms, there was already a wooden church in M\u00fcden in 866. The earliest written record of the village goes back to the year 1022. In the deed of gift by the Bishop of Hildesheim, [[Bernward of Hildesheim|Bernward]], dated 1 November 1022 for the abbey of [[St. Michael (Hildesheim)|St. Michael]] in Hildesheim is the following statement: ''item Mutha in pago Muthiwide'' (\"likewise M\u00fcden in the sub-district (''Untergau'') of M\u00fcndungswald\"). ''Muthiwide'', the Latinized form of the Old Saxon term ''Muthiwiddi'' (Muth = mouth) refers to the name of a sub-district in the Loingau. [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaus]] were established during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] around 793 as regional administrative units. The settlement of M\u00fcden was located on the border of the Loingau, which stretched from the area around the lower Leine river to the Sothriet, Rodau and \u00d6rtze, and had a northern border with the Bardengau. Until the middle of the 15th century the history of M\u00fcden was linked to the neighbouring village of [[Hermannsburg]], with which it formed a common parish until 1440. The region was ruled by the House of [[Billung]] until the line died out, it then went over to the [[House of Welf|Guelphs]] and until 1866 belonged to the House of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced into M\u00fcden in 1530 by order of [[Ernest the Confessor]]. The population at that time was 119.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nLittle is known about the damage caused in M\u00fcden by the [[Thirty Years War]]. From parish bills during the years 1638 to 1650 it can however be deduced that there was destruction and plundering, because damage to the church had to be repaired and new [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] items procured. In addition, the largest church bell was cracked and had to be recast.\n\nIn 1839, on the introduction of land reforms in the Kingdom of Hanover, it became possible for the M\u00fcden farmers to release themselves from their [[manorial duties]]. To do that they had to pay twenty-five times the annual tax as a release fee. Only the M\u00fcllerhof and the Martenshof were able to raise this themselves, the other farms had to continue to pay manorial dues for a long time thereafter. However this did not affect the expansion of the village. The number of inhabitants grew steadily: in 1821 there were 333, in 1890, 580. In 1852 the cemetery around the church, where there were already up to five graves layered one above the other, was closed and a new one laid out north of the village.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hanover had become a [[Prussia]]n province in 1866, and M\u00fcden became part of the district of [[Landkreis Celle|Celle]] following the district reforms of 1885. At the same time there began a gradual change in emphasis away from a pure farming village into a summer retreat. Tourism was promoted by the narratives of the writer [[Hermann L\u00f6ns]] and Richard Linde, who also drew other authors like Felicitas Rose and Diedrich Speckmann as well as the painter Fritz Flebbe to M\u00fcden. Rose and Flebbe are buried in M\u00fcden. In 1889 the ''Gasthof zur Post'' inn was opened, which grew into a busy hotel in the years that followed (today's ''Posthotel''). Another boost for tourism was the opening of the ''[[Kleinbahn]]'' railway from Celle to Munster on 23 April 1910, with a station at M\u00fcden, together with the junction to Hanover. In 1913 the electrification of the village began.\n\n=== Later modern period ===\nFor M\u00fcden the [[First World War]] saw the arrival of refugees from [[East Prussia]], the billeting of the 78th Infantry Regiment and the quartering of French and Belgian [[prisoners-of-war]]. At the end of the war, M\u00fcden itself had lost 22 soldiers. In the interwar years, tourism again became important. The number of inhabitants continued to grow and reached 822 in 1928. In 1938 the registered population was 1,162. In 1931 a youth hostel was opened; whose original [[Bauhaus]] style was heavily contested. From 1940 the youth hostel had to act as a military hospital.\n\nFrom 1944 the M\u00fcden population endured frequent air raid alarms, in response to British bombers attacking the nearby airfield at Fa\u00dfberg. On 14 April 1945 British troops advanced towards the bridges over the \u00d6rtze. When a German detachment blew up the bridge over the Wietze in front of them, British tanks that were already in the area opened fire on the village, setting alight and destroying several houses. Not until 1949 was the last damage repaired. As a result of accepting refugees from Germany's eastern territories the number of villagers had grown by 1946 to 1,746. In 1949 new streets were laid out for M\u00fcden's new citizens. In 1954, a larger cemetery was laid out on the eastern edge of the village. In 1965 the corn mill and [[sawmill]] were closed and, in 1993, the buildings were turned into a tourist and cultural centre. In order to improve the attraction of M\u00fcden, a deer park was established in 1971 and, in 1976, the \u00d6rtze was partially diverted to create an artificial lake, the ''Heidesee'' (Heath Lake). It covers an area of {{convert|6.5|ha|acre}} and is used for [[sailing]], [[angling]] and walking. With its concentration on tourism, the character of the village had completely changed inside 60 years: in 1995 there were only four agricultural concerns left in the village. Today the place advertises itself as the \"Pearl of the [[S\u00fcdheide]]\".\n\nIn 1973 M\u00fcden was absorbed into the collective municipality of Fa\u00dfberg and, on 1 January 1977 became fully incorporated into the new [[Fa\u00dfberg]] municipality. The last ''[[B\u00fcrgermeister]]'' of M\u00fcden was G\u00fcnther H. Wilmsen, who held office from 1973 to 1976.\n\n=== Economy ===\n\n==== Farming ====\nAt the beginning of the 11th century the first agricultural [[farmsteads]] appeared at the [[confluence]] of the Wietze and \u00d6rtze, such as the M\u00fcllerhof, the Martenshof and the Renkenhof, which still exist today near the church, albeit fulfilling different roles (''inter alia'' the Hotel Bauernwald). M\u00fcden had its first chapel in 1185, although it belonged to [[Hermannsburg]]. Construction on the [[Church of St. Lawrence, M\u00fcden|Church of St. Lawrence]] started in 1189 and it was completed in 1217. Not until 1444 was the parish finally separated from Hermannsburg and the village was given its own priest.\n[[File:Muedenkirche.jpg|thumb|[[Church of St. Lawrence, M\u00fcden|St. Lawrence Church]]]]\n\nFor the year 1589 we have the first reliable report about the [[farmsteads]] in M\u00fcden thanks to a tax list, the so-called ''Schatzregister'' (treasury register).

At trials in 1857, which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons, Whitworth's design outperformed the Enfield at a rate of about three to one. Also, the Whitworth rifle was able to hit the target at a range of 2,000 yards, whereas the Enfield could only manage it at a distance of 1,400 yards.<ref>\"Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 19\" By Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain)</ref>  During the [[American Civil War]], the [[Whitworth Sharpshooters|Confederate sharpshooters equipped with Whitworth rifles]] were tasked to eliminate Union field artillery crews, and were responsible for killing [[John Sedgwick|Major General John Sedgwick]] \u2013 one of the highest-ranking officers killed during the Civil War \u2013 at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]].\n\nDuring the Crimean War, the first optical sights were designed for fitting onto the rifles. Much of this pioneering work was the brainchild of Colonel D. Davidson, using optical sights produced by [[Chance Brothers]] of [[Birmingham]]. This allowed a [[marksman]] to more accurately observe and target objects at a greater distance than ever before.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COCIaPM2_ksC&dq=Battle+of+Freeman%27s+Farm+sniping&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Out of Nowhere: A history of the military sniper, from the Sharpshooter to Afghanistan|author=Pegler, Martin|year=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref> The telescopic sight, or scope, was originally fixed and could not be adjusted, which therefore limited its range.

Military snipers and sharpshooters may also be required to carry their rifles and other equipment for long distances, making it important to minimize weight. Military organizations often operate under strict budget constraints, which influences the type and quality of sniper rifles they purchase.\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\nSniper rifles built or modified for use in law enforcement are generally required to have the greatest possible accuracy, but do not need to have as long a range.\n\nLaw enforcement-specific rifles are usually used in non-combat (often urban) environments, so they do not have the requirement to be as hardy or portable as military versions; therefore, they may be smaller, because they do not need very long range.\n\nSome of the first sniper rifles designed specifically to meet police and other law-enforcement requirements were developed for [[West Germany|West German]] police after the [[Munich massacre]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. Many police services and law enforcement organizations (such as the [[U.S. Secret Service]]) now use rifles designed for law enforcement purposes.\n\nThe [[Heckler & Koch PSG1]] is one rifle specifically designed to meet these criteria and is often referred to as an ideal example of this type of sniper rifle. The [[FN Special Police Rifle]] was built for, and is marketed to, law enforcement rather than military agencies.\n\n== Distinguishing characteristics ==\n[[File:Sniperscope.jpg|thumb|Looking through a telescopic sight.]]\n[[File:Pso-1 grid.png|thumb|[[PSO-1]] Sniper Scope Reticle<br>\n1 \u2013 Lead/deflection scale<br>\n2 \u2013 Main targeting chevron<br>\n3 \u2013 Bullet drop chevrons<br>\n4 \u2013 Rangefinder]]\nThe features of a sniper rifle can vary widely depending on the specific tasks it is intended to perform. Features that may distinguish a sniper rifle from other weapons are the presence of a [[telescopic sight]], unusually long overall length,<ref name=\"weaponlengthcountersniper\">''The Ultimate Sniper: an Advanced Training Manual for Military and Police Snipers'', [[John Plaster|Maj. John L. Plaster]], 1993. The information about counter-sniper operations describes techniques for identifying snipers amongst groups of other soldiers. The most easily recognizable feature of a sniper from a great distance is the fact that the sniper's rifle is longer than all the others.</ref> a stock designed for firing from a [[prone position]], and the presence of a [[bipod]] and other accessories.\n\n=== Telescopic sight ===\nThe single most important characteristic that sets a sniper rifle apart from other military or police small arms is the mounting of a [[telescopic sight]], which is relatively easy to distinguish from smaller optical aiming devices found on some modern [[assault rifle]]s and [[submachine gun]]s. \n\nThe telescopic sights used on sniper rifles differ from other optical sights in that they offer much greater magnification (more than 4\u00d7 and up to 40\u00d7), and have a much larger objective [[Lens (optics)|lens]] (40 to 50&nbsp;mm in diameter) for a brighter image.\n\nMost telescopic lenses employed in military or police roles have special [[reticle]]s to aid with judgment of distance, which is an important factor in accurate shot placement due to the bullet's trajectory.\n\n=== Action ===\nThe choice between [[bolt-action]] and [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], usually [[Recoil operation|recoil operated]] or [[Gas-operated|gas operated]] , is usually determined by specific requirements of the sniper's role in a particular organization, with each design having advantages and disadvantages. For a given cartridge, a bolt-action rifle is cheaper to build and maintain, more reliable, and lighter, due to fewer moving parts in the mechanism. In addition, the absence of uncontrolled automatic cartridge case ejection helps avoid revealing the shooter's position. Semi-automatic weapons can serve both as [[battle rifle]] and sniper rifle, and allow for a greater rate (and hence volume) of fire. As such rifles may be modified service rifles, an additional benefit can be commonality of operation with the issued infantry rifle. A bolt action is most commonly used in both military and police roles due to its higher accuracy and ease of maintenance. Anti-materiel applications such as mine clearing and [[special forces]] operations tend to use semi-automatics.\n[[File:Rackandchamber.jpg|thumb|A Marine manually extracts an empty cartridge and chambers a new 7.62\u00d751mm round in his bolt-action [[M40 rifle|M40A3]] sniper rifle. The bolt handle is held in the shooter's hand and is not visible in this photo.]]\n\nA [[designated marksman]] rifle [[Designated marksman rifle|(DMR)]] is less specialized than a typical military sniper rifle, often only intended to extend the range of a group of soldiers. Therefore, when a semi-automatic action is used it is due to its ability to cross over into roles similar to the roles of standard issue weapons. There may also be additional [[logistics|logistical]] advantages if the DMR uses the same ammunition as the more common standard issue weapons. These rifles enable a higher volume of fire, but sacrifice some long range accuracy. They are frequently built from existing [[selective fire]] [[battle rifle]]s or assault rifles, often simply by adding a telescopic sight and adjustable stock.\n\nA police semi-automatic sniper rifle may be used in situations that require a single sniper to engage multiple targets in quick succession, and military semi-automatics, such as the [[M110 SASS]], are used in similar \"target-rich\" environments.\n\n=== Magazine ===\nIn a military setting, logistical concerns are the primary determinant of the cartridge used, so sniper rifles are usually limited to rifle cartridges commonly used by the military force employing the rifle and [[match grade]] ammunition. Since large national militaries generally change slowly, military rifle ammunition is frequently battle-tested and well-studied by ammunition and firearms experts. Consequently, police forces tend to follow military practices in choosing a sniper rifle cartridge instead of trying to break new ground with less-perfected (but possibly better) ammunition.\n\nBefore the introduction of the standard [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (.308 Winchester) cartridge in the 1950s, standard military cartridges were the [[.30-06 Springfield]] or 7.62\u00d763mm (United States), [[.303 British]] (7.7\u00d756mmR) (United Kingdom) and [[7.92\u00d757 mm|7.92\u00d757mm]] (8mm Mauser Germany). The .30-06 Springfield continued in service with U.S. Marine Corps snipers during the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1970s, well after general adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm. At the present time, in both the [[Western world]] and within [[NATO]], [[7.62\u00d751mm]] is currently the primary cartridge of choice for military and police sniper rifles.\n\nWorldwide, the trend is similar. The preferred sniper cartridge in [[Russia]] is another .30 caliber military cartridge, the [[7.62\u00d754 mm R]], which has slightly superior performance to the 7.62\u00d751mm, although the rimmed design limits reliability compared to the latter cartridge. This cartridge was introduced in 1891, and both Russian sniper rifles of the modern era, the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] and the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]], are chambered for it.\n\nCertain commercial cartridges designed with only performance in mind, without the logistical constraints of most armies, have also gained popularity in the 1990s. These include the [[7 mm Remington Magnum]] (7.2\u00d764mm), [[.300 Winchester Magnum]] (7.8/7.62\u00d767mm), and the [[.338 Lapua Magnum]] (8.6\u00d770mm). These cartridges offer better ballistic performance and greater effective range than the 7.62\u00d751mm. Though they are not as powerful as .50 caliber cartridges, rifles chambered for these cartridges are not as heavy as those chambered for .50 caliber ammunition, and are significantly more powerful than rifles chambered for 7.62\u00d751mm.<ref>[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/Long%20Range%20Sniping.htm Cartridges for Long-Range Sniping Rifles by Anthony G Williams]</ref>\n\n[[File:M82rifle.jpg|thumb|[[M82 Barrett rifle|M82A1 SAMR or SASR]] (Special Applications Scoped Rifle or Semi-Automatic Anti Material Rifle), a .50 caliber anti material rifle used in a sniper rifle.]] Though not the typical role for the Barrett, it does have certain desirable long range characteristics.\n\nSnipers may also employ [[anti-materiel rifle]]s in sniping roles against targets such as vehicles, equipment and structures, or for the long-range destruction of explosive devices; these rifles may also be used against personnel.\n\nAnti-materiel rifles tend to be semi-automatic and of a larger caliber than other rifles, using cartridges such as the [[.50 BMG]], [[12.7\u00d7108mm|12.7\u00d7108mm Russian]] or even [[14.5\u00d7114mm|14.5\u00d7114mm Russian]] and [[20 mm caliber|20mm]]. These large cartridges are required to be able to fire projectiles containing payloads such as explosives, armor-piercing cores, incendiaries or combinations of these, such as the [[Raufoss Mk211]] projectile. Due to the considerable size and weight of anti-materiel rifles, two- or three-man sniper teams become necessary.\n\n=== Barrel ===\n[[Gun barrel|Barrel]]s are normally of precise manufacture and of a heavier cross section than more traditional barrels in order to reduce the change in impact points between a first shot from a cold barrel and a follow-up shot from a warm barrel. Unlike many battle and assault rifles, the bores are usually not chromed to avoid inaccuracy due to an uneven treatment.\n\nWhen installed, barrels are often ''free-floated'': i.e., installed so that the barrel contacts the rest of the rifle only at the receiver. A [[free-floating barrel]] avoids contact with the fore-end of the stock by the barrel itself, slings, bipods, or the sniper's hands that can interfere with barrel harmonics. The end of the barrel is usually crowned or machined to form a rebated area around the muzzle proper to avoid asymmetry or damage, and consequent inaccuracy.\n\nExternal longitudinal fluting that contributes to heat dissipation by increasing the surface area, while simultaneously decreasing the weight of the barrel, is sometimes used on sniper-rifle barrels.\n\nSniper-rifle barrels may also utilize a threaded muzzle or combination device ([[muzzle brake]] or [[flash suppressor]] and attachment mount) to allow the fitting of a [[sound suppressor]]. These suppressors often have a means of adjusting the point of impact while fitted.\n\nMilitary sniper rifles tend to have barrel lengths of 609.6&nbsp;mm (24&nbsp;inches) or longer, to allow the cartridge propellant to fully burn, reducing the amount of revealing muzzle flash and increasing muzzle velocity. Police sniper rifles may use shorter barrels to improve handling characteristics. The shorter barrels' muzzle velocity loss is unimportant at closer ranges; the impact velocity of the bullet is more than sufficient.\n\n=== Stock ===\nThe most common special feature of a sniper rifle [[stock (firearms)|stock]] is the adjustable cheek piece, where the shooter's cheek meets the rear of the stock. For most rifles equipped with a telescopic sight, this area is raised slightly, because the telescope is positioned higher than [[iron sights]]. A cheek piece is simply a section of the stock that can be adjusted up or down to suit the individual shooter. To further aid this individual fitting, the stock can sometimes also be adjusted for length, often by varying the number of inserts at the rear of the stock where it meets the shooter's shoulder. If the stock is manufactured from wood, environmental conditions or operational use may [[wood warping|warp the wood]], which may cause slight alignment or barrel harmonics changes over time, altering the point of impact. Stocks manufactured from polymers and metal alloys are less susceptible to point of impact shifting by environmental conditions. Sniper stocks are typically designed to avoid making contact with the barrel of the weapon and minimize the effects of environmental inconstancies. Modern sniper rifle stocks tend to be designed around a rigid chassis, offer user adjustability to allow shooters of various sizes and shapes to tailor the stock to their personal preferences and modular attachment points to provide flexibility to utilize (future) low light and day light aiming optics, laser designators, and other accessories without the need for custom made mounting interface kits.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:L42A1-Large.png|[[L42A1]] <small>(1970)</small> with classic shaped wooden stock with cheek-rising piece and free floating barrel.

Since sniper rifles of this class must compete with several other types of military weapons with similar range, snipers invariably must employ skilled [[fieldcraft]] to conceal their position.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe recent trend in specialized military sniper rifles is towards larger calibers that offer relatively favorable hit probabilities at greater range with anti-personnel cartridges such as the [[.300 Winchester Magnum]] and the [[.338 Lapua Magnum]] and anti-materiel cartridges such as the [[12.7\u00d799mm]], [[12.7\u00d7108mm]], and the [[14.5\u00d7114mm]]. This allows snipers to take fewer risks, and spend less time finding concealment when facing enemies that are not equipped with similar weapons.\n\nMaximum range claims made by military organizations and materiel manufacturers regarding sniper weapon systems are not based on consistent or strictly scientific criteria. The problem is only the bullet interacts after a relatively long flight path with the target (which can also be a materiel target for a sniper bullet). This implies that variables such as the minimal required hit probability, local atmospheric conditions, properties and velocity of the employed bullet (parts), properties of the target and the desired terminal effect are major relevant factors that determine the maximum effective range of the employed system.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of sniper rifles]]\n* [[Longest recorded sniper kills]]\n* [[Long range shooting]]\n\n;Related military roles\n* [[Designated marksman]]\n* [[Scout Sniper]]\n* [[Sniper]]\n\n;Related military weapons\n* [[Anti-materiel rifle]]\n* [[Anti-tank rifle]]\n* [[Assault rifle]]\n* [[Battle rifle]]\n* [[Carbine|Carbine rifle]]\n* [[Designated marksman rifle]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book|author=Tobias, Ronald|title=They Shoot to Kill: A Psycho-History of Criminal Sniping|publisher=Paladin Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|year=1981|isbn=0-87364-207-4}}\n* {{cite book|author=De Haas, Frank|title=Bolt Action Rifles|publisher=Krause Publications|location=|year=1995|isbn=0-87349-168-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/Bolt_Action_Rifles_3rd_Edition}}\n* {{cite book|author=Lebleu, Jon|title=Long Rifle: One Man's Deadly Sniper Missions in Iraq and Afghanistan|publisher=The Lyons Press|location=Guilford|year=2008|isbn=978-1599214405}}\n* {{cite book|author=Pegler, Martin|title=Out of Nowhere: A History of the Military Sniper|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2004|isbn=978-1846031403}}\n* {{cite book|author=Pegler, Martin|title=Sniper Rifles: From the 19th to the 21st Century|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2010|isbn=978-1849083980}}\n* {{cite journal|author=|title=Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain)|volume= 19|year=1860}}\n* {{cite journal|author=Raudzens, George|title=War-Winning Weapons: The Measurement of Technological Determinism in Military History|journal=The Journal of Military History|volume=54|year=1990|pages=403\u2013434|issue=4}}\n* {{cite journal|author=|title=Telescopic Sights for Rifles|publisher=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|year=1916|page=765|issue=2891}}\n* {{cite web|author=Popenker, Max|title=Modern Sniper Rifles|year=2001|url=http://modernfirearms.net/en/modern-sniper-rifles/}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Sniper rifles}}\n* [http://world.guns.ru/sniper/sn00-e.htm Modern Firearms list of sniper rifles]\n* [http://www.snipercentral.com/rifles.htm SniperCentral list of sniper rifles]\n* [http://www.tacticaloperations.com/swatapril2000/index.html Tack Driving Tactical Rifle from Tac Ops]{{snd}}Detailed overview of the accurization process for a .25 MOA rifle\n* [http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/ Detailed accuracy articles], by barrel maker [[Dan Lilja]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070310210955/http://www.thedarkpaladin.com/russiansnipers.htm Detail of Russian snipers and sniper rifles of World War Two by Chris Eger, military historian]\n* [http://demigodllc.com/articles/practical-long-range-rifle-shooting-equipment/ demigodllc.com: Practical long-range rifle shooting]\n* [http://video.foxnews.com/v/4836265467001/guns-101-sniper-rifles/?#sp=show-clips Five-minute Sniper 101 Tutorial, Colonial Days to Present]\n* [http://getrussia.com/articles/russian_rifles/ Russian will soon have a new sniper rifle 'the Tochnost']\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sniper Rifle}}\n[[Category:Sniper rifles| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:M24-Sniper-Weapon-System.jpg|thumb|The bolt-action [[7.62\u00d751mm]] [[M24 Sniper Weapon System]] is capable of 0.5 [[Minute of angle|MOA]] accuracy to maximal effective range of about 800 meters.

His rifle was far more accurate than the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]], which had shown some weaknesses during the recent [[Crimean War]].  At trials in 1857, which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons, Whitworth's design outperformed the Enfield at a rate of about three to one. Also, the Whitworth rifle was able to hit the target at a range of 2,000 yards, whereas the Enfield could only manage it at a distance of 1,400 yards.<ref>\"Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 19\" By Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain)</ref>  During the [[American Civil War]], the [[Whitworth Sharpshooters|Confederate sharpshooters equipped with Whitworth rifles]] were tasked to eliminate Union field artillery crews, and were responsible for killing [[John Sedgwick|Major General John Sedgwick]] \u2013 one of the highest-ranking officers killed during the Civil War \u2013 at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]].\n\nDuring the Crimean War, the first optical sights were designed for fitting onto the rifles.

Military snipers and sharpshooters may also be required to carry their rifles and other equipment for long distances, making it important to minimize weight. Military organizations often operate under strict budget constraints, which influences the type and quality of sniper rifles they purchase.\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\nSniper rifles built or modified for use in law enforcement are generally required to have the greatest possible accuracy, but do not need to have as long a range.\n\nLaw enforcement-specific rifles are usually used in non-combat (often urban) environments, so they do not have the requirement to be as hardy or portable as military versions; therefore, they may be smaller, because they do not need very long range.\n\nSome of the first sniper rifles designed specifically to meet police and other law-enforcement requirements were developed for [[West Germany|West German]] police after the [[Munich massacre]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. Many police services and law enforcement organizations (such as the [[U.S. Secret Service]]) now use rifles designed for law enforcement purposes.\n\nThe [[Heckler & Koch PSG1]] is one rifle specifically designed to meet these criteria and is often referred to as an ideal example of this type of sniper rifle. The [[FN Special Police Rifle]] was built for, and is marketed to, law enforcement rather than military agencies.\n\n== Distinguishing characteristics ==\n[[File:Sniperscope.jpg|thumb|Looking through a telescopic sight.]]\n[[File:Pso-1 grid.png|thumb|[[PSO-1]] Sniper Scope Reticle<br>\n1 \u2013 Lead/deflection scale<br>\n2 \u2013 Main targeting chevron<br>\n3 \u2013 Bullet drop chevrons<br>\n4 \u2013 Rangefinder]]\nThe features of a sniper rifle can vary widely depending on the specific tasks it is intended to perform. Features that may distinguish a sniper rifle from other weapons are the presence of a [[telescopic sight]], unusually long overall length,<ref name=\"weaponlengthcountersniper\">''The Ultimate Sniper: an Advanced Training Manual for Military and Police Snipers'', [[John Plaster|Maj. John L. Plaster]], 1993. The information about counter-sniper operations describes techniques for identifying snipers amongst groups of other soldiers. The most easily recognizable feature of a sniper from a great distance is the fact that the sniper's rifle is longer than all the others.</ref> a stock designed for firing from a [[prone position]], and the presence of a [[bipod]] and other accessories.\n\n=== Telescopic sight ===\nThe single most important characteristic that sets a sniper rifle apart from other military or police small arms is the mounting of a [[telescopic sight]], which is relatively easy to distinguish from smaller optical aiming devices found on some modern [[assault rifle]]s and [[submachine gun]]s. \n\nThe telescopic sights used on sniper rifles differ from other optical sights in that they offer much greater magnification (more than 4\u00d7 and up to 40\u00d7), and have a much larger objective [[Lens (optics)|lens]] (40 to 50&nbsp;mm in diameter) for a brighter image.\n\nMost telescopic lenses employed in military or police roles have special [[reticle]]s to aid with judgment of distance, which is an important factor in accurate shot placement due to the bullet's trajectory.\n\n=== Action ===\nThe choice between [[bolt-action]] and [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], usually [[Recoil operation|recoil operated]] or [[Gas-operated|gas operated]] , is usually determined by specific requirements of the sniper's role in a particular organization, with each design having advantages and disadvantages. For a given cartridge, a bolt-action rifle is cheaper to build and maintain, more reliable, and lighter, due to fewer moving parts in the mechanism. In addition, the absence of uncontrolled automatic cartridge case ejection helps avoid revealing the shooter's position. Semi-automatic weapons can serve both as [[battle rifle]] and sniper rifle, and allow for a greater rate (and hence volume) of fire. As such rifles may be modified service rifles, an additional benefit can be commonality of operation with the issued infantry rifle. A bolt action is most commonly used in both military and police roles due to its higher accuracy and ease of maintenance. Anti-materiel applications such as mine clearing and [[special forces]] operations tend to use semi-automatics.\n[[File:Rackandchamber.jpg|thumb|A Marine manually extracts an empty cartridge and chambers a new 7.62\u00d751mm round in his bolt-action [[M40 rifle|M40A3]] sniper rifle. The bolt handle is held in the shooter's hand and is not visible in this photo.]]\n\nA [[designated marksman]] rifle [[Designated marksman rifle|(DMR)]] is less specialized than a typical military sniper rifle, often only intended to extend the range of a group of soldiers. Therefore, when a semi-automatic action is used it is due to its ability to cross over into roles similar to the roles of standard issue weapons. There may also be additional [[logistics|logistical]] advantages if the DMR uses the same ammunition as the more common standard issue weapons. These rifles enable a higher volume of fire, but sacrifice some long range accuracy. They are frequently built from existing [[selective fire]] [[battle rifle]]s or assault rifles, often simply by adding a telescopic sight and adjustable stock.\n\nA police semi-automatic sniper rifle may be used in situations that require a single sniper to engage multiple targets in quick succession, and military semi-automatics, such as the [[M110 SASS]], are used in similar \"target-rich\" environments.\n\n=== Magazine ===\nIn a military setting, logistical concerns are the primary determinant of the cartridge used, so sniper rifles are usually limited to rifle cartridges commonly used by the military force employing the rifle and [[match grade]] ammunition. Since large national militaries generally change slowly, military rifle ammunition is frequently battle-tested and well-studied by ammunition and firearms experts. Consequently, police forces tend to follow military practices in choosing a sniper rifle cartridge instead of trying to break new ground with less-perfected (but possibly better) ammunition.\n\nBefore the introduction of the standard [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (.308 Winchester) cartridge in the 1950s, standard military cartridges were the [[.30-06 Springfield]] or 7.62\u00d763mm (United States), [[.303 British]] (7.7\u00d756mmR) (United Kingdom) and [[7.92\u00d757 mm|7.92\u00d757mm]] (8mm Mauser Germany). The .30-06 Springfield continued in service with U.S. Marine Corps snipers during the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1970s, well after general adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm. At the present time, in both the [[Western world]] and within [[NATO]], [[7.62\u00d751mm]] is currently the primary cartridge of choice for military and police sniper rifles.\n\nWorldwide, the trend is similar. The preferred sniper cartridge in [[Russia]] is another .30 caliber military cartridge, the [[7.62\u00d754 mm R]], which has slightly superior performance to the 7.62\u00d751mm, although the rimmed design limits reliability compared to the latter cartridge. This cartridge was introduced in 1891, and both Russian sniper rifles of the modern era, the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] and the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]], are chambered for it.\n\nCertain commercial cartridges designed with only performance in mind, without the logistical constraints of most armies, have also gained popularity in the 1990s. These include the [[7 mm Remington Magnum]] (7.2\u00d764mm), [[.300 Winchester Magnum]] (7.8/7.62\u00d767mm), and the [[.338 Lapua Magnum]] (8.6\u00d770mm). These cartridges offer better ballistic performance and greater effective range than the 7.62\u00d751mm. Though they are not as powerful as .50 caliber cartridges, rifles chambered for these cartridges are not as heavy as those chambered for .50 caliber ammunition, and are significantly more powerful than rifles chambered for 7.62\u00d751mm.<ref>[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/Long%20Range%20Sniping.htm Cartridges for Long-Range Sniping Rifles by Anthony G Williams]</ref>\n\n[[File:M82rifle.jpg|thumb|[[M82 Barrett rifle|M82A1 SAMR or SASR]] (Special Applications Scoped Rifle or Semi-Automatic Anti Material Rifle), a .50 caliber anti material rifle used in a sniper rifle.]] Though not the typical role for the Barrett, it does have certain desirable long range characteristics.\n\nSnipers may also employ [[anti-materiel rifle]]s in sniping roles against targets such as vehicles, equipment and structures, or for the long-range destruction of explosive devices; these rifles may also be used against personnel.\n\nAnti-materiel rifles tend to be semi-automatic and of a larger caliber than other rifles, using cartridges such as the [[.50 BMG]], [[12.7\u00d7108mm|12.7\u00d7108mm Russian]] or even [[14.5\u00d7114mm|14.5\u00d7114mm Russian]] and [[20 mm caliber|20mm]]. These large cartridges are required to be able to fire projectiles containing payloads such as explosives, armor-piercing cores, incendiaries or combinations of these, such as the [[Raufoss Mk211]] projectile. Due to the considerable size and weight of anti-materiel rifles, two- or three-man sniper teams become necessary.\n\n=== Barrel ===\n[[Gun barrel|Barrel]]s are normally of precise manufacture and of a heavier cross section than more traditional barrels in order to reduce the change in impact points between a first shot from a cold barrel and a follow-up shot from a warm barrel. Unlike many battle and assault rifles, the bores are usually not chromed to avoid inaccuracy due to an uneven treatment.\n\nWhen installed, barrels are often ''free-floated'': i.e., installed so that the barrel contacts the rest of the rifle only at the receiver. A [[free-floating barrel]] avoids contact with the fore-end of the stock by the barrel itself, slings, bipods, or the sniper's hands that can interfere with barrel harmonics. The end of the barrel is usually crowned or machined to form a rebated area around the muzzle proper to avoid asymmetry or damage, and consequent inaccuracy.\n\nExternal longitudinal fluting that contributes to heat dissipation by increasing the surface area, while simultaneously decreasing the weight of the barrel, is sometimes used on sniper-rifle barrels.\n\nSniper-rifle barrels may also utilize a threaded muzzle or combination device ([[muzzle brake]] or [[flash suppressor]] and attachment mount) to allow the fitting of a [[sound suppressor]]. These suppressors often have a means of adjusting the point of impact while fitted.\n\nMilitary sniper rifles tend to have barrel lengths of 609.6&nbsp;mm (24&nbsp;inches) or longer, to allow the cartridge propellant to fully burn, reducing the amount of revealing muzzle flash and increasing muzzle velocity. Police sniper rifles may use shorter barrels to improve handling characteristics. The shorter barrels' muzzle velocity loss is unimportant at closer ranges; the impact velocity of the bullet is more than sufficient.\n\n=== Stock ===\nThe most common special feature of a sniper rifle [[stock (firearms)|stock]] is the adjustable cheek piece, where the shooter's cheek meets the rear of the stock. For most rifles equipped with a telescopic sight, this area is raised slightly, because the telescope is positioned higher than [[iron sights]]. A cheek piece is simply a section of the stock that can be adjusted up or down to suit the individual shooter. To further aid this individual fitting, the stock can sometimes also be adjusted for length, often by varying the number of inserts at the rear of the stock where it meets the shooter's shoulder. If the stock is manufactured from wood, environmental conditions or operational use may [[wood warping|warp the wood]], which may cause slight alignment or barrel harmonics changes over time, altering the point of impact. Stocks manufactured from polymers and metal alloys are less susceptible to point of impact shifting by environmental conditions. Sniper stocks are typically designed to avoid making contact with the barrel of the weapon and minimize the effects of environmental inconstancies. Modern sniper rifle stocks tend to be designed around a rigid chassis, offer user adjustability to allow shooters of various sizes and shapes to tailor the stock to their personal preferences and modular attachment points to provide flexibility to utilize (future) low light and day light aiming optics, laser designators, and other accessories without the need for custom made mounting interface kits.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"100\">\nFile:L42A1-Large.png|[[L42A1]] <small>(1970)</small> with classic shaped wooden stock with cheek-rising piece and free floating barrel.

The sniper uses the sling to \"lock-in\" by wrapping his non-firing arm into the sling forcing his arm to be still.\n[[Weapon mount#Non-static mount|Non-static weapon mounts]], such as [[bipod]]s, [[monopod]]s and [[shooting sticks]], are also regularly used to aid and improve stability and reduce operator fatigue.\nShooting bags are also commonly used to help stabilize the rifle or to provide a variable base.\n\n== Capabilities ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Assassination]] -->\n\n=== Accuracy ===\n[[File:Minutes of arc1.svg|thumb|Comparison of 0.5, 1, and 3 [[Minute of arc#Firearms|MOA]] extreme spread levels against a human torso at 800 m (left) and a human head at 100 m (right)]]\n[[File:Precision Weapon Portfolio Engagement Ranges & Dispersion.png|thumb|Precision Weapon Engagement Ranges & Dispersion according to the US Army]]\n[[File:Tango51zoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Tango 51]] sniper rifle has an accuracy guarantee of 0.25 MOA (0.07 [[milliradian|mrad]])]]\n\nA military-issue [[battle rifle]] or [[assault rifle]] is usually capable of between 3\u20136 [[Minute of arc#Firearms|minute of angle]] (1\u20132 [[milliradian]]) accuracy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Military Technologies of the World |first=Tae-Woo |last=Lee |page=237 |volume=2 |publisher=[[Praeger Security International]] |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=1IogkgEACAAJ |isbn=978-0275995393}}</ref> A standard-issue military sniper rifle is typically capable of 1\u20133 MOA (0.3\u20131 mrad) accuracy, with a police sniper rifle capable of 0.25\u20131.5 MOA (0.1\u20130.5 mrad) accuracy.

Since sniper rifles of this class must compete with several other types of military weapons with similar range, snipers invariably must employ skilled [[fieldcraft]] to conceal their position.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe recent trend in specialized military sniper rifles is towards larger calibers that offer relatively favorable hit probabilities at greater range with anti-personnel cartridges such as the [[.300 Winchester Magnum]] and the [[.338 Lapua Magnum]] and anti-materiel cartridges such as the [[12.7\u00d799mm]], [[12.7\u00d7108mm]], and the [[14.5\u00d7114mm]]. This allows snipers to take fewer risks, and spend less time finding concealment when facing enemies that are not equipped with similar weapons.\n\nMaximum range claims made by military organizations and materiel manufacturers regarding sniper weapon systems are not based on consistent or strictly scientific criteria. The problem is only the bullet interacts after a relatively long flight path with the target (which can also be a materiel target for a sniper bullet). This implies that variables such as the minimal required hit probability, local atmospheric conditions, properties and velocity of the employed bullet (parts), properties of the target and the desired terminal effect are major relevant factors that determine the maximum effective range of the employed system.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of sniper rifles]]\n* [[Longest recorded sniper kills]]\n* [[Long range shooting]]\n\n;Related military roles\n* [[Designated marksman]]\n* [[Scout Sniper]]\n* [[Sniper]]\n\n;Related military weapons\n* [[Anti-materiel rifle]]\n* [[Anti-tank rifle]]\n* [[Assault rifle]]\n* [[Battle rifle]]\n* [[Carbine|Carbine rifle]]\n* [[Designated marksman rifle]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book|author=Tobias, Ronald|title=They Shoot to Kill: A Psycho-History of Criminal Sniping|publisher=Paladin Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|year=1981|isbn=0-87364-207-4}}\n* {{cite book|author=De Haas, Frank|title=Bolt Action Rifles|publisher=Krause Publications|location=|year=1995|isbn=0-87349-168-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/Bolt_Action_Rifles_3rd_Edition}}\n* {{cite book|author=Lebleu, Jon|title=Long Rifle: One Man's Deadly Sniper Missions in Iraq and Afghanistan|publisher=The Lyons Press|location=Guilford|year=2008|isbn=978-1599214405}}\n* {{cite book|author=Pegler, Martin|title=Out of Nowhere: A History of the Military Sniper|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2004|isbn=978-1846031403}}\n* {{cite book|author=Pegler, Martin|title=Sniper Rifles: From the 19th to the 21st Century|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2010|isbn=978-1849083980}}\n* {{cite journal|author=|title=Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain)|volume= 19|year=1860}}\n* {{cite journal|author=Raudzens, George|title=War-Winning Weapons: The Measurement of Technological Determinism in Military History|journal=The Journal of Military History|volume=54|year=1990|pages=403\u2013434|issue=4}}\n* {{cite journal|author=|title=Telescopic Sights for Rifles|publisher=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|year=1916|page=765|issue=2891}}\n* {{cite web|author=Popenker, Max|title=Modern Sniper Rifles|year=2001|url=http://modernfirearms.net/en/modern-sniper-rifles/}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Sniper rifles}}\n* [http://world.guns.ru/sniper/sn00-e.htm Modern Firearms list of sniper rifles]\n* [http://www.snipercentral.com/rifles.htm SniperCentral list of sniper rifles]\n* [http://www.tacticaloperations.com/swatapril2000/index.html Tack Driving Tactical Rifle from Tac Ops]{{snd}}Detailed overview of the accurization process for a .25 MOA rifle\n* [http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/ Detailed accuracy articles], by barrel maker [[Dan Lilja]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070310210955/http://www.thedarkpaladin.com/russiansnipers.htm Detail of Russian snipers and sniper rifles of World War Two by Chris Eger, military historian]\n* [http://demigodllc.com/articles/practical-long-range-rifle-shooting-equipment/ demigodllc.com: Practical long-range rifle shooting]\n* [http://video.foxnews.com/v/4836265467001/guns-101-sniper-rifles/?#sp=show-clips Five-minute Sniper 101 Tutorial, Colonial Days to Present]\n* [http://getrussia.com/articles/russian_rifles/ Russian will soon have a new sniper rifle 'the Tochnost']\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sniper Rifle}}\n[[Category:Sniper rifles| ]]\n", "name_user": "Yohananw", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper_rifle"}
