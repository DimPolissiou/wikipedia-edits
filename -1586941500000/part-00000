The formation was named for [[Cedar Mountain, Utah|Cedar Mountain]] in northern [[Emery County, Utah]], where William Lee Stokes first studied the exposures in 1944.<ref name=\"stokes1944\" />\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:CMF-oucrop.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The drab-colored lower portion of the Cedar Mountain Formation, overlying the brighter [[Morrison Formation]].]]\nThe formation occurs between the underlying [[Morrison Formation]] and overlying [[Naturita Formation]] (sometimes formerly called the [[Dakota Formation]]).\n\nIt is composed of non-marine sediments, that is, sediments deposited in rivers, lakes and on flood plains. Based on various fossils and [[radiometric dating|radiometric dates]], the Cedar Mountain Formation was deposited during the last half of the [[Early Cretaceous]] Epoch, about 127 - 98 million years ago (mya).\n\nIt has lithography similar to the [[Burro Canyon Formation]] in the region.\n\n[[Dinosaur]] fossils occur throughout the formation, but their study has only occurred since the early 1990s. The dinosaurs in the lower part of the formation differ from those in the upper part. These two dinosaur assemblages, characterized by distinct dinosaurs, show the replacement of older, European-like dinosaurs with younger, Asian-like dinosaurs as the North American Continental [[Plate tectonics|Plate]] drifted westward. A middle dinosaur assemblage may be present, but the fossil record is not clear.\n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe Cedar Mountain Formation is sandwiched between the Morrison Formation below and the Naturita Formation and [[Mancos Shale]] above. The youngest date for Morrison just below the Cedar Mountain Formation is 148.1 \u00b1 0.5 Ma .<ref name=\"kowallisetal1998\" /> or lower [[Tithonian]].  Typically, the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary in western North America is marked by an [[unconformity]] of variable length, and typically signifies 10-49 million years of missing geologic time.<ref name=\"kowallisetal1998\" /> This boundary between the Morrison and Cedar Mountain is commonly marked by a horizon of carbonate nodules<ref name=\"stokes1952\" /><ref name=\"aubrey1998\" /> or by highly polished pebbles that are allegedly gastroliths.\n\nAlthough not part of the Cedar Mountain Formation, the '''[[Naturita Formation]]''' immediately overlies the Cedar Mountain and marks the encroaching [[Western Interior Seaway]]. The Naturita is not uniformly distributed and was eroded away in places by the advancing Seaway so that the marine shales of the Mancos Formation lay directly on the Mussentuchit or its equivalent. The name [[Dakota Formation]] has been improperly used for these strata.\n\n[[File:CMF-stratcol-revised.jpg|thumb|350px|Stratigraphic column showing the various members that make up the Cedar Mountain Formation and their approximate geologic age.<br />Missing strata either were not deposited or were deposited, but later eroded.]]\n\n====Formation members====\nOnly recently did the 125&nbsp;m (410&nbsp;ft) thick formation get subdivided into smaller, distinctive beds called members. There is a debate as to whether there are five members<ref name=\"kirklandetal1997b\" /> or four<ref name=\"rocaargeminadon2003\" /> depending whether the Buckhorn Conglomerate is considered to be at the top of the Morrison Formation or at the base of the Cedar Mountain Formation; most geologists and paleontologists consider it part of the Cedar Mountain Formation. In ascending order the remaining [[member (geology)|members]] are the Yellow Cat Member, Poison Strip Sandstone, Ruby Ranch Member, and the Mussentuchit Member. Each of these members are named after a geographic area where they were first studied.\n\n* The '''Buckhorn Conglomerate''' is considered the lowermost member of the Cedar Mountain Formation in the region of the San Raphael Swell by Stokes.<ref name=\"stokes1952\" /> It is named for exposures near Buckhorn Reservoir near Cedar Mountain. Its position immediately below the Ruby Ranch Member suggests that it may be equivalent to the channel sandstones in the Yellow Cat Member and the Poison Strip Sandstone farther to the east. This idea is strengthened by the similar composition of the gravels in these members, but a direct correlation has not yet been established.\n*The '''Yellow Cat Member''' is named for exposures near the Yellow Cat mining area north of [[Arches National Park]]. It is limited to the eastern portions of the formation and is thickest near Arches National Monument. The member is composed of drab greyish [[mudstone]]s and some lenses of [[sandstone]]. The mudstones were deposited on flood plains, and show evidence of ancient soil development called [[paleosols]]. The mudstones originated as flood deposits from river channels that are marked by the sandstone lenses. Formerly considered [[Barremian]], the latest radiometric and paleopalinological studies conclude that the Yellow Member is older, with deposition occurring from the middle [[Berriasian]] to early [[Hauterivian]] stages.<ref name=\"kirklandetal1997b\" /><ref name=\"kirklandmadsen2007\" /><ref name=\"kirklandandothers2019\">R. M. Joeckel, G. A. Ludvigson, A. M\u00f6ller, C. L. Hotton, M. B. Suarez, C. A. Suarez, B. Sames, J. I. Kirkland and B. Hendrix (2019) ''Chronostratigraphy and Terrestrial Palaeoclimatology of Berriasian-Hauterivian Strata of the Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah, USA.''Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 498.</ref>\n* The '''Poison Strip Sandstone''' was named for prominent, cliff-forming sandstones in the Poison Strip uranium district north of Arches National Monument. It is actually a series of sandstones that were deposited in river channels, and lesser amounts of mudstones and limestones that were deposited on the flood plain and small ponds. The  Poison Strip Sandstone may represent a meandering river complex.<ref name=\"planicoxa-setting-186\" /> Based on the position of the Poison Strip between the Yellow Cat and Ruby Ranch members, it probably was latest Barremian to earliest [[Aptian]]. [[Carbonate]] growths appear on bones in the quarry from which ''Venenosaurus'' was extracted.<ref name=\"veneno-dep-140\" />\n** The Poison Strip Sandstone was the source of Tony's Bone Bed, a significant concentration of dinosaur bones. Before it was discovered, only possible ''[[Sauropelta]]'' remains and the isolated bones of sauropods and theropods had been recovered from the Poison Strip member.<ref name=\"planicoxa-intro-186\" /> Volunteers from the [[Denver Museum of Natural History]] discovered '''Tony's Bone Bed''' in [[1998 in paleontology|1998]], 3.75m below the top of the member.<ref name=\"planicoxa-intro-185\" /> The quality of the preserved remains in Tony's Bone Bed are \"highly variable\". The condition of many of its fossils suggest the deposit accumulated gradually. Many of the bones seem to have been trampled before burial, and some of the ends of bones are missing and were likely removed by scavengers. None of the bones were preserved articulated with each other. All of this suggests a significant period of time between the deaths of the animals and their final entombment. Tony's Bonebed probably accumulated over time when the water in the river channel was low during the [[dry season]].<ref name=\"planicoxa-setting-187\" />\n*The '''Ruby Ranch Member''' is the most widespread and distinctive member of the Cedar Mountain. It was named for exposures on the Ruby Ranch located southeast of Green River, Utah. The member is composed of maroon mudstones with irregular spheres of carbonate nodules. The nodules formed in ancient soils that developed in the mud deposited on the flood plain in a strongly seasonal, semiarid climate. Evaporation of groundwater during the dry season concentrated calcium carbonate and other minerals in the upper parts of the [[soil horizon]]. Radiometric dates place the upper portions of the Ruby Ranch in the late Aptian. [[Exhumed river channel]]s in the Ruby Ranch indicate that stream flow during the Aptian was towards the northeast, the direction of the encrouching Western Interior Seaway.\n*The '''Mussentuchit Member''' is the uppermost member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. It was named for exposures along Mussentuchit Wash southwest of the San Rafael Swell. It is predominantly composed of grey mudstones high in organic carbon from fossil plant material, as well as volcanic ash. The mudstones were originally deposited on a broad coastal plain with a high water table or with abundant rainfall. Thus, carbonate nodules are rare. A radiometric date of 98.37 \u00b1 0.07 Ma places the upper part of the member in the Lower [[Cenomanian]], while lower portions of the member have been dated to 104.46 \u00b1 0.95 Ma, in the [[Albian]] stage.<ref name=DCetal10>Chure, et al. (2010).</ref>\n\n==Fossil content==\nThe Cedar Mountain Formation is proving to contain one of the richest and most diverse Early Cretaceous dinosaur faunas in the world. The discoveries to date have revealed that the origin of some of the later Cretaceous dinosaurs may lie in the Cedar Mountain, but further work is needed to understand the timing and effects the changing position of the North American Plate had on dinosaurian evolution. Also needed is a better understanding of the effects that the changing North American Plate had on the non-dinosaur vertebrates.\n\n===Dinosaurs===\n[[File:CMF-dinos.JPG|thumb|Example of dinosaurs from the Cedar Mountain Formation include the polacanthid ankylosaur ''Gastonia'' from the Yellow Cat Member (upper left), ''Utahraptor'' from the Yellow Cat Member (upper right), a large theropod represented by a tooth from the Ruby Ranch Member (lower left), and ''Tenontosaurus'' from the base of the Mussentuchit (lower right).]]\nThe Cedar Mountain Formation is one of the last major dinosaur-bearing formations to be studied in the United States. Although sporadic bone fragments were known prior to 1990, serious research did not begin until that year. Since then, several organizations have conducted field work collecting dinosaurs, chiefly the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, the College of Eastern Utah, the Utah Geological Survey, Brigham Young University, and Dinosaur National Monument staff. This research indicates that at least two, possibly three dinosaur assemblages are contained within the formation.\n\nThe oldest of these assemblages is from the Yellow Cat, Poison Strip and basal Ruby Ranch members. The small, ''Ornitholestes''-like [[theropod]] ''Nedcolbertia'' and the brachiosaurid [[sauropod]] ''Cedarosaurus'' may be considered as relics, with their closest relatives in the Morrison Formation. In contrast, the polacanthid [[ankylosaur]] ''[[Gastonia (dinosaur)|Gastonia]]'' and a yet unnamed [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontid]] are similar to related forms from the Lower Cretaceous of southern England. These dinosaurs show that the connection between North America and Europe still existed during the Barremian. All of this changes, however, with the upper dinosaur assemblage from the top of the Ruby Ranch and Mussentuchit members. This upper assemblage shows greater similarities with Asian dinosaur assemblages from the same time. For example, the primitive ankylosaurid ''[[Cedarpelta]]'' is related to ''[[Gobisaurus]]'' and ''[[Shamosaurus]]'' from Mongolia, but is more primitive than either because it has teeth in the premaxilla. The upper assemblage also has a [[tyrannosaur]]id, a [[ceratopsian]], and a [[pachycephalosaur]]. Although not a dinosaur, the primitive mammal ''Gobiconodon'' is known from both Mongolia and the Mussentuchit Member. Evidence for a middle dinosaur assemblage between the older and younger ones is controversial because the evidence mostly depends on a single specimen of the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'' from high in the Ruby Ranch Member and the sauropod ''[[Astrodon]]'' from low in the Ruby Ranch. Regardless, the upper and lower dinosaur assemblages in the Cedar Mountain Formation document the separation of North America and Europe, the westward drift of North America, and its connection with Asia 10 to 15 million years later.<ref name=\"carpenter2006\" />\n\nData from Carpenter (2006),<ref name=\"carpenter2006\" /> Cifelli ''et al.''

The San Rafael Swell is the dome-like structure that the formation jogs around. Base map data courtesy of geodata.gov]]\nBesides dinosaurs, the Cedar Mountain Formation has produced a wealth of small fossils (a.k.a. microfossils), mostly teeth from a variety of vertebrates. Most of these specimens have been found in the Mussentuchit Member where they are collected by washing the rock through fine window screen. The teeth and other small fossils are picked from the residue.<ref name=\"cifellietal1999\" />\n\n* Fish include primitive fresh or brackish water sharks (e.g., ''Hybodus'') and rays (c.f., ''Ischyrhiza''), the lung fish (''Ceratodus'') and several bony fishes known from vertebrae. Lung fish are able to breathe air when pond water become poorly oxygenated, such as during the dry season.\n* Amphibians include both salamanders (e.g. ''Albanerpeton'') and frogs, but neither is common.\n* Reptiles are more abundant and better studied. These include aquatic turtles (''Glyptops'', ''Naomichelys''), at least one type of snake (''Coniophis''), and several different lizards, including teiids (''Bicuspidon''), possible [[skink]]s and some extinct families (e.g., Paramacellodidae). Crocodiles are also present but their remains are fragmentary. They include ''Bernissartia'', an unnamed atoposaurid, and unnamed pholidosaurid. At least one fragment of a large pterosaur is known from the base of the Mussentuchut Member. Unfortunately, it is too incomplete to identify to family or genus.\n* Bird remains are very fragmentary because of their delicate structure. At least one aquatic bird is known. Based on the diversity of birds from the Early Cretaceous of China, other birds were probably present in Utah at this time as well.\n* Mammals are the most thoroughly studied thanks to the work of Jeffrey Eaton and Richard Cifelli.<ref name=\"cifellietal1999\" /> They include triconodonts (e.g., ''Astroconodon''), which have the molar cusps arranged in a single row; symmetrodonts (e.g., ''Spalacolestes''; ''Spalacotheridium''), characterized by molars having three cusps arranged in a triangle; multituberculates (e.g., ''Janumys''; ''Cedaromys''; ''Paxacimexomys''), with their multiple rows of cusps on the molars; one of the earliest marsupials (''Kokopellia''), and several unnamed tribotheres, characterized by molars having three cusps that are typically asymmetrically arranged.\n\nThe various vertebrates are listed by member in the list below.\n\nNon-vertebrate fossils are more widely distributed in the Cedar Mountain Formation. These include the distinctive reproductive structures of fresh water algae that are called [[charophyte]]s. Charophytes are so distinctive that they are used to correlate strata of similar age, and thus were used to show that the Yellow Cat Member was time equivalent to Barremian age strata in England.<ref name=\"kirklandetal1997b\" /> [[Ostracod]]s, small crustaceans with clam-like shells, also occur in fresh water deposits, along with \"finger-clams\" or chonchostracans. Pollen have been found in the Mussentuchit Member and are important for reconstructing the environment. In a few places, large petrified logs are known, especially from the Poison Strip. These [[conifer]] logs are over a meter in diameter and indicate the presence of trees over 30 m (100&nbsp;feet). The distinct wood of the [[tree fern]] ''[[Tempskya]]'' is occasional found as well.\n\nData from Carpenter (2006),<ref name=\"carpenter2006\" /> Cifelli ''et al.''

The formation was named for [[Cedar Mountain, Utah|Cedar Mountain]] in northern [[Emery County, Utah]], where William Lee Stokes first studied the exposures in 1944.<ref name=\"stokes1944\" />\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:CMF-oucrop.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The drab-colored lower portion of the Cedar Mountain Formation, overlying the brighter [[Morrison Formation]].]]\nThe formation occurs between the underlying [[Morrison Formation]] and overlying [[Naturita Formation]] (sometimes formerly called the [[Dakota Formation]]).\n\nIt is composed of non-marine sediments, that is, sediments deposited in rivers, lakes and on flood plains. Based on various fossils and [[radiometric dating|radiometric dates]], the Cedar Mountain Formation was deposited during the last half of the [[Early Cretaceous]] Epoch, about 127 - 98 million years ago (mya).\n\nIt has lithography similar to the [[Burro Canyon Formation]] in the region.\n\n[[Dinosaur]] fossils occur throughout the formation, but their study has only occurred since the early 1990s. The dinosaurs in the lower part of the formation differ from those in the upper part. These two dinosaur assemblages, characterized by distinct dinosaurs, show the replacement of older, European-like dinosaurs with younger, Asian-like dinosaurs as the North American Continental [[Plate tectonics|Plate]] drifted westward. A middle dinosaur assemblage may be present, but the fossil record is not clear.\n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe Cedar Mountain Formation is sandwiched between the Morrison Formation below and the Naturita Formation and [[Mancos Shale]] above. The youngest date for Morrison just below the Cedar Mountain Formation is 148.1 \u00b1 0.5 Ma .<ref name=\"kowallisetal1998\" /> or lower [[Tithonian]].  Typically, the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary in western North America is marked by an [[unconformity]] of variable length, and typically signifies 10-49 million years of missing geologic time.<ref name=\"kowallisetal1998\" /> This boundary between the Morrison and Cedar Mountain is commonly marked by a horizon of carbonate nodules<ref name=\"stokes1952\" /><ref name=\"aubrey1998\" /> or by highly polished pebbles that are allegedly gastroliths.\n\nAlthough not part of the Cedar Mountain Formation, the '''[[Naturita Formation]]''' immediately overlies the Cedar Mountain and marks the encroaching [[Western Interior Seaway]]. The Naturita is not uniformly distributed and was eroded away in places by the advancing Seaway so that the marine shales of the Mancos Formation lay directly on the Mussentuchit or its equivalent. The name [[Dakota Formation]] has been improperly used for these strata.\n\n[[File:CMF-stratcol-revised.jpg|thumb|350px|Stratigraphic column showing the various members that make up the Cedar Mountain Formation and their approximate geologic age.<br />Missing strata either were not deposited or were deposited, but later eroded.]]\n\n====Formation members====\nOnly recently did the 125&nbsp;m (410&nbsp;ft) thick formation get subdivided into smaller, distinctive beds called members. There is a debate as to whether there are five members<ref name=\"kirklandetal1997b\" /> or four<ref name=\"rocaargeminadon2003\" /> depending whether the Buckhorn Conglomerate is considered to be at the top of the Morrison Formation or at the base of the Cedar Mountain Formation; most geologists and paleontologists consider it part of the Cedar Mountain Formation. In ascending order the remaining [[member (geology)|members]] are the Yellow Cat Member, Poison Strip Sandstone, Ruby Ranch Member, and the Mussentuchit Member. Each of these members are named after a geographic area where they were first studied.\n\n* The '''Buckhorn Conglomerate''' is considered the lowermost member of the Cedar Mountain Formation in the region of the San Raphael Swell by Stokes.<ref name=\"stokes1952\" /> It is named for exposures near Buckhorn Reservoir near Cedar Mountain. Its position immediately below the Ruby Ranch Member suggests that it may be equivalent to the channel sandstones in the Yellow Cat Member and the Poison Strip Sandstone farther to the east. This idea is strengthened by the similar composition of the gravels in these members, but a direct correlation has not yet been established.\n*The '''Yellow Cat Member''' is named for exposures near the Yellow Cat mining area north of [[Arches National Park]]. It is limited to the eastern portions of the formation and is thickest near Arches National Monument. The member is composed of drab greyish [[mudstone]]s and some lenses of [[sandstone]]. The mudstones were deposited on flood plains, and show evidence of ancient soil development called [[paleosols]]. The mudstones originated as flood deposits from river channels that are marked by the sandstone lenses. Formerly considered [[Barremian]], the latest radiometric and paleopalinological studies conclude that the Yellow Member is older, with deposition occurring from the middle [[Berriasian]] to early [[Hauterivian]] stages.<ref name=\"kirklandetal1997b\" /><ref name=\"kirklandmadsen2007\" /><ref name=\"kirklandandothers2019\">R. M. Joeckel, G. A. Ludvigson, A. M\u00f6ller, C. L. Hotton, M. B. Suarez, C. A. Suarez, B. Sames, J. I. Kirkland and B. Hendrix (2019) ''Chronostratigraphy and Terrestrial Palaeoclimatology of Berriasian-Hauterivian Strata of the Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah, USA.''Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 498.</ref>\n\n* The '''Poison Strip Sandstone''' was named for prominent, cliff-forming sandstones in the Poison Strip uranium district north of Arches National Monument. It is actually a series of sandstones that were deposited in river channels, and lesser amounts of mudstones and limestones that were deposited on the flood plain and small ponds. The  Poison Strip Sandstone may represent a meandering river complex.<ref name=\"planicoxa-setting-186\" /> Based on the position of the Poison Strip between the Yellow Cat and Ruby Ranch members, it probably was latest Barremian to earliest [[Aptian]]. [[Carbonate]] growths appear on bones in the quarry from which ''Venenosaurus'' was extracted.<ref name=\"veneno-dep-140\" />\n** The Poison Strip Sandstone was the source of Tony's Bone Bed, a significant concentration of dinosaur bones. Before it was discovered, only possible ''[[Sauropelta]]'' remains and the isolated bones of sauropods and theropods had been recovered from the Poison Strip member.<ref name=\"planicoxa-intro-186\" /> Volunteers from the [[Denver Museum of Natural History]] discovered '''Tony's Bone Bed''' in [[1998 in paleontology|1998]], 3.75m below the top of the member.<ref name=\"planicoxa-intro-185\" /> The quality of the preserved remains in Tony's Bone Bed are \"highly variable\". The condition of many of its fossils suggest the deposit accumulated gradually. Many of the bones seem to have been trampled before burial, and some of the ends of bones are missing and were likely removed by scavengers. None of the bones were preserved articulated with each other. All of this suggests a significant period of time between the deaths of the animals and their final entombment. Tony's Bonebed probably accumulated over time when the water in the river channel was low during the [[dry season]].<ref name=\"planicoxa-setting-187\" />\n*The '''Ruby Ranch Member''' is the most widespread and distinctive member of the Cedar Mountain. It was named for exposures on the Ruby Ranch located southeast of Green River, Utah. The member is composed of maroon mudstones with irregular spheres of carbonate nodules. The nodules formed in ancient soils that developed in the mud deposited on the flood plain in a strongly seasonal, semiarid climate. Evaporation of groundwater during the dry season concentrated calcium carbonate and other minerals in the upper parts of the [[soil horizon]]. Radiometric dates place the upper portions of the Ruby Ranch in the late Aptian. [[Exhumed river channel]]s in the Ruby Ranch indicate that stream flow during the Aptian was towards the northeast, the direction of the encrouching Western Interior Seaway.\n*The '''Mussentuchit Member''' is the uppermost member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. It was named for exposures along Mussentuchit Wash southwest of the San Rafael Swell. It is predominantly composed of grey mudstones high in organic carbon from fossil plant material, as well as volcanic ash. The mudstones were originally deposited on a broad coastal plain with a high water table or with abundant rainfall. Thus, carbonate nodules are rare. A radiometric date of 98.37 \u00b1 0.07 Ma places the upper part of the member in the Lower [[Cenomanian]], while lower portions of the member have been dated to 104.46 \u00b1 0.95 Ma, in the [[Albian]] stage.<ref name=DCetal10>Chure, et al. (2010).</ref>\n\n==Fossil content==\nThe Cedar Mountain Formation is proving to contain one of the richest and most diverse Early Cretaceous dinosaur faunas in the world. The discoveries to date have revealed that the origin of some of the later Cretaceous dinosaurs may lie in the Cedar Mountain, but further work is needed to understand the timing and effects the changing position of the North American Plate had on dinosaurian evolution. Also needed is a better understanding of the effects that the changing North American Plate had on the non-dinosaur vertebrates.\n\n===Dinosaurs===\n[[File:CMF-dinos.JPG|thumb|Example of dinosaurs from the Cedar Mountain Formation include the polacanthid ankylosaur ''Gastonia'' from the Yellow Cat Member (upper left), ''Utahraptor'' from the Yellow Cat Member (upper right), a large theropod represented by a tooth from the Ruby Ranch Member (lower left), and ''Tenontosaurus'' from the base of the Mussentuchit (lower right).]]\nThe Cedar Mountain Formation is one of the last major dinosaur-bearing formations to be studied in the United States. Although sporadic bone fragments were known prior to 1990, serious research did not begin until that year. Since then, several organizations have conducted field work collecting dinosaurs, chiefly the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, the College of Eastern Utah, the Utah Geological Survey, Brigham Young University, and Dinosaur National Monument staff. This research indicates that at least two, possibly three dinosaur assemblages are contained within the formation.\n\nThe oldest of these assemblages is from the Yellow Cat, Poison Strip and basal Ruby Ranch members. The small, ''Ornitholestes''-like [[theropod]] ''Nedcolbertia'' and the brachiosaurid [[sauropod]] ''Cedarosaurus'' may be considered as relics, with their closest relatives in the Morrison Formation. In contrast, the polacanthid [[ankylosaur]] ''[[Gastonia (dinosaur)|Gastonia]]'' and a yet unnamed [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontid]] are similar to related forms from the Lower Cretaceous of southern England. These dinosaurs show that the connection between North America and Europe still existed during the Barremian. All of this changes, however, with the upper dinosaur assemblage from the top of the Ruby Ranch and Mussentuchit members. This upper assemblage shows greater similarities with Asian dinosaur assemblages from the same time. For example, the primitive ankylosaurid ''[[Cedarpelta]]'' is related to ''[[Gobisaurus]]'' and ''[[Shamosaurus]]'' from Mongolia, but is more primitive than either because it has teeth in the premaxilla. The upper assemblage also has a [[tyrannosaur]]id, a [[ceratopsian]], and a [[pachycephalosaur]]. Although not a dinosaur, the primitive mammal ''Gobiconodon'' is known from both Mongolia and the Mussentuchit Member. Evidence for a middle dinosaur assemblage between the older and younger ones is controversial because the evidence mostly depends on a single specimen of the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'' from high in the Ruby Ranch Member and the sauropod ''[[Astrodon]]'' from low in the Ruby Ranch. Regardless, the upper and lower dinosaur assemblages in the Cedar Mountain Formation document the separation of North America and Europe, the westward drift of North America, and its connection with Asia 10 to 15 million years later.<ref name=\"carpenter2006\" />\n\nData from Carpenter (2006),<ref name=\"carpenter2006\" /> Cifelli ''et al.''

The San Rafael Swell is the dome-like structure that the formation jogs around. Base map data courtesy of geodata.gov]]\nBesides dinosaurs, the Cedar Mountain Formation has produced a wealth of small fossils (a.k.a. microfossils), mostly teeth from a variety of vertebrates. Most of these specimens have been found in the Mussentuchit Member where they are collected by washing the rock through fine window screen. The teeth and other small fossils are picked from the residue.<ref name=\"cifellietal1999\" />\n\n* Fish include primitive fresh or brackish water sharks (e.g., ''Hybodus'') and rays (c.f., ''Ischyrhiza''), the lung fish (''Ceratodus'') and several bony fishes known from vertebrae. Lung fish are able to breathe air when pond water become poorly oxygenated, such as during the dry season.\n* Amphibians include both salamanders (e.g. ''Albanerpeton'') and frogs, but neither is common.\n* Reptiles are more abundant and better studied. These include aquatic turtles (''Glyptops'', ''Naomichelys''), at least one type of snake (''Coniophis''), and several different lizards, including teiids (''Bicuspidon''), possible [[skink]]s and some extinct families (e.g., Paramacellodidae). Crocodiles are also present but their remains are fragmentary. They include ''Bernissartia'', an unnamed atoposaurid, and unnamed pholidosaurid. At least one fragment of a large pterosaur is known from the base of the Mussentuchut Member. Unfortunately, it is too incomplete to identify to family or genus.\n* Bird remains are very fragmentary because of their delicate structure. At least one aquatic bird is known. Based on the diversity of birds from the Early Cretaceous of China, other birds were probably present in Utah at this time as well.\n* Mammals are the most thoroughly studied thanks to the work of Jeffrey Eaton and Richard Cifelli.<ref name=\"cifellietal1999\" /> They include triconodonts (e.g., ''Astroconodon''), which have the molar cusps arranged in a single row; symmetrodonts (e.g., ''Spalacolestes''; ''Spalacotheridium''), characterized by molars having three cusps arranged in a triangle; multituberculates (e.g., ''Janumys''; ''Cedaromys''; ''Paxacimexomys''), with their multiple rows of cusps on the molars; one of the earliest marsupials (''Kokopellia''), and several unnamed tribotheres, characterized by molars having three cusps that are typically asymmetrically arranged.\n\nThe various vertebrates are listed by member in the list below.\n\nNon-vertebrate fossils are more widely distributed in the Cedar Mountain Formation. These include the distinctive reproductive structures of fresh water algae that are called [[charophyte]]s. Charophytes are so distinctive that they are used to correlate strata of similar age, and thus were used to show that the Yellow Cat Member was time equivalent to Barremian age strata in England.<ref name=\"kirklandetal1997b\" /> [[Ostracod]]s, small crustaceans with clam-like shells, also occur in fresh water deposits, along with \"finger-clams\" or chonchostracans. Pollen have been found in the Mussentuchit Member and are important for reconstructing the environment. In a few places, large petrified logs are known, especially from the Poison Strip. These [[conifer]] logs are over a meter in diameter and indicate the presence of trees over 30 m (100&nbsp;feet). The distinct wood of the [[tree fern]] ''[[Tempskya]]'' is occasional found as well.\n\nData from Carpenter (2006),<ref name=\"carpenter2006\" /> Cifelli ''et al.''

Single-walled metal bottles readily transfer temperature of contents to external surfaces, which makes them unsuitable for use with unusually hot or cold liquids. Double-walled metal bottles are insulated to keep cold liquids cold and hot liquids hot, without the external surface being too hot or too cold.

[[HDPE]] and [[LDPE]] bottles can be recycled as well.\n\nBecause the manufacturing and transportation of disposable water bottles requires [[petroleum]], a non-renewable resource, the single-serve bottled water industry has come under pressure from concerned consumers. The [[Pacific Institute]] calculates that it required about 17 million barrels of oil to make the disposable plastic bottles for single-serve water that Americans consumed in 2006. To sustain the consumptive use of products relying on plastic components and level of manufactured demand for plastic water bottles,<ref>{{cite web|title= The Water Project|url=https://thewaterproject.org/bottled-water/bottled_water_wasteful |date= |accessdate=2016-05-29}}</ref>  the end result is shortages of [[fossil fuels]].

Other bottle manufacturing companies are experimenting with alternative materials such as [[corn starch]] to make new bottles that are more readily [[biodegradable]].\n\nThe lowest impact water bottles are those made of glass or metal.  They are not made from petroleum and are easily recyclable.  By choosing to continuously fill any multi-use water bottle, the consumer keeps disposable bottles out of the [[waste stream]] and minimizes environmental impact.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Reuse of water bottles]]\n* [[Beverage can]]\n* [[Bottled water]]\n* [[Carboy]]\n* [[Edible water bottle]]\n* [[Low plastic water bottle]]\n* [[Plastic pollution]]\n* [[Sipper water bottle]], a water dispenser for pets\n* [[Refill (scheme)]]\n* [[Water canister]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://cnocoutdoors.com/blogs/blog/lets-talk-about-threads Blog post about thread types used on different bottles and compatability]\n\n{{packaging}}\n\n[[Category:Liquid containers]]\n[[Category:Bottles]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|text=[[hot water bottle]]}}\n[[File:Multi-use water bottle.JPG|thumb|Multi-use HDPE water bottles]]\n[[File:Clickon Water Dispenser.jpg|thumb|right|Water Dispenser with large plastic bottles ([[demijohn]] or [[carboy]])]]\nA '''water bottle''' is a container that is used to hold [[water]], liquids or other beverages for consumption.

{"title_page": "Solubility equilibrium", "text_new": "'''Solubility equilibrium''' is a type of [[dynamic equilibrium]] that exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the solvent, such as acid or alkali. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent [[equilibrium constant]]. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios.\n\n== Definitions ==\nA solubility equilibrium exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The equilibrium is an example of [[dynamic equilibrium]] in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] are equal to one another. When equilibrium is established, the solution is said to be saturated. The [[concentration]] of the solute in a saturated solution is known as the [[solubility]]. Units of solubility may be molar (mol/[[litre|L]]) or expressed as mass per unit volume, such as \u03bcg/ml. Solubility is temperature-dependent. A solution containing a higher concentration of solute than the solubility is said to be [[supersaturation|supersaturated]]. A supersaturated solution may be induced to come to equilibrium by the addition of a \"seed\", which may be a tiny crystal of the solute or a tiny solid particle, which initiates precipitation.\n\nThere are three main types of solubility equilibria:\n# Simple dissolution.\n# Dissolution with dissociation reaction. This is characteristic of [[salts]]. The equilibrium constant is known in this case as a solubility product.\n# Dissolution with ionization reaction. This is characteristic of the dissolution of [[weak acid]]s or [[weak base]]s in aqueous media of varying [[pH]].\n\nIn each case an [[equilibrium constant]] can be specified as a quotient of [[activity (chemistry)|activities]]. This equilibrium constant is [[dimensionless]] as activity is a dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See {{slink|Equilibrium chemistry|Equilibrium constant}} for details. Moreover, the concentration of solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants defined in terms of concentrations are not only temperature-dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.\n\n=== Phase effect ===\nEquilibria are defined for specific crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. Therefore, the solubility product is expected to be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, [[aragonite]] and [[calcite]] have different solubility products even though they have both the same chemical identity ([[calcium carbonate]]). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a [[metastable]] state. \n\nIn pharmacology, the metastable state is sometimes referred to as amorphous state. Amorphous drugs have higher solubility than their crystalline counterparts due to the absence of long-distance interactions inherent in crystal lattice. Thus, it takes less energy to solvate the molecules in amorphous phase. [[In vivo supersaturation|The effect]] of amorphous phase on solubility is widely used to make drugs more soluble. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hsieh |first=Yi-Ling |last2=Ilevbare |first2=Grace A. |last3=Van Eerdenbrugh |first3=Bernard |last4=Box |first4=Karl J. |last5=Sanchez-Felix |first5=Manuel Vincente |last6=Taylor |first6=Lynne S. |date=2012-05-12 |title=pH-Induced Precipitation Behavior of Weakly Basic Compounds: Determination of Extent and Duration of Supersaturation Using Potentiometric Titration and Correlation to Solid State Properties |journal=Pharmaceutical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=2738\u20132753 |doi=10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8 |pmid=22580905 |issn=0724-8741}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dengale |first=Swapnil Jayant |last2=Grohganz |first2=Holger |last3=Rades |first3=Thomas |last4=L\u00f6bmann |first4=Korbinian |date=May 2016 |title=Recent advances in co-amorphous drug formulations |journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews |volume=100 |pages=116\u2013125 |doi=10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009 |pmid=26805787 |issn=0169-409X}}</ref>\n\n=== Particle-size effect ===\nThe thermodynamic solubility constant is defined for large monocrystals. Solubility increases with decreasing size of solute particle (or droplet) because of the additional surface energy. This effect is generally small, unless particles become very small, typically smaller than 1&nbsp;\u03bcm. The effect of the particle size on solubility constant can be quantified as follows:\n\n: <math>\\log(^*K_A) = \\log(^*K_{A \\to 0}) + \\frac{\\gamma A_\\text{m}}{3.454\\,RT},</math>\n\nwhere *''K<sub>A</sub>'' is the solubility constant for the solute particles with the molar surface area ''A'', *''K''<sub>''A''\u21920</sub> is the solubility constant for substance with molar surface area tending to zero (i.e., when the particles are large), ''\u03b3'' is the [[surface tension]] of the solute particle in the solvent, ''A''<sub>m</sub> is the molar surface area of the solute (in m<sup>2</sup>/mol), ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]], and ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]].<ref name=hefter>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hefter |editor1-first=G.

Section 2.14.</ref> ([[salting in]] and [[salting out]]) refers to the fact that the presence of a salt without [[common ion effect|ion in common]] with the solute has an effect on the [[ionic strength]] of the solution and hence on [[activity coefficient]]s, so that the equilibrium constant, expressed as a concentration quotient, changes.\n\n=== Temperature effect ===\n[[File:SolubilityVsTemperature.png|thumb|300px]]\n\nSolubility is sensitive to changes in [[temperature]]. For example, sugar is more soluble in hot water than cool water. It occurs because solubility constants, like other types of equilibrium constants, are functions of temperature. In accordance with [[Le Chatelier's principle]], when the dissolution process is [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]] (heat is absorbed), solubility increases with rising temperature. This effect is the basis for the process of [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], which can be used to purify a chemical compound. When dissolution is [[exothermic]] (heat is released), solubility decreases with rising temperature.<ref name=\"pauling450\">{{cite book |author-link=Linus Pauling |last=Pauling |first= Linus |title=General Chemistry |publisher= Dover Publishing |date= 1970 |page=450}}</ref> \n[[Sodium sulfate]] shows increasing solubility with temperature below about 32.4&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a decreasing solubility at higher temperature.<ref>{{cite book |first = W.\u00a0F. |last = Linke |first2=A. |last2= Seidell |title = Solubilities of Inorganic and Metal Organic Compounds |edition = 4th |publisher = Van Nostrand |year = 1965 |isbn = 0-8412-0097-1}}</ref> This is because the solid phase is the decahydrate ({{Chem|Na|2|S|O|4|\u00b710H|2|O}}) below the transition temperature, but a different hydrate above that temperature.\n\nThe dependence on temperature of solubility for an ideal solution (achieved for low-solubility substances) is given by the following expression containing the enthalpy of melting \u0394<sub>m</sub>''H'' and mole fraction of the solute at saturation:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln x_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = \\frac{\\bar{H}_{i,\\text{aq}}-H_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT^2},</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{H}_{i,\\text{aq}}</math> is the [[partial molar enthalpy]] of the solute at infinite dilution, and <math> H_{i,\\text{cr}}</math> is the enthalpy per mole of the pure crystal.<ref> [[Kenneth Denbigh]], ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', 1957, p. 257.</ref>\n\nThis differential expression for a non-electrolyte can be integrated on a temperature interval to give<ref>[[Peter Atkins]], ''Physical Chemistry'', p. 153 (8th edition).</ref>:\n\n: <math>ln x_i = \\frac{\\Delta_\\text{m} H_i}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right).</math>\n\nFor nonideal solutions, activity of the solute at saturation appears instead of mole fraction solubility in the derivative w.r.t. temperature:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln a_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = \\frac{H_{i,\\text{aq}}-H_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT^2}.</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\n===Pressure effect===\nFor condensed phases (solids and liquids), the pressure dependence of solubility is typically weak and usually neglected in practice. Assuming an [[ideal solution]], the dependence can be quantified as\n\n: <math>\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln x_i}{\\partial P} \\right)_T = -\\frac{\\bar{V}_{i,\\text{aq}} - V_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT},</math>\n\nwhere the index ''i'' iterates the components, ''x<sub>i</sub>'' is the mole fraction of the ''i''-th component in the solution, ''P'' is the pressure, the index ''T'' refers to constant temperature, {{overline|''V''}}<sub>''i'',aq</sub> is the [[partial molar volume]] of the ''i''-th component in the solution, ''V''<sub>''i'',cr</sub> is the partial molar volume of the ''i''-th component in the dissolving solid, and ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]].<ref>{{cite book |first=E. M. |last=Gutman |title=Mechanochemistry of Solid Surfaces |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |date=1994}}</ref>\n\nThe pressure dependence of solubility does occasionally have practical significance. For example, [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|precipitation fouling]] of oil fields and wells by [[calcium sulfate]] (which decreases its solubility with decreasing pressure) can result in decreased productivity with time.\n\n==Simple dissolution==\nDissolution of an '''organic solid''' can be described as an equilibrium between the substance in its solid and dissolved forms. For example, when [[sucrose]] (table sugar) forms a saturated solution\n:C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(s) {{eqm}} C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(aq).\n\nAn equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written, as for any chemical reaction (products over reactants):\n\n:<math>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\left\\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right\\}}{ \\left \\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(s)}\\right\\}}</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sup><s>o</s></sup> is called the thermodynamic solubility constant. The braces indicate [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]]. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, unity. Therefore\n:<math>K^\\ominus = \\left\\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right\\}</math>\nThe activity of a substance, A, in solution can be expressed as the product of the concentration, [A], and an [[activity coefficient]], ''\u03b3''. When ''K''<sup><s>o</s></sup> is divided by ''\u03b3'', the solubility constant, ''K''<sub>s</sub>,\n:<math>K_\\mathrm{s} = \\left[\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right]\\,</math>\nis obtained. This is equivalent to defining the [[standard state]] as the saturated solution so that the activity coefficient is equal to one. The solubility constant is a true constant only if the activity coefficient is not affected by the presence of any other solutes that may be present. The unit of the solubility constant is the same as the unit of the concentration of the solute. For [[sucrose]] ''K''&nbsp;= 1.971&nbsp;mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup> at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C. This shows that the solubility of sucrose at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C is nearly 2&nbsp;mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup> (540&nbsp;g/l). Sucrose is unusual in that it does not easily form a supersaturated solution at higher concentrations, as do most other [[carbohydrate]]s.\n\n==Dissolution with dissociation==\n'''Ionic compounds''' normally [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into their constituent ions when they dissolve in water. For example, for [[silver chloride]]:\n\n:AgCl<sub>(s)</sub> {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nThe expression for the equilibrium constant for this reaction is:\n\n:<math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}}{ \\left\\{\\ce{AgCl_{(s)}}\\right\\}}\n=\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and braces indicate activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, equal to one.\n\nWhen the solubility of the salt is very low the activity coefficients of the ions in solution are nearly equal to one. By setting them to be actually equal to one this expression reduces to the '''solubility product''' expression:\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{Ag+}][\\ce{Cl-}]= [\\ce{Ag+}]^2= [\\ce{Cl-}]^2.\\,</math>\n\nFor 2:2 and 3:3 salts, such as CaSO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub>, the general expression for the solubility product is the same as for a 1:1 electrolyte\n:AB {{eqm}} A<sup>''p''+</sup> + B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup>\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A][B] = [A]<sup>2</sup> = [B]<sup>2</sup> (electrical charges are omitted in general expressions, for simplicity of notation)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for an unsymmetrical salt like CaCl<sub>2</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>) is given by\n:A<sub>''p''</sub>B<sub>''q''</sub> {{eqm}} ''p''&nbsp;A<sup>''q''+</sup> + ''q''&nbsp;B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup> \nA solute like Sn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is a 1:2 electrolyte like CaCl<sub>2</sub>, so a more complicated expression is needed for the solution equilibrium as the ionic charges are Sn<sup>4+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The solubility product, however, depends only on stoichiometry and is given by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A]<sup>''p''</sup>[B]<sup>''q''</sup>\nWhen the product dissociates the concentration of B is equal to ''{{sfrac|q|p}}'' times the concentration of A. \n:[B] = ''{{sfrac|q|p}}''[A]\nTherefore\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{A}]^p \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q [\\ce{A}]^q =\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q[\\ce{A}]^{p+q}</math>\n:<math chem>[\\ce{A}] = \\sqrt[p+q]{K_\\ce{sp} \\over {\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q}}</math>\nThe solubility, ''S'' is {{sfrac|''p''}}[A].

The smaller the value, or the more negative the log value, the lower the solubility.\n\nSome salts are not fully dissociated in solution.

For example, the solubility of [[silver chloride]], AgCl, is lowered when sodium chloride, a source of the common ion chloride, is added to a suspension of AgCl in water.<ref>{{Housecroft3rd}} Section 6.10.</ref>\n: AgCl(s) {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq); {{spaces|5}}''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [Ag<sup>+</sup>][Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]\nThe solubility, ''S'', in the absence of a common ion can be calculated as follows. The concentrations [Ag<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>] are equal because one mole of AgCl dissociates into one mole of Ag<sup>+</sup> and one mole of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. Let the concentration of [Ag<sup>+</sup>](aq) be denoted by ''x''.\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''<sup>2</sup>;{{spaces|5}} ''S'' = ''x'' = {{sqrt|''K''<sub>sp</sub>}}\n''K''<sub>sp</sub> for AgCl is equal to {{val|1.77|e=-10|u=mol<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22126</sup>}} at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, so the solubility is {{val|1.33|e=-5|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}.\n\nNow suppose that sodium chloride is also present, at a concentration of 0.01&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup>. The solubility, ignoring any possible effect of the sodium ions, is now calculated by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''(0.01 + ''x'')\nThis is a quadratic equation in ''x'', which is also equal to the solubility. \n:''x''<sup>2</sup> + 0.01''x'' \u2212 ''K''<sub>sp</sub> = 0\nIn the case of silver chloride ''x''<sup>2</sup> is very much smaller than 0.01''x'', so this term can be ignored. Therefore\n:''S'' = ''x'' = {{sfrac|''K''<sub>sp</sub>|0.01}} = {{val|1.77|e=-8|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}},\na considerable reduction. In [[gravimetric analysis]] for silver, the reduction in solubility due to the common ion effect is used to ensure \"complete\" precipitation of AgCl.\n\n== Dissolution with reaction ==\n[[File:Silver Chloride dissolution.png|thumb|180px| When a concentrated solution of ammonia is added to a suspension of silver chloride dissolution occurs because a complex of Ag<sup>+</sup> is formed]]\nA typical reaction with dissolution involves a [[weak base]], B, dissolving in an acidic aqueous solution.\n: B(s) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq) {{eqm}} BH<sup>+</sup> (aq)\nThis reaction is very important for pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |title=Potential Of Solubility In Drug Discovery And development |last=Payghan |first=Santosh |year=2008 |publisher=Pharminfo.net |accessdate=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330171700/http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |archivedate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref> Dissolution of weak acids in alkaline media is similarly important. \n:H<sub>''n''</sub>A(s) + OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) {{eqm}} H<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>A<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe uncharged molecule usually has lower solubility than the ionic form, so solubility depends on pH and the [[acid dissociation constant]] of the solute.

With very insoluble substances, the concentrations in solution are very low and difficult to determine. The methods used fall broadly into two categories, static and dynamic.\n\n=== Static methods ===\nIn static methods a mixture is brought to equilibrium and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by [[chemical analysis]]. This usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases. In order to do this the equilibration and separation should be performed in a thermostatted room.<ref>{{cite book|first1=F. J.

The solubility measured for such a mixture is known as \"kinetic solubility\". The cloudiness is due to the fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in [[Tyndall scattering]]. In fact the particles are so small that the [[#Particle size effect|particle size effect]] comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility.

The advantage of this method is that it is relatively fast as the quantity of precipitate formed is quite small.

The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the solvent, such as acid or alkali. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent [[equilibrium constant]]. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios.\n\n== Definitions ==\nA solubility equilibrium exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The equilibrium is an example of [[dynamic equilibrium]] in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] are equal to one another. When equilibrium is established, the solution is said to be saturated. The [[concentration]] of the solute in a saturated solution is known as the [[solubility]]. Units of solubility may be molar (mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>) or expressed as mass per unit volume, such as \u03bcg&nbsp;ml<sup>\u22121</sup>. Solubility is temperature dependent. A solution containing a higher concentration of solute than the solubility is said to be [[supersaturation|supersaturated]]. A supersaturated solution may be induced to come to equilibrium by the addition of a \"seed\" which may be a tiny crystal of the solute, or a tiny solid particle, which initiates precipitation.\n\nThere are three main types of solubility equilibria.\n# Simple dissolution.\n# Dissolution with dissociation reaction. This is characteristic of [[salts]]. The equilibrium constant is known in this case as a solubility product.\n# Dissolution with ionization reaction. This is characteristic of the dissolution of [[weak acid]]s or [[weak base]]s in aqueous media of varying [[pH]].\n\nIn each case an [[equilibrium constant]] can be specified as a quotient of [[activity (chemistry)|activities]]. This equilibrium constant is [[dimensionless]] as activity is a dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See [[equilibrium chemistry#Equilibrium constant]] for details. Moreover, the concentration of solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants defined in terms of concentrations are not only temperature dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.\n\n=== Phase effect ===\nEquilibria are defined for specific crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. Therefore, the solubility product is expected to be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, [[aragonite]] and [[calcite]] will have different solubility products even though they have both the same chemical identity ([[calcium carbonate]]). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a [[metastable]] state. \n\nIn pharmacology, the metastable state is sometimes referred to as amorphous state. Amorphous drugs have higher solubility than their crystalline counterparts due to the absence of long-distance interactions inherent in crystal lattice. Thus, it takes less energy to solvate the molecules in amorphous phase. [[In vivo supersaturation|The effect]] of amorphous phase on solubility is widely used to make drugs more soluble. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh|first=Yi-Ling|last2=Ilevbare|first2=Grace A.|last3=Van Eerdenbrugh|first3=Bernard|last4=Box|first4=Karl J.|last5=Sanchez-Felix|first5=Manuel Vincente|last6=Taylor|first6=Lynne S.|date=2012-05-12|title=pH-Induced Precipitation Behavior of Weakly Basic Compounds: Determination of Extent and Duration of Supersaturation Using Potentiometric Titration and Correlation to Solid State Properties|journal=Pharmaceutical Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=10|pages=2738\u20132753|doi=10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8|pmid=22580905|issn=0724-8741}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dengale|first=Swapnil Jayant|last2=Grohganz|first2=Holger|last3=Rades|first3=Thomas|last4=L\u00f6bmann|first4=Korbinian|date=May 2016|title=Recent advances in co-amorphous drug formulations|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|volume=100|pages=116\u2013125|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009|pmid=26805787|issn=0169-409X}}</ref>\n\n=== Particle size effect ===\nThe thermodynamic solubility constant is defined for large monocrystals. Solubility will increase with decreasing size of solute particle (or droplet) because of the additional surface energy. This effect is generally small unless particles become very small, typically smaller than 1 \u03bcm. The effect of the particle size on solubility constant can be quantified as follows:\n\n:<math>\\log(^*K_{A}) = \\log(^*K_{A \\to 0}) + \\frac{\\gamma A_\\mathrm{m}} {3.454RT}</math>\n\nwhere *''K<sub>A</sub>'' is the solubility constant for the solute particles with the molar surface area ''A'', *''K''<sub>''A''\u21920</sub> is the solubility constant for substance with molar surface area tending to zero (i.e., when the particles are large), ''\u03b3'' is the [[surface tension]] of the solute particle in the solvent, ''A''<sub>m</sub> is the molar surface area of the solute (in m<sup>2</sup>/mol), ''R ''is the [[universal gas constant]], and ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]].<ref name=hefter>{{cite book|editor1-last=Hefter|editor1-first=G.

For example, sugar is more soluble in hot water than cool water. It occurs because solubility constants, like other types of equilibrium constants, are functions of temperature. In accordance with [[Le Chatelier's Principle]], when the dissolution process is [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]] (heat is absorbed), solubility increases with rising temperature. This effect is the basis for the process of [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], which can be used to purify a chemical compound. When dissolution is [[exothermic]] (heat is released) solubility decreases with rising temperature.<ref name=\"pauling450\">{{cite book|author-link=Linus Pauling|last=Pauling|first= Linus|title=General Chemistry|publisher= Dover Publishing|date= 1970 |page=450}}</ref> \n[[Sodium sulfate]] shows increasing solubility with temperature below about 32.4&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a decreasing solubility at higher temperature.<ref>{{cite book|first = W.F.|last = Linke|first2=A.|last2= Seidell |title = Solubilities of Inorganic and Metal Organic Compounds|edition = 4th|publisher = Van Nostrand|year = 1965|isbn = 0-8412-0097-1}}</ref> This is because the solid phase is the decahydrate ({{Chem|Na|2|S|O|4|\u00b710H|2|O}}) below the transition temperature, but a different hydrate above that temperature.\n\nThe dependence on temperature of solubility for an ideal solution (achieved for low solubility substances) is given by the following expression containing the enthalpy of melting \u0394<sub>m</sub>H and mole fraction of the solute at saturation:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln x_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P= \\frac{\\bar{H}_{i,\\mathrm{aq}}-H_{i,\\mathrm{cr}}}{RT^2}</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\nwhere <math> \\bar{H}_{i,\\mathrm{aq}}</math> is the [[partial molar enthalpy]] of the solute at infinite dilution and  <math> H_{i,\\mathrm{cr}}</math> the enthalpy per mole of the pure crystal.<ref> [[Kenneth Denbigh]], ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', 1957, p. 257</ref>\n\nThis differential expression for a non-electrolyte can be integrated on a temperature interval to give<ref>[[Peter Atkins]], ''Physical Chemistry'', p. 153 (8th edition)</ref>:\n\n:<math> ln x_i=\\frac{\\Delta _m H_i}{R}  \\left( 1 / T_f -1 / T \\right)</math>\n\nFor nonideal solutions activity of the solute at saturation appears instead of mole fraction solubility in the derivative w.r.t. temperature:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln a_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P= \\frac{H_{i,\\mathrm{aq}}-H_{i,\\mathrm{cr}}}{RT^2}</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\n===Pressure effect===\nFor condensed phases (solids and liquids), the pressure dependence of solubility is typically weak and usually neglected in practice.

M.|last=Gutman|title=Mechanochemistry of Solid Surfaces|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|date=1994}}</ref>\n\nThe pressure dependence of solubility does occasionally have practical significance. For example, [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|precipitation fouling]] of oil fields and wells by [[calcium sulfate]] (which decreases its solubility with decreasing pressure) can result in decreased productivity with time.\n\n==Simple dissolution==\nDissolution of an '''organic solid''' can be described as an equilibrium between the substance in its solid and dissolved forms. For example, when [[sucrose]] (table sugar) forms a saturated solution\n:C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(s) {{eqm}} C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(aq).\n\nAn equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written, as for any chemical reaction (products over reactants):\n\n:<math>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\left\\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right\\}}{ \\left \\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(s)}\\right\\}}</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sup><s>o</s></sup> is called the thermodynamic solubility constant. The braces indicate [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]]. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, unity. Therefore\n:<math>K^\\ominus = \\left\\{\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right\\}</math>\nThe activity of a substance, A, in solution can be expressed as the product of the concentration, [A], and an [[activity coefficient]], ''\u03b3''. When ''K''<sup><s>o</s></sup> is divided by ''\u03b3'', the solubility constant, ''K''<sub>s</sub>,\n:<math>K_\\mathrm{s} = \\left[\\mathrm{{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}\\right]\\,</math>\nis obtained. This is equivalent to defining the [[standard state]] as the saturated solution so that the activity coefficient is equal to one. The solubility constant is a true constant only if the activity coefficient is not affected by the presence of any other solutes that may be present. The unit of the solubility constant is the same as the unit of the concentration of the solute. For [[sucrose]] ''K''&nbsp;= 1.971&nbsp;mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup> at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C. This shows that the solubility of sucrose at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C is nearly 2&nbsp;mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup> (540&nbsp;g/l). Sucrose is unusual in that it does not easily form a supersaturated solution at higher concentrations, as do most other [[carbohydrate]]s.\n\n==Dissolution with dissociation==\n'''Ionic compounds''' normally [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into their constituent ions when they dissolve in water. For example, for [[silver chloride]]:\n\n:AgCl<sub>(s)</sub> {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nThe expression for the equilibrium constant for this reaction is:\n\n:<math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}}{ \\left\\{\\ce{AgCl_{(s)}}\\right\\}}\n=\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and braces indicate activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, equal to one.\n\nWhen the solubility of the salt is very low the activity coefficients of the ions in solution are nearly equal to one. By setting them to be actually equal to one this expression reduces to the '''solubility product''' expression:\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{Ag+}][\\ce{Cl-}]= [\\ce{Ag+}]^2= [\\ce{Cl-}]^2.\\,</math>\n\nFor 2:2 and 3:3 salts, such as CaSO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub>, the general expression for the solubility product is the same as for a 1:1 electrolyte\n:AB {{eqm}} A<sup>''p''+</sup> + B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup>\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A][B] = [A]<sup>2</sup> = [B]<sup>2</sup> (electrical charges are omitted in general expressions, for simplicity of notation)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for an unsymmetrical salt like CaCl<sub>2</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>) is given by\n:A<sub>''p''</sub>B<sub>''q''</sub> {{eqm}} ''p''&nbsp;A<sup>''q''+</sup> + ''q''&nbsp;B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup> \nA solute like Sn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is a 1:2 electrolyte like CaCl<sub>2</sub>, so a more complicated expression is needed for the solution equilibrium as the ionic charges are Sn<sup>4+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The solubility product, however, depends only on stoichiometry and is given by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A]<sup>''p''</sup>[B]<sup>''q''</sup>\nWhen the product dissociates the concentration of B is equal to ''{{sfrac|q|p}}'' times the concentration of A. \n:[B] = ''{{sfrac|q|p}}''[A]\nTherefore\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{A}]^p \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q [\\ce{A}]^q =\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q[\\ce{A}]^{p+q}</math>\n:<math chem>[\\ce{A}] = \\sqrt[p+q]{K_\\ce{sp} \\over {\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q}}</math>\nThe solubility, ''S'' is {{sfrac|''p''}}[A].

For example, the solubility of [[silver chloride]], AgCl, is lowered when sodium chloride, a source of the common ion chloride, is added to a suspension of AgCl in water.<ref>{{Housecroft3rd}} Section 6.10.</ref>\n: AgCl(s) {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq); {{spaces|5}}''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [Ag<sup>+</sup>][Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]\nThe solubility, ''S'', in the absence of a common ion can be calculated as follows. The concentrations [Ag<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>] are equal because one mole of AgCl dissociates into one mole of Ag<sup>+</sup> and one mole of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. Let the concentration of [Ag<sup>+</sup>](aq) be denoted by ''x''.\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''<sup>2</sup>;{{spaces|5}} ''S'' = ''x'' = {{sqrt|''K''<sub>sp</sub>}}\n''K''<sub>sp</sub> for AgCl is equal to {{val|1.77|e=-10|u=mol<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22126</sup>}} at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, so the solubility is {{val|1.33|e=-5|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}.\n\nNow suppose that sodium chloride is also present, at a concentration of 0.01&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup>. The solubility, ignoring any possible effect of the sodium ions, is now calculated by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''(0.01 + ''x'')\nThis is a quadratic equation in ''x'', which is also equal to the solubility. \n:''x''<sup>2</sup> + 0.01''x'' \u2212 ''K''<sub>sp</sub> = 0\nIn the case of silver chloride ''x''<sup>2</sup> is very much smaller than 0.01''x'', so this term can be ignored. Therefore\n:''S'' = ''x'' = {{sfrac|''K''<sub>sp</sub>|0.01}} = {{val|1.77|e=-8|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}},\na considerable reduction.

A well-known example, is the addition of a concentrated solution of [[ammonia]] to a suspension of [[silver chloride]], in which dissolution is favoured by the formation of an ammine complex.\n:AgCl(s) + 2&nbsp;NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) {{eqm}} [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq)\nAnother example involves the addition of [[water softener]]s to washing powders to inhibit the precipitation of salts of magnesium and calcium ions, which are present in [[hard water]], by forming complexes with them.\n\nThe calculation of solubility in these cases requires two or more simultaneous equilibria to be considered. For example,\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Intrinsic solubility equilibrium\n| B(s) {{eqm}} B(aq)\n| ''K''<sub>s</sub> = [B(aq)] \n|-\n!Acid\u2013base equilibrium\n| B(aq) + H<sup>+</sup>(aq) {{eqm}} BH<sup>+</sup>(aq)\n| ''K''<sub>a</sub> = [B(aq)][H<sup>+</sup>(aq)]/[BH<sup>+</sup>(aq)] \n|}\n\n== Experimental determination ==\nThe determination of solubility is fraught with difficulties.<ref name=hefter/> First and foremost is the difficulty in establishing that the system is in equilibrium at the chosen temperature. This is because both precipitation and dissolution reactions may be extremely slow. If the process is very slow solvent evaporation may be an issue. Supersaturation may occur. With very insoluble substances, the concentrations in solution are very low and difficult to determine. The methods used fall broadly into two categories, static and dynamic.\n\n=== Static methods ===\nIn static methods a mixture is brought to equilibrium and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by [[chemical analysis]]. This usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases. In order to do this the equilibration and separation should be performed in a thermostatted room.<ref>{{cite book|first1=F. J. C. |last1=Rossotti |first2=H. |last2=Rossotti |title=The Determination of Stability Constants |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1961 |chapter=Chapter 9: Solubility}}</ref> Very low concentrations can be measured if a [[radioactive]] tracer is incorporated in the solid phase.\n\nA variation of the static method is to add a solution of the substance in a non-aqueous solvent, such as [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], to an aqueous [[Buffer solution|buffer]] mixture.\n<ref>Aqueous solubility measurement \u2013 kinetic vs. thermodynamic methods {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711083258/http://www.moleculardevices.com/pdfs/pIon.pdf |date=July 11, 2009 }}</ref> Immediate precipitation may occur giving a cloudy mixture. The solubility measured for such a mixture is known as \"kinetic solubility\". The cloudiness is due to the fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in [[Tyndall scattering]]. In fact the particles are so small that the [[#Particle size effect|particle size effect]] comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process known as precipitate ageing.<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}} Chapter 11: Gravimetric analysis</ref>\n\n=== Dynamic methods ===\nSolubility values of organic acids, bases, and ampholytes of pharmaceutical interest may be obtained by a process called \"Chasing equilibrium solubility\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stuart|first=M.|last2=Box|first2=K. |year=2005|title=Chasing Equilibrium: Measuring the Intrinsic Solubility of Weak Acids and Bases|journal=Anal.

Subsequently, the rate of change of pH due to precipitation or dissolution is monitored and strong acid and base titrant are added to adjust the pH to discover the equilibrium conditions when the two rates are equal. The advantage of this method is that it is relatively fast as the quantity of precipitate formed is quite small. However, the performance of the method may be affected by the formation supersaturated solutions.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Solubility table]]: A table of solubilities of mostly inorganic salts at temperatures between 0 and 100&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n* [[Molar solubility]]: The number of moles of a substance (the solute) that can be dissolved per liter of solution before the solution becomes saturated.\n* [[Solvent models]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Housecroft3rd}} Section 6.9: Solubilities of ionic salts.

Toba Tek Singh was the only city other than Karachi where Fatima Jinnah's Muslim League won a seat, and Hamza became the member of parliament. Hamza used to hold public protests across the country during the [[1968 movement in Pakistan|1968 Movement in Pakistan]] against military regime of Ayub Khan and was taken into custody in numerous occasions. President Ayub Khan resigned in the face of growing public protests, and was succeeded by General Yahya Khan. He stood against the Marshal Law of General Yahya Khan and was frontline leader for the civil democracy in Pakistan.\n\nHe was a very fierce opposition to the ruling party of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the 70's. Hamza was amongst the prominent leaders of [[Pakistan National Alliance]] (PNA), a nine party coalition against the ruling party of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]].

Corbett held 500 shares, Henry Failing 250 and his father Josiah 50.<ref>Corbett and the Failings had then immediately increased the bank\u2019s then capitalisation from $100,000 to $250,000 (which was further increased by the owners over succeeding years). ''Merchants, Money and Power: The Portland Establishment, 1843-1913''. E. Kimbark MacColl with Harry H. Stein, The Georgian Press, 1988, p. 149</ref>\n\nThe First National Bank of Portland had been the only bank in Portland (and for a long time the only one west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]) that was chartered under the [[National Banking Act]].<ref>The National Banking Act of 1863 required nationally chartered banks to hold one third of the capital of the bank in US Treasury bonds. It allowed them in return to issue a uniform bank note backed by the bonds. The amount of the notes not to exceed 90 percent of the value of the bonds.</ref> The act was intended to make banking safer and guarantee the value of bank notes in effect creating a nationwide currency.<ref>In 1865 the U.S. Congress enacted a 10 percent tax on any bank or individual using state bank notes. As a result, a number of banks converted to national charters, but many simply stopped issuing notes. Instead, demand deposit money was introduced \u2014 checking accounts.</ref> There was no state-banking act in Oregon until 1907 so other banks at the time were strictly private proprietorships taking deposits and lending money without regulation.<ref>''Oregon Argonauts: Merchant Adventurers on the Western Frontier''. Arthur L. Throckmorton, Oregon Historical Society, 1961, p. 313.</ref> The First National was the exception from its outset.\n\nOn their purchase, Henry Failing had become President of the bank, Henry W. Corbett the Vice-President. Failing held the position until his unexpected death in 1898 when Corbett assumed the President\u2019s role until his own death in 1903.<ref name=\"auto1\">''The Growth of a City: Power and Politics in Portland, Oregon !915 to 1950'', E.Kimbark MacColl, Georgian Press,Portland, Oregon, 1979.</ref>\n\nElliott Corbett looked after the interests of the Corbett brothers in the Bank on behalf of the Corbett estate and also served as Vice-President and a director of the bank.\n[[File:First_National_Bank_Building%2C_Portland%2C_Oregon_-_Marlitt.jpg|left|thumb|[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|The First National Bank Building]].<br>Built in 1916 when Elliott Corbett was responsible for the ownership.<br> (Michael Marlitt photo 2018)]]\nOn H.W. Corbett's death Abbot L. Mills was appointed President and the bank continued to prosper and grow. He retired in 1927. C.F. Adams succeeded him as President from 1927 until 1932.\n\nThe Bank grew solidly under the Mills and Corbett stewardship and soon had outgrown its quarters, so they constructed a new building as its main office. In 1916 the new [[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] was opened at 401\u2013409 SW 5th Avenue, Portland.<ref>[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] architect was Coolidge and Shattuck of Boston. Its design may have been influenced by the classicism of Henry Bacon's marble Lincoln Memorial classicism that had made an impact at the time when the memorial plans were unveiled for it in 1914 (although it was not completed and dedicated until 1922).</ref> The building became known as \"The Marble Temple\".<ref>[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] is now listed on The [[National Register of Historic Places]].</ref>\n\nAfter Mills' retirement and when his successor C.F. Adams was nearing retirement, Elliott Corbett needed to prepare a successor to Adams. Since 1911 the Strong and McNaughton Trust Company had managed the properties of the Corbett estate. So in 1928 Elliott Corbett offered their Trust a merger with the First National's Security and Saving Trust Company.<ref>Brother Hamilton F. Corbett was president of The Security and Saving Trust Company.</ref> He also offered the position of a bank vice-president to MacNaughton. MacNaughton accepted Corbett's offer,<ref>E.B. McNaughton later succeeded as President when the bank changed ownership.</ref> although Strong opted to remain in his own Trust business managing the Corbett estate.<ref>''The Growth of a City: Power and Politics in Portland, Oregon 1915 to 1950'', E.Kimbark MacColl, Georgian Press,Portland, Oregon, 1979.</ref>\n\nBanking in Portland, however, would change. The West Coast Bancorp merged with the US National Bank in early 1928. With this development Elliott Corbett knew that to stay ahead of their rivals the Corbetts and the other major stockholders, the Failings and Lewis families, would likely have to inject more capital into the bank to expand. Otherwise they could make a public share offering to increase the bank's capital. Elliott Corbett had been concerned for a while that bank shares were undervalued.  Banking was therefore a less attractive investment than real estate and other opportunities which were opening up to them for the utilisation of their capital. He and the other stockholders were not in favour of increasing its capital by injecting more of their own or in diluting their own shareholdings by issuing more shares through a public offering. During the years since the Corbetts had been involved, the First National bank had been regarded as solidly run and \"typifying the extreme conservatism for which Portland had been celebrated for half a century.\"<ref>Oregon Voter, June 14, 1930</ref>\n\nThe option was therefore open to them to sell the bank. It was an attractive option for the Corbetts and to the other minority stockholders. A ready purchaser was quickly found in the San Francisco based Transamerica, which owned [[Bank of America]] and Bancitaly, which was trying to strengthen its position on the West coast to compete with the New York and East coast banks.<ref>\"The First National of Portland, Oregon, resources $50,000,000 ... purchased.\" ''The Story of Bank of America: Biography of a Bank'', Marquis James, Bessie R. James, published 1954, 2002 reprint, Beard Books, p.310.</ref> An agreement was signed with Transamerica, in June 1930 and completed in 1932.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nAs a result, for the first time in over sixty years the Corbett family no longer controlled a bank in Portland.<ref>Their grandfather William S. Ladd's foundation, The Ladd and Tilton Bank, had already been sold under the presidency of his eldest son William M. Ladd. It had actually been under the control of his brother-in-law [[Frederic B. Pratt]] of New York, who was a part owner of Standard Oil. Elliott Corbett had declined to have the First National Bank take it over because of the risk inherant for the First National Bank when the Ladd and Tilton had got into financial difficulty. The Pratts and William M. Ladd had instead overseen its orderly transition for its depositors who were none the wiser over its difficulties and the fact that a number of family members had protected them at considerable cost. The Ladd and Tilton was amalgamated with the US National Bank in 1924 and its customer accounts safely transferred there.

Wood however took mischievous delight in giving Senator Corbett and other leading businessmen an annual subscription to the ''Masses''. ''Diaries of Judge Matthew P.

Nurse with her hands behind her back walked up and down telling us about Sammy and temptation, or Sammy and lying, or stealing cookies. Sammy would wrestle with the problem. Either God's word saved him from wrong doing, or he would go ahead and do what he knew was wrong. In the latter case Sammy wouldn't rest easy, his conscience wouldn't let him alone until he finally 'fessed up' and made peace with God or whoever it was that he had wronged.<br>\"...I have no idea how long Sunday school lasted, but I can't forget dear Nurse Cochrane, small, plump, marching back and forth, her Scotch accent enhancing the Sammy stories through which the word of God was put before us.\"<br>'' Riverdale School: 1888-1988'', Helen Weiman Bledsoe, Binford & Mort, Portland, Oregon 1988, p.59-60.</ref>\n\n[[File:Caroline Ladd Corbett Macadam 1.jpg|left|thumb|Better exposed image but otherwise same as Caroline Ladd Corbett Macadam|thumb|Caroline Ladd Corbett]]\n\n===Caroline Ladd Corbett===\nBorn 20 September 1910 in Portland Oregon.

They left their other company holdings inherited from their grandfather H. W. Corbett, with experienced managements already in place, such as their holdings in ''Union Pacific Railroad'', the Portland headquartered ''Home Telephone Company'', the ''Oregon Electric Railway'', the ''Oregon Surety and Casualty Company'' and the ''[[Portland Hotel]]'', to largely operate on their own, usually retaining the role of directors (occasionally as officers) or even just passive shareholders so as to free themselves from their active day-to-day management.\n\nThe Corbett Investment Company's offices were located in the Corbett Building, at Southwest Fifth Avenue and Morrison, overlooking the Pioneer Courthouse.<ref>Senator H.

Corbett]] and his brother-in-law [[Henry Failing]] (with his father Josiah Failing) purchased almost all the shares of the Bank. H. W. Corbett held 500 shares, Henry Failing 250 and his father Josiah 50.<ref>Corbett and the Failings had then immediately increased the bank\u2019s then capitalisation from $100,000 to $250,000 (which was further increased by the owners over succeeding years). ''Merchants, Money and Power: The Portland Establishment, 1843-1913''. E. Kimbark MacColl with Harry H. Stein, The Georgian Press, 1988, p. 149</ref>\n\nThe First National Bank of Portland had been the only bank in Portland (and for a long time the only one west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]) that was chartered under the [[National Banking Act]].<ref>The National Banking Act of 1863 required nationally chartered banks to hold one third of the capital of the bank in US Treasury bonds. It allowed them in return to issue a uniform bank note backed by the bonds. The amount of the notes not to exceed 90 percent of the value of the bonds.</ref> The act was intended to make banking safer and guarantee the value of bank notes in effect creating a nationwide currency.<ref>In 1865 the U.S. Congress enacted a 10 percent tax on any bank or individual using state bank notes. As a result, a number of banks converted to national charters, but many simply stopped issuing notes. Instead, demand deposit money was introduced \u2014 checking accounts.</ref> There was no state-banking act in Oregon until 1907 so other banks at the time were strictly private proprietorships taking deposits and lending money without regulation.<ref>''Oregon Argonauts: Merchant Adventurers on the Western Frontier''. Arthur L. Throckmorton, Oregon Historical Society, 1961, p. 313.</ref> The First National was the exception from its outset.\n\nOn their purchase, Henry Failing had become President of the bank, Henry W. Corbett the Vice-President. Failing held the position until his unexpected death in 1898 when Corbett assumed the President\u2019s role until his own death in 1903.<ref name=\"auto1\">''The Growth of a City: Power and Politics in Portland, Oregon !915 to 1950'', E.Kimbark MacColl, Georgian Press,Portland, Oregon, 1979.</ref>\n\nElliott Corbett looked after the interests of the Corbett brothers in the Bank on behalf of the Corbett estate and also served as Vice-President and a director of the bank.\n[[File:First_National_Bank_Building%2C_Portland%2C_Oregon_-_Marlitt.jpg|left|thumb|[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|The First National Bank Building]].<br>Built in 1916 when Elliott Corbett was responsible for the ownership.<br> (Michael Marlitt photo 2018)]]\nOn H.W. Corbett's death Abbot L. Mills was appointed President and the bank continued to prosper and grow. He retired in 1927. C.F. Adams succeeded him as President from 1927 until 1932.\n\nThe Bank grew solidly under the Mills and Corbett stewardship and soon had outgrown its quarters, so they constructed a new building as its main office. In 1916 the new [[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] was opened at 401\u2013409 SW 5th Avenue, Portland.<ref>[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] architect was Coolidge and Shattuck of Boston. Its design may have been influenced by the classicism of Henry Bacon's marble Lincoln Memorial classicism that had made an impact at the time when the memorial plans were unveiled for it in 1914 (although it was not completed and dedicated until 1922).</ref> The building became known as \"The Marble Temple\".<ref>[[First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon)|First National Bank building]] is now listed on The [[National Register of Historic Places]].</ref>\n\nAfter Mills' retirement and when his successor C.F. Adams was nearing retirement, Elliott Corbett needed to prepare a successor to Adams. Since 1911 the Strong and McNaughton Trust Company had managed the properties of the Corbett estate. So in 1928 Elliott Corbett offered their Trust a merger with the First National's Security and Saving Trust Company.<ref>Brother Hamilton F. Corbett was president of The Security and Saving Trust Company.</ref> He also offered the position of a bank vice-president to MacNaughton. MacNaughton accepted Corbett's offer,<ref>E.B. McNaughton later succeeded as President when the bank changed ownership.</ref> although Strong opted to remain in his own Trust business managing the Corbett estate.<ref>''The Growth of a City: Power and Politics in Portland, Oregon 1915 to 1950'', E.Kimbark MacColl, Georgian Press,Portland, Oregon, 1979.</ref>\n\nBanking in Portland, however, would change. The West Coast Bancorp merged with the US National Bank in early 1928. With this development Elliott Corbett knew that to stay ahead of their rivals the Corbetts and the other major stockholders, the Failings and Lewis families, would likely have to inject more capital into the bank to expand. Otherwise they could make a public share offering to increase the bank's capital. Elliott Corbett had been concerned for a while that bank shares were undervalued.  Banking was therefore a less attractive investment than real estate and other opportunities which were opening up to them for the utilisation of their capital. He and the other stockholders were not in favour of increasing its capital by injecting more of their own or in diluting their own shareholdings by issuing more shares through a public offering. During the years since the Corbetts had been involved, the First National bank had been regarded as solidly run and \"typifying the extreme conservatism for which Portland had been celebrated for half a century.\"<ref>Oregon Voter, June 14, 1930</ref>\n\nThe option was therefore open to them to sell the bank. It was an attractive option for the Corbetts and to the other minority stockholders. A ready purchaser was quickly found in the San Francisco based Transamerica, which owned [[Bank of America]] and Bancitaly, which was trying to strengthen its position on the West coast to compete with the New York and East coast banks.<ref>\"The First National of Portland, Oregon, resources $50,000,000 ... purchased.\" ''The Story of Bank of America: Biography of a Bank'', Marquis James, Bessie R. James, published 1954, 2002 reprint, Beard Books, p.310.</ref> An agreement was signed with Transamerica, in June 1930 and completed in 1932.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nAs a result, for the first time in over sixty years the Corbett family no longer controlled a bank in Portland.<ref>Their grandfather William S. Ladd's foundation, The Ladd and Tilton Bank, had already been sold under the presidency of his eldest son William M. Ladd. It had actually been under the control of his brother-in-law [[Frederic B. Pratt]] of New York, who was a part owner of Standard Oil. Elliott Corbett had declined to have the First National Bank take it over because of the risk inherant for the First National Bank when the Ladd and Tilton had got into financial difficulty. The Pratts and William M. Ladd had instead overseen its orderly transition for its depositors who were none the wiser over its difficulties and the fact that a number of family members had protected them at considerable cost. The Ladd and Tilton was amalgamated with the US National Bank in 1924 and its customer accounts safely transferred there.

So it did not stand in the way of a close personal friendship with Corbett and most of the leading families whose businesses he continued, as their lawyer, to represent. Wood however took mischievous delight in giving Senator Corbett and other leading businessmen an annual subscription to the ''Masses''. ''Diaries of Judge Matthew P.

In 1897 Peter French was shot dead: the assailant, was a homesteader in the area who had petitioned for a road and felt it had been denied by the courts through French's influence. Upon French's death, the P ranch became the property of their various heirs but the \"Wild West\" and the P Ranch debts seemed to have been too much for them.

In his son's biography of his father he describes camping at the P Ranch camp his father had set up there on his 21st birthday in 1900 but that was six years before the Corbett purchase. There is no reference to his father's part ownership of the P Ranch in the book.

They soon had increasing numbers of cattle on the range again. Between 1907 and 1913 the company built 17 and a half miles of new channels from the Donner and Blitzen Rivers in order to improve drainage of the wetlands. They also authorised construction of eight miles of the Busse Ditch and four miles of the Stubblefield Ditch to improve water distribution in the north end of the valley.<ref name=\"auto3\">''Malheur's legacy : celebrating a century of conservation, 1908-2008: Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Southeast Oregon.''

He was offered sausage for breakfast which he declined saying no one should eat sausage because of the indescribable horrors of what might be in the product. He was assured the sausage came from pigs grown on the ranch and hand made by the cook. He changed his mind and enjoyed his breakfast sausage.\" '' Reminiscences of Kate Morgan, granddaughter of the Henry L. Corbetts, 6 February 2016, Elliott. R.

This was twenty-two years after their original investment and the brothers were apparently relieved to dispose of their remaining shares in the company to Swift as by then it was a losing proposition. Even the Swifts, as leading meatpackers, found it difficult to run profitably from 1928 until 1935 when they finally sold it to the US Government.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n[[File:Frenchglen_Hotel_-_Frenchglen_Oregon.jpg|thumb|[[Frenchglen Hotel State Heritage Site|The Frenchglen Hotel]] that the Corbetts' Eastern Oregon Livestock Company built at the P Ranch.<br> (Photo: Ian Pellet)]]\nThe P Ranch was sold to the Federal government because the government needed the Blitzen Valley water rights to protect water levels on the Malheur Lake Bird Reservation.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> A part of the property is now the [[Malheur National Wildlife Refuge]] and the rest is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]].

Miss Lefler played the piano. 'Onward Christian Soldiers' we did with gusto. One little girl reported to her mother...that we sang a song about their dog. The hymn was 'Holy, holy, holy'. The dog's name was Oley. After the hymn we would settle down for a talk by Nurse Cochrane. The talk was generally about a small boy named Sammy. Nurse with her hands behind her back walked up and down telling us about Sammy and temptation, or Sammy and lying, or stealing cookies. Sammy would wrestle with the problem. Either God's word saved him from wrong doing, or he would go ahead and do what he knew was wrong. In the latter case Sammy wouldn't rest easy, his conscience wouldn't let him alone until he finally 'fessed up' and made peace with God or whoever it was that he had wronged.<br>\"...I have no idea how long Sunday school lasted, but I can't forget dear Nurse Cochrane, small, plump, marching back and forth, her Scotch accent enhancing the Sammy stories through which the word of God was put before us.\"<br>'' Riverdale School: 1888-1988'', Helen Weiman Bledsoe, Binford & Mort, Portland, Oregon 1988, p.59-60.</ref>\n\n[[File:Caroline Ladd Corbett Macadam 1.jpg|left|thumb|Better exposed image but otherwise same as Caroline Ladd Corbett Macadam|thumb|Caroline Ladd Corbett]]\n\n===Caroline Ladd Corbett===\nBorn 20 September 1910 in Portland Oregon.

An area which used to seem quite a distance from Portland became a pleasant area to bring up large families.\n\nThe Elliott Corbett's five daughters were brought up there. After the three eldest were married and the two younger were away at College, Elliott took off part of the west end in 1939, including the large formal living room, and the second and third floor above it <ref>Letters and photographs detailing alterations from Elliott Corbett to his daughter Caroline Macadam.<br>Archive of weekly letters from Elliott R.Corbett and Alta S.

With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the most significant American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant impact on popular music.  \n\nHe is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricists [[Lorenz Hart]], with whom he wrote several musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', ''[[On Your Toes]]'' and ''[[Babes in Arms]],'' and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused around characters and drama rather than the light-hearted entertainment that the genre was known for beforehand. \n\nRodgers was the first person to win what is considered the top American entertainment awards in television, recording, movies, and Broadway \u2013 an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award]] \u2014 now known collectively as an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]]. In addition, he was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]], making him one of only two people to receive all five awards ([[Marvin Hamlisch]] is the other). \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nBorn into a prosperous German Jewish family in [[Arverne, Queens]], New York City, Rodgers was the son of Mamie (Levy) and Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky. Richard began playing the piano at the age of six. He attended P.S. 166, Townsend Harris Hall and [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam ([[Waterford, Maine]]) where he composed some of his first songs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hyland-rodgers.html Hyland, William G: ''Richard Rodgers''] ''The New York Times'', Chapter 1.

At Columbia, Rodgers joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers shifted his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now the [[Juilliard School]]).<ref>Richard Rodgers, ''Musical Stages: An Autobiography'' (2002 Reissue),  pp. 12,20\u201321,44, DaCapo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81134-0}}</ref> Rodgers was influenced by composers such as [[Victor Herbert]] and [[Jerome Kern]], as well as by the [[operetta]]s his parents took him to see on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] when he was a child.\n\n===Career===\n\n====Rodgers and Hart====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hart}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Rodgers (seated) with [[Lorenz Hart]] in 1936.]]\nIn 1919, Richard met [[Lorenz Hart]], thanks to Phillip Levitt, a friend of Richard's older brother. [[Rodgers and Hart]] struggled for years in the field of musical comedy, writing several amateur shows. They made their professional debut with the song \"Any Old Place With You\", featured in the 1919 Broadway musical comedy ''A Lonely Romeo''. Their first professional production was the 1920 ''[[Poor Little Ritz Girl]]'', which also had music by [[Sigmund Romberg]]. Their next professional show, ''The Melody Man'', did not premiere until 1924.\n\nWhen he was just out of college Rodgers worked as musical director for [[Lew Fields]]. Among the stars he accompanied were [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Fred Allen]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VVpeiKxbHk Rodgers & Hammerstein as mystery guests on What's My Line?], Feb 19, 1956, video on YouTube</ref> Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, when he and Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious [[Theatre Guild]], called ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Only meant to run one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit \u2014 the song that Rodgers believed \"made\" Rodgers and Hart \u2014 was \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]\". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.\n\nThroughout the rest of the decade, the duo wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London, including ''[[Dearest Enemy]]'' (1925), ''[[The Girl Friend]]'' (1926), ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'' (1926), ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'' (1927), and ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]'' (1928).  Their 1920s shows produced standards such as \"[[Here in My Arms]]\", \"[[Mountain Greenery]]\", \"[[Blue Room (1926 song)|Blue Room]]\", \"[[My Heart Stood Still]]\" and \"[[You Took Advantage of Me]]\".\n\nWith the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in full swing during the first half of the 1930s, the team sought greener pastures in Hollywood. The hardworking Rodgers later regretted these relatively fallow years, but he and Hart did write some classic songs and film scores while out west, including ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932) (directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who would later direct Rodgers's ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' on Broadway), which introduced three standards: \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\", \"[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]\", and \"[[Isn't It Romantic?]]\". Rodgers also wrote a melody for which Hart wrote three consecutive lyrics which either were cut, not recorded or not a hit. The fourth lyric resulted in one of their most famous songs, \"[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]\". Other film work includes the scores to ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), starring [[George M. Cohan]], ''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum'' (1933), starring [[Al Jolson]], and, in a quick return after having left Hollywood, ''Mississippi'' (1935), starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[W. C. Fields]].\n\nIn 1935, they returned to Broadway and wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows that ended only with Hart's death in 1943. Among the most notable are ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]'' (1935), ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, which included the ballet \"[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]\", choreographed by George Balanchine), ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1938), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938), ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940), and their last original work, ''[[By Jupiter]]'' (1942). Rodgers also contributed to the book on several of these shows.\n\nMany of the songs from these shows are still sung and remembered, including \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1935 song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\", \"[[My Romance (song)|My Romance]]\", \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\", \"[[I'll Tell the Man in the Street]]\", \"[[There's a Small Hotel]]\", \"[[Where or When]]\", \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\", \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\", \"[[Falling in Love with Love]]\", \"[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]\", and \"[[Wait till You See Her]]\".\n\nIn 1939, he wrote the ballet ''Ghost Town'' for the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], with choreography by [[Marc Platt (dancer)|Marc Platoff]].<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1D9173CF930A15753C1A9649C8B63 \"DANCE REVIEW; Rodgers As Ideal Dance Partner\"], ''The New York Times'', October 23, 2002.</ref>\n\n====Rodgers and Hammerstein====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hammerstein}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein at piano-original.jpg|thumb|Rodgers (seated) with Hammerstein, 1945]]\nRodgers' partnership with Hart began having problems because of the lyricist's unreliability and declining health. Rodgers began working with [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he had previously written songs (before ever working with Lorenz Hart). Their first musical, the groundbreaking hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), marked the beginning of the most successful partnership in American musical theatre history. Their work revolutionized the musical form. What was once a collection of songs, dances and comic turns held together by a tenuous plot became a fully integrated piece.\n\nThe team went on to create four more hits that are among the most popular in musical history.

Rodgers composed twelve themes, which Bennett used in preparing the orchestra score for the 26-episode [[World War II]] television documentary ''[[Victory at Sea]]'' (1952\u201353). This [[NBC]] production pioneered the \"compilation documentary\"\u2014programming based on pre-existing footage \u2014 and was eventually broadcast in dozens of countries. The melody of the popular song \"[[No Other Love (1953 song)|No Other Love]]\"was later taken from the ''Victory at Sea'' theme entitled \"Beneath the Southern Cross\".  Rodgers won an [[Emmy]] for the music for the ABC documentary ''[[The Valiant Years|Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years]]'', scored by [[Eddie Sauter]], [[Hershy Kay]], and [[Robert Emmett Dolan]]. Rodgers composed the theme music, \"[[March of the Clowns]]\", for the 1963\u201364 television series ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which ran for 30 episodes. He also contributed the main-title theme for the 1963\u201364 historical anthology television series [[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|''The Great Adventure'']].\n\nIn 1950, [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" Rodgers, Hammerstein, and [[Joshua Logan]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''South Pacific''.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama \"Drama\"].

The show was a minor hit and featured the song, \"[[The Sweetest Sounds (song)|The Sweetest Sounds]]\".\n\nRodgers also wrote both the words and music for two new songs used in the film version of [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']]. (Other songs in that film were from Rodgers and Hammerstein.)\n\nRodgers went on to work with lyricists: [[Stephen Sondheim]] (''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'') who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hammerstein, [[Martin Charnin]] (''[[Two by Two (musical)|Two by Two]],'' ''[[I Remember Mama (musical)|I Remember Mama]]'') and [[Sheldon Harnick]] (''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'').\n\nAt its 1978 commencement ceremonies, [[Barnard College]] awarded Rodgers its highest honor, the [[List of Barnard College people#Recipients of the Medal of Distinction|Barnard Medal of Distinction]].\n\nRodgers was an honoree at the first [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978.\n\nAt the 1979 Tony Awards ceremony\u2014six months before his death\u2014Rodgers was presented the Lawrence Langner Memorial Award for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement in the American Theatre.\n\n====Death and legacy====\nRodgers died in 1979, aged 77, after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a [[laryngectomy]]. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nIn 1990, the 46th Street Theatre was renamed the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] in his memory. In 1999, Rodgers and Hart were each commemorated on United States postage stamps. In 2002, the centennial year of Rodgers' birth was celebrated worldwide with books, retrospectives, performances, new recordings of his music, and a Broadway revival of ''Oklahoma!''. The [[BBC Proms]] that year devoted an entire evening to Rodgers' music, including a concert performance of ''Oklahoma!'' The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] released a new CD that year in tribute to Rodgers, entitled ''My Favorite Things: A Richard Rodgers Celebration''.\n\n[[Alec Wilder]] wrote the following about Rodgers:\n\n{{quote|Of all the writers whose songs are considered and examined in this book, those of Rodgers show the highest degree of consistent excellence, inventiveness, and sophistication ...

With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the most significant American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant impact on popular music.  \n\nHe is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricists [[Lorenz Hart]], with whom he wrote several musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', ''[[On Your Toes]]'' and ''[[Babes in Arms]],'' and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused around characters and drama rather than the light-hearted entertainment that the genre was known for beforehand. \n\nRodgers was the first person to win what is considered the top American entertainment awards in television, recording, movies, and Broadway \u2013 an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award]] \u2014 now known collectively as an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]]. In addition, he was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]], making him one of only two people to receive all five awards ([[Marvin Hamlisch]] is the other). \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nBorn into a prosperous German Jewish family in [[Arverne, Queens]], New York City, Rodgers was the son of Mamie (Levy) and Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky. Richard began playing the piano at the age of six. He attended P.S. 166, Townsend Harris Hall and [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam ([[Waterford, Maine]]) where he composed some of his first songs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hyland-rodgers.html Hyland, William G: ''Richard Rodgers''] ''The New York Times'', Chapter 1. Yale University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}</ref>\n\nRodgers, [[Lorenz Hart]], and later collaborator [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] all attended [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia, Rodgers joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers shifted his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now the [[Juilliard School]]).<ref>Richard Rodgers, ''Musical Stages: An Autobiography'' (2002 Reissue),  pp. 12,20\u201321,44, DaCapo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81134-0}}</ref> Rodgers was influenced by composers such as [[Victor Herbert]] and [[Jerome Kern]], as well as by the [[operetta]]s his parents took him to see on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] when he was a child.\n\n===Career===\n\n====Rodgers and Hart====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hart}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Rodgers (seated) with [[Lorenz Hart]] in 1936.]]\nIn 1919, Richard met [[Lorenz Hart]], thanks to Phillip Levitt, a friend of Richard's older brother. [[Rodgers and Hart]] struggled for years in the field of musical comedy, writing several amateur shows. They made their professional debut with the song \"Any Old Place With You\", featured in the 1919 Broadway musical comedy ''A Lonely Romeo''. Their first professional production was the 1920 ''[[Poor Little Ritz Girl]]'', which also had music by [[Sigmund Romberg]]. Their next professional show, ''The Melody Man'', did not premiere until 1924.\n\nWhen he was just out of college Rodgers worked as musical director for [[Lew Fields]]. Among the stars he accompanied were [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Fred Allen]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VVpeiKxbHk Rodgers & Hammerstein as mystery guests on What's My Line?], Feb 19, 1956, video on YouTube</ref> Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, when he and Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious [[Theatre Guild]], called ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Only meant to run one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit \u2014 the song that Rodgers believed \"made\" Rodgers and Hart \u2014 was \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]\". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.\n\nThroughout the rest of the decade, the duo wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London, including ''[[Dearest Enemy]]'' (1925), ''[[The Girl Friend]]'' (1926), ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'' (1926), ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'' (1927), and ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]'' (1928).  Their 1920s shows produced standards such as \"[[Here in My Arms]]\", \"[[Mountain Greenery]]\", \"[[Blue Room (1926 song)|Blue Room]]\", \"[[My Heart Stood Still]]\" and \"[[You Took Advantage of Me]]\".\n\nWith the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in full swing during the first half of the 1930s, the team sought greener pastures in Hollywood. The hardworking Rodgers later regretted these relatively fallow years, but he and Hart did write some classic songs and film scores while out west, including ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932) (directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who would later direct Rodgers's ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' on Broadway), which introduced three standards: \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\", \"[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]\", and \"[[Isn't It Romantic?]]\". Rodgers also wrote a melody for which Hart wrote three consecutive lyrics which either were cut, not recorded or not a hit. The fourth lyric resulted in one of their most famous songs, \"[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]\". Other film work includes the scores to ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), starring [[George M. Cohan]], ''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum'' (1933), starring [[Al Jolson]], and, in a quick return after having left Hollywood, ''Mississippi'' (1935), starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[W. C. Fields]].\n\nIn 1935, they returned to Broadway and wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows that ended only with Hart's death in 1943. Among the most notable are ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]'' (1935), ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, which included the ballet \"[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]\", choreographed by George Balanchine), ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1938), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938), ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940), and their last original work, ''[[By Jupiter]]'' (1942). Rodgers also contributed to the book on several of these shows.\n\nMany of the songs from these shows are still sung and remembered, including \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1935 song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\", \"[[My Romance (song)|My Romance]]\", \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\", \"[[I'll Tell the Man in the Street]]\", \"[[There's a Small Hotel]]\", \"[[Where or When]]\", \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\", \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\", \"[[Falling in Love with Love]]\", \"[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]\", and \"[[Wait till You See Her]]\".\n\nIn 1939, he wrote the ballet ''Ghost Town'' for the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], with choreography by [[Marc Platt (dancer)|Marc Platoff]].<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1D9173CF930A15753C1A9649C8B63 \"DANCE REVIEW; Rodgers As Ideal Dance Partner\"], ''The New York Times'', October 23, 2002.</ref>\n\n====Rodgers and Hammerstein====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hammerstein}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein at piano-original.jpg|thumb|Rodgers (seated) with Hammerstein, 1945]]\nRodgers' partnership with Hart began having problems because of the lyricist's unreliability and declining health. Rodgers began working with [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he had previously written songs (before ever working with Lorenz Hart). Their first musical, the groundbreaking hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), marked the beginning of the most successful partnership in American musical theatre history. Their work revolutionized the musical form. What was once a collection of songs, dances and comic turns held together by a tenuous plot became a fully integrated piece.\n\nThe team went on to create four more hits that are among the most popular in musical history. Each was made into a successful film: ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949, winner of the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951), and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959). Other shows include the minor hit ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' (1958), as well as relative failures ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'' (1947), ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953), and ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'' (1955). They also wrote the score to the film ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'' (1945) (which was remade in 1962 with [[Pat Boone]]) and a special TV musical of ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957).\n\nTheir collaboration produced many well-known songs, including \"[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]\", \"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\", \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" (which also became the state song of Oklahoma), \"It's A Grand Night For Singing\", \"[[If I Loved You]]\", \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\", \"[[It Might as Well Be Spring]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", \"[[Bali Hai]]\", \"[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]\", \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\", \"[[The Sound of Music (song)|The Sound of Music]]\", \"[[Sixteen Going on Seventeen]]\", \"[[Climb Ev'ry Mountain]]\", \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", and \"[[Edelweiss (song)|Edelweiss]]\", Hammerstein's last song.\n[[File:Richard Rodgers Ed Sullivan 1952.JPG|thumb|Rodgers was the subject of a two-part special on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''Toast of the Town'' television show in 1952.]]\nMuch of Rodgers' work with both Hart and Hammerstein was orchestrated by [[Robert Russell Bennett]]. Rodgers composed twelve themes, which Bennett used in preparing the orchestra score for the 26-episode [[World War II]] television documentary ''[[Victory at Sea]]'' (1952\u201353). This [[NBC]] production pioneered the \"compilation documentary\"\u2014programming based on pre-existing footage \u2014 and was eventually broadcast in dozens of countries. The melody of the popular song \"[[No Other Love (1953 song)|No Other Love]]\"was later taken from the ''Victory at Sea'' theme entitled \"Beneath the Southern Cross\".  Rodgers won an [[Emmy]] for the music for the ABC documentary ''[[The Valiant Years|Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years]]'', scored by [[Eddie Sauter]], [[Hershy Kay]], and [[Robert Emmett Dolan]]. Rodgers composed the theme music, \"[[March of the Clowns]]\", for the 1963\u201364 television series ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which ran for 30 episodes. He also contributed the main-title theme for the 1963\u201364 historical anthology television series [[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|''The Great Adventure'']].\n\nIn 1950, [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" Rodgers, Hammerstein, and [[Joshua Logan]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''South Pacific''.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama \"Drama\"].

Retrieved December 3, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Rodgers conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] in excerpts from ''Victory at Sea'', ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' and the ''[[Carousel Waltz]]'' for a special LP released by [[Columbia Records]].\n\n[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musicals earned a total of 37 [[Tony Award]]s, 15 [[Academy Awards]], two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, two [[Grammy Award]]s, and two [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n====After Hammerstein====\nAfter Hammerstein's death in 1960, Rodgers wrote both words and music for his first new Broadway project ''[[No Strings]]'' (1962, which earned two Tony Awards). The show was a minor hit and featured the song, \"[[The Sweetest Sounds (song)|The Sweetest Sounds]]\".\n\nRodgers also wrote both the words and music for two new songs used in the film version of [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']]. (Other songs in that film were from Rodgers and Hammerstein.)\n\nRodgers went on to work with lyricists: [[Stephen Sondheim]] (''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'') who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hammerstein, [[Martin Charnin]] (''[[Two by Two (musical)|Two by Two]],'' ''[[I Remember Mama (musical)|I Remember Mama]]'') and [[Sheldon Harnick]] (''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'').\n\nAt its 1978 commencement ceremonies, [[Barnard College]] awarded Rodgers its highest honor, the [[List of Barnard College people#Recipients of the Medal of Distinction|Barnard Medal of Distinction]].\n\nRodgers was an honoree at the first [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978.\n\nAt the 1979 Tony Awards ceremony\u2014six months before his death\u2014Rodgers was presented the Lawrence Langner Memorial Award for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement in the American Theatre.\n\n====Death and legacy====\nRodgers died in 1979, aged 77, after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a [[laryngectomy]]. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nIn 1990, the 46th Street Theatre was renamed the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] in his memory. In 1999, Rodgers and Hart were each commemorated on United States postage stamps. In 2002, the centennial year of Rodgers' birth was celebrated worldwide with books, retrospectives, performances, new recordings of his music, and a Broadway revival of ''Oklahoma!''. The [[BBC Proms]] that year devoted an entire evening to Rodgers' music, including a concert performance of ''Oklahoma!'' The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] released a new CD that year in tribute to Rodgers, entitled ''My Favorite Things: A Richard Rodgers Celebration''.\n\n[[Alec Wilder]] wrote the following about Rodgers:\n\n{{quote|Of all the writers whose songs are considered and examined in this book, those of Rodgers show the highest degree of consistent excellence, inventiveness, and sophistication ... [A]fter spending weeks playing his songs, I am more than impressed and respectful: I am astonished.<ref>Wilder, Alec, 1973.

The bulk of the volcanic field is in the [[Talca Province|Talca province]] of Chile's [[Maule Region]]. It is a segment of the [[Southern Volcanic Zone]], part of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]]. Many of the volcanic centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during [[postglacial]] times, after [[glacier]]s had retreated from the area. This activity has generated [[Volcanic cone|cones]], [[lava dome]]s, [[Lava dome#Lava coul\u00e9es|lava coulees]] and [[lava flows]] which surround [[Laguna del Maule]] lake. The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the [[Maule River|Maule river]]. Some of the volcanic centres were active during and before the [[last glacial period|last glaciation]]; at least three [[caldera]] formation events are associated with the system.\n\nAbout 130 {{Nbsp}}[[volcanic vents]] belong to the field, whose activity began 1.5{{Nbsp}}million years ago and continued into the [[Holocene]]. Postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with simultaneous [[Explosive eruption|explosive]] and [[Effusive eruption|effusive]] components, and [[volcanic rock]]s in the field vary from [[basalt]] over [[andesite]] and [[dacite]] to [[rhyolite]]. The field was a source of [[obsidian]] with regional importance.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, [[Bradyseism|ground inflation]] began in the volcanic field, indicating the intrusion of a [[Sill (geology)|sill]] beneath it. The rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as [[Uturunku]] in [[Bolivia]] and [[Yellowstone Caldera|Yellowstone]] in the United States and has been accompanied by anomalies in soil gas emission and [[seismic activity]]. This pattern has created concern about the potential for impending large-scale eruptive activity.\n\n== Geography and structure ==\n[[File:Descabezado Grande y Cerro Azul.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cerro Azul, on the right is at the northern edge of the Southern Volcanic Zone]]\n[[File:R\u00edo Blanco y Chait\u00e9n en erupci\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chait\u00e9n, here erupting, is located in the southern part of the Southern Volcanic Zone]]\nThe Laguna del Maule [[volcanic field]] is centred around {{coord|36.1|S|70.5|W}}, straddling the Chilean-[[Argentine]] frontier with most of the complex on the Chilean side.

The bulk of the volcanic field is in the [[Talca Province|Talca province]] of Chile's [[Maule Region]]. It is a segment of the [[Southern Volcanic Zone]], part of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]]. Many of the volcanic centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during [[postglacial]] times, after [[glacier]]s had retreated from the area. This activity has generated [[Volcanic cone|cones]], [[lava dome]]s, [[Lava dome#Lava coul\u00e9es|lava coulees]] and [[lava flows]] which surround [[Laguna del Maule]] lake. The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the [[Maule River|Maule river]]. Some of the volcanic centres were active during and before the [[last glacial period|last glaciation]]; at least three [[caldera]] formation events are associated with the system.\n\nAbout 130 {{Nbsp}}[[volcanic vents]] belong to the field, whose activity began 1.5{{Nbsp}}million years ago and continued into the [[Holocene]]. Postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with simultaneous [[Explosive eruption|explosive]] and [[Effusive eruption|effusive]] components, and [[volcanic rock]]s in the field vary from [[basalt]] over [[andesite]] and [[dacite]] to [[rhyolite]]. The field was a source of [[obsidian]] with regional importance.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, [[Bradyseism|ground inflation]] began in the volcanic field, indicating the intrusion of a [[Sill (geology)|sill]] beneath it.
