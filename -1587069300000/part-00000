As each senior person died, the others would move up a step.\n\nThe head of the school generally used the ''g\u014d'' (and signed his prints) as ''Toyokuni''. When [[Kunisada I]] proclaimed himself head of the school (c. 1842), he started signing as ''Toyokuni'', and the next most senior member, [[Kochoro]] (a name also previously used by Kunisada I, but not as his chief ''g\u014d''), started signing as ''Kunisada'' (Kunisada II, in this case).\n\nThe next most senior member after him, in turn, began signing as ''Kunimasa'' (Kunimasa IV, in this case), which had been Kochoro's ''g\u014d'' before he became Kunisada II. (The original [[Kunimasa|Kunimasa I]] had been a student of Toyokuni I.)\n\nFollowing is a list of some members of the main Utagawa school, giving the succession of names, along with the modern numbering of each:\n\n* Toyokuni (I)\n* Toyoshige -> Toyokuni (II)\n* Kunisada (I) -> Toyokuni (III)\n* Kochoro -> Kunimasa (III) -> Kunisada (II) -> Toyokuni (IV)\n* Kochoro (II) -> Kunimasa (IV) -> Kunisada (III) -> Toyokuni (V)\n\nSee [[List of Utagawa school members|here]] for a more extensive list.\n\n==Two different Toyokuni IIs==\n\nAn additional complexity is the fact that there are two different artists who are sometimes referred to as ''Toyokuni II''; and similarly for the later-numbered artists called \"Toyokuni\".\n\nThe first Toyokuni II was [[Toyoshige]], a mediocre pupil and son-in-law of Toyokuni I who became head of the Utagawa school after Toyokuni I died.\n\nKunisada I (Toyokuni III) apparently despised Toyoshige, and refused to acknowledge him as head of the Utagawa school. Apparently, this was because he felt that as the best pupil, he should have been named head after the old master died, and was upset with Toyoshige, who apparently got the position because of his family connection.\n\nWhen Kunisada I took the art-name Toyokuni (c. 1842), he effectively removed Toyokuni II from house history and for a period actually signed as ''Toyokuni II''. However, he is now numbered, Toyokuni III. There are prints which signed ''Toyokuni II'' which are by the artist now known as Toyokuni III.\n\nThis numbering persisted, so when Kochoro became head of the Utagawa school, he signed as ''Toyokuni III'', although he would be the fourth Toyokuni. Likewise Kochoro II eventually signed as ''Toyokuni IV'', and is now numbered Toyokuni V.\n\n<br />\n\n== Family ==\nAccording to the encyclopedia of Ukiyo-e in the late 1980s, the Utagawa school had 151 students,147 workers from Kuniyoshi, and 173 people from Kuniyoshi. Students who studied at the Utagawa school would gain the chance to receive the Utagawa name if their skill is approved. The master would give out the Utagawa surname, and the use of \u201cToshinomaru\u201d, which is Utagawa's own family crest that is only found within the Utagawa family to the best students. The \u201cYearball\u201d, rounded design, was the symbol of the Utagawa family. This symbol was easy to recognize, so the people who wore the Utagawa crested kimono did not need the ticket to the Edo theater at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asianartnewspaper.com/lines-of-descent-masters-and-students-of-the-utagawa-school/|website=asianartnewspaper.com|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> The \u201cTatsunori no Maru\u201d crest of the same shape with an added line, was used only by the master of Muneya and his workers. The next master was decided at a convention of the very large Utagawa Ichimon family. The master was mainly decided by personality and their Ukiyo-e skills. However, the higher the rank, the better chance that they would be chosen. There were gifts such as crests from the shogunate in the house using this family crest.

He is often joined by his brother, [[Luigi]], and occasionally by other members of the ''Mario'' cast. As in platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed [[level (video gaming)|levels]]. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario [[Damsel in distress|rescuing the kidnapped]] [[Princess Peach]] from the primary [[antagonist]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. The first title in the series, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985, established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game released since.  These include a multitude of [[power-up]]s and [[item (gaming)|items]] that give Mario special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing into both giant and miniature sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5710212/nintendos-revised-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=Nintendo's Revised History Of Super Mario Bros.|first=Michael|last=McWhertor}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Super Mario'' series is part of the greater ''Mario'' franchise.

It established many core ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' gameplay concepts. The brothers Mario and Luigi live in the Mushroom Kingdom, where they must rescue Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser/King Koopa. The game consists of eight [[Level (video games)|worlds]] of four levels each, totaling 32 levels altogether. Though the worlds differ in themes, the fourth level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] (or one of his minions disguised as him).<ref name=\"TMKTheBad\">{{cite web |url= http://themushroomkingdom.net/smb_breakdown.shtml#bad |title=The Bad |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=TMK Super Mario Bros.

It uses the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' engine, with additions such as weather, character movements, and more complex levels, altogether yielding a much higher difficulty. The game follows the same style of level progression as ''Super Mario Bros.'', with eight initial worlds of four levels each. The last level of the eight worlds is a [[lava]]-filled castle that culminates in a battle against Bowser. At that time, this sequel was not released outside Japan since Nintendo of America did not want the Mario series to be known to players outside of Japan for frustrating difficulty. It remained inaccessible to a steadily broadening market of American video game players, becoming stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' could be eventually delivered to America.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|last=McLaughlin|first=Rus| publisher=IGN | date=September 14, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe game later debuted outside Japan in 1993 as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" in the compilation cartridge titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). The original [[Famicom]] version was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in September 2007, listed as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" outside Japan. A later ''Super Mario All-Stars'' Wii [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]], titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars#25th Anniversary Edition|Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition]]'', features the SNES gameplay and adds [[Wii Remote]], [[Classic Controller]], and [[GameCube]] controller compatibility.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 2}}\nIn ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (''Super Mario USA'' in Japan), Mario and his companions are out to stop the evil frog [[Wart (Nintendo)|Wart]] in the Subcon dreamland.

This is also the first ''Super Mario'' game to use a life meter, which allows Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad to be hit up to four times before dying. Mushrooms count for two lives, and coins are used for inter-level [[slot machine]] minigame.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\" />\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 3}}\n''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6\u201310 levels and several bonus stages displayed as locations on a mapped [[overworld]]. These locations are not necessarily in a linear order, and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order. Completed levels cannot be replayed. A world's final level is a [[boss stage]]. The penultimate boss stage is a side-scrolling level atop an [[airship]] (\"Doom Ship\") with a fight against one of Bowser's seven [[Koopalings]]. The game introduced a diverse array of new power-ups, including flight as Raccoon Mario or the level-long ''P-Wing'' allowing permanent flight through a whole level. Bowser is again the final boss.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land}}\n''Super Mario Land'' was the first handheld ''Super Mario'' title after the Game & Watch port of ''Super Mario Bros.'', and was released for the [[Game Boy]]. As with other games in the series, it is a sidescrolling platformer in which Mario sets out to save [[Princess Daisy]] by defeating a mysterious spaceman named [[Tatanga]]. Power-ups include hearts, which gives Mario an extra life (similar to a 1-up mushroom) and small bouncing ball which Mario throws referred to as \"superballs\". The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds.\n\n=== ''Super Mario World'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario World}}\n''Super Mario World'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and consists of nine worlds displayed via a world map overworld. Unlike ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', where each world map is individual, the world map here is unique and covers the whole game. Most of the 72 levels have one exit, though some have hidden second exits. Mario's new moves include a spin jump and the rideable [[Yoshi]] who can eat enemies and either swallow or spit them out. Power-ups include the returning Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star, and the new Cape Feather, based on ''Super Mario Bros. 3'''s Super Leaf, which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape. The game was followed by the prequel ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', which is also considered the first game in the [[Yoshi series]].\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins}}\n''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' introduces Mario's rival, [[Wario]], who had taken over Mario's castle during the events of ''Super Mario Land'' and forces Mario to collect the six golden coins in order to reenter and reclaim his castle. While its predecessor is similar to the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Land 2'' has more in common with later games. The player is no longer restricted to only moving towards the right. A bell at each level's end activates a [[minigame]], where the player can try to get [[1-Up|extra lives]]. There are 32 levels, based on several themed worlds each with its own boss. Three power-ups return: the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. The game introduces the Carrot power-up, which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for a limited time. Its story was continued in ''[[Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3]]'', which retroactively became the first of a spin-off series, ''[[Wario (series)#Wario Land series|Wario Land]]''.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 64'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 64}}\n''Super Mario 64'' was the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[open world]] game in the series, and a [[launch game|launch title]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] home console. Each level is an enclosed environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player collects Power Stars that appear after completing tasks to unlock later courses and areas.<ref name=\"NP88\">{{Cite journal| date=September 1996 | title= Full Coverage&nbsp;\u2014 Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14\u201323}}</ref> The Nintendo 64's [[analog stick]] makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. It is the first ''Super Mario'' series game to feature [[Charles Martinet]]'s voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser, and collect up to 120 Power Stars from the paintings and return them to her castle, the overworld. There are a total of 105 Power Stars in the paintings, with 15 hidden in the castle. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Sunshine'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Sunshine}}\n''Super Mario Sunshine'', the second 3D ''Super Mario'' title. It was released in 2002 for the [[GameCube]]. In it, Mario and Peach travel to Isle Delfino for a vacation when a Mario [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], going by the name of [[Shadow Mario]], appears and vandalizes the entire island. Mario is sentenced to clean the island with a water-squirting accessory called F.L.U.D.D. ''Super Mario Sunshine'' shares many similar gameplay elements with its predecessor ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', yet introduces moves, like spinning while jumping, and several other actions through the use of F.L.U.D.D. The game contains a number of independent levels, which can be reached from the hub, Delfino Plaza. Mario collects Shine Sprites by completing tasks in the levels, which in return unlock levels in Delfino Plaza by way of abilities and plot-related events.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070716082934/http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml|archivedate=July 16, 2007|title=Super Mario Sunshine (JPN) Review|publisher=GamingWorld X|author=Mackie, Joe|accessdate=November 22, 2007}}</ref> ''Sunshine'' introduces the last of Bowser's eight children, [[Bowser Jr.]] , as an antagonist. Yoshi also appears again for Mario to ride in certain sections.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros.'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros.}}\n''New Super Mario Bros.'' was released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in 2006. In it, Mario and Luigi set out to save Princess Peach from [[Bowser Jr]]. The gameplay is 2D, but most of the characters and objects are 3D on [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] backgrounds, resulting in a [[2.5D]] effect. The game uses an overworld map similar to those of ''Super Mario Bros. Deluxe''. Some levels have multiple exits. The classic power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star) return alongside the Mega Mushroom, Blue Shell, and Mini Mushroom. The Mega Mushroom briefly turns Mario (or Luigi) into an invincible giant that destroys everything in his path, enemies as pipes and blocks. The Blue Shell protects Mario from harm and allows him to slide (depending on speed), where the Mini Mushroom shrinks Mario to a much smaller size, allowing him to fit through tight spaces and access places normally unreachable.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Galaxy'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Galaxy}}\n''Super Mario Galaxy'' was launched in 2007 for the [[Wii]]. It is set in [[outer space]], where [[Mario]] travels between \"[[Galaxy|galaxies]]\" to collect Power Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies. Each galaxy contains a number of [[planet]]s and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's physics system gives each celestial object its own [[Gravitation|gravitational force]], which lets the player circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The player is usually able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object. Though the main gameplay and physics are in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], there are several points in the game where the player's movements are restricted into a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear following the new game mechanics, and many of these return in its sequel, ''Super Mario Galaxy 2''.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. Wii}}\nIn ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', Princess Peach is captured by Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings during her birthday party in her castle, and Mario, Luigi, and two Toads (blue and yellow) spring into action to save her. The game features 4-player co-op and new power-ups: the Propeller Mushroom, the Ice Flower, and the Penguin Suit. The Propeller Mushroom allows the player to launch its character high into the air through shaking the [[Wii Remote]]. The Penguin Suit enhances sliding traction, speed and agility of swimming abilities, in addition to the ice ball projectiles that are provisioned by the Ice Flower. All characters can ride [[Yoshi]]. The levels are organised into individually themed open-worlds reminiscent of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. Like in its predecessor, there are three hidden Star Coins to find in each level, which can be used to unlock movies with gameplay tips. It was released in November 2009 to an important commercial success, and won several awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/143/14354229.html |title=IGN: New Super Mario Bros.

It retains the basic premise of its predecessor and includes its items and power-ups. These include the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to create platforms in mid-air, and the Rock Mushroom, which turns Mario into a rolling boulder. Mario can also ride Yoshi along. It was released to widespread critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 3D Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 3D Land}}\n''Super Mario 3D Land'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in November and December 2011. It is the first original 3D ''Super Mario'' game on a handheld console, since all previous games were either 2D or re-edits of former games. As an attempt to translate the gameplay of the 2D games into a 3D environment, it tried to simplify the control scheme of the 3D games through using more linear levels. It also brought back several older gameplay features, including the Super Leaf power-up last seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. This game was released to critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. 2}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. 2'', the direct sequel of ''New Super Mario Bros.'' for the DS, was released in July and August 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. The player, as Mario or Luigi, tries to save Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings, with the game's secondary goal  to collect one million coins. Several gameplay elements were introduced to help achieve this goal, such as the Gold Flower, a rarer variant of the Fire Flower that turns items into coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5903941/new-super-mario-bros-2-hits-japan-3dses-this-august/|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 Hits 3DSes This August|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tinycartridge.com/post/25460539710/new-super-mario-bros-2-artwork-featuring-smb|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 artwork, featuring SMB|work=Tiny Cartridge 3DS|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. U}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. U'', the [[Wii U]] follow-up to ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', was released in November 2012, in North America. It plays similarly to the previous ''New Super Mario Bros.'' titles, and introduces both a Flying Squirrel suit that lets the players glide through the air, and [[asymmetric gameplay]] that allows the player holding the [[Wii U GamePad|GamePad]] to influence the environment. On June 20, 2013, ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' was released as a downloadable content (DLC) package for the game, featuring shorter but more difficult levels, starring Luigi as the main protagonist instead of his brother. Subsequently released as a standalone retail game on August 25, 2013, in North America.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubba |first=Sinan |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/17/super-luigi/ |title=Super Luigi U arrives as DLC June 20, packaged standalone August 25 |publisher=Joystiq |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Unlike the downloadable content version, the standalone retail version of ''New Super Luigi U'' does not require having ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' to play it. The [[Nintendo Switch]] port ''New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe'' includes both the main game and ''New Super Luigi U'' as well as new playable characters Nabbit and Toadette.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3_B-PXyX88|title=New Super Mario Bros.

Like ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', it features Princess Peach and Toad as playable characters in addition to Mario and Luigi. Rosalina from ''Super Mario Galaxy'' is also unlocked later in the game.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker}}\n''Super Mario Maker'' is a creation tool released for the Wii U in September 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Maker Release Date Announced at E3 2015|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-maker-release-date-announced-at-e3-201/1100-6428205/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> which allows players to create their own levels based on the gameplay and style of ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', ''Super Mario World'', and ''New Super Mario Bros. U'', as well as to share their creations online. Based on existing games, several gameplay mechanics were introduced for the game, with existing ones also available to be used together in new ways. A Nintendo 3DS version of the game called ''Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS'', was released in December 2016. It features a few new pre-installed levels, but no online level sharing.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Run'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Run}}\n''Super Mario Run'' is a side-scrolling and [[Endless running game|auto-scrolling]] video game released in December 2016 on the [[iOS]] platform, then in March 2017 on [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It is the first official ''Mario'' game developed for non-Nintendo hardware (since previous attempts all faced cancellation) , as well as the first official Super Mario game developed for [[mobile game|mobile devices]]. As such, it features simplified controls that allow it to be played with only one hand.\n\nIn this game, Mario runs automatically, and the player's in charge of controlling the jumping action so that Mario avoids all hazards. This is achieved by touching the tactile screens these devices are built with, and the longer the player touches the jump button, the higher Mario jumps. Collecting all coins in a precise level unlocks a set of 5 pink coins in said level for Mario (the player) to collect, allowing extended replayability. Collecting these 5 coins unlocks another set of 5 purple coins, which upon collecting unlocks another set of 5 coins, black this time and much harder to collect. This further multiplies the game's length, through requiring the player to beat a single level 4 times to fully complete it.\n\nThis game also includes a \"Toad Rally\" mode, quite similar to the \"VS Boo\" mode of ''Super Mario Bros Deluxe'', in which players have to complete a level faster than a computer-controlled Toad. Success in this mode earns the player access to in-game money to spend in customization options for it to create its own \"Mushroom Kingdom\" map, using mechanics similar to ''[[FarmVille|Farmville]]'', into ''Super Mario Run''<nowiki/>'s third gameplay mode.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Odyssey'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Odyssey}}\nReleased on October 27, 2017 for [[Nintendo Switch]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Odyssey|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Super-Mario-Odyssey-1173332.html|website=Nintendo UK|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> ''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a return to the open-world \"sandbox\" 3D style of game last seen in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. After Mario's cap is possessed by a spirit named Cappy, he is able to use it to temporarily \"capture\" enemies, harmless life forms and objects and utilize their powers. Like previous sandbox 3D games, the game's worlds contain a large variety of objectives that can be achieved in a non-linear order before progressing. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' was critically acclaimed, and earned multiple awards. This game adventures through many different kingdoms, in addition to the standard Mushroom Kingdom Mario's adventures usually take place in ; and is the very first one to include a vocal theme song, \"Jump Up, Super Star!\".\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker 2}}\nOn February 13, 2019 during a Nintendo Direct presentation, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' was announced. ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is very similar in design to its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker''. It introduced many new items, themes, and enemies, as well as an online multiplayer mode. The game was released on June 28, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n== Remakes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! System\n! Year\n!

Power-up use is integral to the series. The series has installments featuring both two and three-dimensional gameplay.\nIn the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] games, the [[player character]] (usually Mario) jumps on platforms and enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D ''Super Mario'' game levels have single-exit objectives, which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next sequential level. ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' introduced the [[overworld]], a map of nonlinear levels that branches according to the player's choice.<ref name=\"NP-10-Preview\">{{Cite journal| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| title = Previews: ''Super Mario Bros. 3''| author= Nintendo Power Staff| issue = 10| date=January\u2013February 1990 | pages = 56\u201359| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced levels with multiple exits.\n\n3D installments in the series have had two subgenres: [[open world]] exploration based games and more linear 3D games with a predetermined path.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Osborn|first1=Alex|title=Miyamoto Offers a Few New Super Mario Odyssey Details|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/13/miyamoto-offers-a-few-new-super-mario-odyssey-details|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=IGN|date=January 13, 2017}}</ref> Levels in the open world games, ''[[Super Mario 64|64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine|Sunshine]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Odyssey|Odyssey]]'', allow the player to freely explore multiple enclosed environments in 360 degree movement.

When hit by an enemy, Mario reverts to his smaller size instead of losing a life.<ref name=\"SuperMushroom\" /> When Mario is in his \"Super\" form, most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated in an interview that beta tests of ''Super Mario Bros.'' proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario.<ref name=\"worldrecord\">{{cite web | author = O'Connell, Patricia | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_45/b3958127.htm | title = Meet Mario's Papa | publisher = BusinessWeek online | date = November 7, 2005 | accessdate =November 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Poison Mushroom'', first introduced in the Japanese ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', is a mushroom that causes damage when touched. In later games, the Poison Mushroom looks almost exactly like the Super Mushroom with a red cap but has a meaner-looking face.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe ''Mini Mushroom'' is a small blue mushroom, a recurring item in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, which shrinks Mario into miniature size, allowing him access areas and pipes that Mario normally cannot reach. Mini Mario also jumps higher, floats midair, bounces off enemies without hurting them except by ground pounding, and can run across the surface of the water and then jump from it as if he was on land. Mario is more vulnerable in this form and loses a life upon receiving one hit in miniature form. The Mini Mushroom in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' allows Mario to run up walls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5942967/its-impossible-to-hate-the-new-new-super-mario-bros-u|title=It's Impossible to Hate the New New Super Mario Bros. U|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Mega Mushroom'', introduced in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and further appearing in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is a more recent addition to the series that grows Mario into a towering, invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running through them. It has an orange-yellow cap with red spots, like the ''Super Mario Bros.'' Super Mushroom, but with an inflated cap. ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' features an item simply called \"Mushroom\"<ref name=\"Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet\">{{ cite book | date=2005 | title=Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet (PAL version) | publisher=Nintendo }}</ref> that grants the same abilities as the Mega Mushroom.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' franchise, the Bee Mushroom gives Mario the Bee Suit, and the Spring Mushroom puts Mario inside a metallic coil. The Mystery Mushroom in ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not in its [[Super Mario Maker 2|2019 sequel]]) provides a \"costume\" based on one of many characters in addition to the abilities of the Super Mushroom.\n\n===== 1-Ups =====\nThe ''[[1-Up]]'' is a common item shown as a green and white mushroom that gives Mario an [[extra life]]. The 1-Up was introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', sometimes hidden in invisible item blocks, and displayed as having an orange cap with green spots. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Land 2]]'', the 1-Up is shown as a heart. 1-Ups can take other forms, such as the 3-Up Moon from ''Super Mario World'' and ''New Super Mario Bros. U''.\n\n==== Projectile flowers ====\nThe flower power-ups let Mario shoot projectiles. The Fire Flower, introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', transforms Mario into Fire Mario, who can throw bouncing fireballs at enemies. ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' was the first 3D Mario platformer game to have the Fire Flower. In ''Super Mario Land'' and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', the Superball is a [[bouncing ball]] obtained from a Super Flower, which Mario can use to defeat enemies and collect coins. The Ice Flower transforms Mario into Ice Mario, where he can shoot balls of ice as projectiles similar to that of the Fire Flower; it freezes enemies in a block of ice, to be used as platforms or as thrown projectiles, as seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''.<ref name=\"nsmbw\" /> In ''Super Mario Galaxy'', the Ice Flower turns Mario into ice and lets him walk on lava or water for a limited time by freezing the surface. Lastly, ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''{{'}}s Gold Flower lets Mario turn bricks into coins and earn bonus coins for defeating enemies.\n\n==== Invincibility ====\nInvincibility is an effect first appearing in the three ''Super Mario Bros.'' games, where it is granted by a \"Starman\",<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario'' manual|url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/media/super-mario-bros/manuals/Super-Mario-Bros-Manual-US.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=legendsoflocalization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 2'' Manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_NES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_Bros._2_-_1986_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//media/system/nintendo_nes/manual/formated/super_mario_bros._3_-_1990_-_nintendo.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=gamesdatabase|date=1990}}</ref> an anthropomorphized, flashing star. The star has also been named the \"Super Star\" in the two ''Super Mario World'' games<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/manual/Formated/Super_Mario_World_-_1991_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_World_2-_Yoshi-s_Island_-_1995_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1995}}</ref> and the \"Rainbow Star\" in the two ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games. Picking up the star makes Mario temporarily [[Glossary of video game terms#God mode|invincible]], able to resist any harm. Use of the item is accompanied by a distinctive music track that appears consistently across most of the games. The player character flickers a variety of colors \u2014 and in some titles, moves with increased speed and enhanced jumping ability \u2014 while under the Star's influence. While invincible, Mario kills any enemy upon contact with it. In ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', the star gives the normally immobile baby Mario the ability to run as well as become invincible. In ''Super Mario 64'', invincibility is provided when Mario wears the metal cap or the vanish cap. The Mega Mushroom provides temporary invincibility with the addition of giant size and environment destruction (see [[Super Mario#Mushrooms|Mushrooms]]).\n\n==== Power Stars and course tokens ====\nThe games often feature [[collectible]]s found in levels in order to progress in the overworld, most frequently with the visual motif of a star. They are typically situated in locations that are not readily found or reached, or awarded for completing stunts, or objectives given by [[Non-player character|NPCs]]. They include the Power Stars in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games, Shine Sprites in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', Star Coins in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series and ''Super Mario 3D Land'', Green Stars in the ''Galaxy'' games and ''Super Mario 3D World'', and Power Moons in ''Super Mario Odyssey''. In ''Super Mario Land 2'', there are six Golden Coin tokens that must be collected to finish the game.\n\n==== Flying ====\nFlight is a common theme throughout the series, first enabled with the [[magic carpet]] item in the international ''Super Mario Bros. 2''. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit items, first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' provide Mario with an animal-suited tail, which in turn acts as a flight propeller. The Tanooki Suit returns in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', and the Super Leaf returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and the ''Super Mario Maker'' series. In the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series and ''Super Mario Maker'' series, the Propeller Block and the Propeller Mushroom let Mario spin up into the air and slowly descend. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', Mario pilots a yellow airplane with unlimited ammunition called the Sky Pop. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduces various forms of flight: the feather item provides a cape, the P Balloon puffs Mario into a floating balloon figure, and Yoshi can carry a blue Koopa shell which gives him wings. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', flight that is granted by a Winged Cap. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Mario has limited flight provided by the Propeller Cap.  In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', Mario has limited flight and gliding capabilities in a Flying Squirrel suit and can also command a pink Baby Yoshi to puff up into the form of a floating balloon. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Mario can obtain a special red star that transforms him into Flying Mario for a limited time. [[Lakitu]]'s cloud can be commandeered in several of the side-scrolling games.\n\n==== Power-up suits ====\nSeveral suits work as power-ups, many of which are based on animals.  Debuting in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', the Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide Mario with a tail which acts as a flight propeller.  In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets Mario spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. In ''Super Mario 3D Land'', the Raccoon Suit reappears and is accompanied by a silver-colored variation called a Statue Leaf.<ref name=GT>{{cite web| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = May 21, 2010| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-super-mario/100404| accessdate =May 22, 2010}}</ref> ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' includes a [[Hammer Bros.]] suit, which allows Mario to throw hammers as projectiles, to defeat enemies at a distance, taking what the Hammer Bros does to Mario and turning it around. While wearing the suit and ducking, Mario is invulnerable to fire attacks. The Hammer Suit was so powerful that in later games, it was downgraded. ''Super Mario 3D Land'' features a \"Boomerang Suit\" which provisions long-distance boomerang projectiles. Other animal suits include the Frog Suit, Tanooki Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit and Bee Suit.\n\n==== Coins ====\n''Super Mario'' level design traditionally incorporates many distributed coins as puzzles and rewards.  Most ''Super Mario'' games award the player an extra life once a certain amount of yellow coins are collected, commonly 50 or 100.  Several coin variants exist, such as silver coins, dragon coins, star coins, and more.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', coins replenish health (and air, when Mario is underwater). In ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Super Mario Sunshine'', collecting 100 coins in a level results in a Power Star or Shine Sprite respectively. There are also stages in that game reward a Power Star for collecting eight red coins in a level, worth two normal coins each. In ''Super Mario 64'', a blue coin is worth five normal coins. In ''Super Mario Sunshine'', blue coins act as a side quest when brought to the Delfino Bank.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' series, after finishing each game once, stages unlock where Mario can collect 100 purple coins to earn a Power Star. In ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', they can also be used to feed some hungry \"Luma\" characters that can turn into either an item or another planet.\n\n=== Luigi and other playable characters ===\n\nThe series often features the option to play as other characters, Luigi in the most instances. Earlier games have offered an alternating multiplayer mode in which the second player controls Luigi on their turn. Luigi is often only playable by player one in a second, more challenging iteration of the base game, such as in ''The Lost Levels'', ''Galaxy 2'', ''New Super Luigi U'' and the special worlds in ''3D Land''; these feature lower gravity and reduced friction for Luigi. Later games allow four player simultaneous play. Playable characters other than Mario and Luigi have included Toads, Peach, Rosalina, [[Mii|Miis]] and Nabbit. Characters are sometimes differentiated by special abilities. ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not ''Super Mario Maker 2'') includes costumes that depict many more characters.\n\n=== Warp Pipes and Warp Cannons ===\n{{See also|Warp (gaming)}}\nThe Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the ''Mario'' series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series). In early ''Mario'' games such as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', special, well-hidden areas known as [[Warp Zone]]s contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuddy |first1=Luke |date= August 2013|title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_UefdMONDLIC&dq=cucco+legend+of+zelda |publisher= Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9691-2 |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> In the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. [[Cannons]] appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. Mario uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming himself and being fired at a distant target. This allows Mario to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n=== Yoshi ===\nMario's dinosaur friend [[Yoshi]] has appeared as a mount to the player character in several ''Super Mario'' games since ''[[Super Mario World]]''. In the sequel, ''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'', a tribe of Yoshis finds Mario and helps him to save Baby Luigi. In this game and ''Super Mario 64 DS'', instead of the player merely riding on Yoshi's back, Yoshi is the player character. Yoshis generally have abilities including eating enemies, flying, and breathing fire. Miyamoto had originally wished for Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in ''Super Mario Bros.'', but this wasn't possible due to the technical restraints of the system.\n\n== Settings ==\n* The {{nihongo foot|'''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u738b\u56fd|Kinoko \u014ckoku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the primary ''Super Mario'' series setting, having been introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'' The Mushroom Kingdom is also the setting for the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' games, ''Super Mario 3D Land'' and ''Super Mario Run''. It is a monarchy and its heir is [[Princess Peach]]. Though Princess Peach, Mario and Luigi are human, most citizens of this area are the mushroom-like [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]]. While the main characters of the series reside in the Mushroom Kingdom, their adventures have extended to other settings.\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' introduced '''Subcon''', a mysterious world issued from Mario's dream. It was taken over by the frog king [[Wart (character)|Wart]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is set in the '''Mushroom World''', a collection of eight kingdoms. Seven of these are \"Mushroom Kingdoms\", ruled by their own kings. The different kingdoms are Grass Land (a plains kingdom), Desert Land (a desert kingdom), Water Land (an ocean kingdom), Giant Land (a kingdom where everything is larger), Sky Land (a kingdom which consists of a peninsula at ground level, and a large plain amidst the sky), Ice Land (an arctic kingdom), and Pipe Land (a small island kingdom filled with a maze of Warp Pipes). The eighth world is Dark Land and is ruled by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]: King of the Koopas. The instruction manual for the game states that the Mushroom Kingdom is a gateway to the Mushroom World.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' takes place in '''Sarasaland'''. It is ruled by [[Princess Daisy]]. The species in Sarasaland range from [[tiki]] monsters to aliens to gigantic [[sphinx]]es, as well as enemies similar to enemies from other games in the series. The kingdoms that make up Sarasaland include Birabuto (an [[Ancient Egypt]]-like kingdom), Muda (an ocean kingdom), Easton (an [[Easter Island]]-like kingdom), and Chai (an Ancient [[China]]-like kingdom).\n* ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduces '''Dinosaur Land''', a separate continent where Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach vacation after the events of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.<ref>Super Mario World instruction manual</ref> '''Yoshi's Island''', the setting of ''[[Yoshi's Island|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', is located within Dinosaur Land. The other areas consist of Donut Plains, Vanilla Dome, Twin Bridges, Forest of Illusion, Chocolate Island, Valley of Bowser, Star World, and the Special Zone.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' introduced '''Mario Land''', a region which apparently belongs to Mario.\n* ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' introduced '''Peach's Castle''', which serves as a [[overworld|hub world]]. The worlds in the game are reached by jumping into paintings, which are portals to imaginary worlds created by Bowser. As such, the game is largely not set in the Mushroom Kingdom. However, Peach's Castle itself is located in the Mushroom Kingdom as shown in games like ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel.\n* ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' introduced '''Isle Delfino''', a tropical island somewhere outside the Mushroom Kingdom. It contains several harbors, beaches, hotels, parks, and villages. Instead of Toads or humans, most of the residents on Isle Delfino are tropical creatures called Nokis and Piantas. Its main village Delfino Plaza serves as the central hub world in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. Different areas of the island can be accessed through portals created by spray paint in different parts of the plaza. Besides Delfino Plaza, the different locations of Delfino Island are Delfino Airstrip, Bianco Hills, Ricco Harbor, Gelato Beach, Pinna Park, Sirena Beach, Noki Bay, Pianta Village, and Corona Mountain. While Isle Delfino has only appeared in one game in the ''Super Mario'' series, it has been commonly used in ''Mario'' spin-off games, especially the [[Mario Kart|''Mario Kart'' series]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' are set in outer space and contain various galaxies and planets.\n* ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' takes place in the '''Sprixie Kingdom''', where the Sprixies live.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' has Mario traveling across the globe in a hat-shaped airship called the Odyssey; thus, several new regions known as \"kingdoms\" are introduced in the game, including a New York-inspired urban area called the '''Metro Kingdom''', a dry desert land called the '''Sand Kingdom''', and a food-filled world called the '''Luncheon Kingdom'''.\n\n== Development and history ==\n{{See also|Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong Jr.|Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros}}\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}\nMuch of the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' music and sound effects have become iconic to the series and incorporated into modern games.
