His Senior Aide-de-Camp was Lieutenant-Colonel John H. Quarton, and his Secretary was M. Patricia Halligan. Federal [[Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada|Justice Minister]] [[Otto Lang]] would explain the significance of the appointment to the [[Edmonton Journal]] saying \"''The Queen's appointment of an Indian is historic in that it was the Queen [Victoria] who built a trust with the Indians of Canada so many years ago.''\"\n\nSteinhauer was known for voicing his personal opinions regarding Indigenous issues in Canada while holding the generally [[apolitical]] role as Lieutenant Governor. In 1977, during the opening of the third session of the [[18th Alberta Legislature]] Steinhauer would read the speech from the throne while dressed in the full regalia of a Nehiraw Chief, and on one his final days in the Legislature, Steinhauer while giving [[Royal Assent]] to legislation reflected on his time as Lieutenant Governor and in thanking the members of the assembly remarked \"''May the Great Spirit remain with you, and will you always carry on such a well-done job''\", becoming the first time the Great Spirit had been invoked in the provincial legislature. In a 1976 speech delivered at the University of Calgary, Steinhauer presented a list of injustices inflicted upon Indigenous peoples, and going so far as to suggest he might withhold Royal Assent for legislation affecting First Nations until there was some improvement. \n\nIn July 1976 Steinhauer headed a delegation commemorating the signing of [[Treaty Six]] and [[Treaty Seven|Seven]] to [[Buckingham Palace]]. He had convinced [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]] [[Peter Lougheed]] to support and finance the trip as well as received the support of the Governor General noting \"''it is the wish of the native people that a representative deputation of Chiefs\u2026should visit the United Kingdom''\".  However, the Governor General and federal government wanted assurances that the visit to England would not be a political event and Steinhauer agreed to ensure the occasions's apolitical nature. Upon being presentedto the Queen, disregarded apolitical protocol and proceeded to raise Indigenous issues. On his return to Edmonton, Steinhauer's account would be printed in the Edmonton Journal \"''I was just stating facts. Because of the Indian Act, aren\u2019t we wards of the government?

Steinhauer was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta effective July 2, 1974. This appointment was made by [[Jules L\u00e9ger]], [[Governor General of Canada]]. His Senior Aide-de-Camp was Lieutenant-Colonel John H. Quarton, and his Secretary was M. Patricia Halligan. Federal [[Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada|Justice Minister]] [[Otto Lang]] would explain the significance of the appointment to the [[Edmonton Journal]] saying \"''The Queen's appointment of an Indian is historic in that it was the Queen [Victoria] who built a trust with the Indians of Canada so many years ago.''\"\n\nSteinhauer was known for voicing his personal opinions regarding Indigenous issues in Canada while holding the generally [[apolitical]] role as Lieutenant Governor. In 1977, during the opening of the third session of the [[18th Alberta Legislature]] Steinhauer would read the speech from the throne while dressed in the full regalia of a Nehiraw Chief, and on one his final days in the Legislature, Steinhauer while giving [[Royal Assent]] to legislation reflected on his time as Lieutenant Governor and in thanking the members of the assembly remarked \"''May the Great Spirit remain with you, and will you always carry on such a well-done job''\", becoming the first time the Great Spirit had been invoked in the provincial legislature. In a 1976 speech delivered at the University of Calgary, Steinhauer presented a list of injustices inflicted upon Indigenous peoples, and going so far as to suggest he might withhold Royal Assent for legislation affecting First Nations until there was some improvement. \n\nIn July 1976 Steinhauer headed a delegation commemorating the signing of [[Treaty Six]] and [[Treaty Seven|Seven]] to [[Buckingham Palace]]. He had convinced [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]] [[Peter Lougheed]] to support and finance the trip as well as received the support of the Governor General noting \"''it is the wish of the native people that a representative deputation of Chiefs\u2026should visit the United Kingdom''\".  However, the Governor General and federal government wanted assurances that the visit to England would not be a political event and Steinhauer agreed to ensure the occasions's apolitical nature. Upon being presentedto the Queen, disregarded apolitical protocol and proceeded to raise Indigenous issues. On his return to Edmonton, Steinhauer's account would be printed in the Edmonton Journal \"''I was just stating facts. Because of the Indian Act, aren\u2019t we wards of the government? Isn\u2019t that a fact? You should read the act.

The network currently consists of three passenger routes, the [[Dulwich Hill Line|L1 Dulwich Hill]], [[CBD and South East Light Rail|L2 Randwick and L3 Kingsford]] lines. A separate light rail network serving Western Sydney called [[Parramatta Light Rail]] is also under construction as of 2020, and is scheduled for completion in 2023.\n\nThe network is controlled by [[Transport for NSW]], with day-to-day operation contracted to [[Transdev Australasia#Transdev Sydney|Transdev]]. In the year ended June 2019, 11.1&nbsp;million passenger journeys were made on the network, which only consisted of L1 at the time.\n\n==History==\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sydney developed an [[Trams in Sydney|extensive tram network]], which grew to be the second largest in the Southern Hemisphere and second largest in the [[Commonwealth]] after [[Trams in London|London]]. The increasing rate of private car ownership, perception that trams contributed to traffic congestion and the general rundown conditions of the network due the lack of funding after [[World War II]] led to the progressive replacement of tram services with buses, with the final section of the tram network closing on 25 February 1961.\n\n[[File:Fish Market light rail stop 1997 (4731800705).jpg|thumb|left|A Sydney Light Rail service in 1997 at the then-new [[Dulwich Hill Line#Fish Market|Fish Market station]]]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the inner city areas of [[Darling Harbour]] and [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] were the subject of an urban renewal program. In 1988 the [[Sydney Monorail]] opened, connecting Darling Harbour to the [[Sydney central business district|central business district]]. With poor integration between the monorail and other transport modes, and the increasing redevelopment of the Pyrmont peninsula \u2013 including the establishment of [[The Star, Sydney|Sydney's first legal casino]] \u2013 it was decided to convert a disused section of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] into a light rail line. A section of track between Pyrmont and [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]] was upgraded and a new on-street section was built to link the line to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]]. The line was set up as a [[public-private partnership]]. It opened in August 1997, running between Central station and [[Wentworth Park]], Pyrmont.\n\nThe private owner soon made proposals for a western extension continuing along the disused goods line, plus a new line through the central business district from Central to [[Circular Quay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nominated Loan Council Allocations For 1998\u201399|url=http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/1998/047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|website=The Australian Treasury Website|accessdate=12 December 2015|date=7 May 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406195711/http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F1998%2F047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The western extension opened in 2000, terminating at [[Lilyfield]], but the company was unsuccessful in its attempts to develop a CBD line, which saw development of light rail stagnate for the remainder of the decade.\n\nBy contrast, the 2010s have seen major expansion and reform of light rail in Sydney including the announcement and delivery of multiple new infrastructure projects, integration of ticketing with the city's other transport modes, the introduction of new trams and the transfer of the network to full public ownership.

Opal is also valid on bus, train and ferry services but separate fares apply for these modes. Opal's light rail fares are the same as those for buses but the fares are not combined when interchanging between the two modes. This is due to change once the CBD and South East Light Rail opens; all light rail passengers interchanging with buses will only pay one fare, calculated from the start of their trip on one mode to the end of their trip on the other.<ref>{{cite web|title=Opal to go live on light rail months ahead of schedule|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=24 November 2014|access-date=24 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201221153/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|archive-date=1 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page Opal rollout extends to light rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071610/http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page |date= 6 October 2014 }} Transport Info NSW 25 November 2014</ref> Light rail stops feature Opal top-up machines that also sell Opal single trip tickets.

No two stops on the existing line are located more than eight kilometres from each other using this method, so the 8&nbsp;km+ band doesn't apply to light rail services.\n\nWhen it first opened, the Inner West Light Rail used its own paper-based ticketing system. Paper tickets were originally sold from ticket machines on stop platforms but were later issued by conductors on board.

The network currently consists of three passenger routes, the [[Dulwich Hill Line|L1 Dulwich Hill]], [[CBD and South East Light Rail|L2 Randwick and L3 Kingsford]] lines. A separate light rail network serving Western Sydney called [[Parramatta Light Rail]] is also under construction as of 2020, and is scheduled for completion in 2023.\n\nThe network is controlled by [[Transport for NSW]], with day-to-day operation contracted to [[Transdev Australasia#Transdev Sydney|Transdev]]. In the year ended June 2019, 11.1&nbsp;million passenger journeys were made on the network, which only consisted of L1 at the time.\n\n==History==\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sydney developed an [[Trams in Sydney|extensive tram network]], which grew to be the second largest in the Southern Hemisphere and second largest in the [[Commonwealth]] after [[Trams in London|London]]. The increasing rate of private car ownership, perception that trams contributed to traffic congestion and the general rundown conditions of the network due the lack of funding after [[World War II]] led to the progressive replacement of tram services with buses, with the final section of the tram network closing on 25 February 1961.\n\n[[File:Fish Market light rail stop 1997 (4731800705).jpg|thumb|left|A Sydney Light Rail service in 1997 at the then-new [[Dulwich Hill Line#Fish Market|Fish Market station]]]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the inner city areas of [[Darling Harbour]] and [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] were the subject of an urban renewal program. In 1988 the [[Sydney Monorail]] opened, connecting Darling Harbour to the [[Sydney central business district|central business district]]. With poor integration between the monorail and other transport modes, and the increasing redevelopment of the Pyrmont peninsula \u2013 including the establishment of [[The Star, Sydney|Sydney's first legal casino]] \u2013 it was decided to convert a disused section of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] into a light rail line. A section of track between Pyrmont and [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]] was upgraded and a new on-street section was built to link the line to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]]. The line was set up as a [[public-private partnership]]. It opened in August 1997, running between Central station and [[Wentworth Park]], Pyrmont.\n\nThe private owner soon made proposals for a western extension continuing along the disused goods line, plus a new line through the central business district from Central to [[Circular Quay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nominated Loan Council Allocations For 1998\u201399|url=http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/1998/047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|website=The Australian Treasury Website|accessdate=12 December 2015|date=7 May 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406195711/http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F1998%2F047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The western extension opened in 2000, terminating at [[Lilyfield]], but the company was unsuccessful in its attempts to develop a CBD line, which saw development of light rail stagnate for the remainder of the decade.\n\nBy contrast, the 2010s have seen major expansion and reform of light rail in Sydney including the announcement and delivery of multiple new infrastructure projects, integration of ticketing with the city's other transport modes, the introduction of new trams and the transfer of the network to full public ownership. The extensions announced during the decade total almost {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}.

Out of the 79 passengers and five crew, seven sustained injuries, though none were serious. Five passengers were hospitalized.

This is done so that arriving aircraft clear departing aircraft, which generally turn southeast after departing.\n\nDuring the other 30% of the year (typically between the fall and spring), the airfield operates in \"North Flow\", with arrivals and departures on runways 34L and 34R. As in South Flow, departing aircraft generally turn east to southeast immediately after taking off, so arrivals from the north pass west of the airport before turning north to land. Residences near SMF are typically south and east of the airport, so North Flow is preferred at night (between 2145 and 0745 local time), conditions permitting, to route flights over agricultural land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacramento.aero/scas/environment/noise/sacramento_international_airport_smf/frequently_asked_questions/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions |author= |date= |publisher=Sacramento County Airport System |accessdate=20 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821084320/http://www.sacramento.aero/scas/environment/noise/sacramento_international_airport_smf/frequently_asked_questions/ |archive-date=August 21, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Terminals ==\n[[File:SMF terminal diagram.svg|thumb|right|SMF terminals; note curved people mover track between airside and landside sections of Terminal B]]\nThe airport has two terminals, terminal A and terminal B, with 32 gates, 19 in terminal B and 13 in terminal A.

In 2008, the Sacramento County Airport System broke ground on the largest capital improvement project in the history of the County of Sacramento: \"The Big Build\".<ref name=history /> The expanded Terminal B was designed by Corgan Associates, Inc. in association with [[Fentress Architects]]. The landside (pre-security) portion of Terminal B was built by the joint venture of Austin Commercial, LP and Walsh Construction, and the glass and aluminum facade was constructed by [[Architectural Glass and Aluminum|AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum)]]. The airside gates and light rail train were built by [[Turner Construction]]. The $1.03 billion terminal modernization project replaced the airport's original, aging Terminal B to meet the rising demand for passenger services and improved the airport's ability to attract new carriers and routes.\n\nThe Central Terminal B complex is three times the size of the original Terminal B with the two parts of the complex \u2013 airside and landside \u2013 connected by the [[SMF Automated People Mover]].<ref name=history /> The capacity of Terminal B is 16&nbsp;million passengers per year, which is not expected to be reached until late in the 2020s. Approximately half of the $1&nbsp;billion cost of the new terminal comes from a new ticket surcharge of $4.50 per passenger and parking fees. Another quarter of the cost is funded by fees charged by the airport to airlines, which in one case tripled from $6.05 per passenger in 2008 to $19.67 by 2013.<ref name=SFC-111006 />\n\nAirport officials held a press conference on July 15, 2011 at the California State Fair, announcing the terminal would open on October 6, 2011.
