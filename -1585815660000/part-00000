However until the mid-1990s SGD remained rather unrecognized by the scientific community because it was hard to detect and measure the freshwater discharge. The first elaborated method to study SGD was done by Moore (1996)who used [[radium-226]] as a tracer for groundwater.

He measured enhanced radium-226 concentrations within the water column near shore and up to about {{convert|100|km}} from the shoreline. Radium-226 is a decay product of [[thorium-230]], which is produced within sediments and supplied by rivers. However, these sources could not explain the high concentrations present in the study area.

{"title_page": "Chimney sweep", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2019}} \n[[File:Chimneysweep.png|thumb|John Colfer, a chimney sweeper in 1850, Wexford, Ireland.]]\nA '''chimney sweep''' is a person who clears [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[soot]] from [[chimney]]s. The chimney uses the [[Stack effect|pressure difference]] caused by a hot column of gas to create a draught and draw air over the hot coals or wood enabling continued combustion. Chimneys may be straight or contain many changes of direction. During normal operation, a layer of [[creosote]] builds up on the inside of the chimney, restricting the flow. The creosote can also catch fire, setting the [[chimney fire|chimney and the building alight]]. The chimney must be swept to remove the soot. This was done by the master sweep.\n\nIn [[Great Britain]], the master sweeps took apprentices, typically [[workhouse]] or orphan boys, and trained them to climb chimneys. In the [[States of the German Confederation|German States]], master sweeps belonged to [[trade guild]]s<ref name=Strange40>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=40}}</ref> and did not use climbing boys. In Italy, Belgium, and France climbing boys were used.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bub und Meister.JPG|thumb|A master chimney sweep (right) and his apprentice boy, known as a ''[[Spazzacamini|Spazzacamino]]'', in Italy at the end of the 19th century]]\n\nWith the increased urban population that came with the [[Age of Industrialization|age of industrialisation]], the number of houses with chimneys grew apace and the occupation of chimney sweep became much sought-after.\n\nBuildings were higher than before and the new chimneys' tops were grouped together.<ref name=Strange7>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=7}}</ref> The routes of flues from individual grates could involve two or more right angles and horizontal angled and vertical sections. The flues were made narrow to create a better draught, 14in by 9in being a common standard. Buckingham Palace had one flue with 15 angles, with the flue narrowing to 9in by 9in.<ref name=Strange64>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=64}}</ref> Chimney sweeping was one of the more difficult, hazardous, and low-paying occupations of the era, and consequently has been derided in verse, ballad and pantomime.\n\nThe first mechanical sweeper was invented by George Smart in 1803 but was resisted in the UK and the US. [[Joseph Glass (inventor)|Joseph Glass]] marketed an improved sweeping machine in 1828; he is credited with being the inventor of the modern chimney sweep's brush.<ref name=Strangexiii>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=xiii}}</ref> In the northern US, whites gave up the trade and employed black sweep-boys from the South.<ref name=Strange90/> After regulation finally took hold in 1875 in the UK and the turn of the century in the US, the occupation became romanticized in popular media.\n\n==Great Britain==\n[[File:Climbing boys in chimneys.svg|thumb|left|alt=This show a cross section of two chimneys with an internal diameter of about twenty eight centimetres in each is a climbing boy of about ten years old. To the left the boy is climbing by bracing his back and knees against the chimney. To the right the boy is 'stuck', his knees are wedged up against his chin, and calfs, thighs and torso block the chimney preventing him from moving up or down.|A boy climbing to the left;<br/>A boy 'stuck' to the right.]]\nBoys as young as four climbed hot [[flue]]s that could be as narrow as 81&nbsp;square&nbsp;inches (9x9 inches or 23x23 cm). Work was dangerous and they could get jammed in the flue, suffocate or burn to death. As soot is [[carcinogen]]ic, and as the boys slept under the soot sacks and were rarely washed, they were prone to [[chimney sweeps' carcinoma]]. From 1775 onwards there was increasing concern for the welfare of the boys, and [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] were passed to restrict, and in 1875 to stop this usage.<ref name=Strange80>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=80}}</ref> [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], the philanthropist, led the later campaign.\n\nChimneys started to appear in Britain around 1200, when they replaced the open fire burning in the middle of the one room house. At first there would be one heated room in the building and chimneys would be large. Over the next four hundred years, rooms became specialized and smaller and many were heated. Sea coal started to replace wood, and it deposited a layer of flammable creosote in the inside surface of the flue, and caked it with soot. Whereas before, the chimney was a vent for the smoke, now the plume of hot gas was used to suck air into the fire, and this required narrower flues.<ref name=Strange6>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> Even so, boys rarely climbed chimneys before the [[Great Fire of London]], when [[building regulations in the United Kingdom|building regulations]] were put in place and the design of chimneys was altered. The new chimneys were often angular and narrow, and the usual dimension of the flue in domestic properties was {{convert|9|in|cm}} by {{convert|14|in|cm}}. The master sweep was unable to climb into such small spaces himself and employed climbing boys to go up the chimneys to dislodge the soot. The boys often 'buffed it', that is, climbed in the nude,<ref name=Strange30>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=30}}</ref> propelling themselves by their knees and elbows which were scraped raw. They were often put up hot chimneys, and sometimes up chimneys that were alight in order to extinguish the fire. Chimneys with sharp angles posed a particular hazard.<ref name=Waldron390>{{Harvnb|Waldron|1983|p=390}}</ref> These boys were apprenticed to the sweep, and from 1778 until 1875 a series of laws attempted to regulate their working conditions, and many first hand accounts were documented and published in parliamentary reports. From about 1803, there was an alternative method of brushing chimneys, but sweeps and their clients resisted the change, preferring climbing boys to the new humane sweeping machines.<ref name=Strange46>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> Compulsory education was established in 1870 by the [[Education Act 1870]] but it was a further five years before legislation was put in place to license chimney sweeps and finally prevent boys being sent up chimneys.<ref name=Strangexiv>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=xiv}}</ref>\n\n===Climbing boys===\n[[File:Seven-flue Stack 1834.png|thumb|Cross-section of a seven-flue stack in a four-story house with cellars.

He would be paid by the parish to teach orphans or [[pauper]]s the craft. They were totally reliant on him: they or their guardians had signed [[Indenture|papers of indenture]], in front of a magistrate, which bound them to him until they were adults. It was the duty of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Poor Law guardian]]s to apprentice as many [[workhouse|children of the workhouse]] in their care as possible, so as to reduce costs to the parish. The master sweep had duties: to teach the craft and its mysteries, to provide the apprentice with a second suit of clothes, to have him cleaned once a week, allow him to attend church, and not send him up chimneys that were on fire. An apprentice agreed to obey his master.<ref name=Strange12>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=12}}</ref> Once his seven-year-long apprenticeship was completed he would become a [[journeyman]] sweep, and would continue to work for a master sweep of his choice. Other apprentices were sold on to the sweep, or sold by their parents. Prices ranged from 7&nbsp;[[shilling]]s<ref name=Strange21>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=21}}</ref> to 4 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s.\n\nIt was generally agreed that six was a good age to train a boy.<ref name=Strange14>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=14}}</ref> Though [[Lord Shaftesbury]] once encountered one of the age of four, they were considered to be too weak.<ref name=Strange14/> A master sweep would have many apprentices, who would start the morning by roaming the streets calling out \"''Soot -Oh, Sweep''\" or another cry to let the house-owners know they were around; this would remind the owners of the dangers of un-swept chimneys. When engaged, the master sweep would fix a cloth over the [[fireplace]], and the climbing boy would take off his boots and any excess clothes, then get behind it. The flue would be as tall as the house and twist several times, and its dimensions would be 14in by 9in. He would pull his cap down over his face and hold a large flat brush over his head, and wedge his body diagonally in the flue.<ref name=Strange18>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=18}}</ref> Using his back, elbows and knees, he would shimmy up the flue in the manner of a caterpillar<ref name=Strange14/> and use the brush to dislodge loose soot, which would fall over him and down to the bottom, and a scraper to chip away the solid bits, as a smooth chimney was a safe chimney. Having reached the top he would slide back down at speed back to the floor and the soot pile. It was now his job to bag up the soot and carry it back to the master sweep's cart or yard.\n\n[[Soot]] was valuable and could be sold for 9d a [[bushel]] in 1840.<ref name=mayhew353>{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=353}}</ref> An apprentice would do four or five chimneys a day. When they first started they scraped their knees and elbows, so the master would harden up their skin by standing them close to a hot fire and rubbing in strong brine using a brush. This was done each evening until the skin hardened.<ref name=Strange14/> The boys got no wages but lived with the master, who fed them. They slept together on the floor or in the cellar under the sacks and the cloth used during the day to catch the soot. This was known as \"sleeping black\".<ref name=\"Strange18\"/> The boy would be washed by the mistress in a tub in the yard; this might happen as often as once a week, but rarely. One sweep used to wash down his boys in [[the Serpentine]].<ref name=Strange71-72>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=71,72}}</ref> Another Nottingham sweep insisted they washed three times a year, for Christmas, [[Whitsun]] and the [[Goose Fair]]. Sometimes, a boy would need to be persuaded to climb faster or higher up the chimney, and the master sweep would light either a small fire of straw or a [[Sulfur|brimstone]] candle, to encourage him to try harder. Another method to stop him from \"going off\" ([[asphyxia]]ting) was to send another boy up behind him to prick pins into his buttocks or the soles of his feet.<ref name=Strange13>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=13}}</ref>\n\nChimneys varied in size. The common flue was designed to be one and a half bricks long by one brick wide, though they often narrowed to one brick square, that is {{convert|9|in|mm}} by {{convert|9|in|mm}} or less.<ref name=Strange16>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=16}}</ref> Often the chimney would still be hot from the fire, and occasionally it would actually be on fire.<ref name=Strange21/><ref name=Strange27>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=27}}</ref> Careless climbing boys could get stuck with their knees jammed against their chins. The harder they struggled the tighter they became wedged. They could remain in this position for many hours until they were pushed out from below or pulled out with a rope. If their struggling caused a fall of soot they would suffocate. Dead or alive the boy had to be removed and this would be done by removing bricks from the side of the chimney.<ref name=Strange26>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=26}}</ref> If the chimney was particularly narrow the boys would be told to \"buff it\", that is to do it naked;<ref name=Strange71>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=71}}</ref> otherwise they just wore trousers, and a shirt made from thick rough cotton cloth.\n\n===Health and safety concerns===\nThe conditions to which these children were subjected caused concern and societies were set up to promote mechanical means for sweeping chimneys and it is through their pamphlets that we have a better idea of what the job could entail. Here a sweep describes the fate of one boy:\n<blockquote>\nAfter passing through the chimney and descending to the second angle of the fireplace the Boy finds it completely filled with soot, which he has dislodged from the sides of the upright part. He endeavours to get through, and succeeds in doing so, after much struggling as far as his shoulders; but finding that the soot is compressed hard all around him, by his exertions, that he can recede no farther; he then endeavours to move forward, but his attempts in this respect are quite abortive; for the covering of the horizontal part of the Flue being stone, the sharp angle of which bears hard on his shoulders, and the back part of his head prevents him from moving in the least either one way or the other. His face, already covered with a climbing cap, and being pressed hard in the soot beneath him, stops his breath. In this dreadful condition he strives violently to extricate himself, but his strength fails him; he cries and groans, and in a few minutes he is suffocated. An alarm is then given, a brick-layer is sent for, an aperture is perforated in the Flue, and the boy is extracted, but found lifeless. In a short time an inquest is held, and a Coroner's Jury returns a verdict of 'Accidental Death.' \"<ref name=Waldron391>{{Harvnb|Waldron|1983|p=391}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThese however were not the only occupational hazards that chimney sweeps suffered. In the 1817 report to Parliament, witnesses reported that climbing boys suffered from general neglect, and exhibited stunted growth and deformity of the spine, legs, and arms, which were thought to be caused by being required to remain in abnormal positions for long periods of time before their bones had hardened. The knees and ankle joints were the most affected. Sores and inflammation of the eyelids that could lead to loss of sight, were slow in healing because the boy kept rubbing them. Bruises and burns were obvious hazards of having to work in an overheated environment. Cancer of the scrotum was found only in chimney sweeps so was referred to as Chimney Sweep Cancer in the teaching hospitals. Asthma and inflammation of the chest were attributed to the fact that the boys were out in all weathers.<ref name=Mayhew350>{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=350}}</ref>\n\n''[[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma]]'', which the sweeps called [[soot wart]], didn't occur until the sweep was in his late teens or twenties. It has now been identified as a manifestation of ''[[Squamous-cell carcinoma|scrotal squamous cell carcinoma]]''. It was reported in 1775 by [[Percival Pott|Sir Percival Pott]] in climbing boys or chimney sweepers. It is the first industrially related cancer to be found. Potts described it:\n<blockquote>\nIt is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of the [[scrotum]] where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges\u2026in no great length of time it pervades the skin, [[dartos]] and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the [[testicle]], which it inlarges [''sic''], hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the [[Spermatic cord|spermatic process]] into the [[abdomen]].\n</blockquote>\n\nHe also comments on the life of the boys:\n<blockquote>\nThe fate of these people seems peculiarly hard\u2026they are treated with great brutality\u2026they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies, [''sic''] where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to [[puberty]] they become\u2026liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease.</blockquote>\nThe carcinogen was thought to be [[coal tar]] possibly containing some [[arsenic]].<ref name=Waldron391/><ref name=\"Schwartz\">{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Robert A.|title=Skin Cancer: Recognition and Management|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|edition=3|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6CMGuQmQi4C&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=mule+spinners%27+cancer+squamous+cell+carcinoma.#v=onepage&q=mule%20spinners%27%20cancer%20squamous%20cell%20carcinoma.&f=false|accessdate=2 May 2011|isbn=978-0-470-69563-0}}</ref>\n\nThere were many deaths caused by accidents, frequently caused by the boy becoming jammed in the flue of a heated chimney, where he could suffocate or be burned to death. Sometimes a second boy would be sent to help, and on occasions would suffer the same fate.<ref name=Mayhew351>{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=351}}</ref>\n\n===Regulation===\n[[File:Schornsteinfeger, Wanfried, Deutschland, IMG 8113 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Chimney sweeper]]\nIn 1788, the [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1788]]: ''An Act for the Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and their Apprentices'' was passed, to limit a sweeper to six apprentices, at least 8 years old, but lacked enforcement.<ref name=\"keydates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/dates/work.htm|title= Key dates in Working Conditions, Factory Acts (Great Britain 1300 \u2013 1899)|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> It introduced the Apprenticeship Cap badge. The Act had been partially inspired by the interest in climbing boys shown by [[Jonas Hanway]], and his two publications ''The State of Chimney Sweepers' Young Apprentices'' (1773) and later ''Sentimental History of Chimney Sweeps in London and Westminster'' (1785). He asserted that while Parliament was exercised with the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] in the new world it was ignoring the slavery imposed on climbing boys. He looked to [[Edinburgh]] [[Scotland]] where sweeps were regulated by the police, climbing was not allowed and chimneys were swept by the Master Sweep himself pulling bundles of rags up and down the chimney. He did not see how climbing chimneys could be considered a valid apprenticeship, as the only skill obtained was that of climbing chimneys which did not lead to future employment.<ref name=Strange37>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=37}}</ref> Hanway advocated that Christianity should be brought into the boys' lives and lobbied for Sunday Schools for the boys. The [[House of Lords|Lords]] removed the proposed clause that Master Sweeps should be licensed, and before [[civil registration]], there was no way that anyone could check if a child was actually eight.\n\nIn the same year, David Porter, a humane master sweep, sent a petition to Parliament, and in 1792 published ''Considerations of the Present State of Chimney Sweepers with some Observations on the Act of Parliament intended for their Relief and Regulation''. Though concerned for the boys' welfare he believed that boys were more efficient than any of the new mechanical cleaning machines. In 1796 a society was formed for ''Bettering the Conditions of the Poor'', and they encouraged the reading of Hanway's and Porter's tracts. They had influential members and royal patronage from [[George III]].<ref name=Strange43>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=43}}</ref> A Friendly Society for the Protection and Education of Chimney-Sweepers' Boys had been established in 1800.<ref>(The Times 16 April 1800, Page 1, Column b.)</ref>\n\nIn 1803, it was thought by some that a mechanical brush could replace a climbing boy (the Human brush), and members of the 1796 society formed ''The London Society for Superseding the Necessity for Employing Climbing Boys'',<ref name=Strange43/> They ascertained that children had now cleaned flues as small as 7in by 7in, and promoted a competition for a mechanical brush. The prize was claimed by George Smart for what, in effect, was a brush head on a long segmented cane, made rigid by an adjustable cord that passed through the canes.<ref name=Strange44>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=44}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1834]] contained many of the needed regulations. It stated that an apprentice must express himself in front of a magistrate that he was'' willing and desirous''. Masters must not take on boys under the age of fourteen. The master could only have six apprentices and an apprentice could not be lent to another master. Boys under fourteen who were already apprenticed, must wear brass cap badges on a leather cap. Apprentices were not allowed to climb flues to extinguish fires. Street cries were regulated.<ref name=Strange65>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=65}}</ref> The act was resisted by the master sweeps, and the general public believed that property would be at risk if the flues were not cleaned by a climbing boy.\n\nAlso that year building regulations relating to the construction of chimneys were changed.\n\nThe [[Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840]] made it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to sweep chimneys. It was widely ignored. Attempts were made in 1852 and 1853 to reopen the issue, another enquiry was convened and more evidence was taken. There was no [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]. The ''Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864'', c37. tightened controls significantly, by authorizing fines and imprisonment for master sweeps who were ignoring the law, giving the police the power of arrest on suspicion and authorizing [[Board of Trade]] inspections of new and remodelled chimneys. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] was a main proponent of the Bill.\n\nIn February 1875 a twelve-year-old boy, George Brewster, was sent up the [[Fulbourn Hospital]] chimneys by his master, William Wyer. He stuck and smothered. The entire wall had to be pulled down to get him out and although he was still alive, he died shortly afterwards. There was a Coroner's Inquest which returned a verdict of [[manslaughter]]. Wyer was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment with hard labour. Lord Shaftesbury seized on the incident to press his campaign again. He wrote a series of letters to The Times and in September 1875 pushed another Bill through Parliament which finally stopped the practice of sending boys up chimneys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://human-nature.com/free-associations/clark/chap2.html|title=2 The Asylum Years|website=human-nature.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=Strange31>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=31}}</ref>\n\nA ''[[Chimney Sweepers Act 1875|Chimney Sweepers Act]]'' was passed in 1875 that required chimney sweepers ''to be authorized by the police to carry on their businesses in the district'', thus providing the legal means to enforce all previous legislation.<ref name=\"keydates\" />\n\n==United States==\n[[File:Studio portrait of young chimney sweeps, by Havens, O.

Differences arise from the nature of housing and the political pressures. Early settler houses were built close together out of wood, so when one burnt it spread quickly to neighbouring properties. This caused the authorities to regulate the design of flues. From an early date, fire wardens and inspectors were appointed.\n\nSweeping of the wide flues of these low buildings was often done by the householder himself, using a ladder to pass a wide brush down the chimney. In a narrow flue, a bag of bricks and brushwood would be dropped down the chimney. But in longer flues climbing boys were used, complete with the tradition of coercion and persuasion using burning straw and pins in the feet and the buttocks.<ref name=Strange90>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=90}}</ref> Sweeping was not a popular trade. During the eighteenth century the employment of African-American chimney sweeps spread from the south to the north. African-American sweeps faced discrimination and were accused of being inefficient and starting fires. It was claimed that there were fewer fires in London where chimneys were swept by white boys than in New York City. As in the UK, Smart's sweeping machine was available in the US shortly after 1803, but few were used. Unlike the UK, there were no societies formed to advocate for the climbing boys. In fact, the contemporary novel ''[[Tit for Tat (novel)|Tit for Tat]]'' went so far as to deny the Black slave chimney sweeps' hardships by claiming that they had it easier than the London chimney sweeps.<ref name=Strange93>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=93}}</ref>\n\n==Sweeps festivals==\nThe London boys had one day's holiday a year, the first of May, (Mayday) [[International Labour Day]].

The chimney uses the [[Stack effect|pressure difference]] caused by a hot column of gas to create a draught and draw air over the hot coals or wood enabling continued combustion. Chimneys may be straight or contain many changes of direction. During normal operation, a layer of [[creosote]] builds up on the inside of the chimney, restricting the flow. The creosote can also catch fire, setting the [[chimney fire|chimney and the building alight]]. The chimney must be swept to remove the soot. This was done by the master sweep.\n\nIn [[Great Britain]], the master sweeps took apprentices, typically [[workhouse]] or orphan boys, and trained them to climb chimneys.

Sea coal started to replace wood, and it deposited a layer of flammable creosote in the inside surface of the flue, and caked it with soot.

Prices ranged from 7&nbsp;[[shilling]]s<ref name=Strange21>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=21}}</ref> to 4 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s.\n\nIt was generally agreed that six was a good age to train a boy.<ref name=Strange14>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=14}}</ref> Though [[Lord Shaftesbury]] once encountered one of the age of four, they were considered to be too weak.<ref name=Strange14/> A master sweep would have many apprentices, who would start the morning by roaming the streets calling out \"''Soot -Oh, Sweep''\" or another cry to let the house-owners know they were around; this would remind the owners of the dangers of un-swept chimneys. When engaged, the master sweep would fix a cloth over the [[fireplace]], and the climbing boy would take off his boots and any excess clothes, then get behind it. The flue would be as tall as the house and twist several times, and its dimensions would be 14in by 9in. He would pull his cap down over his face and hold a large flat brush over his head, and wedge his body diagonally in the flue.<ref name=Strange18>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=18}}</ref> Using his back, elbows and knees, he would shimmy up the flue in the manner of a caterpillar<ref name=Strange14/> and use the brush to dislodge loose soot, which would fall over him and down to the bottom, and a scraper to chip away the solid bits, as a smooth chimney was a safe chimney. Having reached the top he would slide back down at speed back to the floor and the soot pile. It was now his job to bag up the soot and carry it back to the master sweep's cart or yard.\n\n[[Soot]] was valuable and could be sold for 9d a [[bushel]] in 1840.<ref name=mayhew353>{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=353}}</ref> An apprentice would do four or five chimneys a day. When they first started they scraped their knees and elbows, so the master would harden up their skin by standing them close to a hot fire and rubbing in strong brine using a brush. This was done each evening until the skin hardened.<ref name=Strange14/> The boys got no wages but lived with the master, who fed them. They slept together on the floor or in the cellar under the sacks and the cloth used during the day to catch the soot. This was known as \"sleeping black\".<ref name=\"Strange18\"/> The boy would be washed by the mistress in a tub in the yard; this might happen as often as once a week, but rarely. One sweep used to wash down his boys in [[the Serpentine]].<ref name=Strange71-72>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=71,72}}</ref> Another Nottingham sweep insisted they washed three times a year, for Christmas, [[Whitsun]] and the [[Goose Fair]]. Sometimes, a boy would need to be persuaded to climb faster or higher up the chimney, and the master sweep would light either a small fire of straw or a [[Sulfur|brimstone]] candle, to encourage him to try harder. Another method to stop him from \"going off\" ([[asphyxia]]ting) was to send another boy up behind him to prick pins into his buttocks or the soles of his feet.<ref name=Strange13>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=13}}</ref>\n\nChimneys varied in size. The common flue was designed to be one and a half bricks long by one brick wide, though they often narrowed to one brick square, that is {{convert|9|in|mm}} by {{convert|9|in|mm}} or less.<ref name=Strange16>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=16}}</ref> Often the chimney would still be hot from the fire, and occasionally it would actually be on fire.<ref name=Strange21/><ref name=Strange27>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=27}}</ref> Careless climbing boys could get stuck with their knees jammed against their chins. The harder they struggled the tighter they became wedged. They could remain in this position for many hours until they were pushed out from below or pulled out with a rope. If their struggling caused a fall of soot they would suffocate. Dead or alive the boy had to be removed and this would be done by removing bricks from the side of the chimney.<ref name=Strange26>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=26}}</ref> If the chimney was particularly narrow the boys would be told to \"buff it\", that is to do it naked;<ref name=Strange71>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=71}}</ref> otherwise they just wore trousers, and a shirt made from thick rough cotton cloth.\n\n===Health and safety concerns===\nThe conditions to which these children were subjected caused concern and societies were set up to promote mechanical means for sweeping chimneys and it is through their pamphlets that we have a better idea of what the job could entail. Here a sweep describes the fate of one boy:\n<blockquote>\nAfter passing through the chimney and descending to the second angle of the fireplace the Boy finds it completely filled with soot, which he has dislodged from the sides of the upright part. He endeavours to get through, and succeeds in doing so, after much struggling as far as his shoulders; but finding that the soot is compressed hard all around him, by his exertions, that he can recede no farther; he then endeavours to move forward, but his attempts in this respect are quite abortive; for the covering of the horizontal part of the Flue being stone, the sharp angle of which bears hard on his shoulders, and the back part of his head prevents him from moving in the least either one way or the other. His face, already covered with a climbing cap, and being pressed hard in the soot beneath him, stops his breath. In this dreadful condition he strives violently to extricate himself, but his strength fails him; he cries and groans, and in a few minutes he is suffocated. An alarm is then given, a brick-layer is sent for, an aperture is perforated in the Flue, and the boy is extracted, but found lifeless. In a short time an inquest is held, and a Coroner's Jury returns a verdict of 'Accidental Death.' \"<ref name=Waldron391>{{Harvnb|Waldron|1983|p=391}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThese however were not the only occupational hazards that chimney sweeps suffered. In the 1817 report to Parliament, witnesses reported that climbing boys suffered from general neglect, and exhibited stunted growth and deformity of the spine, legs, and arms, which were thought to be caused by being required to remain in abnormal positions for long periods of time before their bones had hardened. The knees and ankle joints were the most affected. Sores and inflammation of the eyelids that could lead to loss of sight, were slow in healing because the boy kept rubbing them. Bruises and burns were obvious hazards of having to work in an overheated environment. Cancer of the scrotum was found only in chimney sweeps so was referred to as Chimney Sweep Cancer in the teaching hospitals. Asthma and inflammation of the chest were attributed to the fact that the boys were out in all weathers.<ref name=Mayhew350>{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=350}}</ref>\n\n''[[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma]]'', which the sweeps called [[soot wart]], didn't occur until the sweep was in his late teens or twenties. It has now been identified as a manifestation of ''[[Squamous-cell carcinoma|scrotal squamous cell carcinoma]]''. It was reported in 1775 by [[Percival Pott|Sir Percival Pott]] in climbing boys or chimney sweepers. It is the first industrially related cancer to be found. Potts described it:\n<blockquote>\nIt is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of the [[scrotum]] where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges\u2026in no great length of time it pervades the skin, [[dartos]] and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the [[testicle]], which it inlarges [''sic''], hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the [[Spermatic cord|spermatic process]] into the [[abdomen]].\n</blockquote>\n\nHe also comments on the life of the boys:\n<blockquote>\nThe fate of these people seems peculiarly hard\u2026they are treated with great brutality\u2026they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies, [''sic''] where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to [[puberty]] they become\u2026liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease.</blockquote>\nThe carcinogen was thought to be [[coal tar]] possibly containing some [[arsenic]].<ref name=Waldron391/><ref name=\"Schwartz\">{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Robert A.|title=Skin Cancer: Recognition and Management|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|edition=3|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6CMGuQmQi4C&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=mule+spinners%27+cancer+squamous+cell+carcinoma.#v=onepage&q=mule%20spinners%27%20cancer%20squamous%20cell%20carcinoma.&f=false|accessdate=2 May 2011|isbn=978-0-470-69563-0}}</ref>\n\nThere were many deaths caused by accidents, frequently caused by the boy becoming jammed in the flue of a heated chimney, where he could suffocate or be burned to death. Sometimes a second boy would be sent to help, and on occasions would suffer the same fate.<ref name=Mayhew351>{{Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=351}}</ref>\n\n===Regulation===\n[[File:Schornsteinfeger, Wanfried, Deutschland, IMG 8113 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Chimney sweeper]]\nIn 1788, the [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1788]]: ''An Act for the Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and their Apprentices'' was passed, to limit a sweeper to six apprentices, at least 8 years old, but lacked enforcement.<ref name=\"keydates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/dates/work.htm|title= Key dates in Working Conditions, Factory Acts (Great Britain 1300 \u2013 1899)|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> It introduced the Apprenticeship Cap badge. The Act had been partially inspired by the interest in climbing boys shown by [[Jonas Hanway]], and his two publications ''The State of Chimney Sweepers' Young Apprentices'' (1773) and later ''Sentimental History of Chimney Sweeps in London and Westminster'' (1785). He asserted that while Parliament was exercised with the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] in the new world it was ignoring the slavery imposed on climbing boys. He looked to [[Edinburgh]] [[Scotland]] where sweeps were regulated by the police, climbing was not allowed and chimneys were swept by the Master Sweep himself pulling bundles of rags up and down the chimney. He did not see how climbing chimneys could be considered a valid apprenticeship, as the only skill obtained was that of climbing chimneys which did not lead to future employment.<ref name=Strange37>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=37}}</ref> Hanway advocated that Christianity should be brought into the boys' lives and lobbied for Sunday Schools for the boys. The [[House of Lords|Lords]] removed the proposed clause that Master Sweeps should be licensed, and before [[civil registration]], there was no way that anyone could check if a child was actually eight.\n\nIn the same year, David Porter, a humane master sweep, sent a petition to Parliament, and in 1792 published ''Considerations of the Present State of Chimney Sweepers with some Observations on the Act of Parliament intended for their Relief and Regulation''. Though concerned for the boys' welfare he believed that boys were more efficient than any of the new mechanical cleaning machines. In 1796 a society was formed for ''Bettering the Conditions of the Poor'', and they encouraged the reading of Hanway's and Porter's tracts. They had influential members and royal patronage from [[George III]].<ref name=Strange43>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=43}}</ref> A Friendly Society for the Protection and Education of Chimney-Sweepers' Boys had been established in 1800.<ref>(The Times 16 April 1800, Page 1, Column b.)</ref>\n\nIn 1803, it was thought by some that a mechanical brush could replace a climbing boy (the Human brush), and members of the 1796 society formed ''The London Society for Superseding the Necessity for Employing Climbing Boys'',<ref name=Strange43/> They ascertained that children had now cleaned flues as small as 7in by 7in, and promoted a competition for a mechanical brush. The prize was claimed by George Smart for what, in effect, was a brush head on a long segmented cane, made rigid by an adjustable cord that passed through the canes.<ref name=Strange44>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=44}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1834]] contained many of the needed regulations. It stated that an apprentice must express himself in front of a magistrate that he was'' willing and desirous''. Masters must not take on boys under the age of fourteen. The master could only have six apprentices and an apprentice could not be lent to another master. Boys under fourteen who were already apprenticed, must wear brass cap badges on a leather cap. Apprentices were not allowed to climb flues to extinguish fires. Street cries were regulated.<ref name=Strange65>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=65}}</ref> The act was resisted by the master sweeps, and the general public believed that property would be at risk if the flues were not cleaned by a climbing boy.\n\nAlso that year building regulations relating to the construction of chimneys were changed.\n\nThe [[Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840]] made it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to sweep chimneys. It was widely ignored. Attempts were made in 1852 and 1853 to reopen the issue, another enquiry was convened and more evidence was taken. There was no [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]. The ''Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864'', c37. tightened controls significantly, by authorizing fines and imprisonment for master sweeps who were ignoring the law, giving the police the power of arrest on suspicion and authorizing [[Board of Trade]] inspections of new and remodelled chimneys. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] was a main proponent of the Bill.\n\nIn February 1875 a twelve-year-old boy, George Brewster, was sent up the [[Fulbourn Hospital]] chimneys by his master, William Wyer. He stuck and smothered. The entire wall had to be pulled down to get him out and although he was still alive, he died shortly afterwards. There was a Coroner's Inquest which returned a verdict of [[manslaughter]]. Wyer was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment with hard labour. Lord Shaftesbury seized on the incident to press his campaign again. He wrote a series of letters to The Times and in September 1875 pushed another Bill through Parliament which finally stopped the practice of sending boys up chimneys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://human-nature.com/free-associations/clark/chap2.html|title=2 The Asylum Years|website=human-nature.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=Strange31>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=31}}</ref>\n\nA ''[[Chimney Sweepers Act 1875|Chimney Sweepers Act]]'' was passed in 1875 that required chimney sweepers ''to be authorized by the police to carry on their businesses in the district'', thus providing the legal means to enforce all previous legislation.<ref name=\"keydates\" />\n\n==United States==\n[[File:Studio portrait of young chimney sweeps, by Havens, O.

They look between eleven and fourteen years old, wear rough clothes and battered hats and caps.| A studio portrait of four New York climbing boys, with brushes and scrapers]]\n\nThe history of sweeping in the United States varies little from that in the United Kingdom. Differences arise from the nature of housing and the political pressures. Early settler houses were built close together out of wood, so when one burnt it spread quickly to neighbouring properties. This caused the authorities to regulate the design of flues. From an early date, fire wardens and inspectors were appointed.\n\nSweeping of the wide flues of these low buildings was often done by the householder himself, using a ladder to pass a wide brush down the chimney. In a narrow flue, a bag of bricks and brushwood would be dropped down the chimney. But in longer flues climbing boys were used, complete with the tradition of coercion and persuasion using burning straw and pins in the feet and the buttocks.<ref name=Strange90>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=90}}</ref> Sweeping was not a popular trade. During the eighteenth century the employment of African-American chimney sweeps spread from the south to the north. African-American sweeps faced discrimination and were accused of being inefficient and starting fires. It was claimed that there were fewer fires in London where chimneys were swept by white boys than in New York City. As in the UK, Smart's sweeping machine was available in the US shortly after 1803, but few were used. Unlike the UK, there were no societies formed to advocate for the climbing boys. In fact, the contemporary novel ''[[Tit for Tat (novel)|Tit for Tat]]'' went so far as to deny the Black slave chimney sweeps' hardships by claiming that they had it easier than the London chimney sweeps.<ref name=Strange93>{{Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=93}}</ref>\n\n==Sweeps festivals==\nThe London boys had one day's holiday a year, the first of May, (Mayday) [[International Labour Day]].

There is a greater understanding of the dangers of flue deposits and [[carbon monoxide]] and gases from combustion. The standard chimney brush is still used, along with more modern tools (such as vacuums, cameras and special chimney cleaning tools{{Example needed|date=December 2018}}). Most sweeps are done from the bottom of the chimney, rather than the top, to prevent the dispersion of dust and debris and because it is safer for the chimney sweep to do the sweeping from this position. Inspection may be done from the bottom or top, or both if accessible.\n\nMost modern chimney sweeps are professionals, and are usually trained to diagnose and repair hazards along with maintenance such as removal of [[creosote|flammable creosote]], firebox and damper repair, and smoke chamber repair. Some sweeps also offer more complicated repairs such as flue repair and relining, crown repair, and [[tuckpointing]] or rebuilding of masonry chimneys and cement crowns.\n\nIn the US, the two trade organizations that help to regulate the industry are the [[Modern chimney cleaning#Chimney Safety Institute of America|Chimney Safety Institute of America]] and [[National Chimney Sweep Guild|The National Chimney Sweep Guild]]. Certification for chimney sweeps are issued by two organizations: [[Modern chimney cleaning#Certified Chimney Professionals|Certified Chimney Professionals]] and The [[Chimney Safety Institute of America]], which was first to establish certification and requires sweeps to re-test every three years or demonstrate the commitment to education by earning CEUs through CSIA or the National Fireplace Institute to bypass the test.

After the kidnapping of their parents and going through countless abusive foster homes, Sabrina is incredibly suspicious and hesitant trust their grandmother. Sabrina, having been told her whole life that her grandmother is dead, believes she is an imposter. 'Granny'  lives with a man named Mr. Canis, who she says helps her take care of the house. They soon find out that their grandmother is a very strange person. Her house is filled with fairy tale books, her dog, elvis, initially attacks Sabrina, her door has eight locks and eight different keys, her car has a rope rather than a seatbelt, and they are told that they aren't allowed to let anyone or anything in the house without granny or Canis' permission first. Granny claims that she was close with their parents, and has received letters from them in the past. That night, Sabrina attempts to escape with Daphne through the woods, but they are attacked by small bugs that resemble fireflies. When granny finds them, she refers to the bugs as [[pixie]]s, and keeps them away with a mysterious blue dust that seems to put them to sleep. Granny doesn't seem angry, but she has their windows nailed shut.\n\nAfter, granny and canis drive with the girls through the town, eventually reaching what appears to be the scene of a crime, a house that has been completely crushed into rubble. Granny and Canis leave the girls alone to go investigate the scene, and while Sabrina and Daphne wait, they encounter Mr. Seven and his employer, Mr. Charming. Both seem to have a serious disdain for the Grimm Family, despite being familiar with granny and canis. Granny finds a fresh leaf on the ground and decides that it's from a beanstalk, but Mr. Charming seems eager to dismiss and cover up the case. Granny tells the girls she believes the house has been stepped on by a giant. Sabrina thinks she's gone crazy, and Daphne thinks she's joking, but later they both realize that the rubble is sitting in the indentation of a massive footprint. At the house, Granny finally informs the girls that they are late descendants of the Brothers Grimm.\n\nShe tells them that every fairy tale the Brothers Grimm wrote was actually an accurate account of something that really happened. She explains that in the past, fairy tale creatures, or 'Everafters,' and normal humans lived side by side. However, much later in history, as tensions grew, magic was banned and any dangerous everafters were captured and caged. The Grimm brothers collected and documented as many stories as they could of everafters, and became friends with many of them in the process. Many everafters moved to America to build a safe community, with Wilhelm Grimm as their leader. However, as the human population began to grow, rebel groups formed in Ferryport landing in order to eradicate the human population. In order to prevent an all out war, Wilhelm Grimm went to Baba Yaga, a powerful witch, and asked her to put a spell over the town keeping all everafters in permanently. Baba Yaga granted this in exchange for Wilhelm's freedom, meaning one grimm would always have to stay in fairyport landing for the spell to stay intact. Granny tells them that the peace in Ferryport Landing is fragile, and it's the Grimm Family's job to maintain it.\n\nAfter, the family goes to the hospital to visit the farmer who was injured in the giant accident, only to find that Mr. Charming (revealed to be prince charming) has beaten them and erased the farmer's memory. Despite this, they interview the farmer's wife at his bedside. The farmer's wife, Mrs. Applebee, informs them that her husband had sworn he'd seen a giant, but she believes a different theory. She says there was a british man who often visited their farm and asked to rent their field, but became hostile when they refused. She says that later, the man had returned, apologized for being so rude, and offered to pay for them to stay in New York City as an apology. Mrs. Applebee had gone with her sister rather than her husband. However, when they arrived, the hotel had no record of their reservation. On the way out, the family is ambushed by a group of 'goons' who threaten the grimms to abandon the case. Granny is not scared, and instead sees this as a sign they are on the right path. Granny decides to follow the gang and find out who employed them in a stakeout. On the way, she tells them about giants. the only person to ever have successfully robbed and killed a giant was Jack,(from [[Jack and the Beanstalk]]), but now he works at a retail store in town. On the stakeout, while granny and canis are distracted, sabrina makes an attempt to escape with daphne, despite daphne's protests. just after they leave the car, it is attacked by a giant. The giant, chanting about how he must find \"the englishman\" picks up the car, containing granny and canis, and walks away with it, leaving the girls alone in the woods with only granny's handbag. They try to hitchhike, but encounter Officer Hamstead, one of the three little pigs. He offers to drive the girls home, but they discover he works for mr. Charming, and make an escape. The girls follow pixie lights into the woods and soon meet [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] (from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''). Puck originally believes they are spies and tries to drown them, claiming they have stolen the old lady away from him. they mistake  him for the infamous [[Peter Pan]], which enrages him even further. He originally decides that he won't help them find granny because he is a self-proclaimed villain. however, he follows them home, helps them get back into the house, and agrees to help them save their grandmother just because she was kind to him and fed him since he was little. Puck and Sabrina share a clear hatred for each other and spend the majority of the time bickering. Sabrina and Daphne find their father's diary, detailing his accounts with Mayor Charming. It reveals that the upcoming fundraiser ball at prince charming's mansion is a scam he created to make money after a series of business fails. they also find out that giants are very gullible. they theorize that mayor charming tricked a giant into crushing the house for him, and that mayor charming is the 'englishman.'\n\nAfter, the girls find a letter in granny's purse telling them to enter the room in her house that she previously declared off limits. Inside, they discover the Magic Mirror from [[Snow White]] that is in their home. they can ask the mirror any rhyming question, and it will answer. they first ask if granny is alive, to which the mirror replies that both her and canis are okay. they then find out that they are still in the car in the giant's shirt pocket. when they ask who they can go to, to help defeat the giant, the mirror shows them Jack the giant killer, sitting in a cell. However, at the same time, they are pursued by the police, Officers Hamstead, Swineheart, and Boarman (from [[The Three Little Pigs]]). Sabrina, Daphne, and Puck escape the house on a [[magic carpet]] and fly to the Ferryport Landing prison where they rescue Jack (from [[Jack and the Beanstalk]]). The officer guarding jack is ichabod crane, so the girls disguise themselves as the headless horseman to distract him while Jack escapes. while they fly away, Jack purposefully attracts attention from the police. then, the giant makes a reappearance and chases them through town, causing destruction everywhere they go. Jack seems to enjoy the attention, while sabrina and daphne struggle to stay on the carpet. They get home and Jack decides they should spend the night, though sabrina is hesitant to let him stay in their house. Late at night, Puck and Sabrina discuss their distrust for Jack, only to stumble upon him and the dog in a fight. Puck accuses Jack of having 'sticky fingers', or thieving. they briefly fight before the girls stop them. Jack keeps mentioning his \"big plan,\" but refraining from telling the girls what it is. After this secrecy causes sabrina to finally snap and ream jack out, he reveals that his plan is for them to sneak into Charming's office during the fundraiser ball and steal his city planning blueprints. Jack believes this will lead them to wherever Charming wants to send the giant next.\n\nThe group uses the mirror to get disguises as well as the ruby slippers from the wizard of oz. Sabrina (disguised as Momma Bear from [[Goldilocks]]) and Daphne (disguised as the [[Tinman]]) are told by the mirror that their disguises will wear off at nine o clock. the sisters use the magic slippers to get into charmings mansion.the girls encounter many fairy tale creatures who all discuss Granny Relda's incident with the giant. the whole town is familiar with the grimm family. the everafters have a blatant disdain for the grimms and loudly discuss how they hope the family will soon die out so they can leave the town. they are only interrupted by Briar Rose, or sleeping beauty, who defends the grimm family. the girls also find out that there is a possibility that their parents were kidnapped rather than just having abandoned the girls. Sabrina sneaks away into the mayor's office, where she finds tape recordings of the giant crushing the farmer's house. Suddenly, sabrina is caught by prince charming, who already has daphne. he threatens to kill them if they don't tell him who they really are. He also mentions that he doesn't want to join the \"scarlet hand,\" a 'revolution.' The girls change back into themselves just in time, as a giant arrives outside the party. Charming attempts to throw them outside, but the party has formed a mob that is impossible to penetrate. the three witches start to fight the giant, which daphne protests as granny and canis are still in its pocket.\n\nKing arthur and the knights of the round table fight the giant off, and the guests leave the party enraged with charming.  the girls demand that charming give them their grandmother back, sure that he is in control of the giant. However, Charming's tapes reveal the real culprit: Jack. Jack tricked them. He was the one who set loose the giant hoping that by killing it in front of a crowd of news reporters he would come back into his former fame. Charming sent hamstead to take them out of town long enough to kill the giant and save their grandmother. the girls ask why charming would want to help them, and he replies 'I have my reasons.\" they return home quickly after this realization to find that jack has ransacked their home and injured elvis. Jack has stolen several magic beans from the mirror. charming and the girls get weapons from the mirror and go to fight jack, who has released a new giant and is attempting to anger it. Sabrina accidentally kills the giant with excalibur and enrages jack. Jack tries to kill sabrina and daphne but they are rescued by Mr. Canis, who turns out to be the [[Big Bad Wolf]] and the giant is sent back to its kingdom accompanied by Jack to meet its [[Queen consort|queen]].\n\nThe girls discover that a shady organization known as the scarlet hand is responsible for kidnapping their parents. It is also revealed that Puck will be moving in with them.\n\n==Characters==\n*Sabrina Grimm\n*Daphne Grimm\n*Granny Relda Grimm\n*Mr. Canis\n*Puck\n*Mayor Charming\n*Mr. Seven\n*Jack the Giant Killer\n*Sheriff Hamstead\n*Officer Boarman\n*Officer Swinehart\n*Elvis (Dog)\n*Mirror\n*Icabod Crane\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairy-Tale Detectives, The}}\n[[Category:2005 American novels]]\n[[Category:2005 children's books]]\n[[Category:2005 fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:American fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:American mystery novels]]\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Children's mystery novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = The Fairy-Tale Detectives\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = The Fairy-Tale Detectives.jpg<!--prefer 1st edition-->\n| caption = \n| author        = [[Michael Buckley (author)|Michael Buckley]]\n| illustrator   = Peter Ferguson\n| cover_artist  = Peter Ferguson\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        = [[The Sisters Grimm (novel series)|The Sisters Grimm series]]\n| genre         = [[Fantasy novel|Fantasy]] [[Mystery novel]]\n| publisher     = [[Harry N.

That night, Sabrina attempts to escape with Daphne through the woods, but they are attacked by small bugs that resemble fireflies. When granny finds them, she refers to the bugs as [[pixie]]s, and keeps them away with a mysterious blue dust that seems to put them to sleep. Granny doesn't seem angry, but she has their windows nailed shut.\n\nAfter, granny and canis drive with the girls through the town, eventually reaching what appears to be the scene of a crime, a house that has been completely crushed into rubble. Granny and Canis leave the girls alone to go investigate the scene, and while Sabrina and Daphne wait, they encounter Mr. Seven and his employer, Mr. Charming. Both seem to have a serious disdain for the Grimm Family, despite being familiar with granny and canis. Granny finds a fresh leaf on the ground and decides that it's from a beanstalk, but Mr. Charming seems eager to dismiss and cover up the case. Granny tells the girls she believes the house has been stepped on by a giant. Sabrina thinks she's gone crazy, and Daphne thinks she's joking, but later they both realize that the rubble is sitting in the indentation of a massive footprint. At the house, Granny finally informs the girls that they are late descendants of the Brothers Grimm. \n\nShe tells them that every fairy tale the Brothers Grimm wrote was actually an accurate account of something that really happened. She explains that in the past, fairy tale creatures, or 'Everafters,' and normal humans lived side by side. However, much later in history, as tensions grew, magic was banned and any dangerous everafters were captured and caged. The Grimm brothers collected and documented as many stories as they could of everafters, and became friends with many of them in the process. Many everafters moved to America to build a safe community, with Wilhelm Grimm as their leader. However, as the human population began to grow, rebel groups formed in Ferryport landing in order to eradicate the human population. In order to prevent an all out war, Wilhelm Grimm went to Baba Yaga, a powerful witch, and asked her to put a spell over the town keeping all everafters in permanantly. Baba Yaga granted this in exchange for Wilhelm's freedom, meaning one grimm would always have to stay in fairyport landing for the spell to stay intact. Granny tells them that the peace in Ferryport Landing is fragile, and it's the Grimm Family's job to maintain it. \n\nAfter, the family goes to the hospital to visit the farmer who was injured in the giant accident, only to find that Mr. Charming (revealed to be prince charming) has beaten them and erased the farmer's memory. Despite this, they interview the farmer's wife at his bedside. The farmer's wife, Mrs. Applebee, informs them that her husband had sworn he'd seen a giant, but she believes a different theory. She says there was a british man who often visited their farm and asked to rent their field, but became hostile when they refused. She says that later, the man had returned, apologized for being so rude, and offered to pay for them to stay in New York City as an apology. Mrs. Applebee had gone with her sister rather than her husband. However, when they arrived, the hotel had no record of their reservation. On the way out, the family is ambushed by a group of 'goons' who threaten the grimms to abandon the case. Granny is not scared, and instead sees this as a sign they are on the right path. Granny decides to follow the gang and find out who employed them in a stakeout. On the way, she tells them about giants. the only person to ever have successfully robbed and killed a giant was Jack,(from [[Jack and the Beanstalk]]), but now he works at a retail store in town. On the stakeout, while granny and canis are distracted, sabrina makes an attempt to escape with daphne, despite daphne's protests. just after they leave the car, it is attacked by a giant. The giant, chanting about how he must find \"the englishman\" picks up the car, containing granny and canis, and walks away with it, leaving the girls alone in the woods with only granny's handbag. They try to hitchhike, but encounter Officer Hamstead, one of the three little pigs. He offers to drive the girls home, but they discover he works for mr. Charming, and make an escape. The girls follow pixie lights into the woods and soon meet [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] (from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''). Puck originally believes they are spies and tries to drown them, claiming they have stolen the old lady away from him. they mistake  him for the infamous [[Peter Pan]], which enrages him even further. He originally decides that he won't help them find granny because he is a self-proclaimed villain. however, he follows them home, helps them get back into the house, and agrees to help them save their grandmother just because she was kind to him and fed him since he was little. Puck and Sabrina share a clear hatred for each other and spend the majority of the time bickering. Sabrina and Daphne find their father's diary, detailing his accounts with Mayor Charming. It reveals that the upcoming fundraiser ball at prince charming's mansion is a scam he created to make money after a series of business fails. they also find out that giants are very gullible. they theorize that mayor charming tricked a giant into crushing the house for him, and that mayor charming is the 'englishman.' \n\nAfter, the girls find a letter in granny's purse telling them to enter the room in her house that she previously declared off limits. Inside, they discover the Magic Mirror from [[Snow White]] that is in their home. they can ask the mirror any rhyming question, and it will answer. they first ask if granny is alive, to which the mirror replies that both her and canis are okay. they then find out that they are still in the car in the giant's shirt pocket. when they ask who they can go to, to help defeat the giant, the mirror shows them Jack the giant killer, sitting in a cell. However, at the same time, they are pursued by the police, Officers Hamstead, Swineheart, and Boarman (from [[The Three Little Pigs]]). Sabrina, Daphne, and Puck escape the house on a [[magic carpet]] and fly to the Ferryport Landing prison where they rescue Jack (from [[Jack and the Beanstalk]]). The officer guarding jack is ichabod crane, so the girls disguise themselves as the headless horseman to distract him while Jack escapes. while they fly away, Jack purposefully attracts attention from the police. then, the giant makes a reappearance and chases them through town, causing destruction everywhere they go. Jack seems to enjoy the attention, while sabrina and daphne struggle to stay on the carpet. They get home and Jack decides they should spend the night, though sabrina is hesitant to let him stay in their house. Late at night, Puck and Sabrina discuss their distrust for Jack, only to stumble upon him and the dog in a fight. Puck accuses Jack of having 'sticky fingers', or thieving. they briefly fight before the girls stop them. Jack keeps mentioning his \"big plan,\" but refraining from telling the girls what it is. After this secrecy causes sabrina to finally snap and ream jack out, he reveals that his plan is for them to sneak into Charming's office during the fundraiser ball and steal his city planning blueprints. Jack believes this will lead them to wherever Charming wants to send the giant next.\n\nThe group uses the mirror to get disguises as well as the ruby slippers from the wizard of oz. Sabrina (disguised as Momma Bear from [[Goldilocks]]) and Daphne (disguised as the [[Tinman]]) are told by the mirror that their disguises will wear off at nine o clock. the sisters use the magic slippers to get into charmings mansion.the girls encounter many fairy tale creatures who all discuss Granny Relda's incident with the giant. the whole town is familiar with the grimm family. the everafters have a blatant disdain for the grimms and loudly discuss how they hope the family will soon die out so they can leave the town. they are only interrupted by Briar Rose, or sleeping beauty, who defends the grimm family. the girls also find out that there is a possibility that their parents were kidnapped rather than just having abandoned the girls. Sabrina sneaks away into the mayor's office, where she finds tape recordings of the giant crushing the farmer's house. Suddenly, sabrina is caught by prince charming, who already has daphne. he threatens to kill them if they don't tell him who they really are. He also mentions that he doesn't want to join the \"scarlet hand,\" a 'revolution.' The girls change back into themselves just in time, as a giant arrives outside the party. Charming attempts to throw them outside, but the party has formed a mob that is impossible to penetrate. the three witches start to fight the giant, which daphne protests as granny and canis are still in its pocket. \n\nKing arthur and the knights of the round table fight the giant off, and the guests leave the party enraged with charming.  the girls demand that charming give them their grandmother back, sure that he is in control of the giant. However, Charming's tapes reveal the real culprit: Jack. Jack tricked them. He was the one who set loose the giant hoping that by killing it in front of a crowd of news reporters he would come back into his former fame. Charming sent hamstead to take them out of town long enough to kill the giant and save their grandmother. the girls ask why charming would want to help them, and he replies 'I have my reasons.\" they return home quickly after this realization to find that jack has ransacked their home and injured elvis. Jack has stolen several magic beans from the mirror. charming and the girls get weapons from the mirror and go to fight jack, who has released a new giant and is attempting to anger it. Sabrina accidentally kills the giant with excalibur and enrages jack. Jack tries to kill sabrina and daphne but they are rescued by Mr. Canis, who turns out to be the [[Big Bad Wolf]] and the giant is sent back to its kingdom accompanied by Jack to meet its [[Queen consort|queen]]. \n\nThe girls discover that a shady organization known as the scarlet hand is responsible for kidnapping their parents. It is also revealed that Puck will be moving in with them.\n\n==Characters==\n*Sabrina Grimm\n*Daphne Grimm\n*Granny Relda Grimm\n*Mr. Canis\n*Puck\n*Mayor Charming\n*Mr. Seven\n*Jack the Giant Killer\n*Sheriff Hamstead\n*Officer Boarman\n*Officer Swinehart\n*Elvis (Dog)\n*Mirror\n*Icabod Crane\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairy-Tale Detectives, The}}\n[[Category:2005 American novels]]\n[[Category:2005 children's books]]\n[[Category:2005 fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:American fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:American mystery novels]]\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Children's mystery novels]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot summary:Typo/generalfixes, replaced: permanantly \u2192 permanently", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fairy-Tale_Detectives"}
