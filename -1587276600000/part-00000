It was released on May 14, 2002, on [[Anthem Records]], and was their first studio release since ''[[Test for Echo]]'' (1996), the longest gap between two Rush albums. After the Test For Echo tour finished in July 1997, the group entered an extended hiatus following personal tragedies suffered by drummer and lyricist [[Neil Peart]]. The  band reunited in January 2001 to rehearse material for a new album, recording for which lasted until November.<ref name=\"Vapor Trails news archive\">Vapor Trails news archive [http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/VTnews.htm Power Windows website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616202159/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/VTnews.htm |date=2008-06-16 }}.

Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which he traveled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering {{convert|88,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At some point in his journey, Peart decided to return to the band. In his book ''[[Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road]]'', Peart writes of how he had told his band mates at Selena's funeral, \"consider me retired.\"<ref name=\"Peart-GhostRider\">Peart, Neil.

They discussed what they wanted to achieve and how the album should take shape. Lifeson said it was to get \"a feel for each other's frame of mind. We needed to see if everybody was really up for it.\"<ref name=GPLAYER02>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20020800guitarplayer.htm|title=Back in the Limelight: Alex Lifeson and Rush Reignite After a Five-Year Hiatus|first=Shawn|last=Hammond|date=August 2002|magazine=Guitar Player|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}</ref>. Lee and Lifeson said that they chose the studio based on its \"artist friendly environment, that was very comfortable and accommodating\".<ref name=CM2002/> Among the topics discussed was the album's musical direction which became a source of difficulty as initially, there was little agreement on what it should be. Upon reaching a consensus, Lifeson said the three found common ground \"on every aspect of the recording.\"<ref name=GPLAYER02/>\n\nThe band started working, adopting a three-week-on, one-week-off schedule with no one present apart from a technical assistant.<ref name=JAM2001>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20010112jam.htm|title=Geddy Lee on the Rush Reunion|publisher=Jam! Showbiz|date=12 January 2001|first=Paul|last=Cantin|accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=CM2002/> The group was hopeful there was still chemistry amongst them to make an album. They adopted their usual method of writing with Lee and Lifeson working together on musical ideas in the studio control room while Peart worked elsewhere on the lyrics, this time using a pen, paper and a computer. Peart wrote about their attitude towards the sessions: \"We laid out no parameters, no goals, no limitations, only that we would take a relaxed, civilized approach.\"<ref name=TOURBOOK/> Peart looked through his scrapbook of notes and phrases he'd collected and explored ways of connecting them together to form a complete lyrical idea. Lee and Lifeson developed ideas largely through jam sessions typically kicked off by setting a pattern on a drum machine and playing along, recording every session using [[Logic Pro]].<ref name=TOURBOOK/> This was to avoid making a demo tape of a collection of songs and re-record them at a later point. This way early takes became the basis of the songs which kept the music fresh using as many original takes where possible.<ref name=CM2002/>\n\nAfter several weeks Peart presented the ideas he'd formed, but Lee and Lifeson had not put down any concrete pieces of music. Peart recalled they were not yet \"serious\" and still wanted to play and explore ideas as sifting through what they had put to tape was a tedious process and disrupted their creative flow.<ref name=TOURBOOK/> Peart had completed six sets of lyrics at this point but was not getting feedback from his bandmates as he had before, so he paused on lyrics and focused on his book ''[[Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road]]''.<ref name=TOURBOOK/><ref name=MD2002>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20020900moderndrummer.htm|title=Neil Peart: The Fire Returns|first=William F.|last=Miller|magazine=Modern Drummer|date=September 2002|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}</ref> The three became dissatisfied with what they'd come up with and thought it was too forced, which led to their decision to take some weeks off. They felt refreshed and more focused upon resuming and were able to work out complete songs and not just sections.<ref name=GPLAYER02/> The songs that emerged from these early jams were \"Peaceable Kingdom,\" \"Ceiling Unlimited\" and \"Nocturne,\" and they contain some parts put down from the original takes.<ref name=GPLAYER02/> According to Lifeson, no tracks were completely re-recorded.<ref name=GPLAYER02/>\n\n''Vapor Trails'' is the first album since ''[[Caress of Steel]]'' (1975) not to feature a keyboard instrument. This was an important factor for Lifeson, who often worried about their presence on previous Rush albums, but Lee agreed not to use them. Instead, Lifeson spent a greater amount of time devising guitar parts that were \"richer on tonality and harmonic quality\" that were adequate enough for the background tracks.<ref name=CM2002/> Lifeson avoided sound effects on his guitar to achieve a more raw sound.<ref name=CM2002/> At certain points in recording his drum parts, Peart had been influenced by [[The Who|Who]] drummer [[Keith Moon]] and played in his style.<ref name=MD2002/>\n\nAfter taking a break in June 2001,<ref name=CM2002/> Rush began to record their new songs in mid-August.<ref name=VP2001>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20010916vancouverprovince.htm|title=Rush Back in the Studio|first=Sorelle|last=Saldman|work=Vancouver Province|date=September 16, 2001|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref> Initially they decided to write 13 tracks for the album and pick the best 10 or 11 for the final selection, but when the time arrived they agreed to include all of them.<ref name=KLBJ>{{cite interview|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20020410klbj.htm|title=KLBJ Interviews Alex Lifeson [Transcript]|first=Peggy|last=Simmons|airdate=April 10, 2002|station=KLBJ Austin, Texas|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref> They were joined by English producer [[Paul Northfield]], who had worked on several previous Rush albums and assisted in the arrangement to some tracks when the group felt stuck.<ref name=VP2001/><ref name=KLBJ/> The band are credited as co-producers.

Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which he traveled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering {{convert|88,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At some point in his journey, Peart decided to return to the band. In his book ''[[Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road]]'', Peart writes of how he had told his band mates at Selena's funeral, \"consider me retired.\"<ref name=\"Peart-GhostRider\">Peart, Neil.

They discussed what they wanted to achieve and how the album should take shape. Lifeson said it was to get \"a feel for each other's frame of mind. We needed to see if everybody was really up for it.\"<ref name=GPLAYER02>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20020800guitarplayer.htm|title=Back in the Limelight: Alex Lifeson and Rush Reignite After a Five-Year Hiatus|first=Shawn|last=Hammond|date=August 2002|magazine=Guitar Player|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}</ref>. Lee and Lifeson said that they chose the studio based on its \"artist friendly environment, that was very comfortable and accommodating\".<ref name=CM2002/> Among the topics discussed was the album's musical direction which became a source of difficulty as initially, there was little agreement on what it should be. Upon reaching a consensus, Lifeson said the three found common ground \"on every aspect of the recording.\"<ref name=GPLAYER02/>\n\nThe band started working, adopting a three-week-on, one-week-off schedule with no one present apart from a technical assistant.<ref name=JAM2001>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20010112jam.htm|title=Geddy Lee on the Rush Reunion|publisher=Jam! Showbiz|date=12 January 2001|first=Paul|last=Cantin|accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=CM2002/> The group was hopeful there was still chemistry amongst them to make an album. They adopted their usual method of writing with Lee and Lifeson working together on musical ideas in the studio control room while Peart worked elsewhere on the lyrics, this time using a pen, paper and a computer. Peart wrote about their attitude towards the sessions: \"We laid out no parameters, no goals, no limitations, only that we would take a relaxed, civilized approach.\"<ref name=TOURBOOK/> Peart looked through his scrapbook of notes and phrases he'd collected and explored ways of connecting them together to form a complete lyrical idea. Lee and Lifeson developed ideas largely through jam sessions typically kicked off by setting a pattern on a drum machine and playing along, recording every session using [[Logic Pro]].<ref name=TOURBOOK/> This was to avoid making a demo tape of a collection of songs and re-record them at a later point. This way early takes became the basis of the songs which kept the music fresh using as many original takes where possible.<ref name=CM2002/>\n\nAfter several weeks Peart presented the ideas he'd formed, but Lee and Lifeson had not put down any concrete pieces of music. Peart recalled they were not yet \"serious\" and still wanted to play and explore ideas as sifting through what they had put to tape was a tedious process and disrupted their creative flow.<ref name=TOURBOOK/> Peart had completed six sets of lyrics at this point but was not getting feedback from his bandmates as he had before, so he paused on lyrics and focused on his book ''[[Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road]]''.<ref name=TOURBOOK/><ref name=MD2002>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20020900moderndrummer.htm|title=Neil Peart: The Fire Returns|first=William F.|last=Miller|magazine=Modern Drummer|date=September 2002|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}</ref> The three became dissatisfied with what they'd come up with and thought it was too forced, which led to their decision to take some weeks off. They felt refreshed and more focused upon resuming and were able to work out complete songs and not just sections.<ref name=GPLAYER02/> The songs that emerged from these early jams were \"Peaceable Kingdom,\" \"Ceiling Unlimited\" and \"Nocturne,\" and they contain some parts put down from the original takes.<ref name=GPLAYER02/> According to Lifeson, no tracks were completely re-recorded.<ref name=GPLAYER02/>\n\n''Vapor Trails'' is the first album since ''[[Caress of Steel]]'' (1975) not to feature a keyboard instrument. This was an important factor for Lifeson, who often worried about their presence on previous Rush albums, but Lee agreed not to use them.

It was released as a [[double album]] on 18 November 1974 by [[Charisma Records]]. It tells the story of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth from New York City who embarks on a journey of self-discovery, and encounters bizarre incidents and characters along the way. During the writing and recording sessions Gabriel temporarily left the band in order to work with [[William Friedkin]], which, along with his insistence on writing all of the lyrics, put strains on the rest of the band.\n\n''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' was released to a mixed critical reception, though it has since received critical acclaim and has gained a [[cult following]]. It peaked at No. 10 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 41 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Two singles were released in the UK, \"Counting Out Time\" and \"[[The Carpet Crawlers]]\", while the title track was released as a single in the US. Genesis supported the album with their [[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour|1974\u20131975 tour]] across North America and Europe, playing the album in its entirety across 102 dates. The album continued to sell, and reached [[RIAA certification|Gold]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 1990 for shipment of 500,000 copies.\n\n== Background ==\nIn May 1974, the Genesis line-up of frontman and singer [[Peter Gabriel]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], bassist [[Mike Rutherford]], drummer [[Phil Collins]] and guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] finished their 1973\u20131974 tour of Europe and North America to support their fifth studio album, ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' (1973). That album was a critical and commercial success for the group, earning them their highest-charting release in the United Kingdom and the United States. That June they booked three months at [[Headley Grange]], a large former [[poorhouse]] in [[Headley, East Hampshire|Headley]], [[East Hampshire]], in order to write and rehearse new material for their next studio album.{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=120}}<ref name=NMEjune1974>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thegenesisarchive.co.uk/the-charterhouse-boys-interview-by-steve-clarke-nme-1st-june/ |title=The Charterhouse Boys |first=Steve |last=Clarke |magazine=[[New Musical Express]] |date=1 June 1974 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> Upon their arrival the building had been left in a very poor state by the previous band to use it, with excrement on the floor and rat infestations.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=151}} By this time the personal lives of some members had begun to affect the mood in the band, causing complications for their work.

Gabriel recorded his vocals at Island Studios, where the album was mixed over a series of shifts as the band struggled to complete the album in time for its November 1974 release date.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=76}} Collins recalled: \"I'd be mixing and dubbing all night and then Tony and Mike would come in and remix what I'd done because I'd lost all sense of normality by that point\".{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=52}}\n\n=== Story ===\nThe album tells the story of Rael, a half-[[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] adolescent living in New York City, who experiences several bizarre situations and characters.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/pgn8 |title=Classic Pop/Rock Review \u2013 Genesis, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway |first=Daryl |last=Easlea |accessdate=31 December 2008 |publisher=BBC |date=23 April 2007}}</ref> Gabriel was influenced by the band's last American tour to set the story in New York City. He used the location as a tool to make Rael \"more real, more extrovert and violent\",<ref name=sounds1974/> choosing to develop a character that is the least likely person to \"fall into all this pansy claptrap\", and aiming for a story that contrasted between fantasy and character.<ref name=nme1975/> Gabriel explained that as the story progresses Rael finds he is not as \"butch\" as he hoped, and his experiences eventually bring out a more romantic side to his personality. The end of the story is not directly clear; Gabriel deliberately left the conclusion ambiguous. When asked about it, Gabriel does not declare that Rael dies, though he compared the ending to the buildup of suspense and drama in a film in which \"you never see what's so terrifying because they leave it up in the air without ... labelling it\".<ref name=nme1975/> Several of the story's occurrences and settings derived from Gabriel's dreams.<ref name=platts>Platts 2001, p. unknown.</ref> Collins remarked that the entire concept was about [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]].<ref name=history>{{cite AV media |people=[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] |title=Genesis: A History |medium=VHS |publisher=[[PolyGram|PolyGram Video]] |year=1991}}</ref> The individual songs also make satirical allusions to [[mythology]], the [[sexual revolution]], advertising, and [[consumerism]].<ref name=platts/> Gabriel felt the songs alone were not enough to detail all of the action in his story, so he wrote the full plot on the album's sleeve.<ref name=sounds1974/>\n\n==== Plot summary ====\n[[File:Broadway Crowds (5896264776) crop.jpg|thumb|right|The story opens with Rael on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City.]]\nOne morning in New York City, Rael is holding a can of spray paint, hating everyone around him. He witnesses a lamb lying down on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] which has a profound effect on him. (\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\") As he walks along the street, he sees a dark cloud take the shape of a movie screen and slowly move towards him, finally absorbing him (\"Fly on a Windshield\"), seeing an explosion of images of the current day (\"Broadway Melody of 1974\") before he wakes up in a cave and falls asleep once again (\"Cuckoo Cocoon\"). Rael wakes up and finds himself trapped in a cage of [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s which slowly close in towards him. As he tries to escape, he sees his brother John and calls to him, but John walks away and the cage suddenly disappears (\"In the Cage\").\n\nRael now finds himself on the floor of a factory and is given a tour of the area by a woman, where he watches people being processed like packages. He spots old members of his New York City gang, and also John with the number \"9\" stamped on his forehead. Fearing for his life, Rael escapes into a corridor (\"The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging\"){{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=72}} and has an extended flashback of returning from a gang raid in New York City, (\"Back in N.Y.C.\"){{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=75}} a dream where his hairy heart is removed and shaved with a razor, (\"Hairless Heart\") and his first sexual encounter (\"Counting Out Time\").{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=76}} Rael's flashback ends, and he finds himself in a long, red-carpeted corridor of people crawling towards its exit via a spiral staircase (\"The Carpet Crawlers\"). At the top, he enters a chamber with 32 doors, surrounded by people and unable to concentrate (\"The Chamber of 32 Doors\"). He finds a blind woman who leads him out of the chamber and into another cave (\"Lilywhite Lilith\"), where he becomes trapped by falling rocks (\"The Waiting Room\", \"Anyway\"). Rael encounters [[Death (personification)|Death]] (\"Here Comes the Supernatural Anaesthetist\") and escapes the cave.\n\nRael ends up in a pool with three [[Lamia]], beautiful snake-like creatures, and has sex with them, but they die after drinking some of his blood (\"The Lamia\"). He leaves the pool in a boat (\"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\"), and finds himself in a group of Slippermen, distorted, grotesque men who have all had the same experience with the Lamias, and finds that he has become one of them (\"The Arrival\"). Rael finds John among the Slippermen, who reveals that the only way to become human again is to visit Doktor Dyper and be [[castrated]] (\"A Visit to the Doktor\"). Both are castrated and keep their removed penises in containers around their necks. Rael's container is taken by a [[raven]] and he chases after it, leaving John behind (\"The Raven\"). The raven drops the container in a ravine and into a rushing underground river (\"Ravine\").\n\nAs Rael walks alongside it, he sees a window in the bank above his head which reveals his home amidst the streets (\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway\"). Faced with the option of returning home, he sees John in a river below him, struggling to stay afloat. Despite being deserted twice by John, Rael dives in to save him and the gateway to New York vanishes (\"Riding the Scree\"). Rael rescues John and drags his body to the bank of the river and turns him over to look at his face, only to see his own face instead (\"In the Rapids\"). His consciousness then drifts between both bodies, and he sees the surrounding scenery melting away into a haze. Both bodies dissolve, and Rael's spirit becomes one with everything around him (\"''it.''\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloovis.com/music/lamb.html |title=bloovis.com - The Annotated Lamb Lies Down on Broadway |author= |date= |website=www.bloovis.com |accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Songs ===\n[[File:Brian Eno - TopPop 1974 12.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Brian Eno]] contributed effects on the album; these were dubbed \"Enossifications\".]]\nMuch of the music developed through band improvisations and jams, often after setting a single idea, which Banks found particularly enjoyable.

Banks said: \"Instantly the rest of us would conjure up that particular mood.\"{{sfn|Fielder|Sutcliffe|1984}} Banks was particularly fond of the part when the drums and guitar come in, calling it one of the band's best ever moments.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=157}} Hackett chose to play \"Egyptian phrases\", and noted that the group used a similar modulation to that of the end section of ''[[Bolero]]'' by [[Maurice Ravel]].{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=42}} \"Back in N.Y.C.\" sees Genesis adopting a more aggressive sound than in past compositions, and includes Gabriel singing an expletive in the line \"I'm not full of shit\".{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=75}} A personal highlight for Collins is \"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\"{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=92}} and \"The Waiting Room\" which developed as a \"basic good to bad [[Soundscape|soundscaping]]\" jam while it was raining, before they stopped and a rainbow formed outside. Collins said that \"Steve [Hackett] played these dark chords, then Peter [Gabriel] blows into his oboe reeds, then there was a loud clap of thunder and we really thought we were entering another world or something. It was moments like that when we were still very much a unified five-piece\".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=157}}\n\n\"The Carpet Crawlers\" developed at a time when Gabriel had written some lyrics, but no music had been written for them. The band put together a chord sequence<ref>[[#2007InterviewDVD|Banks, Tony.

In a departure from their previous albums that featured more colourful designs, the front cover of ''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' makes use of black and white and no colour. The band's logo, originally designed by [[Paul Whitehead]] and used on ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' (1971) and ''Foxtrot'' (1972), was replaced by a new one in an [[Art Deco]] style by [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]]. The left picture on the front depicts Rael in the area where \"In the Rapids\" and \"Riding the Scree\" are set.{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=52}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe band considered releasing the album as two single albums released six months apart.{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=52}} Gabriel later thought this idea would have been more suitable, for a double album contained too much new material, and the extra time would have given him more time to work on the lyrics.{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=52}} Nevertheless, ''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' was released as a double album on 18 November 1974,<ref name=allmusic/> days before the start of its [[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour|supporting tour]].

Banks hoped the album would end people's comparisons of Genesis to [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], two other popular [[progressive rock]] bands of the time. Gabriel knew the album's concept was ideal for critics \"to get their teeth into\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=94}}\n\nIn giving an interview to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in October 1974, shortly before the album's release, Gabriel played several tracks from ''The Lamb'' to reporter [[Chris Welch]], including \"In the Cage\", \"Hairless Heart\", \"The Carpet Crawlers\", and \"Counting Out Time\". Welch wrote, \"It sounded superb. Beautiful songs, fascinating lyrics, and sensitive, subtle playing, mixed with humour and harmonies. What more could a Genesis fan desire?\" He singled out Collins' playing as \"outstanding\".<ref name=melodymaker1974/> Welch's review for ''Melody Maker'' published a month later included his thoughts on such long concept albums\u2013\"A few golden miraculous notes and some choice pithy words are worth all the clutter and verbiage\"\u2013and he called the album a \"[[white elephant]]\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=94}} For ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[Barbara Charone]] wrote highly of the collection. She summarised ''The Lamb'' as a combination of the \"musical proficiency\" on ''Selling England by the Pound'' (1973) with the \"grandiose illusions\" on ''Foxtrot'' (1972) and \"a culmination of past elements injected with present abilities and future directions\". Charone thought it had more high points than any previous Genesis album, apart from some \"few awkward instrumental moments on side three\". All members received praise for their performances, including Hackett coming across as a more dominant member of the group with his \"frenetic, choppy style\", Collins' backup harmony vocals and Rutherford's \"thick, foreboding bass chords and gentle acoustics\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thegenesisarchive.co.uk/album-review-genesis-the-lamb-sounds-25th-november/ |title=Genesis: lamb like a polished diamond |first=Barbara |last=Charone |date=25 November 1974 |magazine=Sounds |accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> Colin Irwin wrote a negative review of the \"Counting Out Time\" single, with its \"weary, tepid approach\" and a \"woeful, dreary three and a half minutes\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thegenesisarchive.co.uk/review-counting-out-time-single-mm-16th-november/ |title=Genesis: What a dreary time |first=Colin |last=Irwin |date=16 November 1974 |magazine=Melody Maker |accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince its release, the album has been met with critical acclaim.

The tour's stage show involved three backdrop screens that displayed 1,450 slides, designed by Geoffrey Shaw, from eight projectors{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=100}} and a [[laser lighting display]].{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=95}} Banks recalled the slides only came close to working perfectly on four or five occasions.<ref name=history/> The tour was the high point of Gabriel's use of theatrics and costumes. He changed his appearance with a short haircut and styled facial hair<ref name=melodymaker1974/> and dressed as Rael in a leather jacket, T-shirt and jeans. During \"The Lamia\", he surrounded himself with a spinning cone-like structure decorated with images of snakes. In the last verse, the cone would collapse to reveal Gabriel wearing a body suit that glowed from lights placed under the stage. \"The Colony of Slippermen\" featured Gabriel as one of the Slippermen, covered in lumps with inflatable genitalia that emerged onto the stage by crawling out of a penis-shaped tube.<ref name=platts/> Gabriel recalled the difficulty in placing his microphone near his mouth whilst he was in the costume.<ref name=history/> Collins admitted that the tour at times was ostentatious and \"inspiration for Spinal Tap\". For \"''it.''\", an explosion set off twin [[strobe light]]s that reveal Gabriel and a dummy figure dressed identically on each side of the stage, leaving the audience clueless as to which was real. The performance ended with Gabriel vanishing from the stage in a flash of light and a puff of smoke.<ref name=history/> During the final concert of the tour, roadie Geoff Banks acted as the dummy on stage, wearing nothing but a leather jacket.<ref name=C&V/>\n\nIn one concert review, the theatrics for \"The Musical Box\", the show's encore and once the band's stage highlight, was seen as \"crude and elementary\" compared to the \"sublime grandeur\" of ''The Lamb...'' set.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/melody-maker-genesis-reviewed-live-in-chicago-7th-december/ |title=Impressive Genesis hit new heights |first=Al |last=Rudis |magazine=Melody Maker |date=7 December 1974 |page=28 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=93}} Collins later said, \"People would steam straight past Tony, Mike, Steve and I, go straight up to Peter and say, \"You're fantastic, we really enjoyed the show.\" It was becoming a one-man show to the audience.\"<ref name=C&V>Genesis 2007, p. unknown.</ref> The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] called the tour \"a spectacle on par with anything attempted in the world of rock to that point\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/genesis/bio/ |title=Genesis Biography |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Gabriel's departure ===\nDuring their stop in [[Cleveland]] in November 1974, Gabriel told the band he would leave at the conclusion of the tour.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}} The decision was kept a secret from outsiders and media all through the tour, and Gabriel promised the band to stay silent about it for a while after its end in June 1975, to give them some time to prepare for a future without him.

It was released as a [[double album]] on 18 November 1974 by [[Charisma Records]]. It tells the story of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth from New York City who embarks on a journey of self-discovery, and encounters bizarre incidents and characters along the way. During the writing and recording sessions Gabriel temporarily left the band in order to work with [[William Friedkin]], which, along with his insistence on writing all of the lyrics, put strains on the rest of the band.\n\n''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' was released to a mixed critical reception, though it has since received critical acclaim and has gained a [[cult following]]. It peaked at No. 10 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 41 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Two singles were released in the UK, \"Counting Out Time\" and \"[[The Carpet Crawlers]]\", while the title track was released as a single in the US. Genesis supported the album with their [[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour|1974\u20131975 tour]] across North America and Europe, playing the album in its entirety across 102 dates. The album continued to sell, and reached [[RIAA certification|Gold]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 1990 for shipment of 500,000 copies.\n\n== Background ==\nIn May 1974, the Genesis line-up of frontman and singer [[Peter Gabriel]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], bassist [[Mike Rutherford]], drummer [[Phil Collins]] and guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] finished their 1973\u20131974 tour of Europe and North America to support their fifth studio album, ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' (1973). That album was a critical and commercial success for the group, earning them their highest-charting release in the United Kingdom and the United States. That June they booked three months at [[Headley Grange]], a large former [[poorhouse]] in [[Headley, East Hampshire|Headley]], [[East Hampshire]], in order to write and rehearse new material for their next studio album.{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=120}}<ref name=NMEjune1974>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thegenesisarchive.co.uk/the-charterhouse-boys-interview-by-steve-clarke-nme-1st-june/ |title=The Charterhouse Boys |first=Steve |last=Clarke |magazine=[[New Musical Express]] |date=1 June 1974 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> Upon their arrival the building had been left in a very poor state by the previous band to use it, with excrement on the floor and rat infestations.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=151}} By this time the personal lives of some members had begun to affect the mood in the band, causing complications for their work. Hackett explained: \"Everybody had their own agenda. Some of us were married, some of us had children, some of us were getting divorced, and we were still trying to get it together in the country\".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=151}} Banks later deemed this period of time as his least favourite of all his time in Genesis.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=156}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Writing ===\n[[File:Peter Gabriel 2012 Life Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|The album's concept and story was conceived by the group's original lead singer, [[Peter Gabriel]].]]\nBefore discussions were held regarding the album's contents, the band decided to record a [[double album]], for the extended format would give them the opportunity to improvise and put down more of their musical ideas.<ref>[[#2007InterviewDVD|Rutherford, Mike.

He insisted that having devised the concept he should write the lyrics, leaving the majority of the music in the charge of his bandmates.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=42}} This was a departure from the band's usual method of songwriting; lyrical contributions on previous albums had always involved the other members.<ref>[[#2007InterviewDVD|Banks, Tony.

Gabriel recorded his vocals at Island Studios, where the album was mixed over a series of shifts as the band struggled to complete the album in time for its November 1974 release date.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=76}} Collins recalled: \"I'd be mixing and dubbing all night and then Tony and Mike would come in and remix what I'd done because I'd lost all sense of normality by that point\".{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=52}}\n\n=== Story ===\nThe album tells the story of Rael, a half-[[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] adolescent living in New York City, who experiences several bizarre situations and characters.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/pgn8 |title=Classic Pop/Rock Review \u2013 Genesis, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway |first=Daryl |last=Easlea |accessdate=31 December 2008 |publisher=BBC |date=23 April 2007}}</ref> Gabriel was influenced by the band's last American tour to set the story in New York City. He used the location as a tool to make Rael \"more real, more extrovert and violent\",<ref name=sounds1974/> choosing to develop a character that is the least likely person to \"fall into all this pansy claptrap\", and aiming for a story that contrasted between fantasy and character.<ref name=nme1975/> Gabriel explained that as the story progresses Rael finds he is not as \"butch\" as he hoped, and his experiences eventually bring out a more romantic side to his personality. The end of the story is not directly clear; Gabriel deliberately left the conclusion ambiguous. When asked about it, Gabriel does not declare that Rael dies, though he compared the ending to the buildup of suspense and drama in a film in which \"you never see what's so terrifying because they leave it up in the air without ... labelling it\".<ref name=nme1975/> Several of the story's occurrences and settings derived from Gabriel's dreams.<ref name=platts>Platts 2001, p. unknown.</ref> Collins remarked that the entire concept was about [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]].<ref name=history>{{cite AV media |people=[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] |title=Genesis: A History |medium=VHS |publisher=[[PolyGram|PolyGram Video]] |year=1991}}</ref> The individual songs also make satirical allusions to [[mythology]], the [[sexual revolution]], advertising, and [[consumerism]].<ref name=platts/> Gabriel felt the songs alone were not enough to detail all of the action in his story, so he wrote the full plot on the album's sleeve.<ref name=sounds1974/>\n\n==== Plot summary ====\n[[File:Broadway Crowds (5896264776) crop.jpg|thumb|right|The story opens with Rael on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City.]]\nOne morning in New York City, Rael is holding a can of spray paint, hating everyone around him. He witnesses a lamb lying down on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] which has a profound effect on him. (\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\") As he walks along the street, he sees a dark cloud take the shape of a movie screen and slowly move towards him, finally absorbing him (\"Fly on a Windshield\"), seeing an explosion of images of the current day (\"Broadway Melody of 1974\") before he wakes up in a cave and falls asleep once again (\"Cuckoo Cocoon\"). Rael wakes up and finds himself trapped in a cage of [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s which slowly close in towards him. As he tries to escape, he sees his brother John and calls to him, but John walks away and the cage suddenly disappears (\"In the Cage\").\n\nRael now finds himself on the floor of a factory and is given a tour of the area by a woman, where he watches people being processed like packages. He spots old members of his New York City gang, and also John with the number \"9\" stamped on his forehead. Fearing for his life, Rael escapes into a corridor (\"The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging\"){{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=72}} and has an extended flashback of returning from a gang raid in New York City, (\"Back in N.Y.C.\"){{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=75}} a dream where his hairy heart is removed and shaved with a razor, (\"Hairless Heart\") and his first sexual encounter (\"Counting Out Time\").{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=76}} Rael's flashback ends, and he finds himself in a long, red-carpeted corridor of people crawling towards its exit via a spiral staircase (\"The Carpet Crawlers\"). At the top, he enters a chamber with 32 doors, surrounded by people and unable to concentrate (\"The Chamber of 32 Doors\"). He finds a blind woman who leads him out of the chamber and into another cave (\"Lilywhite Lilith\"), where he becomes trapped by falling rocks (\"The Waiting Room\", \"Anyway\"). Rael encounters [[Death (personification)|Death]] (\"Here Comes the Supernatural Anaesthetist\") and escapes the cave.\n\nRael ends up in a pool with three [[Lamia]], beautiful snake-like creatures, and has sex with them, but they die after drinking some of his blood (\"The Lamia\"). He leaves the pool in a boat (\"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\"), and finds himself in a group of Slippermen, distorted, grotesque men who have all had the same experience with the Lamias, and finds that he has become one of them (\"The Arrival\"). Rael finds John among the Slippermen, who reveals that the only way to become human again is to visit Doktor Dyper and be [[castrated]] (\"A Visit to the Doktor\"). Both are castrated and keep their removed penises in containers around their necks. Rael's container is taken by a [[raven]] and he chases after it, leaving John behind (\"The Raven\"). The raven drops the container in a ravine and into a rushing underground river (\"Ravine\").\n\nAs Rael walks alongside it, he sees a window in the bank above his head which reveals his home amidst the streets (\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway\"). Faced with the option of returning home, he sees John in a river below him, struggling to stay afloat. Despite being deserted twice by John, Rael dives in to save him and the gateway to New York vanishes (\"Riding the Scree\"). Rael rescues John and drags his body to the bank of the river and turns him over to look at his face, only to see his own face instead (\"In the Rapids\"). His consciousness then drifts between both bodies, and he sees the surrounding scenery melting away into a haze. Both bodies dissolve, and Rael's spirit becomes one with everything around him (\"''it.''\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloovis.com/music/lamb.html |title=bloovis.com - The Annotated Lamb Lies Down on Broadway |author= |date= |website=www.bloovis.com |accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Songs ===\n[[File:Brian Eno - TopPop 1974 12.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Brian Eno]] contributed effects on the album; these were dubbed \"Enossifications\".]]\nMuch of the music developed through band improvisations and jams, often after setting a single idea, which Banks found particularly enjoyable. Examples of this are what he described as a \"Chinese jam\" which ended up as part of \"The Colony of Slippermen\", one named \"Victory at Sea\" which was worked into \"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\", and another known as \"Evil Jam\" which became \"The Waiting Room\".{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=42}}{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=156}} Though the album is written to a story concept, Gabriel described its format as being split into \"self-contained song units\".<ref name=melodymaker1974/> He thought the album contained some of the group's best material and songs that he was most proud of during his time in Genesis.<ref>[[#2007InterviewDVD|Gabriel, Peter.

Banks said: \"Instantly the rest of us would conjure up that particular mood.\"{{sfn|Fielder|Sutcliffe|1984}} Banks was particularly fond of the part when the drums and guitar come in, calling it one of the band's best ever moments.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=157}} Hackett chose to play \"Egyptian phrases\", and noted that the group used a similar modulation to that of the end section of ''[[Bolero]]'' by [[Maurice Ravel]].{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=42}} \"Back in N.Y.C.\" sees Genesis adopting a more aggressive sound than in past compositions, and includes Gabriel singing an expletive in the line \"I'm not full of shit\".{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=75}} A personal highlight for Collins is \"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\"{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=92}} and \"The Waiting Room\" which developed as a \"basic good to bad [[Soundscape|soundscaping]]\" jam while it was raining, before they stopped and a rainbow formed outside. Collins said that \"Steve [Hackett] played these dark chords, then Peter [Gabriel] blows into his oboe reeds, then there was a loud clap of thunder and we really thought we were entering another world or something. It was moments like that when we were still very much a unified five-piece\".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=157}}\n\n\"The Carpet Crawlers\" developed at a time when Gabriel had written some lyrics, but no music had been written for them. The band put together a chord sequence<ref>[[#2007InterviewDVD|Banks, Tony.

In a departure from their previous albums that featured more colourful designs, the front cover of ''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' makes use of black and white and no colour. The band's logo, originally designed by [[Paul Whitehead]] and used on ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' (1971) and ''Foxtrot'' (1972), was replaced by a new one in an [[Art Deco]] style by [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]]. The left picture on the front depicts Rael in the area where \"In the Rapids\" and \"Riding the Scree\" are set.{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=52}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe band considered releasing the album as two single albums released six months apart.{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=52}} Gabriel later thought this idea would have been more suitable, for a double album contained too much new material, and the extra time would have given him more time to work on the lyrics.{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=52}} Nevertheless, ''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' was released as a double album on 18 November 1974,<ref name=allmusic/> days before the start of its [[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour|supporting tour]].

Banks hoped the album would end people's comparisons of Genesis to [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], two other popular [[progressive rock]] bands of the time. Gabriel knew the album's concept was ideal for critics \"to get their teeth into\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=94}}\n\nIn giving an interview to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in October 1974, shortly before the album's release, Gabriel played several tracks from ''The Lamb'' to reporter [[Chris Welch]], including \"In the Cage\", \"Hairless Heart\", \"The Carpet Crawlers\", and \"Counting Out Time\". Welch wrote, \"It sounded superb. Beautiful songs, fascinating lyrics, and sensitive, subtle playing, mixed with humour and harmonies. What more could a Genesis fan desire?\" He singled out Collins' playing as \"outstanding\".<ref name=melodymaker1974/> Welch's review for ''Melody Maker'' published a month later included his thoughts on such long concept albums\u2013\"A few golden miraculous notes and some choice pithy words are worth all the clutter and verbiage\"\u2013and he called the album a \"[[white elephant]]\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=94}} For ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[Barbara Charone]] wrote highly of the collection. She summarised ''The Lamb'' as a combination of the \"musical proficiency\" on ''Selling England by the Pound'' (1973) with the \"grandiose illusions\" on ''Foxtrot'' (1972) and \"a culmination of past elements injected with present abilities and future directions\". Charone thought it had more high points than any previous Genesis album, apart from some \"few awkward instrumental moments on side three\". All members received praise for their performances, including Hackett coming across as a more dominant member of the group with his \"frenetic, choppy style\", Collins' backup harmony vocals and Rutherford's \"thick, foreboding bass chords and gentle acoustics\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thegenesisarchive.co.uk/album-review-genesis-the-lamb-sounds-25th-november/ |title=Genesis: lamb like a polished diamond |first=Barbara |last=Charone |date=25 November 1974 |magazine=Sounds |accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> Colin Irwin wrote a negative review of the \"Counting Out Time\" single, with its \"weary, tepid approach\" and a \"woeful, dreary three and a half minutes\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thegenesisarchive.co.uk/review-counting-out-time-single-mm-16th-november/ |title=Genesis: What a dreary time |first=Colin |last=Irwin |date=16 November 1974 |magazine=Melody Maker |accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince its release, the album has been met with critical acclaim.

He says that despite Gabriel's \"lengthy [[libretto]]\" on the sleeve \"the story never makes sense\", though its music is \"forceful, imaginative piece of work that showcases the original Genesis lineup at a peak ... it's a considerable, lasting achievement and it's little wonder that Peter Gabriel had to leave ... they had gone as far as they could go together\".<ref name=allmusic/>\n\nA ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' poll to rank readers' favourite progressive rock albums of all time placed ''The Lamb'' fifth in the list.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-your-favorite-prog-rock-albums-of-all-time-20120725/5-genesis-the-lamb-lies-down-on-broadway-0563736 |title=Readers' Poll: Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time |author=Greene, Andy |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> In 2014, readers of ''[[Rhythm (music magazine)|Rhythm]]'' voted it the album with the fourth-greatest drumming in the history of progressive rock.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.teamrock.com/news/2014-10-03/rush-neil-peart-influential-prog-drummer |title=Peart named most influential prog drummer |publisher=TeamRock |date=3 October 2014 |accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> In 2015, ''NME'' included the album in its \"23 Maddest and Most Memorable Concept Albums\" list for \"taking in themes of split personalities, heaven and hell and truth and fantasy\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/photos/23-of-the-maddest-and-most-memorable-concept-albums/382723#/photo/1 |title=23 Of The Maddest And Most Memorable Concept Albums |work=NME |accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref> It was one of two albums by Genesis included in the top ten of the ''Rolling Stone'' list of the 50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time.

''Reissues Interview 2007'' bonus feature at 2:33\u20132:45.]]</ref> Rutherford said that, while ''The Lamb'' is a fan favorite, it was a gruelling album to work on and had a lot of highs, but also a lot of lows. Hackett remarked how his guitar was underutilized in comparison to past albums, but thought the album had a lot of beautiful moments and has grown on him over time. In ''[[Genesis: Together and Apart]]'', Gabriel stated the album was one of his two high points with the band, along with \"[[Supper's Ready]]\", Also in that documentary, Collins said the band created their best music on the album. He also cites it as his favourite Genesis album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0002015/trivia |title=Phil Collins |author= |date= |website=IMDb |accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Reissues ===\n''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'' was first remastered for CD in 1994, and released on [[Virgin Records]] in Europe and [[Atlantic Records]] in North America. The included booklet features the lyrics and story printed on the original LP, though some of the inner sleeve artwork was not reproduced. A remastered edition for [[Super Audio CD]] and DVD with new stereo and [[5.1 surround sound]] mixes by [[Nick Davis (record producer)|Nick Davis]] was released in 2008 as part of the ''[[Genesis 1970\u20131975]]'' box set.\n\n== Tour ==\n{{Main|The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour}}\nGenesis supported the album with a 102-date concert tour across North America and Europe,{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} playing the album in its entirety with one or two older songs as encores.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}} Such a format was not supported by the entire band, considering most of the audience were not yet familiar with the large amount of new material. It was to begin on 29 October 1974 with an 11-date tour of the UK that sold out within four hours of going on sale, but after Hackett crushed a wine glass in his left hand which severed a tendon, and needed time to recover, these dates were rescheduled for 1975. The group lost money, for they were unable to recoup deposits they had paid to the venues.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/nme-26th-october-1974-genesis-tour-is-off/ |title=Genesis tour is called off! |date=26 October 1974 |magazine=New Musical Express |accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=melodymaker1974/> The tour began on 20 November in Chicago,<ref name=\"Peter Gabriel 1988\"/> and ended on 22 May 1975 in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[France]].{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} The last two scheduled concerts on 24 and 27 May in [[Toulouse]] and [[Paris]], respectively, were cancelled due to low ticket sales.<ref name=history/> Gabriel marked the occasion of his final show with the group by playing the \"[[Last Post]]\" on his [[oboe]].{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=83}} Hackett estimated the band's debts at \u00a3220,000 at the tour's end.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=82}}\n\n[[File:Genesis live 1974-11-20.jpg|thumb|right|Rutherford, Gabriel, and Collins performing in 1974 during ''The Lamb...'' tour. Gabriel is wearing the Slipperman costume.]]\nThe tour featured at the time some of the biggest instruments used by the band, including Rutherford's double-neck Rickenbacker and the largest drum kit ever used by Collins. The tour's stage show involved three backdrop screens that displayed 1,450 slides, designed by Geoffrey Shaw, from eight projectors{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=100}} and a [[laser lighting display]].{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=95}} Banks recalled the slides only came close to working perfectly on four or five occasions.<ref name=history/> The tour was the high point of Gabriel's use of theatrics and costumes. He changed his appearance with a short haircut and styled facial hair<ref name=melodymaker1974/> and dressed as Rael in a leather jacket, T-shirt and jeans. During \"The Lamia\", he surrounded himself with a spinning cone-like structure decorated with images of snakes. In the last verse, the cone would collapse to reveal Gabriel wearing a body suit that glowed from lights placed under the stage. \"The Colony of Slippermen\" featured Gabriel as one of the Slippermen, covered in lumps with inflatable genitalia that emerged onto the stage by crawling out of a penis-shaped tube.<ref name=platts/> Gabriel recalled the difficulty in placing his microphone near his mouth whilst he was in the costume.<ref name=history/> Collins admitted that the tour at times was ostentatious and \"inspiration for Spinal Tap\". For \"''it.''\", an explosion set off twin [[strobe light]]s that reveal Gabriel and a dummy figure dressed identically on each side of the stage, leaving the audience clueless as to which was real. The performance ended with Gabriel vanishing from the stage in a flash of light and a puff of smoke.<ref name=history/> During the final concert of the tour, roadie Geoff Banks acted as the dummy on stage, wearing nothing but a leather jacket.<ref name=C&V/>\n\nIn one concert review, the theatrics for \"The Musical Box\", the show's encore and once the band's stage highlight, was seen as \"crude and elementary\" compared to the \"sublime grandeur\" of ''The Lamb...'' set.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/melody-maker-genesis-reviewed-live-in-chicago-7th-december/ |title=Impressive Genesis hit new heights |first=Al |last=Rudis |magazine=Melody Maker |date=7 December 1974 |page=28 |accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=93}} Collins later said, \"People would steam straight past Tony, Mike, Steve and I, go straight up to Peter and say, \"You're fantastic, we really enjoyed the show.\" It was becoming a one-man show to the audience.\"<ref name=C&V>Genesis 2007, p. unknown.</ref> The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] called the tour \"a spectacle on par with anything attempted in the world of rock to that point\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/genesis/bio/ |title=Genesis Biography |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Gabriel's departure ===\nDuring their stop in [[Cleveland]] in November 1974, Gabriel told the band he would leave at the conclusion of the tour.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}} The decision was kept a secret from outsiders and media all through the tour, and Gabriel promised the band to stay silent about it for a while after its end in June 1975, to give them some time to prepare for a future without him. By August, the news had leaked to the media anyway, and Gabriel wrote a personal statement to the English music press to explain his reasons and his view of his career up to this point; the piece, titled \"Out, Angels Out\", was printed in several of the major rock music magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thatericalper.com/2012/02/13/peter-gabriels-letter-to-media-on-why-he-left-genesis/ |title=Peter Gabriel's letter to media on why he left Genesis |last=Eric |date=2012-02-13 |website=That Eric Alper |access-date=2017-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232305/http://www.thatericalper.com/2012/02/13/peter-gabriels-letter-to-media-on-why-he-left-genesis/ |archivedate=26 April 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In his open letter, he explained his disillusion with the music industry and his wish to spend extended time with his family.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=107}} Banks later stated, \"Pete was also getting too big for the group. He was being portrayed as if he was 'the man' and it really wasn't like that. It was a very difficult thing to accommodate. So it was actually a bit of a relief.\"{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}}\n\n=== Recordings ===\nNo complete performance of the album has been officially released, except for the majority of the band's performance from 24 January 1975 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, which was released as part of the ''[[Genesis Archive 1967\u201375]]'' box set.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=81}} Some tracks feature re-recorded vocals from Gabriel and guitar parts from Hackett; the box set contains a remixed studio version of \"''it.''\", also with re-recorded vocals.

With the launching of [[MTV Base|MTV Base Africa]], artists within West Africa were able to grant themselves a large platform. Artists such as [[M.I Abaga|MI Abaga]], [[Naeto C]], and [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] were among the first to take advantage of this, however most of the artists were merely making interpretations of hip hop and R&B. While this allowed them to build local audiences, it blocked them from a wider platform due to the language barriers in-place. [[P-Square]] released their album ''[[Game Over (P-Square album)|Game Over]]'' in 2007, which was unique for its usage of Nigerian rhythms and melodies. Meanwhile, artists such as [[Flavour N'abania]] were able to find success by embracing older genres, such as [[highlife]], and remixing it into something more modern, as seen in his song \"[[Nwa Baby|Nwa Baby (Ashawo Remix)]]\". By 2011, artists within the burgeoning scene were beginning to become stars across the continent. P-Square released \"[[Chop My Money|Chop My Money (Remix)]]\" alongside popular Senegalese-American artist [[Akon]] in 2011.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nHowever it wasn't until \"[[Oliver Twist (D'banj song)|Oliver Twist]]\", released by Nigerian artist [[D'banj]] in the summer of 2011, that afrobeats first saw international success.

With the launching of [[MTV Base|MTV Base Africa]], artists within West Africa were able to grant themselves a large platform. Artists such as [[M.I Abaga|MI Abaga]], [[Naeto C]], and [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] were among the first to take advantage of this, however most of the artists were merely making interpretations of hip hop and R&B. While this allowed them to build local audiences, it blocked them from a wider platform due to the language barriers in-place. [[P-Square]] released their album ''[[Game Over (P-Square album)|Game Over]]'' in 2007, which was unique for its usage of Nigerian rhythms and melodies. Meanwhile, artists such as [[Flavour N'abania]] were able to find success by embracing older genres, such as [[highlife]], and remixing it into something more modern, as seen in his song \"[[Nwa Baby|Nwa Baby (Ashawo Remix)]]\". By 2011, artists within the burgeoning scene were beginning to become stars across the continent. P-Square released \"[[Chop My Money|Chop My Money (Remix)]]\" alongside popular Senegalese-American artist [[Akon]] in 2011.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nHowever it wasn't until \"[[Oliver Twist (D'banj song)|Oliver Twist]]\", released by Nigerian artist [[D'banj]] in the summer of 2011, that afrobeats first saw international success.
