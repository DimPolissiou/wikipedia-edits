of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the highest-ranking official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]]. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].\n\nAs the central figure of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of leadership]] of the People's Republic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217211144/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/dl/download.php?d=%2Fcontent%2Fias%2Farchiv%2Fcds%2Fcds_0905.pdf|title=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|last=|first=|date=May 2009|website=giga-hamburg.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=17 February 2012|accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref> Xi has significantly centralised institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed [[National Security Commission of the Communist Party of China|National Security Commission]], as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet.

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the highest-ranking official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]]. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].\n\nAs the central figure of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of leadership]] of the People's Republic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217211144/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/dl/download.php?d=%2Fcontent%2Fias%2Farchiv%2Fcds%2Fcds_0905.pdf|title=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|last=|first=|date=May 2009|website=giga-hamburg.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=17 February 2012|accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref> Xi has significantly centralised institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed [[National Security Commission of the Communist Party of China|National Security Commission]], as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet.

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

It has since gained popularity among civilian collectors for its historical significance. It has considerable significance in popular culture, especially in works about the Prohibition era and World War II, and is among the best-known firearms in history. The original fully automatic Thompsons are no longer produced, but numerous semi-automatic civilian versions are still being manufactured by Auto-Ordnance. These retain a similar appearance to the original models, but they have various modifications in order to comply with [[National Firearms Act|US firearm laws]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History and service==\n===Development===\n[[File:Thompson-and-his-gun.jpg|thumb|upright|General John T. Thompson holding an M1921]]\n\nGeneral [[John T. Thompson]] developed the Thompson Submachine Gun. He originally envisioned an \"[[Thompson Autorifle|auto rifle]]\" ([[semi-automatic rifle]]) to replace the bolt action service rifles then in use, but he came across a patent issued to [[John Bell Blish]] in 1915 while searching for a way to allow his weapon to operate safely without the complexity of a [[Recoil operation|recoil]] or [[gas-operated reloading]] mechanism. Blish's design was based on the adhesion of inclined metal surfaces under pressure.<ref>{{cite book|first=Julian S. |last=Hatcher|title=Hatcher's Notebook|publisher= Military Service Publishing Co.|year= 1947|page= 44}}</ref> Thompson gained financial backing from [[Thomas Fortune Ryan|Thomas F. Ryan]] and started the [[Auto-Ordnance Company]] in 1916 for the purpose of developing his \"auto rifle\". It was primarily developed in [[Cleveland, Ohio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfatoys.com/tsmg/|title=The Unofficial Tommy Gun Page|website=www.nfatoys.com}}</ref> and the principal designers were Theodore H. Eickhoff, Oscar V. Payne, and George E. Goll. By late 1917, the limits of the [[Blish lock|Blish Principle]] were discovered; rather than working as a locked breech, it functioned as a friction-delayed [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]] action. It was found that the only cartridge currently in service that was suitable for use with the lock was the [[.45 ACP]] round. Thompson then envisioned a \"one-man, hand-held machine gun\" in .45 ACP as a \"trench broom\" for use in the ongoing [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. Payne designed the gun and its stick and drum magazines. The project was then titled \"Annihilator I\", and most of the design issues had been resolved by 1918; however, the war ended two days before prototypes could be shipped to Europe.<ref name=\"Frank Iannamico 1928\">{{harvnb|Iannamico|2000|page={{page needed|date=December 2011}}}}</ref>\n\nAt an Auto-Ordnance board meeting in 1919 to discuss the marketing of the \"Annihilator\", with the war now over, the weapon was officially renamed the \"Thompson Submachine Gun\". While other weapons had been developed shortly prior with similar objectives in mind, the Thompson was the first weapon to be labeled and marketed as a \"submachine gun\".<ref name=\"James\"/> Thompson intended the weapon as an automatic \"trench-broom\" to sweep enemy troops from the trenches, filling a role for which the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR) had been proven ill-suited.{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1977|p=272}} This concept had already been developed by [[Imperial Germany|German]] troops using their own [[Theodor Bergmann|Bergmann]] [[MP 18]], the world's first submachine gun, in concert with ''[[infiltration tactics|Sturmtruppen]]'' tactics.<ref>Gudmundsson, Bruce.

Praeger Press. {{page needed|date=December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Early use===\nThe Thompson first entered production as the M1921. It was available to civilians, although poor sales resulted from the expense of the weapon; the Thompson gun with one Type XX 20 shot \"stick\" magazine was priced at $200 in 1921 ({{Inflation|US|200|1921|fmt=eq}}). M1921 Thompsons were sold in small quantities to the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]]<ref>[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/inspectors/a6p1.html Smithsonian National Postal Museum], Postal Inspectors: The Silent Service, Unexpected Duties. \"The Postal Inspection Service became the first law enforcement agency to purchase the Thompson submachine gun ...\"</ref> to protect the mail from a spate of robberies<ref name=\"Fitz2487\">{{harvnb|Fitzsimons|1977|p=2487}}</ref> and to the United States Marine Corps. Federal sales were followed by sales to several police departments in the US and minor international sales to various armies and constabulary forces, chiefly in Central and South America.<ref name=\"Fitz2487\"/> The Marines used their Thompsons in the [[Banana Wars]] and in China. It was popular as a point-defense weapon for countering ambush by Nicaraguan guerrillas, and led to the organization of four-man [[fire team]]s with as much firepower as a nine-man rifle squad. The major complaints against the Thompson were its weight, inaccuracy at ranges over {{convert|50|yd|m}}, and the lack of penetrating power of the .45 ACP pistol cartridge.<ref name=\"rt66.com\">{{cite web |author=Bert Kortegaard |url=http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/thompson.htm |title=M1A1 Thompson Submachine Gun |publisher=Rt66.com |date=2000-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217064700/http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/smallarms/thompson.htm |archivedate=2011-12-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of the first batches of Thompsons were bought in America by agents of the [[Irish Republic]], notably [[Harry Boland]].

It had a Cutts [[Muzzle brake|compensator]], cooling fins on the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], employed a delayed blowback action and its charging handle was on the top of the receiver.\n* The M1 and M1A1 had a barrel without cooling fins, a simplified rear sight, provisions only for box magazines, employed a straight blowback action and the charging handle was on the side of the receiver.\nOver 1.5 million military Thompson submachine guns were produced during World War II.<ref name=\"Iannamico 1999\"/>\n\n====Magazine developments====\n[[File:Thompson Magazine.JPG|thumb|left|Drum and box magazines]]\n\nMilitary users of the M1928A1 had complaints about the \"L\" fifty-round drum magazine; the British Army officially criticised \"their excessive weight, the rattling sound they made\" and shipped thousands back to the U.S. in exchange for box magazines. The Thompson had to be cocked, bolt retracted ready to fire, to attach the drum. It attached and detached by sliding sideways, which made magazine changes slow and also created difficulty in clearing a cartridge malfunction (\"jam\"). Reloading an empty drum with cartridges was an involved process.\n\nIn contrast, the \"XX\" twenty-round box magazine was light and compact, it tended not to rattle, and could be inserted with the bolt safely closed. It was quickly attached and detached and was removed downward, making clearing jams easier. The box tripped the bolt open lock when empty, facilitating magazine changes. An empty box was easily reloaded with loose rounds. However, users complained it was limited in capacity. In the field, some soldiers taped two \"XX\" magazines together in what would be known as [[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|\"jungle style\"]] to speed magazine changes.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2011/2/15/thompson-submachine-gun-the-tommy-gun-goes-to-war/|title=Thompson Submachine Gun: The Tommy Gun Goes to War|accessdate=2016-02-04|magazine=American Rifleman|author=Bruce Canfield}}</ref>\n\nTwo alternatives to the \"L\" drum and \"XX\" box magazines were tested December 6, 1941, at Fort Knox: an extended thirty-round box magazine and a forty-round magazine made by welding two 20-round magazines face to face, jungle style. Testers considered both superior to either the \"XX\" box or \"L\" drum.

New Zealand commando forces initially used Thompsons but switched them for the more reliable, lighter, and more accurate Owen during the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Guadalcanal]] campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2IP-Comm-t1-body1-d13.html|title=Chapter XII \u2014 Guadalcanal \u2013 NZETC|website=nzetc.victoria.ac.nz}}</ref> The U.S. Marines also used the Thompson as a limited-issue weapon, especially during their later island assaults. The Thompson was soon found to have limited effect in heavy jungle cover, where the low-[[velocity]] .45 bullet would not penetrate most small-diameter trees or protective armor vests. {{anchor|Remington-Thompson}}(In 1923, the Army had rejected the [[.45 Remington\u2013Thompson]], which had twice the energy of the .45 ACP).{{sfn|Bearse|1994|p=213}} In the U.S. Army, many Pacific War jungle patrols were originally equipped with Thompsons in the early phases of the [[New Guinea]] and [[Guadalcanal]] campaigns, but soon began employing the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] in its place as a point defense weapon.{{sfn|George|1981|p=400}}\n\nThe Army introduced the U.S. [[M3 submachine gun|M3 and M3A1]] submachine guns in 1943 with plans to produce the latter in numbers sufficient to cancel future orders for the Thompson, while gradually withdrawing it from the first-line service. However, due to unforeseen production delays and requests for modifications, the M3/M3A1 never replaced the Thompson, and purchases continued until February 1944. At the end of World War II, the Thompson, with a total wartime production of over 1.5 million, outnumbered the M3/M3A1 submachine guns in service by nearly three to one.<ref name=\"Iannamico 1999\">{{cite book|last=Iannamico|first=Frank|title=The U.S. M3-M3A1 Submachine Gun|location=Harmony, Maine|publisher= Moose Lake Publishing|isbn=978-0-9701954-4-9|year=1999| pp= 14, 55}}</ref>\n\n===After World War II===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Mandelbaum Gate Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Two Israeli policemen, armed with Thompsons meet a Jordanian legionnaire near the [[Mandelbaum Gate]] {{circa|1950}}]]\n\nThompson submachine guns were used by both sides during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]].{{sfn|Yenne|2009|p=263}} Following the war, Thompsons were issued to members of Israel's elite [[Unit 101]], upon the formation of that unit in 1953.<ref name=\"Eilam\">{{cite book|last= Uzi|first= Eilam|title= Eilam's Arc: How Israel Became a Military Technology Powerhouse|publisher= Sussex Academic Press|year= 2011|page=7}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Greek Civil War]], the Thompson [[submachine gun]] was used by both sides. The [[Hellenic Armed Forces]], gendarmerie and police units were equipped with Thompson submachine guns supplied by the British and later in the war by the United States. The opposing Communist fighters of the [[Democratic Army of Greece]] were also using Thompson submachine guns, either captured from government forces or inherited from [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]]. ELAS was the strongest of the resistance forces during the period of [[Greek Resistance]] against the Germans and Italians and were supplied with arms from both the British and the United States. After the demobilization of ELAS, an unspecified number of arms were not surrendered to the government but kept hidden, and were later used by the Democratic Army of Greece.<ref name=\"Sazanidis\">{{harvnb|Sazanidis|1995|pp=293\u2013295}}</ref>\n\nThe Thompson also found service with the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|KNIL]] during their [[Indonesian National Revolution|attempt]] to retake their former colony of Indonesia. Captured examples were later used by Indonesian forces against Dutch forces.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Militair bij de status-quo-lijn bij Gombong waar onderhandelingen plaatsvinden TMnr 10029233.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|KNIL]] soldier armed with an M1928A1 submachine gun; {{circa|1948}}]]\nBy the time of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, the Thompson had seen much use by the U.S. and South Korean military, even though Thompson had been replaced as standard-issue by the M3/M3A1. With huge numbers of guns available in army ordnance arsenals, the Thompson remained classed as Limited Standard or Substitute Standard long after the standardization of the M3/M3A1. Many Thompsons were distributed to the US-backed [[Republic of China|Nationalist Chinese]] armed forces as military aid before the fall of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government to [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[communist]] forces at the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 (Thompsons had already been widely used throughout China since the 1920s, at a time when several Chinese warlords and their military factions [[Warlord Era|running various parts of the fragmented country]] made purchases of the weapon and then subsequently produced many local copies). During the Korean War, US troops were surprised to encounter [[People's Volunteer Army|communist Chinese troops]] armed with Thompsons (amongst other captured US-made Nationalist Chinese and American firearms), especially during unexpected night-time assaults which became a prominent Chinese combat tactic in the conflict. The gun's ability to deliver large quantities of short-range automatic assault fire proved very useful in both defense and assault during the early part of the war when it was constantly mobile and shifting back and forth. Many Chinese Thompsons were captured and placed into service with American soldiers and marines for the remaining period of the war.\n\nThe [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] received 34,000 M1A1 Thompsons during the 1950s as part of a ''US Military Aid to Yugoslavia Agreement''. These guns were used during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Yugoslav Army\">{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia and After: A Study in Fragmentation, Despair and Rebirth|first1=David A. |last1=Dyker |first2= Ivan |last2= Vejvoda|edition=1st|date= 9 December 1996|location= London|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 9781317891352 |page=120|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=7VmPBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT169#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cuban Revolution]], the Thompson submachine gun was used by both [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]'s army and [[Fidel Castro]]'s guerrillas.

It was later replaced by the [[M16 rifle|M16]]. Not only did some U.S. soldiers have use of them in Vietnam, but they encountered them as well. The [[Viet Cong]] liked the weapon and used both captured models as well as manufacturing their own copies in small jungle workshops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WestPointMilitaryMuseum/SubmachineGuns/pages/12VietCongHomemadeThompsonSubmachineGun.htm|title=12 Viet Cong Homemade Thompson Submachine Gun|website=www.williammaloney.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian government destroyed most of their Thompson machine carbines in the 1960s. They shipped their remaining stocks to arm the forces of [[Lon Nol]]'s [[Khmer Republic]] in 1975. They were then captured and used by the [[Khmer Rouge]].\n\nIn the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]], known as [[the Troubles]] (1969\u20131998), the Thompson was again used by the Irish Republican paramilitaries. According to historian [[Peter Hart (historian)|Peter Hart]], \"The Thompson remained a key part of both the [[Official IRA]] and [[Provisional IRA]] arsenals until well into the 1970s when it was superseded by the [[Armalite AR-18|Armalite]] and the [[AK-47]].\"{{sfn|Hart|2003|p=191}}\n\nThe Thompson was also used by U.S. and overseas law enforcement and police forces, most prominently by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. The FBI used Thompsons until they were declared obsolete and ordered destroyed in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Vanderpool|first=Bill|title=Bring Enough Gun|magazine=[[American Rifleman]]|date= October 2013 |pages=80\u201385&115\u2013116}}</ref>\n\n==Collector interest==\nBecause of their quality and craftsmanship, as well as their gangster-era and WWII connections, Thompsons are sought as collector's items. There were fewer than 40 pre-production prototypes. The Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut was contracted by the Auto-Ordnance Corporation to manufacture the initial mass production of 15,000 Thompson Submachine Guns in 1920. An original Colt Model 1921 A or AC, Model 1927 A or AC, Model 1928 Navy A or AC, properly registered in working condition with original components can easily fetch from [[United States dollar|US$]]25,000 to $45,000+ depending on condition and accessories. For WWII, approximately 1,700,000 Thompson Submachine Guns were produced by Auto-Ordnance and [[Savage Arms]], with 1,387,134 being the simplified World War II M1 and M1A1 variants (without the Blish lock and oiling system{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1977|p=2488}}).\n\nA Model 1921A believed to have been owned by [[Bonnie and Clyde]], but without historical documentation to substantiate this provenance, sold at auction on January 21, 2012, in Kansas City for $130,000.<ref>Rice, Glenn E. \"$210K for Bonnie & Clyde Tommy Gun, shotgun\" [http://www.kansascity.com/2012/01/21/3383602/bonnie-and-clyde-gun-goes-for.html <u>The Kansas City Star</u>] 21 Jan. 2012</ref>\n\n==Features==\n===Operating characteristics===\n[[File:Thompson 21 field stripped.jpg|thumb|left|Thompson 1921, field stripped]]\n\nEarly versions of the Thompson, the Model 1919, had a fairly high cyclic rate of fire, as high as 1,200&nbsp;rounds per minute (rpm), with most Model 1921s at 800&nbsp;rpm. In 1927, the U.S. Navy ordered 500 Thompsons but requested a lower rate of fire. Thompson requested  Payne develop a method of reducing the cyclic rate of fire. Payne replaced the actuator with a heavier one and the recoil spring with a stiffer one; the changes reduced the rate of fire from 800 to the 600&nbsp;rpm of the U.S. Navy Model 1928. Later M1 and M1A1 Thompsons averaged also 600&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy F. 1948 p. 299\">{{harvnb|Dunlap|1948|p=299}}</ref> This rate of fire, combined with a rather heavy trigger pull and a stock with an excessive drop, increases the tendency for the barrel to climb off target in automatic fire.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy F. 1948 p. 299\"/><ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 395\">{{harvnb|George|1981|p=395}}</ref> Compared to more modern submachine guns, the .45 Thompson is quite heavy, weighing roughly the same as the contemporary [[M1 Garand]] semi-automatic rifle, and requires a lot of cleaning. This was one of the major complaints about the weapon by [[U.S. Army]] personnel to whom it was issued.<ref name=\"rt66.com\"/>\n\n[[File:Thompson1928a1.jpg|thumb|Thompson M1928A1, field stripped]]\nAlthough the drum magazine provided significant firepower, in military service it was found to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 395\"/> The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility was not included in the design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.<ref name=\"rt66.com\"/>\n\nThe selective-fire (semi- or fully automatic) Thompson fires from the \"open bolt\" position, in which the bolt is held fully to rearward by the sear when cocked. When the trigger is depressed, the bolt is released, traveling forward to chamber and simultaneously fire the first and subsequent rounds until either the trigger is released or the ammunition is exhausted. This eliminates the risk of \"[[Cooking off|cook-off]]\", which can sometimes occur in closed-bolt automatic weapons.\n\n===Disassembly===\nThe Thompson submachine gun varies in field strip procedure, depending on the variant. World War II-era M1 variants and RPB models field strip more easily than the M1921.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe 1928 variant can be disassembled easily by first detaching the stock, then sliding off the lower receiver and then simply removing the internal parts, cleaning them, and then putting it back together. When opened up, the Thompson features a small number of parts that need to be removed including the spring, bolt, Blish Lock, and actuator bolt.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 98.jpg|thumb|Thompson M1921 submachine gun with Argentine Halcon compensator]]\n\n===Prototypes===\n====Persuader and Annihilator====\nThere were two main experimental models of the Thompson. The ''Persuader'' was a [[Belt (firearm)|belt-fed]] version developed in 1917/18. It was partially built, but never completely finished. The ''Annihilator'', serial no. Ver 10 prototypes was similar in appearance to the later models, but without rear sight and butt stock mounts. The Annihilator prototypes first were fed from a 20-round box magazine, but later, the 50- and 100-round [[drum magazine]] models were developed.\n\n====Model 1919====\nStarting with the Serial no. 11, the Model 1919 takes the final appearance of the later Thompsons with the rear sights and the butt stock. The Model 1919 was limited to about 40 units; the first built did not use the drums, as it was too difficult to fire. Many variations have been noted within this model. The weapons had very high cyclic rates up to 1,500&nbsp;rpm.{{sfn|Bearse|1994|p=210}} This was the weapon Brigadier General Thompson demonstrated at [[Camp Perry]] in 1920. A number of Model 1919s were made without butt stocks, rear- and front sights, but the final version closely resembled the later Model  1921.  This model was designed to \"sweep\" trenches with bullets. The [[New York City Police Department]] was the largest purchaser of the M1919. Some experimental calibers aside the [[.45 ACP]] (11.4x23mm) were the [[.22LR]], [[.32 ACP]], [[.38 ACP]], and [[9mm Luger|9mmP]].<ref name=\"Fitz2487\"/>\n\n====.351 WSL variant====\nOnly one prototype was made in [[.351 WSL]] using a standard 20\" barrel and an ROF of 1000rpm.\n\n====Thompson .30 Carbine====\nThe layout and ergonomics of the Thompson submachine gun were also considered for the role of a Light Rifle before the adoption of the [[M1 Carbine]]. It was based on the M1921/27 variants. However, it was turned down without testing due to logistic problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/10/20/thompson-tommy-gun-smg-30-carbine-version/|title=Thompson \"Tommy Gun\" SMG... .30 Carbine Version -|date=20 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====.30-06 variant====\nA .30\u201306 variant was intended as a rival to the M1918 BAR. It had an extended receiver with a recoil buffer and fed from 20 round magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1397698A/en|title=Gun|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\n====Model 1921====\n[[File:Thompson Colt Address.jpg|thumb|Colt address on Thompson 1921 SMG]]\n[[File:Thompsonad1sm.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"Anti-Bandit Gun\": 1920s advertisement of the Thompson M1921 for United States [[Police|law enforcement]] forces]]\n[[File:Thompson 21 and Rifle.JPG|thumb|[[Thompson Autorifle]] (top, upright) and SMG Model (bottom, inverted) of 1921]]\n\nThe Model 1921 (M1921) was the first major production model. Fifteen thousand were produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance. In its original design, it was finished more like a sporting weapon, with an adjustable rear sight, a blued, finned barrel and vertical [[foregrip]] (or pistol grip) and the Blish lock. The M1921 was quite expensive to manufacture, with the original retail price around $200, because of its high-quality wood furniture and finely [[machined]] parts. The M1921 was famous throughout its career with police and criminals and in motion pictures. This model gained fame from its use by criminals during Prohibition, and was nicknamed \"tommy gun\" by the media.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n====Model 1923====\nThe Model 1923 was a heavy submachine gun introduced to potentially expand the Auto-Ordnance product line and was demonstrated for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thompsonsmg.com/PHOTOS%20continued.htm |title=PHOTOS continued |publisher=Thompsonsmg.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> It fired the more powerful [[.45 Remington\u2013Thompson]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] which fired a heavier {{convert|250|gr|oz g|abbr=on|lk=on}} bullet at muzzle velocities of about {{convert|1,450|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and energy about {{convert|1170|ftlb|J|abbr=on|lk=on}}, with greater range than the .45 ACP. It introduced a horizontal [[Forearm (firearm component)|forearm]], improved inline stock for accuracy, {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} barrel, [[bipod]], and [[bayonet]] lug. The M1923 was intended to rival the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR), with which the Army was already satisfied. The Army did not give the Model 1923 much consideration, so it was not adopted.\n\n====Model 1921AC (1926)====\nWhile not a new model in the usual sense of incorporating major changes, in 1926 the Cutts Compensator (a [[muzzle brake]]) was offered as an option for the M1921; Thompsons with the compensator were cataloged as No. 21AC at the original price of $200.00, with the plain M1921 designated No. 21A at a reduced price of $175.00.<ref name=\"Frank Iannamico 1928\"/> The Model 1921 was thereafter referred to as Model 1921A or Model 1921AC, though some collectors still refer to it as the Model 1921.\n\n====Model 1928====\nThe Model 1928 was the first type widely used by military forces, with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as major buyers through the 1930s. The original Model 1928s were Model 1921s with weight added to the actuator, which slowed down the [[cyclic rate]] of fire, a United States Navy requirement. On these guns, the model number \"1921\" on the receiver was updated by stamping an \"8\" over the last \"1\". The Navy Model 1928 has several names among collectors: the \"Colt Overstamp\", \"1921 Overstamp\", \"28 Navy\", or just \"28N\".\n\nThe 1928 Thompson would be the last small arm adopted by the U.S. Army that used a year designation in the official nomenclature. With the start of World War II, major contracts from several countries saved the manufacturer from [[bankruptcy]]. A notable variant of the Model 1928 with an aluminum receiver and tenite grip, buttstock, and forend, was made by Savage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.machinegunbooks.com/eleven.html |title=Thompson Gallery |publisher=www.MachineGunBooks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref>\n\n====M1928A1====\n[[File:Halftrack-fort-knox-4.jpg|thumb|M1928A1 at [[Fort Knox, Kentucky|Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], June 1942]]\n\nThe M1928A1 variant entered mass production before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], as on-hand stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal forend, in place of the distinctive vertical foregrip (\"[[pistol grip]]\"), and a provision for a military [[sling (firearms)|sling]]. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons during the early years of World War II. Though it could use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service showed the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular sight guard wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.\n\nIn addition, the Soviet Union received M1928A1s, included as standard equipment with the [[M3 Stuart|M3 light]] [[tank]]s obtained through Lend-Lease. The weapons were never issued to the Red Army because of a lack of .45 ACP ammunition on the Eastern Front; they were simply put in storage, although a picture exists of what appears to be Thompsons being used by Russian M3 Stuart crews in the Caucasus. As of September 2006, limited numbers of these weapons have been re-imported from Russia to the United States as disassembled \"spare parts kits\", comprising the entire weapon less the receiver (as required by Federal law).\n\nAn M1928A1 which also came with an unusual inline stock, modified with elevated sights to increase accuracy also existed. Some Thompsons were built with a folding stock, similar to the [[M1A1 Carbine]] for Allied tank crews, drivers and paratroopers and submarine raiders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/experimental-thompson-stock/|title=Experimental Thompson Stock|work=Forgotten Weapons|date=2012-12-07}}</ref>\n\n===Service variants===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\n\n====Thompson Machine Carbine (TMC)====\nIn 1940 Commonwealth troops in Egypt and North Africa were issued commercial model Lend-Lease Colt- and Savage-manufactured M1928s. Section leaders carried them instead of pistols or rifles. Many of the Colt models had French-language manuals packed with them as they had been abruptly diverted to England after the fall of France. They soon discovered that the weapon was prone to jamming due to sand. To fix this, the armorers removed the Blish Lock and replaced it with a hex bolt to keep the cocking handle and bolt together. The 20-round Type XX magazines had their peep-holes welded shut to keep sand out and the 50-round Type L drums were discontinued. Ammunition was scarce as it was either in small lots of Lend-Lease commercial ammo or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the [[9mm Parabellum|9mm]] [[Sten gun]] and [[Lanchester SMG]].\n\nThe Japanese captured enough Thompson M1928 SMGs and ammunition when they captured Hong Kong and Malaysia that it became a limited standard weapon. It surpassed any similar weapons currently in their service. Ammunition was usually in US 42-round Lend-Lease commercial cartons or Australian 28-round military cartons captured from the Commonwealth forces that was sampled, tested, and resealed with Japanese arsenal stickers.\n\nModels used in the Pacific by Australian troops had their sling swivels remounted on the left side to allow it to be fired more easily while prone. A metal sling mount was fitted to the left side of the wooden buttstock. Ammunition was manufactured in Australia or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the [[Owen Gun|Owen Machine Carbine]].\n\n====M1====\n[[File:Thompson submachine gun Firecontrols.jpg|thumb|Fire Controls M1928a1Thompson Front lever is selector switch set for full auto]]\n\nResponding to a request for further simplification, the M1 was standardized in April 1942 as the '''United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M1'''. Rate of fire was reduced to approximately 600\u2013700&nbsp;rpm.\n\nFirst issued in 1943, the M1 uses a simple [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]] operation, with the charging handle moved to the side. The flip-up adjustable Lyman rear sight was replaced with a fixed L sight. Late M1s had triangular guard wings added to the rear L sight, which were standardized on the M1A1. The slots adjoining the magazine well allowing the use of a drum magazine were removed. A new magazine catch with the provision for retaining drum magazines removed, was produced, but most M1s and later M1A1s retained the original. The less expensive and more-easily manufactured \"stick\" magazines were used exclusively in the M1, with a new 30-round version joining the familiar 20-round type. The Cutts [[Muzzle brake|compensator]], barrel cooling fins, and Blish lock were omitted while the [[Stock (firearms)|buttstock]] was permanently affixed. Late production M1 stocks were fitted with reinforcing bolts and washers to prevent splitting of the stock where it attached to the receiver. The British had used improvised bolts or wood screws to reinforce M1928 stocks. The M1 reinforcing bolt and washer were carried over to the M1A1 and retrofitted to many of the M1928A1s in U.S. and British service. Late M1s also had simplified fire control switches, also carried over to the M1A1. Certain M1s had issues with high rate of fire climbing up to ~800 RPM. The exact cause remains unknown, but was resolved with the transition to the M1A1.<ref>[https://smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2163 M1 Vs M1A1 Thompson Submachine Gun Cyclic rate]</ref>\n\n====M1A1==== <!-- [[M1A1]] links here -->\n[[File:M1A1.gif|thumb|left|Both sides of the Thompson M1A1 shown with 30-round magazine]]\n\nThe M1A1, standardized in October 1942 as the '''United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M1A1''', could be produced in half the time of the M1928A1, and at a much lower cost. The main difference between the M1 and M1A1 was the bolt. The M1 bolt had a floating firing pin and hammer, the bolt of the M1A1 had the firing pin machined to the face of the bolt, eliminating unnecessary parts. The reinforced stock and protective sight wings were standard. The 30-round magazine became more common. In 1939, Thompsons cost the government $209 apiece. By the spring of 1942, cost-reduction design changes had brought this down to $70. In February 1944, the M1A1 reached a low price of $45 each, including accessories and spare parts, although the difference in price between the M1 and M1A1 was only $0.06. By the end of the war, the M1A1 was replaced with the even lower-cost [[M3 submachine gun|M3]] (commonly called the \"Grease Gun\").\n\n===Semi-automatic===\n====Model 1927====\nThe Model 1927 was the open bolt semi-automatic-only version of the M1921. It was made by modifying an existing Model 1921, including replacing certain parts. The \"Thompson Submachine Gun\" inscription was machined over to replace it with \"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine\", and the \"Model 1921\" inscription was also machined over to replace it with \"Model 1927.\" Although the Model 1927 was semi-automatic only, it was easily converted to fully automatic by installing a full-auto Model 1921 fire control group (internal parts). Most Model 1927s owned by police have been converted back to full-auto.{{sfn|Iannamico|2000|p=21}} The original Model 1927 is classified as a machine gun under the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934 (a) by being \"readily convertible\" by swapping parts and (b) by a [[Open bolt#Legality|1982 BATF ruling]] making all open bolt semi-automatic firearms manufactured after the date of this ruling classified as machine guns.\n\n====Model 1927A1====\nThe Model 1927A1 is a semi-automatic only replica version of the Thompson, originally produced by Auto-Ordnance of [[West Hurley, New York|West Hurley]], New York for the civilian collector's market from 1974 to 1999. It has been produced since 1999 by Kahr Arms of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]]. It is officially known as the \"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Model of 1927A1.\" The internal design is completely different to operate from the closed bolt and the carbine has barrel length of {{convert|16.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} (versus open bolt operation and barrel length of {{convert|10.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} for the full automatic versions). Under federal regulations, these changes make the Model 1927A1 legally a rifle and remove it from the federal registry requirements of the [[National Firearms Act]]. These modern versions should not be confused with the original semi-automatic M1927, which was a slightly modified M1921 produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance.\n\nThe Model 1927A1 is the semi-automatic replica of the Thompson Models of 1921 and 1927. The \"Thompson Commando\" is a semi-automatic replica of the M1928A1. The Auto-Ordnance replica of the Thompson M1 and M1A1 is known as the TM1, and may be found marked \"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Caliber .45M1\".\n\n====Model 1927A3====\nThe Model 1927A3 is a semi-automatic, .22 caliber version of the Thompson produced by Auto-Ordnance in West Hurley.\n\n====Model 1927A5====\nThe Model 1927A5 is a semi-automatic, .45 ACP pistol version of the Thompson originally produced by Auto-Ordnance in West Hurley from the 1970s until the early 1990s or late '80s. It featured an aluminum receiver to reduce weight. It has since been replaced with the Kahr Arms TA5 Pistol, which features a 10.5\" barrel and steel receiver, unlike the 1927A5's 13\" barrel and aluminum receiver.\n\nAs per the NFA (National Firearms Act of 1934), the \"1927A5 .45 ACP Pistol\" is simply classified as a \"Firearm\" (Any type of firearm with an overall length of 26\" or greater, that does not have a buttstock) as it neither fits the definition of a Pistol or Rifle under federal law. This categorization also legally allows it to have 1921 or 1928 style foregrip equipped, unlike other \"pistol style\" Thompson variants, without an AOW (Any Other Weapon) Tax Stamp.\n[[File:BATFE Firearm Classification Letter.jpg|left|thumb|Auto-Ordnance 1927A5 DOJ BATFE Firearm Classification Letter]]\n\n====1928A1 LTD====\nThe 1928A1 LTD is a civilian semi-automatic-only conversion by Luxembourg Defense Technology (LuxDefTec) in Luxembourg. They are made from original 1928A1 guns of various appearance (with or without Cutt's compensator, ribbed or smooth barrels, adjustable or fixed sights), that where imported [[Lend-Lease]] guns from Russia.\n\n===Export variants===\n====BSA Thompsons====\nIn an attempt to expand interest and sales overseas, Auto-Ordnance entered into a partnership with and licensed the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited]] (BSA) in England to produce a European model. These were produced in small quantities and have a different appearance than the classic style. The '''BSA 1926''' was manufactured in 9mmP and [[7.63\u00d725mm Mauser|7.63mm Mauser]] and were tested by various governments, including France, in the mid-1920s. It was never adopted by any military force, and only a small number were produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotavapen.se/gota/artiklar/kpist/stengun.htm |title=Submachine guns of UK \u2013 BSA Thompson 1926 \u2013 Thompson 1928A1 \u2013 Lanchester \u2013 Sten and Sterling |publisher=Gotavapen.se |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref>\n\n===RPB Thompsons===\n====Special purpose variant====\nA special purpose machine pistol variant of the Thompson is manufactured by RPB Industries of Atlanta.<ref>[http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8272/3053620dzpobzua.jpg ]{{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Suppressed variant====\nA version with a threaded barrel for suppressors, side folding stock, and modified sights.\n\n==Civilian ownership==\n===Canada===\nAll variants and modified versions of Thompson submachine guns (even semiautomatic-only versions) are prohibited by name in Canada, as part of Prohibited Weapons Order No. 13 in 1995. Consequently, they cannot be legally imported or owned except under very limited circumstances. For example, to own one the person must be \"[[grandfather clause|grandfathered]]\" and have owned one before the bill was passed against it. The submachine gun is not grandfathered like in US, only the owner. The submachine gun can only be sold to other grandfathered individuals; this keeps prices extremely low as the number of permitted licensed individuals is very small and dwindling with time. Eventually, all prohibited guns will be out of circulation.<ref>[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-462/page-2.html#h-4 List of Restricted and Prohibited Firearms], Canadian Firearms Centre (CFC)</ref>{{rp|Part 1.86}}<ref>[http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/factsheets/prohibited_e.asp Prohibited Firearms], Canadian Firearms Centre (CFC)</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:1921mc.jpg|thumb|Firing the 1921 Thompson]]\n\nThe perceived popularity of submachine guns such as the Thompson with violent gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s was one of the main reasons given for passage of the [[National Firearms Act]] by the [[United States Congress]] in 1934. One of its provisions was that owners of fully automatic firearms were required to register them with the predecessor agency of the modern [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF). The law also placed restrictions on the possession, transfer, and transport of the weapons.\n\nThere are several U.S. made [[automatic firearm|automatic]] and [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] variants, copies, or replicas. The semi-automatic versions are less regulated by federal law.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe possession of any fully automatic firearm is prohibited in the UK by the [[Firearms Act 1968]]; prohibited firearms can be possessed on a section 5 certificate, but these are not issued to civilians. A fully automatic firearm that has been converted to semi-automatic fire, such as the Model 1927, is prohibited by the [[Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988|Firearms Act 1988]], as is any centre-fire purpose-made semi-automatic weapon, such as the Model 1927A1. It is now effectively impossible for a firearm of this type to be legally possessed by a member of the general public, except in certified deactivated condition or where specifically manufactured as a semi-automatic in calibre .22lr.\n\n===Germany===\nThe gun, in a government approved semiautomatic conversion or clone, can legally be owned by hunters and sport shooters. With a design date prior to 1942 it isn't considered a \"weapon of war\" any more. Only the fully automatic version is a [[Gun legislation in Germany|prohibited weapon]]. As a long gun, it can be bought by hunters (even if it can't be used to actually hunt for legal reasons). There are disciplines in government approved sport shooting rulebooks that allow this type to be used, therefore the gun can be bought by sport shooters, too.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

It was a common sight in the media of the time, being used by both law enforcement officers and criminals.{{sfn|Bearse|1994|p=210}} The Thompson submachine gun was also known informally as the \"'''Tommy Gun'''\", \"'''Annihilator'''\", \"'''Chicago Typewriter'''\", \u201c'''Trench Broom'''\u201d, \"'''Chicago Submachine'''\", \"'''Chicago Piano'''\", \"'''Chicago Style'''\", \"'''Chicago Organ Grinder'''\", \"'''Drum Gun'''\",\"'''the Chopper'''\", and simply \"'''the Thompson'''\".<ref>{{cite web |last= Smith |first= Charles H. |title= The Thompson Submachine Gun (A Brief History of Auto-Ordnance Corp.) |url= http://www.auto-ordnance.com/ao_ao.html |accessdate= 2008-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080827181631/http://auto-ordnance.com/ao_ao.html |archivedate= 2008-08-27 |df=  }}</ref><ref name=\"James\">{{cite web|last= James |first= Gary |url= http://www.nfatoys.com/tsmg/web/history.htm |title= Development of the Thompson Submachine Gun |date= 1996\u20132006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher= My Al Capone Museum |title= The Chicago Typewriter |url= http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id84.htm |accessdate= 2008-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= National Rifle Association \u2013 Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) |title= Issues: The Late 19th Century |url= http://www.nraila.org/media/misc/lostrts.html |accessdate= 2008-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080706130950/http://www.nraila.org/media/misc/lostrts.html |archivedate= 2008-07-06 |df=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Willbanks |first= James H. |title= Machine Guns: An Illustrated History of Their Impact |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VWkYoAkoMHIC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=chicago+piano+thompson#v=onepage&q=chicago%20piano%20thompson&f=false|page = 183 |accessdate= 2014-05-18|isbn= 9781851094806 |year= 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe Thompson was favored by soldiers, criminals, police, FBI, and civilians alike for its large [[.45 ACP]] cartridge and high volume of fully automatic fire. It has since gained popularity among civilian collectors for its historical significance. It has considerable significance in popular culture, especially in works about the Prohibition era and World War II, and is among the best-known firearms in history. The original fully automatic Thompsons are no longer produced, but numerous semi-automatic civilian versions are still being manufactured by Auto-Ordnance. These retain a similar appearance to the original models, but they have various modifications in order to comply with [[National Firearms Act|US firearm laws]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History and service==\n===Development===\n[[File:Thompson-and-his-gun.jpg|thumb|upright|General John T. Thompson holding an M1921]]\n\nGeneral [[John T. Thompson]] developed the Thompson Submachine Gun. He originally envisioned an \"[[Thompson Autorifle|auto rifle]]\" ([[semi-automatic rifle]]) to replace the bolt action service rifles then in use, but he came across a patent issued to [[John Bell Blish]] in 1915 while searching for a way to allow his weapon to operate safely without the complexity of a [[Recoil operation|recoil]] or [[gas-operated reloading]] mechanism. Blish's design was based on the adhesion of inclined metal surfaces under pressure.<ref>{{cite book|first=Julian S. |last=Hatcher|title=Hatcher's Notebook|publisher= Military Service Publishing Co.|year= 1947|page= 44}}</ref> Thompson gained financial backing from [[Thomas Fortune Ryan|Thomas F. Ryan]] and started the [[Auto-Ordnance Company]] in 1916 for the purpose of developing his \"auto rifle\". It was primarily developed in [[Cleveland, Ohio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfatoys.com/tsmg/|title=The Unofficial Tommy Gun Page|website=www.nfatoys.com}}</ref> and the principal designers were Theodore H. Eickhoff, Oscar V. Payne, and George E. Goll. By late 1917, the limits of the [[Blish lock|Blish Principle]] were discovered; rather than working as a locked breech, it functioned as a friction-delayed [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]] action. It was found that the only cartridge currently in service that was suitable for use with the lock was the [[.45 ACP]] round. Thompson then envisioned a \"one-man, hand-held machine gun\" in .45 ACP as a \"trench broom\" for use in the ongoing [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. Payne designed the gun and its stick and drum magazines. The project was then titled \"Annihilator I\", and most of the design issues had been resolved by 1918; however, the war ended two days before prototypes could be shipped to Europe.<ref name=\"Frank Iannamico 1928\">{{harvnb|Iannamico|2000|page={{page needed|date=December 2011}}}}</ref>\n\nAt an Auto-Ordnance board meeting in 1919 to discuss the marketing of the \"Annihilator\", with the war now over, the weapon was officially renamed the \"Thompson Submachine Gun\". While other weapons had been developed shortly prior with similar objectives in mind, the Thompson was the first weapon to be labeled and marketed as a \"submachine gun\".<ref name=\"James\"/> Thompson intended the weapon as an automatic \"trench-broom\" to sweep enemy troops from the trenches, filling a role for which the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR) had been proven ill-suited.{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1977|p=272}} This concept had already been developed by [[Imperial Germany|German]] troops using their own [[Theodor Bergmann|Bergmann]] [[MP 18]], the world's first submachine gun, in concert with ''[[infiltration tactics|Sturmtruppen]]'' tactics.<ref>Gudmundsson, Bruce. (1995). ''Stormtroop Tactics: Innovation in the German Army, 1914\u20131918''. Praeger Press. {{page needed|date=December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Early use===\nThe Thompson first entered production as the M1921. It was available to civilians, although poor sales resulted from the expense of the weapon; the Thompson gun with one Type XX 20 shot \"stick\" magazine was priced at $200 in 1921 ({{Inflation|US|200|1921|fmt=eq}}). M1921 Thompsons were sold in small quantities to the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]]<ref>[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/inspectors/a6p1.html Smithsonian National Postal Museum], Postal Inspectors: The Silent Service, Unexpected Duties. \"The Postal Inspection Service became the first law enforcement agency to purchase the Thompson submachine gun ...\"</ref> to protect the mail from a spate of robberies<ref name=\"Fitz2487\">{{harvnb|Fitzsimons|1977|p=2487}}</ref> and to the United States Marine Corps. Federal sales were followed by sales to several police departments in the US and minor international sales to various armies and constabulary forces, chiefly in Central and South America.<ref name=\"Fitz2487\"/> The Marines used their Thompsons in the [[Banana Wars]] and in China. It was popular as a point-defense weapon for countering ambush by Nicaraguan guerrillas, and led to the organization of four-man [[fire team]]s with as much firepower as a nine-man rifle squad. The major complaints against the Thompson were its weight, inaccuracy at ranges over {{convert|50|yd|m}}, and the lack of penetrating power of the .45 ACP pistol cartridge.<ref name=\"rt66.com\">{{cite web |author=Bert Kortegaard |url=http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/thompson.htm |title=M1A1 Thompson Submachine Gun |publisher=Rt66.com |date=2000-09-21 |accessdate=2011-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217064700/http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/smallarms/thompson.htm |archivedate=2011-12-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of the first batches of Thompsons were bought in America by agents of the [[Irish Republic]], notably [[Harry Boland]].

The remainder made their way to the [[Irish Republican Army]] by way of Liverpool and were used in the last month of the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919\u201321).{{sfn|Hart|2003|pp=184\u2013185}} After a truce with the British in July 1921, the IRA imported more Thompsons and used them in the subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323).

The Thompson had to be cocked, bolt retracted ready to fire, to attach the drum. It attached and detached by sliding sideways, which made magazine changes slow and also created difficulty in clearing a cartridge malfunction (\"jam\"). Reloading an empty drum with cartridges was an involved process.\n\nIn contrast, the \"XX\" twenty-round box magazine was light and compact, it tended not to rattle, and could be inserted with the bolt safely closed. It was quickly attached and detached and was removed downward, making clearing jams easier. The box tripped the bolt open lock when empty, facilitating magazine changes. An empty box was easily reloaded with loose rounds. However, users complained it was limited in capacity. In the field, some soldiers taped two \"XX\" magazines together in what would be known as [[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|\"jungle style\"]] to speed magazine changes.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2011/2/15/thompson-submachine-gun-the-tommy-gun-goes-to-war/|title=Thompson Submachine Gun: The Tommy Gun Goes to War|accessdate=2016-02-04|magazine=American Rifleman|author=Bruce Canfield}}</ref>\n\nTwo alternatives to the \"L\" drum and \"XX\" box magazines were tested December 6, 1941, at Fort Knox: an extended thirty-round box magazine and a forty-round magazine made by welding two 20-round magazines face to face, jungle style.

With huge numbers of guns available in army ordnance arsenals, the Thompson remained classed as Limited Standard or Substitute Standard long after the standardization of the M3/M3A1. Many Thompsons were distributed to the US-backed [[Republic of China|Nationalist Chinese]] armed forces as military aid before the fall of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government to [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[communist]] forces at the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 (Thompsons had already been widely used throughout China since the 1920s, at a time when several Chinese warlords and their military factions [[Warlord Era|running various parts of the fragmented country]] made purchases of the weapon and then subsequently produced many local copies). During the Korean War, US troops were surprised to encounter [[People's Volunteer Army|communist Chinese troops]] armed with Thompsons (amongst other captured US-made Nationalist Chinese and American firearms), especially during unexpected night-time assaults which became a prominent Chinese combat tactic in the conflict. The gun's ability to deliver large quantities of short-range automatic assault fire proved very useful in both defense and assault during the early part of the war when it was constantly mobile and shifting back and forth. Many Chinese Thompsons were captured and placed into service with American soldiers and marines for the remaining period of the war.\n\nThe [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] received 34,000 M1A1 Thompsons during the 1950s as part of a ''US Military Aid to Yugoslavia Agreement''.

They shipped their remaining stocks to arm the forces of [[Lon Nol]]'s [[Khmer Republic]] in 1975. They were then captured and used by the [[Khmer Rouge]].\n\nIn the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]], known as [[the Troubles]] (1969\u20131998), the Thompson was again used by the Irish Republican paramilitaries. According to historian [[Peter Hart (historian)|Peter Hart]], \"The Thompson remained a key part of both the [[Official IRA]] and [[Provisional IRA]] arsenals until well into the 1970s when it was superseded by the [[Armalite AR-18|Armalite]] and the [[AK-47]].\"{{sfn|Hart|2003|p=191}}\n\nThe Thompson was also used by U.S. and overseas law enforcement and police forces, most prominently by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].

There were fewer than 40 pre-production prototypes. The Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut was contracted by the Auto-Ordnance Corporation to manufacture the initial mass production of 15,000 Thompson Submachine Guns in 1920. An original Colt Model 1921 A or AC, Model 1927 A or AC, Model 1928 Navy A or AC, properly registered in working condition with original components can easily fetch from [[United States dollar|US$]]25,000 to $45,000+ depending on condition and accessories. For WWII, approximately 1,700,000 Thompson Submachine Guns were produced by Auto-Ordnance and [[Savage Arms]], with 1,387,134 being the simplified World War II M1 and M1A1 variants (without the Blish lock and oiling system{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1977|p=2488}}).\n\nA Model 1921A believed to have been owned by [[Bonnie and Clyde]], but without historical documentation to substantiate this provenance, sold at auction on January 21, 2012, in Kansas City for $130,000.<ref>Rice, Glenn E. \"$210K for Bonnie & Clyde Tommy Gun, shotgun\" [http://www.kansascity.com/2012/01/21/3383602/bonnie-and-clyde-gun-goes-for.html <u>The Kansas City Star</u>] 21 Jan. 2012</ref>\n\n==Features==\n===Operating characteristics===\n[[File:Thompson 21 field stripped.jpg|thumb|left|Thompson 1921, field stripped]]\n\nEarly versions of the Thompson, the Model 1919, had a fairly high cyclic rate of fire, as high as 1,200&nbsp;rounds per minute (rpm), with most Model 1921s at 800&nbsp;rpm. In 1927, the U.S. Navy ordered 500 Thompsons but requested a lower rate of fire. Thompson requested  Payne develop a method of reducing the cyclic rate of fire. Payne replaced the actuator with a heavier one and the recoil spring with a stiffer one; the changes reduced the rate of fire from 800 to the 600&nbsp;rpm of the U.S. Navy Model 1928. Later M1 and M1A1 Thompsons averaged also 600&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy F. 1948 p. 299\">{{harvnb|Dunlap|1948|p=299}}</ref> This rate of fire, combined with a rather heavy trigger pull and a stock with an excessive drop, increases the tendency for the barrel to climb off target in automatic fire.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy F. 1948 p. 299\"/><ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 395\">{{harvnb|George|1981|p=395}}</ref> Compared to more modern submachine guns, the .45 Thompson is quite heavy, weighing roughly the same as the contemporary [[M1 Garand]] semi-automatic rifle, and requires a lot of cleaning. This was one of the major complaints about the weapon by [[U.S. Army]] personnel to whom it was issued.<ref name=\"rt66.com\"/>\n\n[[File:Thompson1928a1.jpg|thumb|Thompson M1928A1, field stripped]]\nAlthough the drum magazine provided significant firepower, in military service it was found to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 395\"/> The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility was not included in the design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.<ref name=\"rt66.com\"/>\n\nThe selective-fire (semi- or fully automatic) Thompson fires from the \"open bolt\" position, in which the bolt is held fully to rearward by the sear when cocked. When the trigger is depressed, the bolt is released, traveling forward to chamber and simultaneously fire the first and subsequent rounds until either the trigger is released or the ammunition is exhausted. This eliminates the risk of \"[[Cooking off|cook-off]]\", which can sometimes occur in closed-bolt automatic weapons.\n\n===Disassembly===\nThe Thompson submachine gun varies in field strip procedure, depending on the variant. World War II-era M1 variants and RPB models field strip more easily than the M1921.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe 1928 variant can be disassembled easily by first detaching the stock, then sliding off the lower receiver and then simply removing the internal parts, cleaning them, and then putting it back together. When opened up, the Thompson features a small number of parts that need to be removed including the spring, bolt, Blish Lock, and actuator bolt.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 98.jpg|thumb|Thompson M1921 submachine gun with Argentine Halcon compensator]]\n\n===Prototypes===\n====Persuader and Annihilator====\nThere were two main experimental models of the Thompson. The ''Persuader'' was a [[Belt (firearm)|belt-fed]] version developed in 1917/18. It was partially built, but never completely finished. The ''Annihilator'', serial no. Ver 10 prototypes was similar in appearance to the later models, but without rear sight and butt stock mounts. The Annihilator prototypes first were fed from a 20-round box magazine, but later, the 50- and 100-round [[drum magazine]] models were developed.\n\n====Model 1919====\nStarting with the Serial no. 11, the Model 1919 takes the final appearance of the later Thompsons with the rear sights and the butt stock. The Model 1919 was limited to about 40 units; the first built did not use the drums, as it was too difficult to fire. Many variations have been noted within this model. The weapons had very high cyclic rates up to 1,500&nbsp;rpm.{{sfn|Bearse|1994|p=210}} This was the weapon Brigadier General Thompson demonstrated at [[Camp Perry]] in 1920. A number of Model 1919s were made without butt stocks, rear- and front sights, but the final version closely resembled the later Model  1921.  This model was designed to \"sweep\" trenches with bullets. The [[New York City Police Department]] was the largest purchaser of the M1919. Some experimental calibers aside the [[.45 ACP]] (11.4x23mm) were the [[.22LR]], [[.32 ACP]], [[.38 ACP]], and [[9mm Luger|9mmP]].<ref name=\"Fitz2487\"/>\n\n====.351 WSL variant====\nOnly one prototype was made in [[.351 WSL]] using a standard 20\" barrel and an ROF of 1000rpm.\n\n====Thompson .30 Carbine====\nThe layout and ergonomics of the Thompson submachine gun were also considered for the role of a Light Rifle before the adoption of the [[M1 Carbine]].

In its original design, it was finished more like a sporting weapon, with an adjustable rear sight, a blued, finned barrel and vertical [[foregrip]] (or pistol grip) and the Blish lock. The M1921 was quite expensive to manufacture, with the original retail price around $200, because of its high-quality wood furniture and finely [[machined]] parts.

The Army did not give the Model 1923 much consideration, so it was not adopted.\n\n====Model 1921AC (1926)====\nWhile not a new model in the usual sense of incorporating major changes, in 1926 the Cutts Compensator (a [[muzzle brake]]) was offered as an option for the M1921; Thompsons with the compensator were cataloged as No. 21AC at the original price of $200.00, with the plain M1921 designated No. 21A at a reduced price of $175.00.<ref name=\"Frank Iannamico 1928\"/> The Model 1921 was thereafter referred to as Model 1921A or Model 1921AC, though some collectors still refer to it as the Model 1921.\n\n====Model 1928====\nThe Model 1928 was the first type widely used by military forces, with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as major buyers through the 1930s. The original Model 1928s were Model 1921s with weight added to the actuator, which slowed down the [[cyclic rate]] of fire, a United States Navy requirement. On these guns, the model number \"1921\" on the receiver was updated by stamping an \"8\" over the last \"1\". The Navy Model 1928 has several names among collectors: the \"Colt Overstamp\", \"1921 Overstamp\", \"28 Navy\", or just \"28N\".\n\nThe 1928 Thompson would be the last small arm adopted by the U.S. Army that used a year designation in the official nomenclature. With the start of World War II, major contracts from several countries saved the manufacturer from [[bankruptcy]]. A notable variant of the Model 1928 with an aluminum receiver and tenite grip, buttstock, and forend, was made by Savage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.machinegunbooks.com/eleven.html |title=Thompson Gallery |publisher=www.MachineGunBooks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref>\n\n====M1928A1====\n[[File:Halftrack-fort-knox-4.jpg|thumb|M1928A1 at [[Fort Knox, Kentucky|Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], June 1942]]\n\nThe M1928A1 variant entered mass production before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], as on-hand stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal forend, in place of the distinctive vertical foregrip (\"[[pistol grip]]\"), and a provision for a military [[sling (firearms)|sling]]. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons during the early years of World War II. Though it could use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service showed the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular sight guard wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.\n\nIn addition, the Soviet Union received M1928A1s, included as standard equipment with the [[M3 Stuart|M3 light]] [[tank]]s obtained through Lend-Lease. The weapons were never issued to the Red Army because of a lack of .45 ACP ammunition on the Eastern Front; they were simply put in storage, although a picture exists of what appears to be Thompsons being used by Russian M3 Stuart crews in the Caucasus. As of September 2006, limited numbers of these weapons have been re-imported from Russia to the United States as disassembled \"spare parts kits\", comprising the entire weapon less the receiver (as required by Federal law).\n\nAn M1928A1 which also came with an unusual inline stock, modified with elevated sights to increase accuracy also existed. Some Thompsons were built with a folding stock, similar to the [[M1A1 Carbine]] for Allied tank crews, drivers and paratroopers and submarine raiders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/experimental-thompson-stock/|title=Experimental Thompson Stock|work=Forgotten Weapons|date=2012-12-07}}</ref>\n\n===Service variants===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\n\n====Thompson Machine Carbine (TMC)====\nIn 1940 Commonwealth troops in Egypt and North Africa were issued commercial model Lend-Lease Colt- and Savage-manufactured M1928s. Section leaders carried them instead of pistols or rifles. Many of the Colt models had French-language manuals packed with them as they had been abruptly diverted to England after the fall of France. They soon discovered that the weapon was prone to jamming due to sand. To fix this, the armorers removed the Blish Lock and replaced it with a hex bolt to keep the cocking handle and bolt together. The 20-round Type XX magazines had their peep-holes welded shut to keep sand out and the 50-round Type L drums were discontinued. Ammunition was scarce as it was either in small lots of Lend-Lease commercial ammo or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the [[9mm Parabellum|9mm]] [[Sten gun]] and [[Lanchester SMG]].\n\nThe Japanese captured enough Thompson M1928 SMGs and ammunition when they captured Hong Kong and Malaysia that it became a limited standard weapon. It surpassed any similar weapons currently in their service. Ammunition was usually in US 42-round Lend-Lease commercial cartons or Australian 28-round military cartons captured from the Commonwealth forces that was sampled, tested, and resealed with Japanese arsenal stickers.\n\nModels used in the Pacific by Australian troops had their sling swivels remounted on the left side to allow it to be fired more easily while prone. A metal sling mount was fitted to the left side of the wooden buttstock. Ammunition was manufactured in Australia or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the [[Owen Gun|Owen Machine Carbine]].\n\n====M1====\n[[File:Thompson submachine gun Firecontrols.jpg|thumb|Fire Controls M1928a1Thompson Front lever is selector switch set for full auto]]\n\nResponding to a request for further simplification, the M1 was standardized in April 1942 as the '''United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M1'''. Rate of fire was reduced to approximately 600\u2013700&nbsp;rpm.\n\nFirst issued in 1943, the M1 uses a simple [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]] operation, with the charging handle moved to the side. The flip-up adjustable Lyman rear sight was replaced with a fixed L sight. Late M1s had triangular guard wings added to the rear L sight, which were standardized on the M1A1. The slots adjoining the magazine well allowing the use of a drum magazine were removed. A new magazine catch with the provision for retaining drum magazines removed, was produced, but most M1s and later M1A1s retained the original. The less expensive and more-easily manufactured \"stick\" magazines were used exclusively in the M1, with a new 30-round version joining the familiar 20-round type. The Cutts [[Muzzle brake|compensator]], barrel cooling fins, and Blish lock were omitted while the [[Stock (firearms)|buttstock]] was permanently affixed. Late production M1 stocks were fitted with reinforcing bolts and washers to prevent splitting of the stock where it attached to the receiver. The British had used improvised bolts or wood screws to reinforce M1928 stocks. The M1 reinforcing bolt and washer were carried over to the M1A1 and retrofitted to many of the M1928A1s in U.S. and British service. Late M1s also had simplified fire control switches, also carried over to the M1A1. Certain M1s had issues with high rate of fire climbing up to ~800 RPM. The exact cause remains unknown, but was resolved with the transition to the M1A1.<ref>[https://smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2163 M1 Vs M1A1 Thompson Submachine Gun Cyclic rate]</ref>\n\n====M1A1==== <!-- [[M1A1]] links here -->\n[[File:M1A1.gif|thumb|left|Both sides of the Thompson M1A1 shown with 30-round magazine]]\n\nThe M1A1, standardized in October 1942 as the '''United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M1A1''', could be produced in half the time of the M1928A1, and at a much lower cost. The main difference between the M1 and M1A1 was the bolt. The M1 bolt had a floating firing pin and hammer, the bolt of the M1A1 had the firing pin machined to the face of the bolt, eliminating unnecessary parts. The reinforced stock and protective sight wings were standard. The 30-round magazine became more common. In 1939, Thompsons cost the government $209 apiece. By the spring of 1942, cost-reduction design changes had brought this down to $70. In February 1944, the M1A1 reached a low price of $45 each, including accessories and spare parts, although the difference in price between the M1 and M1A1 was only $0.06. By the end of the war, the M1A1 was replaced with the even lower-cost [[M3 submachine gun|M3]] (commonly called the \"Grease Gun\").\n\n===Semi-automatic===\n====Model 1927====\nThe Model 1927 was the open bolt semi-automatic-only version of the M1921. It was made by modifying an existing Model 1921, including replacing certain parts. The \"Thompson Submachine Gun\" inscription was machined over to replace it with \"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine\", and the \"Model 1921\" inscription was also machined over to replace it with \"Model 1927.\" Although the Model 1927 was semi-automatic only, it was easily converted to fully automatic by installing a full-auto Model 1921 fire control group (internal parts). Most Model 1927s owned by police have been converted back to full-auto.{{sfn|Iannamico|2000|p=21}} The original Model 1927 is classified as a machine gun under the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934 (a) by being \"readily convertible\" by swapping parts and (b) by a [[Open bolt#Legality|1982 BATF ruling]] making all open bolt semi-automatic firearms manufactured after the date of this ruling classified as machine guns.\n\n====Model 1927A1====\nThe Model 1927A1 is a semi-automatic only replica version of the Thompson, originally produced by Auto-Ordnance of [[West Hurley, New York|West Hurley]], New York for the civilian collector's market from 1974 to 1999. It has been produced since 1999 by Kahr Arms of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]]. It is officially known as the \"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Model of 1927A1.\" The internal design is completely different to operate from the closed bolt and the carbine has barrel length of {{convert|16.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} (versus open bolt operation and barrel length of {{convert|10.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} for the full automatic versions). Under federal regulations, these changes make the Model 1927A1 legally a rifle and remove it from the federal registry requirements of the [[National Firearms Act]]. These modern versions should not be confused with the original semi-automatic M1927, which was a slightly modified M1921 produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance.\n\nThe Model 1927A1 is the semi-automatic replica of the Thompson Models of 1921 and 1927. The \"Thompson Commando\" is a semi-automatic replica of the M1928A1. The Auto-Ordnance replica of the Thompson M1 and M1A1 is known as the TM1, and may be found marked \"Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Caliber .45M1\".\n\n====Model 1927A3====\nThe Model 1927A3 is a semi-automatic, .22 caliber version of the Thompson produced by Auto-Ordnance in West Hurley.\n\n====Model 1927A5====\nThe Model 1927A5 is a semi-automatic, .45 ACP pistol version of the Thompson originally produced by Auto-Ordnance in West Hurley from the 1970s until the early 1990s or late '80s. It featured an aluminum receiver to reduce weight. It has since been replaced with the Kahr Arms TA5 Pistol, which features a 10.5\" barrel and steel receiver, unlike the 1927A5's 13\" barrel and aluminum receiver.\n\nAs per the NFA (National Firearms Act of 1934), the \"1927A5 .45 ACP Pistol\" is simply classified as a \"Firearm\" (Any type of firearm with an overall length of 26\" or greater, that does not have a buttstock) as it neither fits the definition of a Pistol or Rifle under federal law. This categorization also legally allows it to have 1921 or 1928 style foregrip equipped, unlike other \"pistol style\" Thompson variants, without an AOW (Any Other Weapon) Tax Stamp.\n[[File:BATFE Firearm Classification Letter.jpg|left|thumb|Auto-Ordnance 1927A5 DOJ BATFE Firearm Classification Letter]]\n\n====1928A1 LTD====\nThe 1928A1 LTD is a civilian semi-automatic-only conversion by Luxembourg Defense Technology (LuxDefTec) in Luxembourg. They are made from original 1928A1 guns of various appearance (with or without Cutt's compensator, ribbed or smooth barrels, adjustable or fixed sights), that where imported [[Lend-Lease]] guns from Russia.\n\n===Export variants===\n====BSA Thompsons====\nIn an attempt to expand interest and sales overseas, Auto-Ordnance entered into a partnership with and licensed the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited]] (BSA) in England to produce a European model. These were produced in small quantities and have a different appearance than the classic style. The '''BSA 1926''' was manufactured in 9mmP and [[7.63\u00d725mm Mauser|7.63mm Mauser]] and were tested by various governments, including France, in the mid-1920s. It was never adopted by any military force, and only a small number were produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotavapen.se/gota/artiklar/kpist/stengun.htm |title=Submachine guns of UK \u2013 BSA Thompson 1926 \u2013 Thompson 1928A1 \u2013 Lanchester \u2013 Sten and Sterling |publisher=Gotavapen.se |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref>\n\n===RPB Thompsons===\n====Special purpose variant====\nA special purpose machine pistol variant of the Thompson is manufactured by RPB Industries of Atlanta.<ref>[http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8272/3053620dzpobzua.jpg ]{{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Suppressed variant====\nA version with a threaded barrel for suppressors, side folding stock, and modified sights.\n\n==Civilian ownership==\n===Canada===\nAll variants and modified versions of Thompson submachine guns (even semiautomatic-only versions) are prohibited by name in Canada, as part of Prohibited Weapons Order No. 13 in 1995. Consequently, they cannot be legally imported or owned except under very limited circumstances. For example, to own one the person must be \"[[grandfather clause|grandfathered]]\" and have owned one before the bill was passed against it. The submachine gun is not grandfathered like in US, only the owner. The submachine gun can only be sold to other grandfathered individuals; this keeps prices extremely low as the number of permitted licensed individuals is very small and dwindling with time. Eventually, all prohibited guns will be out of circulation.<ref>[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-462/page-2.html#h-4 List of Restricted and Prohibited Firearms], Canadian Firearms Centre (CFC)</ref>{{rp|Part 1.86}}<ref>[http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/factsheets/prohibited_e.asp Prohibited Firearms], Canadian Firearms Centre (CFC)</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:1921mc.jpg|thumb|Firing the 1921 Thompson]]\n\nThe perceived popularity of submachine guns such as the Thompson with violent gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s was one of the main reasons given for passage of the [[National Firearms Act]] by the [[United States Congress]] in 1934. One of its provisions was that owners of fully automatic firearms were required to register them with the predecessor agency of the modern [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF). The law also placed restrictions on the possession, transfer, and transport of the weapons.\n\nThere are several U.S. made [[automatic firearm|automatic]] and [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] variants, copies, or replicas. The semi-automatic versions are less regulated by federal law.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe possession of any fully automatic firearm is prohibited in the UK by the [[Firearms Act 1968]]; prohibited firearms can be possessed on a section 5 certificate, but these are not issued to civilians. A fully automatic firearm that has been converted to semi-automatic fire, such as the Model 1927, is prohibited by the [[Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988|Firearms Act 1988]], as is any centre-fire purpose-made semi-automatic weapon, such as the Model 1927A1. It is now effectively impossible for a firearm of this type to be legally possessed by a member of the general public, except in certified deactivated condition or where specifically manufactured as a semi-automatic in calibre .22lr.\n\n===Germany===\nThe gun, in a government approved semiautomatic conversion or clone, can legally be owned by hunters and sport shooters. With a design date prior to 1942 it isn't considered a \"weapon of war\" any more. Only the fully automatic version is a [[Gun legislation in Germany|prohibited weapon]]. As a long gun, it can be bought by hunters (even if it can't be used to actually hunt for legal reasons). There are disciplines in government approved sport shooting rulebooks that allow this type to be used, therefore the gun can be bought by sport shooters, too.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

{"title_page": "Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount FitzWilliam", "text_new": "'''Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount Fitzwilliam''' (1581\u20131650) was an Irish nobleman of the Stuart age. He was born to wealth and privilege, and acquired a peerage, but due to his loyalty to the English  Crown he suffered  considerable hardship  during the [[English Civil War]], and died in poverty.\n\n==Background==\nHe was born in [[Dublin]], probably at [[Merrion Castle]], eldest of the five  sons  of Sir Richard FitzWiliam, Constable of [[Wicklow]], and Jane Preston, daughter of Christopher Preston, 4th [[Viscount Gormanston]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1902-1920 Vol.2  p.11</ref> The FitzWilliam family are recorded   in Dublin from about 1210, and by the time of Thomas's  birth they  were among the wealthiest and most influential families in [[the Pale]].\n\n==Early career==\nThomas was only fourteen when his father died.  As a young man he spent some time in [[London]] studying law at [[Gray's Inn]].  He  was [[knighted]] in 1605, the year of his marriage.\n\nIn 1608 he narrowly avoided being caught up  in the rebellion of Sir [[Cahir O'Doherty]], having stood [[surety]]  for the good behaviour of O'Doherty, who had married Thomas's  aunt Mary Preston.<ref>Ball, p.12</ref> A messenger arrived at Merrion Castle ordering FitzWilliam to produce the person of O'Doherty; fortunately FitzWilliam was not at home.  \n\nHe was [[knighted]]  the same year, and  served as [[Sheriff of County Dublin]]  in 1609. In  1610  he received a substantial grant of land in [[County Armagh]] from the English Crown.  No doubts   seem to have been entertained about his own loyalty to the Crown, except perhaps during the latter part of the  English  Civil War, In  1629 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] created him [[Viscount FitzWilliam]] in recognition of his family's long record of service to the Crown.<ref>Cokayne  ''Complete Peerage'' 6 volumes. Reissued  2000 Vol. 5, p. 527</ref> It appears that a good deal was expected in return for the title, and Thomas had to make substantial gifts of money  to the King. This put a particular burden on his estates since he was involved in  protracted litigation with his numerous brothers and sisters, due to  his father's breaking of an [[entail]] on the estates, which benefitted Thomas  at the expense of  his siblings. Admittedly Thomas himself had been the beneficiary of a generous Crown grant of land in Armagh.  Like nearly all of his family he inclined to the [[Roman Catholic]]  faith, while adhering in public to the [[Church of Ireland]]; later generations of  Fitzwilliams were quite open in their support for the Catholic  religion.\n\n==Civil war and last years==\nWhen the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out, FitzWilliam, unlike many of the nobility of the Pale, remained loyal to the Crown, despite strong pressure from his mother's family, the Prestons of Gormanston, to join the [[Irish Confederacy]].<ref>Ball, p.13</ref> He was one of  only three nobles to offer their assistance in the [[Royalist]] defence of Dublin, and a garrison was placed in Merrion Castle. It was betrayed in June 1642 and thereafter FitzWilliam only lived there for short periods. He offered his services\nto the  [[Lord Justices (Ireland)|Lords Justices]], but  despite his long record of loyalty to the Crown he was rebuffed, apparently on account of his known leanings towards the Roman Catholic religion,  and he  took no further part in the fighting.  He spent some time in  England, where the King received him courteously.   He was promised an English [[Earldom]],  but the promise was not kept. He returned to Ireland, only to discover that he had been [[outlawed]]]. In his last years he led an unsettled existence, living  sometimes at Merrion Castle,  sometimes with his eldest son at [[Howth]], and sometimes in [[Louth, County Louth|Louth]]. At times he seems to have been almost destitute, and  he wrote to  [[ James Butler, 1st Duke  of Ormonde]] in 1647 asking for repayment of a [[debt]]. In 1648 he was promised a [[pension]]  of \u00a3100 a year, but it is unclear if he ever received it.<ref>Ball, p.16</ref>\n\nDue perhaps to the confused conditions of the [[ English Civil War]], little seems to be known about the date and place of his death.

He was born to wealth and privilege, and acquired a peerage, but due to his loyalty to the English  Crown he suffered  considerable hardship  during the [[English Civil War]], and died in poverty.\n\n==Background==\nHe was born in [[Dublin]], probably at [[Merrion Castle]], eldest of the five  sons  of Sir Richard FitzWiliam, Constable of [[Wicklow]], and Jane Preston, daughter of Christopher Preston, 4th [[Viscount Gormanston]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1902-1920 Vol.2  p.11</ref> The FitzWilliam family are recorded   in Dublin from about 1210, and by the time of Thomas's  birth they  were among the wealthiest and most influential families in [[the Pale]].\n\n==Early career==\nThomas was only fourteen when his father died.  As a young man he spent some time in [[London]] studying law at [[Gray's Inn]].  He  was [[knighted]] in 1605, the year of his marriage.\n\nIn 1608 he narrowly avoided being caught up  in the rebellion of Sir [[Cahir O'Doherty]], having stood [[surety]]  for the good behaviour of O'Doherty, who had married Thomas's  aunt Mary Preston.<ref>Ball, p.12</ref> A messenger arrived at Merrion Castle ordering FitzWilliam to produce the person of O'Doherty; fortunately FitzWilliam was not at home.  \n\nHe was [[knighted]]  the same year, and  served as [[Sheriff of County Dublin]]  in 1609. In  1610  he received a substantial grant of land in [[County Armagh]] from the English Crown.  No doubts   seem to have been entertained about his own loyalty to the Crown, except perhaps during the latter part of the  English  Civil War, In  1629 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] created him [[Viscount FitzWilliam]] in recognition of his family's long record of service to the Crown.<ref>Cokayne  ''Complete Peerage'' 6 volumes. Reissued  2000 Vol. 5, p. 527</ref> It appears that a good deal was expected in return for the title, and Thomas had to make substantial gifts of money  to the King. This put a particular burden on his estates since he was involved in  protracted litigation with his numerous brothers and sisters, due to  his father's breaking of an [[entail]] on the estates, which benefitted Thomas  at the expense of  his siblings. Admittedly Thomas himself had been the beneficiary of a generous Crown grant of land in Armagh.  Like nearly all of his family he inclined to the [[Roman Catholic]]  faith, while adhering in public to the [[Church of Ireland]]; later generations of  Fitzwilliams were quite open in their support for the Catholic  religion.\n\n==Civil war and last years==\nWhen the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out, FitzWilliam, unlike many of the nobility of the Pale, remained loyal to the Crown, despite strong pressure from his mother's family, the Prestons of Gormanston, to join the [[Irish Confederacy]].<ref>Ball, p.13</ref> He was one of  only three nobles to offer their assistance in the [[Royalist]] defence of Dublin, and a garrison was placed in Merrion Castle. It was betrayed in June 1642 and thereafter FitzWilliam only lived there for short periods. He offered his services\nto the  [[Lord Justices (Ireland)|Lords Justices]], but  despite his long record of loyalty to the Crown he was rebuffed, apparently on account of his known leanings towards the Roman Catholic religion,  and he  took no further part in the fighting.  He spent some time in  England, where the King received him courteously.   He was promised an English [[Earldom]],  but the promise was not kept. He returned to Ireland, only to discover that he had been [[outlawed]]]. In his last years he led an unsettled existence, living  sometimes at Merrion Castle,  sometimes with his eldest son at [[Howth]], and sometimes in [[Louth, County Louth|Louth]]. At times he seems to have been almost destitute, and  he wrote to  [[ James Butler, 1st Duke  of Ormonde]] in 1647 asking for repayment of a [[debt]]. In 1648 he was promised a [[pension]]  of \u00a3100 a year, but it is unclear if he ever received it.<ref>Ball, p.16</ref>\n\nDue perhaps to the confused conditions of the [[ English Civil War]], little seems to be known about the date and place of his death. Even the year has been disputed, but is generally stated to be 1650. He was certainly dead before 1655 when his eldest surviving son Oliver was allowed to inherit a part of the estates, though most of them were not restored until 1663.<ref>Ball, p.18</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1605 he married Margaret Plunkett, daughter of Oliver Plunkett, 4th [[Baron Louth]] and  his wife Frances, who was the daughter of [[Nicholas Bagenal]] and Eleanor Griffith,   and  sister of [[Henry Bagenal]] and of Mabel, Countess of Tyrone.<ref>Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'', p. 527</ref> They had four sons:\n*Richard, who predeceased his father: He married Elizabeth Stanihust but  had no children;\n*[[Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]], he   was married  three times but had no children;\n*Christopher, who lived mainly in England:  he married Jane Brereton of [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]] (whose sister Dorothy was  his brother Oliver's first wife)  and  had one surviving daughter but no son;\n*[[William FitzWilliam, 3rd Viscount FitzWilliam]], ancestor of  all succeeding Viscounts Fitzwilliam.\n\n==Character==\nHis friend [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]] described him as a man who was  \"in every way faithful to his allegiance\".<ref>Ball, p.13</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fitzwilliam, Thomas Fitzwilliam, 1st Viscount}}\n[[Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland]]\n[[Category:1581 births]]\n[[Category:1650 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:17th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:People from Mount Merrion]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n", "name_user": "Chrisdoyleorwell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFamily", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_FitzWilliam,_1st_Viscount_FitzWilliam"}

It was the 117th annual [[AFL Grand Final|grand final]] of the [[Australian Football League]] (formerly the Victorian Football League),<ref>In 1897 and 1924 there were no grand finals and instead the premier was decided by a finals play-off. In 1948, 1977 and 2010, there were grand final replays after initial draws.</ref> staged to determine the [[List of AFL premiers|premiers]] for the [[2013 AFL season]]. The match, attended by 100,007 spectators, was won by Hawthorn by a margin of 15 points, marking the club's [[List of Australian Football League premiers#AFL premiers (1990-present)|eleventh VFL/AFL premiership victory]]. Hawthorn's [[Brian Lake]] was awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as the best player on the ground.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|2013 AFL season}}\n{{further|2013 AFL finals series|2013 Hawthorn Football Club season|2013 Fremantle Football Club season}}\nHawthorn entered the 2013 season having lost the [[2012 AFL Grand Final|2012 Grand Final]] to {{AFL Syd}}, and for most of the season was seen as the favourites for the premiership.<ref>{{cite news | last = Landsberger | first = Sam | title = Hawthorn opens the 2013 premiership market favourite | newspaper = Herald Sun | date = 2012-09-29 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/hawthorn-opens-the-2013-premiership-market-favourite/story-e6frf9jf-1226484051889 | accessdate = 2014-04-06 }}</ref> After losing to {{AFL Gee}} in Round 1, Hawthorn compiled a 12-match winning streak, until this streak was ended with another loss to Geelong in Round 15. The club's only other loss came against {{AFL Ric}} in Round 19, and it finished with a record of 19&ndash;3 to win the minor premiership for the second consecutive year. They defeated Sydney in the qualifying final by 54 points and earned a week off. They ended an [[Kennett curse|11-match losing streak against Geelong]] (dating back to [[2008 AFL Grand Final|2008]]) to win by five points in the preliminary final. The match was Hawthorn's third grand final appearance in six years.\n\nFremantle entered the 2013 season having come off a semi-final loss to {{AFL Ade}} in the previous year's finals series. After winning their first two matches of the season by 28 points, the Dockers lost back-to-back matches against {{AFL Ess}} and {{AFL Haw}} to be 2&ndash;2 after Round 4 &ndash; this was the only time they lost consecutive matches during the season. Fremantle recorded its largest ever victory when they defeated {{AFL GWS}} in Round 20, then, with a finals berth guaranteed, Ross Lyon rested half of his regular side ahead of its final regular season match against {{AFL Stk}}; the result was a 71-point defeat, which marked the worst defeat in Lyon's coaching career. The team finished third at the end of the home-and-away season, and compiled a club-best record of 16\u20135\u20131. They unexpectedly defeated {{AFL Gee}} in [[Kardinia Park|Geelong]] by 15 points in the first week of the finals (an upset that is still regarded by many as the greatest victory in the team's history), which earnt them a week off and a home preliminary final. Fremantle  defeated the reigning premiers, Sydney, by 25 points in the preliminary final. The match was Fremantle's first grand final in its history.\n\nThe two teams met once during the regular season, in Round 4 at [[York Park|Aurora Stadium]]; Hawthorn won by 42 points.\n\n==Media Coverage==\nThe match was televised by the [[Seven Network]]. The primary match commentary was provided by [[Bruce McAvaney]] and [[Dennis Cometti]].\n\n==Pre-match entertainment==\nTwo Australian bands, [[Birds of Tokyo]] and [[Hunters & Collectors]] performed before the game and at half time, respectively.  The [[Australian national anthem]] was sung by [[Tina Arena]].<ref name=\"Ent\">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-grand-final-2013-entertainment-headlined-by-local-acts-20130902-2sztb.html|title=AFL grand final 2013 entertainment headlined by local acts|date=2 September 2013|first=Patrick |last=Bartley|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\n==Match summary==\n\n===First quarter===\nFremantle won the coin toss and chose to kick towards the City End of the MCG in the first quarter. However, it was Hawthorn who got off to a good start, with [[Jack Gunston]] kicking the first goal before [[Lance Franklin]] kicked the Hawks' second after [[Luke McPharlin]] gave away a [[50-metre penalty]] for stepping over the mark. Hawthorn then had a few chances to extend their margin, however a rushed behind, combined with missed opportunities by [[Shaun Burgoyne]] and [[Isaac Smith (footballer)|Isaac Smith]], had little influence on the scoreboard. Meanwhile, Fremantle were held goalless in the opening quarter with [[Hayden Ballantyne]] and [[Nick Suban]] missing relatively easy shots on goal whilst [[Nathan Fyfe]] missed two shots completely with both going out on the full. At quarter time, the Hawks had a 12 point lead.\n\n===Second quarter===\nHawthorn started off the quarter strongly, taking a stranglehold of the game against the Dockers. [[Jack Gunston]] kicked his second goal on the run from just inside 50 before [[Cyril Rioli]] through his manic forward pressure, got himself on the board after catching [[Lee Spurr]] for holding the ball, taking the Hawks to a massive 24 point lead. Finally at the 12 minute mark, [[Tendai Mzungu]] kicked the Dockers' first goal, before [[Ryan Crowley]] kicked yet another behind for Fremantle. This was quickly followed by [[Jack Gunston]] slotting his third goal after outpositioning Fremantle's [[Zac Dawson]]. The two teams then exchanged behinds with Rioli and [[Brad Sewell]] for Hawthorn and [[Matthew Pavlich]] and [[Nat Fyfe]] for Fremantle all registering minor scores as Hawthorn enjoyed a 23 point lead at half time. Fremantle\u2019s first half score of 1.6 (12) was the lowest in a grand final since [[1960 VFL Grand Final|1960]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-28/afl-grand-final-2013-hawthorn-fremantle-live-blog/4985912?section=sport|title= AFL grand final 2013: Hawthorn v Fremantle as it happened|date=28 September 2013|work=ABC.net|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Third quarter===\nAfter failing to capitalise on their chances in the first half, Fremantle began a comeback in the third quarter. Within a minute, Fremantle captain [[Matthew Pavlich]] kicked his first goal, however this was later cancelled out by a goal to [[Jarryd Roughead]]. This was followed by 3 goals in succession to Femantle with goals to Pavlich, [[Michael Walters]], a massive 55 metre set shot bomb from [[Chris Mayne]] and a behind from [[David Mundy]] to take the Dockers within 3 points of the Hawks. The Hawks tried to respond with a flurry of their own, however missed opportunities to Roughead and [[Cyril Rioli]] only made little difference to the margin. Roughead later managed to kick his second goal after he was pushed in the back, but Fremantle replied as behinds to [[Stephen Hill (Australian footballer)|Stephen Hill]] and [[Michael Barlow]] and Walters kicking his second goal once again allowed them to close within 3 points. Moments later, Hawthorn replied again as [[Jack Gunston]] kicked his fourth goal. Gunston then has another opportunity through a set shot but misses it to the right as the Hawks entered the three-quarter-time break ten points ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/28/hawthorn-fremantle-afl-grand-final-live|title= Hawthorn v Fremantle: AFL grand final \u2013 as it happened|date=28 September 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Final quarter===\nAs much as the majority of the 3rd quarter was dominated by Fremantle, the first half of the fourth quarter was dominated by the Hawks as they booted 3 unanswered goals to take themselves to a match winning 31 point lead. [[Jarryd Roughead]] missed a shot with his snap going wide before [[Isaac Smith (footballer)|Isaac Smith]] slotted a massive goal from a set shot 55 metres out in similar fashion to [[Chris Mayne]]'s goal in the third quarter. Additional goals to [[Luke Breust]] and [[Bradley Hill (footballer)|Bradley Hill]] and behinds from Roughead and [[Lance Franklin]] put the result beyond doubt, stretching their lead to 31 points. During Hawthorn\u2019s period of dominance, [[Brian Lake]], a recently recruited defender from the [[Western Bulldogs]], was instrumental in shutting down Fremantle\u2019s attacks, taking two critical contested marks from opposing kicks, to help his team to victory. Fremantle tried hard to make a final comeback with two late goals to [[Danyle Pearce]] and [[Matthew Pavlich]] to give the Dockers some hope. However, Fremantle\u2019s inability on the day to convert their opportunities was summed up as [[Hayden Ballantyne]] and Pavlich missed two crucial shots on goal, whereas another opportunity was rushed through for a behind. Fremantle then had one last opportunity to get themselves back into the game. With 90 seconds remaining, [[Ryan Crowley]] had a running shot on goal in an open paddock which would\u2019ve bought the Dockers to within 2 kicks of the Hawks, however, he was run down and tackled by [[Ben Stratton]] with the ensuing kick missing to the right. Hawthorn were then able to hold on to win the grand final by 15 points, avenging their grand final loss the previous year.<ref name=\"GF\">[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/09/29/what-we-learnt-from-the-2013-afl-grand-final/ What we learnt from the 2013 AFL Grand Final], ''The Roar'', 29 September 2013</ref>\n\n===Overall report===\n{{wide image|MCG Grand Final panorama.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|A panoramic view of the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the 2013 Grand Final.}}\nHawthorn led the match from start to finish, but were outplayed for significant periods.

Two years later in [[2015 AFL season|2015]], Fremantle won the [[minor premiership]] for finishing on top of the AFL ladder at the end of the home & away season, but they failed to convert that achievement into another grand final appearance, losing to Hawthorn in the Preliminary Final.<ref name=\"GF\"/>\n\n===Norm Smith Medal===\n[[Brian Lake]] took ten marks of which seven were intercept marks to repel the Dockers attack. He took two crucial marks in the final quarter which sealed his Norm Smith Medal win. Lake finished with 12 votes, just edging out teammate [[Jack Gunston]] with 11 votes who was also crucial on the day with his straight kicking, booting 4 goals. [[David Mundy]] polled 4 votes, while [[Luke Hodge]] and [[Nat Fyfe]] polled 2 and 1 votes respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-09-28/live-2013-grand-final|title= 2013 Grand Final as it happened|date=28 September 2013|work=AFL.com|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> He subsequently accepted a four match suspension for deliberately elbowing opponent Michael Walters in the jaw during the third quarter, making him the first Norm Smith Medalist to have committed a reportable offence during a match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-09-30/hawk-heroes-handed-bans|title=Lake, Rioli banned, Suban to Tribunal - AFL.com.au|author=|date=|website=afl.com.au}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Australian rules football kit\n| pattern_b       = _brown_stripes_copia\n| pattern_sh      =  \n| pattern_so      = _hoops_gold\n| body          = FBBF15\n| shorts         = 823F00\n| socks          = 823F00\n | title      = Hawthorn  \n}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit\n | pattern_b  = _3purplev\n | pattern_sh =  _sides_on_white\n | pattern_so =  _3whitehoops\n | body       = ffffff\n | shorts     = 2A1A54 \n | socks      = 2A1A54\n | title      = Fremantle\n}}\n|}\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{{Aussie rules team | title =     {{font color|#4D2004|Hawthorn|link=Hawthorn Football Club}} | color = #FBBF15      \n| backpocket1 = 24 [[Ben Stratton]]\n| fullback = 17 [[Brian Lake]]\n| backpocket2 = 18 [[Brent Guerra]]\n| halfbackflank1 = 9 [[Shaun Burgoyne]]\n| centrehalfback = 6 [[Josh Gibson (footballer)|Josh Gibson]]\n| halfbackflank2 = 14 [[Grant Birchall]]\n| wing1 = 16 [[Isaac Smith (footballer)|Isaac Smith]]\n| centre = 5 [[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]]\n| wing2 = 3 [[Jordan Lewis]]\n| halfforwardflank1 = 22 [[Luke Breust]]\n| centrehalfforward = 23 [[Lance Franklin]]\n| halfforwardflank2 = 33 [[Cyril Rioli]]\n| forwardpocket1 = 28 [[Paul Puopolo]]\n| fullforward = 2 [[Jarryd Roughead]]\n| forwardpocket2 = 20 [[David Hale (footballer)|David Hale]]\n| ruck = 39 [[Max Bailey]]\n| ruckrover = 12 [[Brad Sewell]]\n| rover = 15 [[Luke Hodge]] ([[Captain (Australian rules football)|c]])\n| interchange1 = 26 [[Liam Shiels]]\n| interchange2 = 19 [[Jack Gunston]]\n| interchange3 = 10 [[Bradley Hill (footballer)|Bradley Hill]]\n| interchange4 = 32 [[Jonathan Simpkin]] (sub)\n| interchange5 = \n| interchange6 = \n| coach = [[Alastair Clarkson]]\n}}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{{Aussie rules team | title =     {{font color|#FFFFFF|Fremantle|link=Fremantle Football Club}} | color = #2A1A54     \n| backpocket1 = 41 [[Paul Duffield]]\n| fullback = 3 [[Zac Dawson]]\n| backpocket2 = 37 [[Michael Johnson (Australian rules footballer)|Michael Johnson]]\n| halfbackflank1 = 6 [[Danyle Pearce]]\n| centrehalfback = 18 [[Luke McPharlin]]\n| halfbackflank2 = 34 [[Lee Spurr]]\n| wing1 = 13 [[Tendai Mzungu]]\n| centre = 15 [[Ryan Crowley]]\n| wing2 = 16 [[David Mundy]]\n| halfforwardflank1 = 7 [[Nathan Fyfe]]\n| centrehalfforward = 23 [[Chris Mayne]]\n| halfforwardflank2 = 33 [[Cameron Sutcliffe]]\n| forwardpocket1 = 10 [[Michael Walters]]\n| fullforward = 29 [[Matthew Pavlich]] ([[Captain (Australian rules football)|c]])\n| forwardpocket2 = 30 [[Zac Clarke]]\n| ruck = 31 [[Aaron Sandilands]]\n| ruckrover = 9 [[Matt de Boer]]\n| rover = 32 [[Stephen Hill (Australian footballer)|Stephen Hill]]\n| interchange1 = 1 [[Hayden Ballantyne]]\n| interchange2 = 8 [[Nick Suban]]\n| interchange3 = 21 [[Michael Barlow]]\n| interchange4 = 27 [[Lachie Neale]] (sub)\n| interchange5 = \n| interchange6 = \n| coach = [[Ross Lyon]]\n}}\n|}\n\n;Umpires\nThe umpiring panel for the grand final comprised nine match day umpires and three emergencies.

It was the 117th annual [[AFL Grand Final|grand final]] of the [[Australian Football League]] (formerly the Victorian Football League),<ref>In 1897 and 1924 there were no grand finals and instead the premier was decided by a finals play-off. In 1948, 1977 and 2010, there were grand final replays after initial draws.</ref> staged to determine the [[List of AFL premiers|premiers]] for the [[2013 AFL season]]. The match, attended by 100,007 spectators, was won by Hawthorn by a margin of 15 points, marking the club's [[List of Australian Football League premiers#AFL premiers (1990-present)|eleventh VFL/AFL premiership victory]]. Hawthorn's [[Brian Lake]] was awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as the best player on the ground.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|2013 AFL season}}\n{{further|2013 AFL finals series|2013 Hawthorn Football Club season|2013 Fremantle Football Club season}}\nHawthorn entered the 2013 season having lost the [[2012 AFL Grand Final|2012 Grand Final]] to {{AFL Syd}}, and for most of the season was seen as the favourites for the premiership.<ref>{{cite news | last = Landsberger | first = Sam | title = Hawthorn opens the 2013 premiership market favourite | newspaper = Herald Sun | date = 2012-09-29 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/hawthorn-opens-the-2013-premiership-market-favourite/story-e6frf9jf-1226484051889 | accessdate = 2014-04-06 }}</ref> After losing to {{AFL Gee}} in Round 1, Hawthorn compiled a 12-match winning streak, until this streak was ended with another loss to Geelong in Round 15. The club's only other loss came against {{AFL Ric}} in Round 19, and it finished with a record of 19&ndash;3 to win the minor premiership for the second consecutive year. They defeated Sydney in the qualifying final by 54 points and earned a week off. They ended an [[Kennett curse|11-match losing streak against Geelong]] (dating back to [[2008 AFL Grand Final|2008]]) to win by five points in the preliminary final. The match was Hawthorn's third grand final appearance in six years.\n\nFremantle entered the 2013 season having come off a semi-final loss to {{AFL Ade}} in the previous year's finals series. After winning their first two matches of the season by 28 points, the Dockers lost back-to-back matches against {{AFL Ess}} and {{AFL Haw}} to be 2&ndash;2 after Round 4 &ndash; this was the only time they lost consecutive matches during the season. Fremantle recorded its largest ever victory when they defeated {{AFL GWS}} in Round 20, then, with a finals berth guaranteed, Ross Lyon rested half of his regular side ahead of its final regular season match against {{AFL Stk}}; the result was a 71-point defeat, which marked the worst defeat in Lyon's coaching career. The team finished third at the end of the home-and-away season, and compiled a club-best record of 16\u20135\u20131. They unexpectedly defeated {{AFL Gee}} in [[Kardinia Park|Geelong]] by 15 points in the first week of the finals (an upset that is still regarded by many as the greatest victory in the teams history), which earnt them a week off and a home preliminary final. Fremantle  defeated the reigning premiers, Sydney, by 25 points in the preliminary final. The match was Fremantle's first grand final in its history.\n\nThe two teams met once during the regular season, in Round 4 at [[York Park|Aurora Stadium]]; Hawthorn won by 42 points.\n\n==Media Coverage==\nThe match was televised by the [[Seven Network]]. The primary match commentary was provided by [[Bruce McAvaney]] and [[Dennis Cometti]].\n\n==Pre-match entertainment==\nTwo Australian bands, [[Birds of Tokyo]] and [[Hunters & Collectors]] performed before the game and at half time, respectively.  The [[Australian national anthem]] was sung by [[Tina Arena]].<ref name=\"Ent\">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-grand-final-2013-entertainment-headlined-by-local-acts-20130902-2sztb.html|title=AFL grand final 2013 entertainment headlined by local acts|date=2 September 2013|first=Patrick |last=Bartley|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\n==Match summary==\n\n===First quarter===\nFremantle won the coin toss and chose to kick towards the City End of the MCG in the first quarter. However, it was Hawthorn who got off to a good start, with [[Jack Gunston]] kicking the first goal before [[Lance Franklin]] kicked the Hawks' second after [[Luke McPharlin]] gave away a [[50-metre penalty]] for stepping over the mark. Hawthorn then had a few chances to extend their margin, however a rushed behind, combined with missed opportunities by [[Shaun Burgoyne]] and [[Isaac Smith (footballer)|Isaac Smith]], had little influence on the scoreboard. Meanwhile, Fremantle were held goalless in the opening quarter with [[Hayden Ballantyne]] and [[Nick Suban]] missing relatively easy shots on goal whilst [[Nathan Fyfe]] missed two shots completely with both going out on the full. At quarter time, the Hawks had a 12 point lead.\n\n===Second quarter===\nHawthorn started off the quarter strongly, taking a stranglehold of the game against the Dockers. [[Jack Gunston]] kicked his second goal on the run from just inside 50 before [[Cyril Rioli]] through his manic forward pressure, got himself on the board after catching [[Lee Spurr]] for holding the ball, taking the Hawks to a massive 24 point lead. Finally at the 12 minute mark, [[Tendai Mzungu]] kicked the Dockers' first goal, before [[Ryan Crowley]] kicked yet another behind for Fremantle. This was quickly followed by [[Jack Gunston]] slotting his third goal after outpositioning Fremantle's [[Zac Dawson]]. The two teams then exchanged behinds with Rioli and [[Brad Sewell]] for Hawthorn and [[Matthew Pavlich]] and [[Nat Fyfe]] for Fremantle all registering minor scores as Hawthorn enjoyed a 23 point lead at half time. Fremantle\u2019s first half score of 1.6 (12) was the lowest in a grand final since [[1960 VFL Grand Final|1960]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-28/afl-grand-final-2013-hawthorn-fremantle-live-blog/4985912?section=sport|title= AFL grand final 2013: Hawthorn v Fremantle as it happened|date=28 September 2013|work=ABC.net|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Third quarter===\nAfter failing to capitalise on their chances in the first half, Fremantle began a comeback in the third quarter. Within a minute, Fremantle captain [[Matthew Pavlich]] kicked his first goal, however this was later cancelled out by a goal to [[Jarryd Roughead]]. This was followed by 3 goals in succession to Femantle with goals to Pavlich, [[Michael Walters]], a massive 55 metre set shot bomb from [[Chris Mayne]] and a behind from [[David Mundy]] to take the Dockers within 3 points of the Hawks. The Hawks tried to respond with a flurry of their own, however missed opportunities to Roughead and [[Cyril Rioli]] only made little difference to the margin. Roughead later managed to kick his second goal after he was pushed in the back, but Fremantle replied as behinds to [[Stephen Hill (Australian footballer)|Stephen Hill]] and [[Michael Barlow]] and Walters kicking his second goal once again allowed them to close within 3 points. Moments later, Hawthorn replied again as [[Jack Gunston]] kicked his fourth goal. Gunston then has another opportunity through a set shot but misses it to the right as the Hawks entered the three-quarter-time break ten points ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/28/hawthorn-fremantle-afl-grand-final-live|title= Hawthorn v Fremantle: AFL grand final \u2013 as it happened|date=28 September 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Final quarter===\nAs much as the majority of the 3rd quarter was dominated by Fremantle, the first half of the fourth quarter was dominated by the Hawks as they booted 3 unanswered goals to take themselves to a match winning 31 point lead. [[Jarryd Roughead]] missed a shot with his snap going wide before [[Isaac Smith (footballer)|Isaac Smith]] slotted a massive goal from a set shot 55 metres out in similar fashion to [[Chris Mayne]]\u2019s goal in the third quarter. Additional goals to [[Luke Breust]] and [[Bradley Hill (footballer)|Bradley Hill]] and behinds from Roughead and [[Lance Franklin]] put the result beyond doubt, stretching their lead to 31 points. During Hawthorn\u2019s period of dominance, [[Brian Lake]], a recently recruited defender from the [[Western Bulldogs]], was instrumental in shutting down Fremantle\u2019s attacks, taking two critical contested marks from opposing kicks, to help his team to victory. Fremantle tried hard to make a final comeback with two late goals to [[Danyle Pearce]] and [[Matthew Pavlich]] to give the Dockers some hope. However, Fremantle\u2019s inability on the day to convert their opportunities was summed up as [[Hayden Ballantyne]] and Pavlich missed two crucial shots on goal, whereas another opportunity was rushed through for a behind. Fremantle then had one last opportunity to get themselves back into the game. With 90 seconds remaining, [[Ryan Crowley]] had a running shot on goal in an open paddock which would\u2019ve bought the Dockers to within 2 kicks of the Hawks, however, he was run down and tackled by [[Ben Stratton]] with the ensuing kick missing to the right. Hawthorn were then able to hold on to win the grand final by 15 points, avenging their grand final loss the previous year.<ref name=\"GF\">[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/09/29/what-we-learnt-from-the-2013-afl-grand-final/ What we learnt from the 2013 AFL Grand Final], ''The Roar'', 29 September 2013</ref>\n\n===Overall report===\n{{wide image|MCG Grand Final panorama.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|A panoramic view of the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the 2013 Grand Final.}}\nHawthorn led the match from start to finish, but were outplayed for significant periods.

He took two crucial marks in the final quarter which sealed his Norm Smith Medal win. Lake finished with 12 votes, just edging out teammate [[Jack Gunston]] with 11 votes who was also crucial on the day with his straight kicking, booting 4 goals. [[David Mundy]] polled 4 votes, while [[Luke Hodge]] and [[Nat Fyfe]] polled 2 and 1 votes respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-09-28/live-2013-grand-final|title= 2013 Grand Final as it happened|date=28 September 2013|work=AFL.com|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> He subsequently accepted a four match suspension for deliberately elbowing opponent Michael Walters in the jaw during the third quarter, making him the first Norm Smith Medalist to have committed a reportable offence during a match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-09-30/hawk-heroes-handed-bans|title=Lake, Rioli banned, Suban to Tribunal - AFL.com.au|author=|date=|website=afl.com.au}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Australian rules football kit\n| pattern_b       = _brown_stripes_copia\n| pattern_sh      =  \n| pattern_so      = _hoops_gold\n| body          = FBBF15\n| shorts         = 823F00\n| socks          = 823F00\n | title      = Hawthorn  \n}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit\n | pattern_b  = _3purplev\n | pattern_sh =  _sides_on_white\n | pattern_so =  _3whitehoops\n | body       = ffffff\n | shorts     = 2A1A54 \n | socks      = 2A1A54\n | title      = Fremantle\n}}\n|}\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{{Aussie rules team | title =     {{font color|#4D2004|Hawthorn|link=Hawthorn Football Club}} | color = #FBBF15      \n| backpocket1 = 24 [[Ben Stratton]]\n| fullback = 17 [[Brian Lake]]\n| backpocket2 = 18 [[Brent Guerra]]\n| halfbackflank1 = 9 [[Shaun Burgoyne]]\n| centrehalfback = 6 [[Josh Gibson (footballer)|Josh Gibson]]\n| halfbackflank2 = 14 [[Grant Birchall]]\n| wing1 = 16 [[Isaac Smith (footballer)|Isaac Smith]]\n| centre = 5 [[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]]\n| wing2 = 3 [[Jordan Lewis]]\n| halfforwardflank1 = 22 [[Luke Breust]]\n| centrehalfforward = 23 [[Lance Franklin]]\n| halfforwardflank2 = 33 [[Cyril Rioli]]\n| forwardpocket1 = 28 [[Paul Puopolo]]\n| fullforward = 2 [[Jarryd Roughead]]\n| forwardpocket2 = 20 [[David Hale (footballer)|David Hale]]\n| ruck = 39 [[Max Bailey]]\n| ruckrover = 12 [[Brad Sewell]]\n| rover = 15 [[Luke Hodge]] ([[Captain (Australian rules football)|c]])\n| interchange1 = 26 [[Liam Shiels]]\n| interchange2 = 19 [[Jack Gunston]]\n| interchange3 = 10 [[Bradley Hill (footballer)|Bradley Hill]]\n| interchange4 = 32 [[Jonathan Simpkin]] (sub)\n| interchange5 = \n| interchange6 = \n| coach = [[Alastair Clarkson]]\n}}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{{Aussie rules team | title =     {{font color|#FFFFFF|Fremantle|link=Fremantle Football Club}} | color = #2A1A54     \n| backpocket1 = 41 [[Paul Duffield]]\n| fullback = 3 [[Zac Dawson]]\n| backpocket2 = 37 [[Michael Johnson (Australian rules footballer)|Michael Johnson]]\n| halfbackflank1 = 6 [[Danyle Pearce]]\n| centrehalfback = 18 [[Luke McPharlin]]\n| halfbackflank2 = 34 [[Lee Spurr]]\n| wing1 = 13 [[Tendai Mzungu]]\n| centre = 15 [[Ryan Crowley]]\n| wing2 = 16 [[David Mundy]]\n| halfforwardflank1 = 7 [[Nathan Fyfe]]\n| centrehalfforward = 23 [[Chris Mayne]]\n| halfforwardflank2 = 33 [[Cameron Sutcliffe]]\n| forwardpocket1 = 10 [[Michael Walters]]\n| fullforward = 29 [[Matthew Pavlich]] ([[Captain (Australian rules football)|c]])\n| forwardpocket2 = 30 [[Zac Clarke]]\n| ruck = 31 [[Aaron Sandilands]]\n| ruckrover = 9 [[Matt de Boer]]\n| rover = 32 [[Stephen Hill (Australian footballer)|Stephen Hill]]\n| interchange1 = 1 [[Hayden Ballantyne]]\n| interchange2 = 8 [[Nick Suban]]\n| interchange3 = 21 [[Michael Barlow]]\n| interchange4 = 27 [[Lachie Neale]] (sub)\n| interchange5 = \n| interchange6 = \n| coach = [[Ross Lyon]]\n}}\n|}\n\n;Umpires\nThe umpiring panel for the grand final comprised nine match day umpires and three emergencies.
