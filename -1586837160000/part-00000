After [[Universal Studios]] acquired the rights to remake ''La Jet\u00e9e'' as a full-length film, [[David Peoples|David]] and [[Janet Peoples]] were hired to write the script.\n\nUnder Gilliam's direction, Universal granted the filmmakers a $29.5 million budget, and filming lasted from February to May 1995. The film was shot mostly in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]], where the story was set.\n\nThe film was released to critical praise and grossed $168 million worldwide. Pitt was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] for his performance. The film also won and was nominated for various categories at the [[Saturn Award]]s.\n\n== Plot ==\nI very bad zoo keeper lets twelve monkeys out on to the zoo and they kill all the tourists and the zoo goes bankrupt.

Kosberg persuaded the film's director, [[Chris Marker]], to let him [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] the project to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], seeing it as a perfect basis for a full-length science fiction film. Universal reluctantly agreed to purchase the [[film rights|remake rights]] and hired [[David Peoples|David]] and [[Janet Peoples]] to write the screenplay.<ref>{{cite news |author=Chris Nashawaty |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1219922_1,00.html |title=They Call Him Mr. Pitch |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=July 28, 2006 |accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref> Producer [[Charles Roven]] chose [[Terry Gilliam]] to direct, because he believed the filmmaker's style was perfect for ''12 Monkeys''{{'}} nonlinear storyline and time travel subplot.<ref name=\"note\" /> Gilliam had just abandoned a [[film adaptation]] of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' when he signed to direct ''12 Monkeys''.<ref name=\"first\">{{cite book |author=Ian Christie; [[Terry Gilliam]] |title=Gilliam on Gilliam |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gilliamongilliam0000gill/page/220 220\u2013225] |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |month= |year=1999 |isbn=0-571-20280-2 |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/gilliamongilliam0000gill/page/220 }}</ref> The film also represents the second film for which Gilliam did not write or co-write the screenplay. Although he prefers to direct his own scripts, he was captivated by Peoples' \"intriguing and intelligent script. The story is disconcerting.

Universal's production of ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995) had resulted in various [[cost overrun]]s. To get ''12 Monkeys'' approved for production, Gilliam persuaded Willis to lower his normal [[asking price]].<ref name=\"second\">Christie, Gilliam, pp.226\u2013230</ref> Because of Universal's strict production incentives and his history with the studio on ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Gilliam received [[final cut privilege]].

By the time of ''12 Monkeys''{{'}} release, ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994), ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' (1994), and ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'' (1995) had been released, making Pitt an [[A-list]] actor, which drew greater attention to the film and boosted its box-office standing.

There were also technical glitches with the futuristic mechanical props. Because the film has a nonlinear storyline, continuity errors occurred, and some scenes had to be reshot. Gilliam also injured himself when he went horseback riding. Despite setbacks, the director managed to stay within the budget and was only a week behind his [[shooting schedule]]. \"It was a tough shoot\", acknowledged Jeffrey Beecroft (''[[Mr. Brooks]]'', ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''), the [[production designer]]. \"There wasn't a lot of money or enough time.

Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a \"nightmarish intervention of technology. You try to see the faces on the screens in front of you, but the real faces and voices are down there and you have these tiny voices in your ear.

The film is also intended to be a study of people's declining ability to communicate in modern civilization due to the interference of technology.<ref name=\"comment\" />\n\n=== Allusions to other films and media ===\n''12 Monkeys'' is inspired by the French short film ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]'' (1962); as in ''La Jet\u00e9e'', characters are haunted by the images of their own deaths.<ref name=\"third\" /> Like ''La Jet\u00e9e'', ''12 Monkeys'' contains references to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958). Toward the end of the film, Cole and Railly hide in a theater showing a 24-hour Hitchcock marathon and watch a scene from ''Vertigo''. Railly then transforms herself with a blonde wig, as Judy ([[Kim Novak]]) transforms herself into blonde Madeleine in ''Vertigo''; Cole sees her emerge within a red light, as Scottie ([[James Stewart]]) saw Judy emerge within a green light.<ref name=\"third\" /> Brief notes of [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s film score can also be heard. Railly also wears the same coat Novak wore in the first part of ''Vertigo''. The scene at [[Muir Woods National Monument]], where Judy (as Madeleine) looks at the growth rings of a felled redwood and traces back events in her past life, resonates with larger themes in ''12 Monkeys''. Cole and Railly later have a similar conversation while the same music from ''Vertigo'' is repeated.<ref name=\"third\" /> The Muir Woods scene in ''Vertigo'' is also reenacted in ''La Jet\u00e9e''. In a previous scene in the film, Cole wakes up in a hospital bed with the scientists talking to him in chorus. This is a direct homage to the \"[[Dem Bones|Dry Bones]]\" scene in [[Dennis Potter]]'s ''[[The Singing Detective]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=SALON Reviews:12 Monkeys |url=http://www.salon.com/05/reviews/monkey2.html |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050531001122/http://www.salon.com/05/reviews/monkey2.html |archivedate=2005-05-31 |accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref>\n\nJames Cole is a notable [[Christ figure]] in film.<ref name=\"Kozlovic\">{{cite web| first=Anton Karl| last=Kozlovic| url=https://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art8-cinematicchrist.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223221011/http://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art8-cinematicchrist.html| archivedate=2005-02-23| title=The Structural Characteristics of the Cinematic Christ-figure| work=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture| accessdate=2016-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Roman Catholicism in Fantastic Film|chapter=Blasphemy in the Name of Fantasy: The Films of Terry Gilliam in a Catholic Context|author=Christopher McKittrick|editor=Regina Hansen|publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]]|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7864-8724-0|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> The film is significant in the genre of science-fiction film noir, and it alludes to various \"canonical noir\" films.<ref>{{citation|title=Transgressing Women: Investigating Space and the Body in Contemporary Noir Thrillers|date=January 2005|publisher=Lancaster University|author=Jamaluddin Bin Aziz|section=Future Noir}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Box office ===\n''12 Monkeys'' was given a [[limited release]] in the United States on December 29, 1995.

After [[Universal Studios]] acquired the rights to remake ''La Jet\u00e9e'' as a full-length film, [[David Peoples|David]] and [[Janet Peoples]] were hired to write the script.\n\nUnder Gilliam's direction, Universal granted the filmmakers a $29.5 million budget, and filming lasted from February to May 1995. The film was shot mostly in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]], where the story was set.\n\nThe film was released to critical praise and grossed $168 million worldwide. Pitt was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] for his performance. The film also won and was nominated for various categories at the [[Saturn Award]]s.\n\n== Plot ==\nA deadly virus, released in the year 1996, wipes out almost all of humanity; forcing survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus. \n\nIn 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of [[Philadelphia]]. Cole is selected to be trained and sent back in time to find the original virus, in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport.\n\nCole arrives in [[Baltimore]], 1990, not 1996 as planned and is arrested, then hospitalized at a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[anti-corporatism|anti-corporatist]] views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors where he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened and that nobody can change it.\n\nAfter an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell but disappears moments later; waking up back in 2035. Cole is interrogated by the scientists who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. Cole accidentally arrives at a battlefield during [[World War I]], is shot in the leg and then suddenly transported to 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the [[Cassandra metaphor|Cassandra complex]] to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Railly meets Dr. Peters who tells her that apocalypse alarmists represent the sane vision while [[Human impact on the environment|humanity's gradual destruction of the environment]] is the real lunacy. \n\nCole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys before they set out in search of him. When they confront Goines, he denies any involvement with the group and says that, in 1990, Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines' virologist father.\n\nAbout to be apprehended by police, Cole is transported back to 2035 where he reaffirms to the scientists his commitment to his mission. But when he finds Railly again in 1996, he tells her he now believes himself crazy as she had suggested all along. Railly, meanwhile, has discovered evidence of his time travel, which she shows him; believing he is insane. They decide to depart for the [[Florida Keys]] before the onset of the plague. \n\nOn their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' father in an animal cage. At the airport, Cole leaves a last message telling the scientists that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys they are on the wrong track, and that he will not return. Cole is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. \n\nAt the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.\n\nCole forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters. After drawing the gun he was given, Cole is fatally shot by police. As Cole lies dying in Railly's arms, Railly suddenly begins to scan the crowd around her; seemingly looking for something she knows must be there. Railly finally makes eye contact with a small boy\u2014the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his own death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Peters, safely aboard the plane with the virus, sits down next to Jones, one of the scientists from the future, who comments that her job is \u201cinsurance.\u201d\n<!-- Do not add further details or interpretation here \u2013 the ending is clearly left ambiguous. -->\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as James Cole\n** Joseph Melito as young James Cole\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Kathryn Railly\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Jeffrey Goines\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Dr. Leland Goines\n* [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Dr. Peters\n* [[Jon Seda]] as Jose\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Lt.

Kosberg persuaded the film's director, [[Chris Marker]], to let him [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] the project to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], seeing it as a perfect basis for a full-length science fiction film. Universal reluctantly agreed to purchase the [[film rights|remake rights]] and hired [[David Peoples|David]] and [[Janet Peoples]] to write the screenplay.<ref>{{cite news |author=Chris Nashawaty |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1219922_1,00.html |title=They Call Him Mr. Pitch |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=July 28, 2006 |accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref> Producer [[Charles Roven]] chose [[Terry Gilliam]] to direct, because he believed the filmmaker's style was perfect for ''12 Monkeys''{{'}} nonlinear storyline and time travel subplot.<ref name=\"note\" /> Gilliam had just abandoned a [[film adaptation]] of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' when he signed to direct ''12 Monkeys''.<ref name=\"first\">{{cite book |author=Ian Christie; [[Terry Gilliam]] |title=Gilliam on Gilliam |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gilliamongilliam0000gill/page/220 220\u2013225] |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |month= |year=1999 |isbn=0-571-20280-2 |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/gilliamongilliam0000gill/page/220 }}</ref> The film also represents the second film for which Gilliam did not write or co-write the screenplay. Although he prefers to direct his own scripts, he was captivated by Peoples' \"intriguing and intelligent script. The story is disconcerting.

It is a study of madness and dreams, of death and re-birth, set in a world coming apart.\"<ref name=\"note\">DVD production notes</ref>\n\nUniversal took longer than expected to approve ''12 Monkeys'', although Gilliam had two stars (Willis and Pitt) and a firm budget of $29.5 million (low for a Hollywood science fiction film). Universal's production of ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995) had resulted in various [[cost overrun]]s. To get ''12 Monkeys'' approved for production, Gilliam persuaded Willis to lower his normal [[asking price]].<ref name=\"second\">Christie, Gilliam, pp.226\u2013230</ref> Because of Universal's strict production incentives and his history with the studio on ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Gilliam received [[final cut privilege]].

Examples of false memories include Cole's recollection of the airport shooting, altered each time he has the dream, and a \"mentally divergent\" man at the asylum who has false memories.<ref name=\"comment2\">[[Chris Marker|Terry Gilliam]], [[short film|Charles Roven]], DVD ''audio commentary'', 1998, [[La Jet\u00e9e|Universal Home Video]].</ref>\n\nReferences to time, time travel, and monkeys are scattered throughout the film, including the [[Woody Woodpecker]] cartoon \"Time Tunnel\" playing on the TV in a hotel room, the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'' (1931) on TV in the asylum, and the subplots involving monkeys (drug testing, news stories and animal rights). The film is also intended to be a study of people's declining ability to communicate in modern civilization due to the interference of technology.<ref name=\"comment\" />\n\n=== Allusions to other films and media ===\n''12 Monkeys'' is inspired by the French short film ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]'' (1962); as in ''La Jet\u00e9e'', characters are haunted by the images of their own deaths.<ref name=\"third\" /> Like ''La Jet\u00e9e'', ''12 Monkeys'' contains references to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958). Toward the end of the film, Cole and Railly hide in a theater showing a 24-hour Hitchcock marathon and watch a scene from ''Vertigo''. Railly then transforms herself with a blonde wig, as Judy ([[Kim Novak]]) transforms herself into blonde Madeleine in ''Vertigo''; Cole sees her emerge within a red light, as Scottie ([[James Stewart]]) saw Judy emerge within a green light.<ref name=\"third\" /> Brief notes of [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s film score can also be heard. Railly also wears the same coat Novak wore in the first part of ''Vertigo''. The scene at [[Muir Woods National Monument]], where Judy (as Madeleine) looks at the growth rings of a felled redwood and traces back events in her past life, resonates with larger themes in ''12 Monkeys''. Cole and Railly later have a similar conversation while the same music from ''Vertigo'' is repeated.<ref name=\"third\" /> The Muir Woods scene in ''Vertigo'' is also reenacted in ''La Jet\u00e9e''. In a previous scene in the film, Cole wakes up in a hospital bed with the scientists talking to him in chorus. This is a direct homage to the \"[[Dem Bones|Dry Bones]]\" scene in [[Dennis Potter]]'s ''[[The Singing Detective]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=SALON Reviews:12 Monkeys |url=http://www.salon.com/05/reviews/monkey2.html |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050531001122/http://www.salon.com/05/reviews/monkey2.html |archivedate=2005-05-31 |accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref>\n\nJames Cole is a notable [[Christ figure]] in film.<ref name=\"Kozlovic\">{{cite web| first=Anton Karl| last=Kozlovic| url=https://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art8-cinematicchrist.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223221011/http://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art8-cinematicchrist.html| archivedate=2005-02-23| title=The Structural Characteristics of the Cinematic Christ-figure| work=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture| accessdate=2016-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Roman Catholicism in Fantastic Film|chapter=Blasphemy in the Name of Fantasy: The Films of Terry Gilliam in a Catholic Context|author=Christopher McKittrick|editor=Regina Hansen|publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]]|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7864-8724-0|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> The film is significant in the genre of science-fiction film noir, and it alludes to various \"canonical noir\" films.<ref>{{citation|title=Transgressing Women: Investigating Space and the Body in Contemporary Noir Thrillers|date=January 2005|publisher=Lancaster University|author=Jamaluddin Bin Aziz|section=Future Noir}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Box office ===\n''12 Monkeys'' was given a [[limited release]] in the United States on December 29, 1995.

Barne's father had established himself as co-proprietor of the Borough and controlled one seat; on his father's death in 1777, Barne's eldest brother declined to fill the vacancy and so Barne accepted the offer, hoping to obtain, by voting with the administration, a paid office. He was eventually offered a post, as a Commissioner of Taxes, and, on accepting it, resigned his seat in 1791.\n\n==Early life and legal career==\n\nBarne was born on 25 August 1754, the second son of [[Miles Barne (politician born 1718)|Miles Barne]] of [[Sotterley]], a Member of Parliament for Dunwich, and his second wife, Mary Thornhill, daughter of George Thornhill of [[Diddington]], Huntingdonshire.<ref>Stokes (1986a) ; Burke (1833), p. 141</ref>\n\nHe was educated at [[Westminster School]] in 1768 and then admitted at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], in 1772, matriculating that year and becoming a scholar in 1773. He received an LL.B. in 1780 and was a fellow of Trinity Hall from 1781 to 1814. Prior to his education, he was admitted at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1770 and then called to the Bar later, in 1779. A Bencher in 1811 and Reader 1820, he was the Treasurer from 1820 to 1821.<ref>Venn (1940), p. 160</ref>\n\n==Member of Parliament==\n\nDunwich was a Parliamentary constituency in Suffolk, which had largely fallen into the sea and had a dwindling population by the late eighteenth century; it was home to roughly 40 voters.<ref>Stokes (1986b)</ref> Thus, the two seats belonging to the Borough were essentially controlled by local land-lords; by 1764, it was in the hands of the Barne and Vanneck families, who were co-proprietors of the parish.<ref>Stokes (1986b)</ref> Barne Barne, having begun his training as a barrister, was therefore returned for Dunwich \"on the family interest\" in 1777, when his father resigned, due to his declining health and advanced age, and his eldest brother, [[Miles Barne (politician born 1746)|Miles Barne]] declined the seat.<ref>Stokes (1986a)</ref>\n\nAs a Member, Barne tended to vote with the administration, hoping to secure himself a commission of some kind; he is not known to have spoken in debate. In 1788, he petitioned Pitt for this, and supported him silently in the hope of a reward. Having been returned again in 1790, Barne was offered the position of a Commissioner of Taxes in 1791 and resigned from the House.<ref>Stokes (1986a) ; Drummond (1964)</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nHe appears to have developed a reputation for aggressively working in his family's favour in Dunwich, in his attempt to further their interest there. He offered his resignation from the Tax office in 1818 and it was accepted in 1820.<ref>Stokes (1986a)</ref>\n\nHe died, unmarried, on 19 June 1828.<ref>Stokes (1986a) ; [https://books.google.com/books?id=a6lJAAAAYAAJ&dq=Barne+Gentleman%27s+Magazine&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Gentleman's Magazine''] (1828, pt. i), p. 648</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n* Burke, J.

Barne's father had established himself as co-proprietor of the Borough and controlled one seat; on his father's death in 1777, Barne's eldest brother declined to fill the vacancy and so Barne accepted the offer, hoping to obtain, by voting with the administration, a paid office. He was eventually offered a post, as a Commissioner of Taxes, and, on accepting it, resigned his seat in 1791.\n\n==Early life and legal career==\n\nBarne was born on 25 August 1754, the second son of [[Miles Barne (politician born 1718)|Miles Barne]] of [[Sotterley]], a Member of Parliament for Dunwich, and his second wife, Mary Thornhill, daughter of George Thornhill of [[Diddington]], Huntingdonshire.<ref>Stokes (1986a) ; Burke (1833), p. 141</ref>\n\nHe was educated at [[Westminster School]] in 1768 and then admitted at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], in 1772, matriculating that year and becoming a scholar in 1773. He received an LL.B. in 1780 and was a fellow of Trinity Hall from 1781 to 1814. Prior to his education, he was admitted at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1770 and then called to the Bar later, in 1779. A Bencher in 1811 and Reader 1820, he was the Treasurer from 1820 to 1821.<ref>Venn (1940), p. 160</ref>\n\n==Member of Parliament==\n\nDunwich was a Parliamentary constituency in Suffolk, which had largely fallen into the sea and had a dwindling population by the late eighteenth century; it was home to roughly 40 voters.<ref>Stokes (1986b)</ref> Thus, the two seats belonging to the Borough were essentially controlled by local land-lords; by 1764, it was in the hands of the Barne and Vanneck families, who were co-proprietors of the parish.<ref>Stokes (1986b)</ref> Barne Barne, having begun his training as a barrister, was therefore returned for Dunwich \"on the family interest\" in 1777, when his father resigned, due to his declining health and advanced age, and his eldest brother, [[Miles Barne (politician born 1746)|Miles Barne]] declined the seat.<ref>Stokes (1986a)</ref>\n\nAs a Member, Barne tended to vote with the administration, hoping to secure himself a commission of some kind; he is not known to have spoken in debate. In 1788, he petitioned Pitt for this, and supported him silently in the hope of a reward. Having been returned again in 1790, Barne was offered the position of a Commissioner of Taxes in 1791 and resigned from the House.<ref>Stokes (1986a) ; Drummond (1964)</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nHe appears to have developed a reputation for aggressively working in his family\u2019s favour in Dunwich, in his attempt to further their interest there. He offered his resignation from the Tax office in 1818 and it was accepted in 1820.<ref>Stokes (1986a)</ref>\n\nHe died, unmarried, on 19 June 1828.<ref>Stokes (1986a) ; [https://books.google.com/books?id=a6lJAAAAYAAJ&dq=Barne+Gentleman%27s+Magazine&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Gentleman's Magazine''] (1828, pt. i), p. 648</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n* Burke, J.
