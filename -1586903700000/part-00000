Growing up in Europe give Barth a different cultural perspective. Her memory of West Berlin is \"dark and austere\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63658187|title=Pressplay : contemporary artists in conversation.|date=2005|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-4533-7|location=London|oclc=63658187}}</ref> and she left for the States before the Berlin wall was taken down in 1989. During early adolescence her father began a research project in the States at Stanford University and she moved to the US shortly after. Barth was 12 years old and did not know English when she arrived in the States. The shift from cold-war Germany to 1970s California was a culture shock for Barth.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nLater, Barth\u2019s received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of California, Davis]] in 1982 and a Master of Fine Arts from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1985. From 1990 to 2008, she was a professor in the Art Department at the University of California, Riverside, until she was given the honorary title of Professor Emeritus in the Department of Art in 2008 to the present. She was also a visiting Graduate Faculty member at the [[ArtCenter College of Design|Art Center College of Design]], Pasadena, California from 2000-2012 and has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. After receiving the MacArthur Fellowship in October 2012, she noted that she still plans to teach on a part-time basis because teaching forces her to \"put language to\" what she is thinking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/9173|title=Art Professor Wins MacArthur Fellowship|last=October 1|first=Bettye Miller on|last2=2012|website=UCR Today|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> \n\n<br />\n\n== Work ==\n\n=== Early Work: Late 1980s & Early 1990s ===\nIn 1989 Barth\u2019s work was black and white, multi-paneled photographic and painted images mounted on wood that addressed the psychodynamics of vision, using optic patterns, repetitious visual metaphors for the eye, and diagrams related to light and human vision.<ref name=\":0\" /> The multi-panel work set up formal relationships that would continue through Barth\u2019s artistic practice in later works. Barth explains that this early work was about \u201cthe confrontation with the camera, in the feeling of being looked at, blasted with light, being blinded, all as a physical experience.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1990, Barth continued to explore optic patterns and illusions in her works ''Untitled #11-14''. This work includes four small photographs of houses that are encompassed in large fields of black and white strips, similar to that of static on a television screen and creates an optic vibration. The work intersects with the themes of photographic vision and the idea of the \u2018gaze.\u2019<ref name=\":0\" /><br />\n\n=== Mid 1990s ===\nBarth\u2019s work began to internalize the space between the viewer and the object in the mid 1990s, zooming in and zooming out, looking close and far away in her works like ''Untitled #13'' (1991) and ''Untitled #16'' (1990). \u00a0She begins playing with the communication of space with in the work through landscape and abstracted text, and plays with the idea of how the perception of the works occurs within the human body viewing it. Pamela Lee says, \u201cthe self-consciousness of looking is grounded in subjective looking\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> in Barth\u2019s work. In ''Untitled #13'', Barth includes a photograph of a landscape whose details are blurred to slow down the immediate understanding of the image by the audience. This effect describes the instability of one\u2019s visual field of vision, and becomes the basis for Barth\u2019s next series of works ''Grounds''.<br />\n\n=== ''Grounds'' (1992-1995) ===\nThis body of photographs consists of over 50 images in different sizes and scales. These photos defy the conventional flat photographic image by being laminated prints that are then mounted on wood boards multiple inches thick, projecting the print away from the wall. As a result, the images of ''Grounds'' impersonate an object instead of a print. This plays into Barth\u2019s conceptual ideas for the body of work, referring to these photographs as \u00a0\u201ccontainers of information.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer [https://darrencampion.com Darren Campion] says,\u201cBarth\u2019s work addresses that fundamental dissonance between the world as it is and the world as we see it, the chasms of perceived experience. This is extended to other areas of the photographic process as well \u2013 the main correlate of space being, of course, time, and its fluidity, which seems antithetical to our notion of what photography does.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theincoherentlight.com/2012/12/uta-barth-density-of-light.html|title=Uta Barth: The Density of Light|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>  Barth made the images by photographing generic locations outdoors as if she was shooting a formal portrait but removed the subject of the portrait in focus and left the out-of-focus background behind. Barth\u2019s gesture reverses the typical use of the camera, shooting something out of focus instead of something in-focus. As a result, she photographs unoccupied space. Barth was thinking about stock photography while making this body of work, picturing backdrops for family photos and portrait photography from the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\":0\" /> <br />\n\n=== ''Fields'' (1995-1996) ===\nIn 1995 Barth began transitioning from her ''Grounds'' series into a new body of work known as ''Fields''. She took her photographic approach in ''Grounds'' and turned it on its side, thinking about the site-specific relationship between the photograph and the physical space where it was made. This idea introduces motion into the work. Visual movement across the images in ''Fields'' creates a blur that is similar to that found in film and cinematic work. ''Fields'' produces the \u201cillusion of filmic space and time\" and Barth has said that she created this body of work in a similar way film producers scout locations for the perfect place to shoot a scene in a film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn relation to her ''Field'' and ''Ground'' series, which depict blurred and empty foregrounds, Barth has stated: \"I am interested in the conventions of picture-making, in the desire to picture the world and in our relationship, our continual love for and fascination with pictures.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barth|first=Uta|title=Uta Barth: in between places|last2=Conkelton|first2=Sheryl|last3=Ferguson|first3=Russell|last4=Martin|first4=Timothy|last5=Henry Art Gallery|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington|isbn=0935558373|location=Seattle, Wash.|language=English|oclc=45567870}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n=== Late 1990s ===\nIn 1998 Barth begins another series of ''Untitled'' works, including ''Untitled (98.4)'' and ''Untitled (98.6)''. Here, Barth begins to focus on sequencing in the gallery again, grouping images together in diptychs, triptychs and clusters. The work plays on the idea of multiple points of view or the experience of a visual double-take where a detail catches the viewer long enough to take a second image, a second look.<ref name=\":0\" /> To make this work, Barth would shoot multiple photographs in a row so that she could go back and edit the series of images to find the best photographs to pair together. This act re-introduces the notion of time into Barth\u2019s work. She begins spacing her panels of images on the wall in intervals to show gaps in time between shooting the photographs.\n<br />\n\n=== Early 2000s ===\nBarth creates two of her most famous bodies of work during the same time period, ''nowhere near'' (1999) and ''\u2026and of time'' (2000). Here, Barth interrogates the temporality of photography and the duration of vision. In ''nowhere near'' the camera records a repeated view out of Barth\u2019s living room window over multiple months.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/editorial-artsy-asks-gregory-crewdson-uta-barth-and|title=Artsy Asks Gregory Crewdson, Uta Barth, and Yuki Onodera All About the Window|date=2013-09-30|website=Artsy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> She made hundreds of images that contain moments of framing, records the ebb and flow of light and captures the change of the seasons. This body of work deals with the duration of looking and the prolonged engagement with \u201cseeing\u201d nothing. The series of work ''\u2026and of time'' is the inverse series about the same window found in ''nowhere near''. The images depict the light falling through the window, repeating grid like reflections of light that  bounce and illuminate onto the wall and floor of Barth\u2019s living room. \u201cThe window becomes the aperture of the house and light and imagery project through it,\u201d Barth\u2019s says.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nIn 2002 Barth creates ''white blind (bright red)''. She deliberately sequences images, pairing anywhere from two, six or a dozen photographs of bare tree branches with white sky backdrops together. In contrast with the photographic panels are brightly colored panels of primary red, ox-blood, and a deep yellow scattered throughout the sequencing that break up the visual rhythm of movement from one image to the next.

Her memory of West Berlin is \"dark and austere\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63658187|title=Pressplay : contemporary artists in conversation.|date=2005|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-4533-7|location=London|oclc=63658187}}</ref> and she left for the States before the Berlin wall was taken down in 1989. During early adolescence her father began a research project in the States at Stanford University and she moved to the US shortly after. Barth was 12 years old and did not know English when she arrived in the States. The shift from cold-war Germany to 1970s California was a culture shock for Barth<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63658187|title=Pressplay : contemporary artists in conversation.|date=2005|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-4533-7|location=London|oclc=63658187}}</ref>. \n\nLater, Barth\u2019s received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of California, Davis]] in 1982 and a Master of Fine Arts from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1985. From 1990 to 2008, she was a professor in the Art Department at the University of California, Riverside, until she was given the honorary title of Professor Emeritus in the Department of Art in 2008 to the present. She was also a visiting Graduate Faculty member at the [[ArtCenter College of Design|Art Center College of Design]], Pasadena, California from 2000-2012 and has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. After receiving the MacArthur Fellowship in October 2012, she noted that she still plans to teach on a part-time basis because teaching forces her to \"put language to\" what she is thinking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/9173|title=Art Professor Wins MacArthur Fellowship|last=October 1|first=Bettye Miller on|last2=2012|website=UCR Today|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> \n\n<br />\n\n== Work ==\n\n=== Early Work: Late 1980s & Early 1990s ===\nIn 1989 Barth\u2019s work was black and white, multi-paneled photographic and painted images mounted on wood that addressed the psychodynamics of vision, using optic patterns, repetitious visual metaphors for the eye, and diagrams related to light and human vision.<ref name=\":0\" /> The multi-panel work set up formal relationships that would continue through Barth\u2019s artistic practice in later works. Barth explains that this early work was about \u201cthe confrontation with the camera, in the feeling of being looked at, blasted with light, being blinded, all as a physical experience.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1990, Barth continued to explore optic patterns and illusions in her works ''Untitled #11-14''. This work includes four small photographs of houses that are encompassed in large fields of black and white strips, similar to that of static on a television screen and creates an optic vibration. The work intersects with the themes of photographic vision and the idea of the \u2018gaze.\u2019<ref name=\":0\" /><br />\n\n=== Mid 1990s ===\nBarth\u2019s work began to internalize the space between the viewer and the object in the mid 1990s, zooming in and zooming out, looking close and far away in her works like ''Untitled #13'' (1991) and ''Untitled #16'' (1990). \u00a0She begins playing with the communication of space with in the work through landscape and abstracted text, and plays with the idea of how the perception of the works occurs within the human body viewing it. Pamela Lee says, \u201cthe self-consciousness of looking is grounded in subjective looking\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> in Barth\u2019s work. In ''Untitled #13'', Barth includes a photograph of a landscape whose details are blurred to slow down the immediate understanding of the image by the audience. This effect describes the instability of one\u2019s visual field of vision, and becomes the basis for Barth\u2019s next series of works ''Grounds''.<br />\n\n=== ''Grounds'' (1992-1995) ===\nThis body of photographs consists of over 50 images in different sizes and scales. These photos defy the conventional flat photographic image by being laminated prints that are then mounted on wood boards multiple inches thick, projecting the print away from the wall. As a result, the images of ''Grounds'' impersonate an object instead of a print. This plays into Barth\u2019s conceptual ideas for the body of work, referring to these photographs as \u00a0\u201ccontainers of information.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer [https://darrencampion.com Darren Campion] says,\u201cBarth\u2019s work addresses that fundamental dissonance between the world as it is and the world as we see it, the chasms of perceived experience. This is extended to other areas of the photographic process as well \u2013 the main correlate of space being, of course, time, and its fluidity, which seems antithetical to our notion of what photography does.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theincoherentlight.com/2012/12/uta-barth-density-of-light.html|title=Uta Barth: The Density of Light|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>  Barth made the images by photographing generic locations outdoors as if she was shooting a formal portrait but removed the subject of the portrait in focus and left the out-of-focus background behind. Barth\u2019s gesture reverses the typical use of the camera, shooting something out of focus instead of something in-focus. As a result, she photographs unoccupied space. Barth was thinking about stock photography while making this body of work, picturing backdrops for family photos and portrait photography from the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\":0\" /> <br />\n\n=== ''Fields'' (1995-1996) ===\nIn 1995 Barth began transitioning from her ''Grounds'' series into a new body of work known as ''Fields''. She took her photographic approach in ''Grounds'' and turned it on its side, thinking about the site-specific relationship between the photograph and the physical space where it was made. This idea introduces motion into the work. Visual movement across the images in ''Fields'' creates a blur that is similar to that found in film and cinematic work. ''Fields'' produces the \u201cillusion of filmic space and time\" and Barth has said that she created this body of work in a similar way film producers scout locations for the perfect place to shoot a scene in a film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn relation to her ''Field'' and ''Ground'' series, which depict blurred and empty foregrounds, Barth has stated: \"I am interested in the conventions of picture-making, in the desire to picture the world and in our relationship, our continual love for and fascination with pictures.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barth|first=Uta|title=Uta Barth: in between places|last2=Conkelton|first2=Sheryl|last3=Ferguson|first3=Russell|last4=Martin|first4=Timothy|last5=Henry Art Gallery|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington|isbn=0935558373|location=Seattle, Wash.|language=English|oclc=45567870}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n=== Late 1990s ===\nIn 1998 Barth begins another series of ''Untitled'' works, including ''Untitled (98.4)'' and ''Untitled (98.6)''. Here, Barth begins to focus on sequencing in the gallery again, grouping images together in diptychs, triptychs and clusters. The work plays on the idea of multiple points of view or the experience of a visual double-take where a detail catches the viewer long enough to take a second image, a second look.<ref name=\":0\" /> To make this work, Barth would shoot multiple photographs in a row so that she could go back and edit the series of images to find the best photographs to pair together. This act re-introduces the notion of time into Barth\u2019s work. She begins spacing her panels of images on the wall in intervals to show gaps in time between shooting the photographs.\n<br />\n\n=== Early 2000s ===\nBarth creates two of her most famous bodies of work during the same time period, ''nowhere near'' (1999) and ''\u2026and of time'' (2000). Here, Barth interrogates the temporality of photography and the duration of vision. In ''nowhere near'' the camera records a repeated view out of Barth\u2019s living room window over multiple months.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/editorial-artsy-asks-gregory-crewdson-uta-barth-and|title=Artsy Asks Gregory Crewdson, Uta Barth, and Yuki Onodera All About the Window|date=2013-09-30|website=Artsy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> She made hundreds of images that contain moments of framing, records the ebb and flow of light and captures the change of the seasons. This body of work deals with the duration of looking and the prolonged engagement with \u201cseeing\u201d nothing. The series of work ''\u2026and of time'' is the inverse series about the same window found in ''nowhere near''. The images depict the light falling through the window, repeating grid like reflections of light that  bounce and illuminate onto the wall and floor of Barth\u2019s living room. \u201cThe window becomes the aperture of the house and light and imagery project through it,\u201d Barth\u2019s says.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nIn 2002 Barth creates ''white blind (bright red)''. She deliberately sequences images, pairing anywhere from two, six or a dozen photographs of bare tree branches with white sky backdrops together. In contrast with the photographic panels are brightly colored panels of primary red, ox-blood, and a deep yellow scattered throughout the sequencing that break up the visual rhythm of movement from one image to the next. Instead of being drawn in by a single image, the viewer experiences a banned of images that flicker across the walls of the gallery in a horizon line of images.<ref name=\":0\" /> \u00a0\u201cA flickering of visual consciousness,\u201d [[Holly Myers|Holly Meyers,]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenand.com/articles-1|title=Articles / Holly Myers / then/and|website=then/and|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://25071b8d-551e-4741-9356-5ccda1eadb69.filesusr.com/ugd/609b6d_0b695c651a1a4e2393a118d0400b6f00.pdf|title=Uta Barth: Domestic Bliss|last=Myers|first=Holly|date=April 14, 2020|website=Then/and|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 14th, 2020}}</ref> an art critic for the [[Los Angeles Times]] wrote in reference to the work.

In this series, Barth\u2019s intervention of her own body parts into the photographic frame to position the subject of the photograph is made visible.

Reserves''' is the reserve team of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. It is the most senior level of the Liverpool academy beneath the first team. In the summer of 2012, the whole English reserve football system was overhauled and replaced with an Under 21 league system, the [[Professional Development League]]. Liverpool's Reserve team became the Liverpool under 21 team and competes in the Professional Development League 1 which is also known by its sponsorship name of Barclays under 21 Premier League. The team generally consists of Under-21 players at the club but at times senior players also play for the reserves when they are recuperating from injury. Following the introduction of new regulations from 2012\u201313 season, only three outfield players and one goalkeeper over the age of 21 can play for the reserves regularly.\n\nIn [[2012\u201313 Professional U21 Development League]] the reserve team of Liverpool reached the semifinal before losing to the eventual winners [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United]]. The following season in 2013\u201314 the reserves team again lost to Manchester United reserves in the semis.\n\n'''Liverpool F.C. Academy''' is the youth set up [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]]. It trains players from the U6 age group<ref name=\"Inglethorpe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/alex-inglethorpe-insists-important-liverpool-7733416|title= Alex Inglethorpe insists it is important for Liverpool FC to bring through local talent|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=7 September 2014}}</ref> up to the U21 squad. The academy has separate head coaches in charge of development in the U6-U9, U10-U11, U12-U14 and U15-U16 age groups. At U21 and U18 level there are dedicated coaching teams managed by Michael Beale with the U21 position vacant as of 2 march 2020. [[Alex Inglethorpe]] was promoted from U21 manager to Academy Director in the summer of 2014 and hold overall responsibility for operation of the academy. The academy has won the [[FA Youth Cup]], a competition for players of age 15 to 18, four times in 1996, 2006, 2007 and 2019.\n\nLiverpool F.C. Academy is considered to be one of the best and one of the most prolific [[Association football|football]] academies both in England and in the world.  Various current and past Liverpool players have graduated through the academy with the likes of [[Billy Liddell]], [[Ronnie Moran]], [[Ian Callaghan]], [[Phil Thompson]], [[Robbie Fowler]], [[Steve McManaman]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Jamie Carragher]], [[Steven Gerrard]] and [[Trent Alexander-Arnold]], among many others.\n\n==Reserve team==\n'''[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] Reserves''' played in [[Premier Reserve League]]. The Reserves won the regional division title in 2000 and again 2008 winning also the national league that year. It competed in the [[Lancashire Combination]] from 1896 to 1911, with the exception of the 1898\u201399 season, in which it joined [[The Combination]]. From 1911 on, it took part in the [[Central League (football)|Central League]] until becoming inaugural members of the Premier Reserve League North in 1999. The team also participated in the [[Liverpool Senior Cup]] and the [[Lancashire Senior Cup]]; the last time it took part in them was the 2009\u201310 season when it also won both competitions.\n\nThe last reserve team manager was Rodolfo Borrell, who was appointed in July 2011 and led the reserve team during its final season before taking over the newly formed under-21 side in July 2012. The reserves last played their home games at [[Prenton Park]] (the home of [[Tranmere Rovers]]);<ref name=\"Reserves Travel \u2013 Liverpool FC\">{{cite web| url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/travel/reserves-travel | title = Reserves Travel \u2013 Liverpool FC | publisher = Liverpool FC | accessdate  =4 October 2011}}</ref> in previous seasons the team has also played at the club's academy, the [[Halliwell Jones Stadium]] (home of [[Warrington Wolves]]), [[Haig Avenue]] (the home of [[Southport F.C.|Southport]]), [[Totally Wicked Stadium]] (the home of [[St Helens R.F.C.]]) and the [[Racecourse Ground]] (home of [[Wrexham A.F.C.theyre all terrible as well.\nThe most successful Liverpool Reserves manager was [[Roy Evans]]. Evans spent most of his playing career as a reserve team player, making only 11 appearances for the first team. After an injury ended his career in 1974, he was appointed manager of the reserves by [[Bob Paisley]]. Evans subsequently led the reserves to victory in a series of Central League championships, including three in his first three seasons, a four in a row sequence from 1978, and two more in the early 1980s. Throughout the history of Liverpool FC, many of the club's best known players have progressed through the reserve team. These include current first team squad member [[Trent Alexander-Arnold]], [[Steven Gerrard]], [[Robbie Fowler]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Steve McManaman]], [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Raheem Sterling]].\n\n==The Academy==\n{{Main|The Academy, Kirkby}}\n[[File:Football Academy - geograph.org.uk - 118878.jpg|thumb|The Academy]]\nIn 1998, a new state-of-the-art Youth Academy was opened in [[Kirkby]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley]]. It replaced the older, more informal youth system, and enables the club to focus their youth development and scouting, employing new techniques and FA standards.\n\nScouts attend many local youth matches looking for talented boys. A boy will then be invited to attend training sessions at the Academy. They are currently taken in as young as the age of six. Former [[England national football team|England International]] player [[Jamie Carragher]] started at Liverpool when he was aged just nine, with [[Michael Owen]] joining at eleven, and [[Steven Gerrard]] joining at the age of eight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/171229-photos-jordan-s-rise-through-lfc-s-ranks|title=Photos: Jordan's rise through LFC's ranks|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|date=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn the walls of the indoor centre hang the words 'Technique', 'Attitude', 'Balance', and 'Speed'.

Reserves''' is the reserve team of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. It is the most senior level of the Liverpool academy beneath the first team. In the summer of 2012, the whole English reserve football system was overhauled and replaced with an Under 21 league system, the [[Professional Development League]]. Liverpool's Reserve team became the Liverpool under 21 team and competes in the Professional Development League 1 which is also known by its sponsorship name of Barclays under 21 Premier League. The team generally consists of Under-21 players at the club but at times senior players also play for the reserves when they are recuperating from injury. Following the introduction of new regulations from 2012\u201313 season, only three outfield players and one goalkeeper over the age of 21 can play for the reserves regularly.\n\nIn [[2012\u201313 Professional U21 Development League]] the reserve team of Liverpool reached the semifinal before losing to the eventual winners [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United]]. The following season in 2013\u201314 the reserves team again lost to Manchester United reserves in the semis.\n\n'''Liverpool F.C. Academy''' is the youth set up [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]]. It trains players from the U6 age group<ref name=\"Inglethorpe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/alex-inglethorpe-insists-important-liverpool-7733416|title= Alex Inglethorpe insists it is important for Liverpool FC to bring through local talent|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=7 September 2014}}</ref> up to the U21 squad. The academy has separate head coaches in charge of development in the U6-U9, U10-U11, U12-U14 and U15-U16 age groups. At U21 and U18 level there are dedicated coaching teams managed by Michael Beale with the U21 position vacant as of 2 march 2020. [[Alex Inglethorpe]] was promoted from U21 manager to Academy Director in the summer of 2014 and hold overall responsibility for operation of the academy. The academy has won the [[FA Youth Cup]], a competition for players of age 15 to 18, four times in 1996, 2006, 2007 and 2019.\n\nLiverpool F.C. Academy is considered to be one of the best and one of the most prolific [[Association football|football]] academies both in England and in the world.  Various current and past Liverpool players have graduated through the academy with the likes of [[Billy Liddell]], [[Ronnie Moran]], [[Ian Callaghan]], [[Phil Thompson]], [[Robbie Fowler]], [[Steve McManaman]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Jamie Carragher]], [[Steven Gerrard]] and [[Trent Alexander-Arnold]], among many others.\n\n==Reserve team==\n'''[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] Reserves''' played in [[Premier Reserve League]]. The Reserves won the regional division title in 2000 and again 2008 winning also the national league that year. It competed in the [[Lancashire Combination]] from 1896 to 1911, with the exception of the 1898\u201399 season, in which it joined [[The Combination]]. From 1911 on, it took part in the [[Central League (football)|Central League]] until becoming inaugural members of the Premier Reserve League North in 1999. The team also participated in the [[Liverpool Senior Cup]] and the [[Lancashire Senior Cup]]; the last time it took part in them was the 2009\u201310 season when it also won both competitions.\n\nThe last reserve team manager was Rodolfo Borrell, who was appointed in July 2011 and led the reserve team during its final season before taking over the newly formed under-21 side in July 2012. The reserves last played their home games at [[Prenton Park]] (the home of [[Tranmere Rovers]]);<ref name=\"Reserves Travel \u2013 Liverpool FC\">{{cite web| url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/travel/reserves-travel | title = Reserves Travel \u2013 Liverpool FC | publisher = Liverpool FC | accessdate  =4 October 2011}}</ref> in previous seasons the team has also played at the club's academy, the [[Halliwell Jones Stadium]] (home of [[Warrington Wolves]]), [[Haig Avenue]] (the home of [[Southport F.C.|Southport]]), [[Totally Wicked Stadium]] (the home of [[St Helens R.F.C.]]) and the [[Racecourse Ground]] (home of [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]]).\n\nThe most successful Liverpool Reserves manager was [[Roy Evans]]. Evans spent most of his playing career as a reserve team player, making only 11 appearances for the first team. After an injury ended his career in 1974, he was appointed manager of the reserves by [[Bob Paisley]]. Evans subsequently led the reserves to victory in a series of Central League championships, including three in his first three seasons, a four in a row sequence from 1978, and two more in the early 1980s. Throughout the history of Liverpool FC, many of the club's best known players have progressed through the reserve team. These include current first team squad member [[Trent Alexander-Arnold]], [[Steven Gerrard]], [[Robbie Fowler]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Steve McManaman]], [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Raheem Sterling]].\n\n==The Academy==\n{{Main|The Academy, Kirkby}}\n[[File:Football Academy - geograph.org.uk - 118878.jpg|thumb|The Academy]]\nIn 1998, a new state-of-the-art Youth Academy was opened in [[Kirkby]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley]]. It replaced the older, more informal youth system, and enables the club to focus their youth development and scouting, employing new techniques and FA standards.\n\nScouts attend many local youth matches looking for talented boys. A boy will then be invited to attend training sessions at the Academy. They are currently taken in as young as the age of six. Former [[England national football team|England International]] player [[Jamie Carragher]] started at Liverpool when he was aged just nine, with [[Michael Owen]] joining at eleven, and [[Steven Gerrard]] joining at the age of eight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/171229-photos-jordan-s-rise-through-lfc-s-ranks|title=Photos: Jordan's rise through LFC's ranks|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|date=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn the walls of the indoor centre hang the words 'Technique', 'Attitude', 'Balance', and 'Speed'.
