It was adapted by Williams and [[Hal Kanter]] and directed by [[Daniel Mann]], with stars [[Anna Magnani]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Marisa Pavan]] and [[Jo Van Fleet]]. Williams originally wrote the play for [[Italian people|Italian]] Anna Magnani to play on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] in 1951, but she rejected the offer because of her difficulty with the English language at the time. By the time of this film adaptation, she was ready.<ref name=\"Osborne\" />\n\nAnna Magnani won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance, and the film won\n[[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] receiving five other nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Pavan.\n\n== Plot ==\nSerafina Delle Rose ([[Anna Magnani]]) proudly praises her husband Rosario<!-- removed \"([[David Newell]])\": among other evidence of mistaken identity, the linked actor was still 16 at the time of filming --> to her female neighbors before revealing that she is pregnant with their second child. Returning home she finds Rosario asleep in bed and whispers to him that she is with child. Emerging from his room she finds a young woman named Estelle ([[Virginia Grey]]) at the door who wants her to make a shirt for her lover from some expensive silk material. It transpires that Rosario is her lover as, when Serafina is out of the room, she steals a photograph of him from Serafina's [[sideboard]] before departing.\n\nLater that night Rosario is out working (he is a van driver who hauls bananas) and Serafina is busy working on the shirt for her customer. The women of the neighborhood discover that Rosario has been killed in a road accident while trying to speed away from the police; he was smuggling something illegal under the bananas. When Serafina discovers her beloved husband's demise she collapses, and later the local doctor informs her daughter Rosa ([[Marisa Pavan]]) and the women of the neighborhood that Serafina has miscarried.\n\nThree years later Serafina has become a recluse. She has allowed her appearance to deteriorate. It is the day of the high school graduation and the women of the neighborhood are impatiently banging on Serafina's front door for their daughters' graduation dresses, which she has sewn. Rosa is also begging for her graduation dress from her mother, but Serafina has locked them\u2014along with the rest of Rosa's clothes\u2014away. Rosa's teacher turns up in the neighborhood demanding to know what is keeping them. She goes to the Delle Rose household and eventually makes Serafina see sense.\n\nAfter much thought Serafina decides to attend her daughter's graduation. During this time two women arrive asking if Serafina can quickly mend their bandanas for a festival to which they are going. Serafina reluctantly does so, but is appalled by their talk of men and reprimands them. One of the women, Bessie ([[Jo Van Fleet]]), takes offense and informs Serafina that her late husband was having an affair. Serafina does not go to the graduation ceremony after this revelation, but instead sits alone in the dark until Rosa comes home. She is infuriated when Rosa introduces her to her new sailor boyfriend Jack Hunter ([[Ben Cooper]]) and Serafina mistrusts his intentions. After her interrogation, he confides that he is a virgin.  She forces him to vow before a statue of the Virgin Mary that he will respect Rosa's innocence. Then Rosa and Jack are picked up by a car of friends for a party.\n\nSerafina is still stinging from the revelation that her husband was unfaithful.  On a mission to root out the truth, she heads to the church (where a bazaar is being held) to ask the priest if her husband had confessed to an affair with another woman.  He refuses to answer and she attacks him.  A truck driver named Alvaro ([[Burt Lancaster]]) pulls her off the priest, but she tears Alvaro's shirtfront in her attack.  Serafina collapses, then is thrown out of the church and is mocked by her female neighbors.  Alvaro drives the dazed Serafina home in his banana truck. She offers to repair his torn shirt. At her home Alvaro acts the clown, and flatters Serafina with compliments, brashly confiding his life story to her.  Some wine is consumed and she begins to talk of her late husband, whom she still idolizes.  She mentions that he used to have a rose tattooed on his chest. Serafina loans Alvaro the rose silk shirt that she had sewn the night of her husband's death until she is able to repair the shirt she tore.  They agree to meet later that night.  Alvaro returns, having impulsively gotten a rose tattooed on his chest. Serafina is disgusted and goes to throw him out, stating that he is dishonoring Rosario's memory. He awkwardly makes a pass at her, and she attempts to throw him out. Reconsidering, Serafina demands that Alvaro drive her to a club her husband used to attend. Once there she meets Estelle and guesses correctly that she was having an affair with him. Estelle confesses and shows Serafina the rose tattooed on her chest as a symbol of her love for Rosario. Returning home, Serafina smashes the urn containing Rosario's ashes.  She invites Alvaro to return in the night.\n\nAlvaro turns up hours later at the Delle Rose household intoxicated and, mortified by his actions, Serafina leaves him in a drunken stupor and retires to bed. That night Rosa returns home and falls asleep on the sofa. As Alvaro awakes from his drunken stupor he sees Serafina's beautiful daughter lying there asleep and moves over to kiss her. As he does Rosa wakes up and screams, before confronting her mother as to why there is a strange man in the house.\n\nSerafina gets rid of him, but the following morning she finds him on top of a boat mast outside her house begging for her forgiveness. Serafina and Rosa are extremely embarrassed and Serafina refuses to leave the house in order to make him come down, much to Rosa's frustration. At that moment Jack arrives and asks Serafina if he can marry Rosa. Serafina is stunned, but seeing that this is what Rosa wants she gives them her consent and they leave to be married. Serafina then calls Alvaro down from the boat mast before declaring in front of her neighbors that they have to pick up from where they left off the night before. They enter her house and shut the door. A lively pop tune<!-- ''The Sheik of Araby'', probably too much information here --> is heard starting up on Serafina's [[player piano]], along with the sounds of their partying and laughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Anna Magnani]] \u2013 Serafina Delle Rose\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] \u2013 Alvaro Mangiacavallo\n* [[Marisa Pavan]] \u2013 Rosa Delle Rose\n* [[Ben Cooper]] \u2013 Seaman Jack Hunter\n* [[Virginia Grey]] \u2013 Estelle Hohengarten\n* [[Jo Van Fleet]] \u2013 Bessie\n* Sandro Giglio \u2013 Father De Leo\n* [[Mimi Aguglia]] \u2013 Assunta\n* [[Florence Sundstrom]] \u2013 Flora\n\n==Production and release==\nMuch of the film was shot on location in [[Key West, Florida]], although the setting is not specifically mentioned in the film.

Backed by music videos for the singles \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", the Blue Album became a [[multiplatinum]] success. Weezer's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve [[cult following|cult status]] and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and ''Pinkerton'' are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for ''Pinkerton'', bassist [[Matt Sharp]] left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with the \"[[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]]\", with new bassist [[Mikey Welsh]]. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"[[Hash Pipe]]\" and \"[[Island in the Sun (Weezer song)|Island in the Sun]]\", the album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left the band and was replaced by current bassist [[Scott Shriner]]. Weezer's fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'' (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]]'' (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"[[Beverly Hills (song)|Beverly Hills]]\" became Weezer's first single to top the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and the first to reach the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\nIn 2008, Weezer released the \"[[Weezer (Red Album)|Red Album]]\", featuring \"[[Roland TR-808|TR-808s]], synths, [[Southern rap]], and [[baroque]] counterpoint\".<ref name=\"PFRiversinterview\">{{cite web |last=Crock |first=Jason |date=2008-01-28 |title=Interview: Rivers Cuomo |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6773-rivers-cuomo/ |accessdate=2017-06-25}}</ref> Its lead single, \"[[Pork and Beans (song)|Pork and Beans]]\", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a  [[Grammy]]-winning YouTube music video.

Cuomo had what he then described as a \"massive falling out\" with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer's audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos. Online Weezer fans staged a brief protest, with several websites proclaiming \"Free ''Maladroit''\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"allm\"/>\n\nThe fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'', was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor. The album served as a harder-edged version of the band's trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for \"[[Dope Nose]]\" featured an obscure [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku|Japanese motorcycle gang]], and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"[[Keep Fishin']]\" combined Weezer with [[the Muppets]], and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.\n\nWeezer released its much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The ''[[Weezer \u2013 Video Capture Device: Treasures from the Vault 1991\u20132002|Video Capture Device]]'' DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through ''[[Maladroit]]'''s Enlightenment Tour.

The demos were a big hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished album.

It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"Beverly Hills\" was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual [[Grammy Awards]], the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The second single released from ''Make Believe'' was \"[[We Are All on Drugs]]\". MTV refused to play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing \"on drugs\" with \"in love\" and renaming the song \"We Are All in Love\". In early 2006, it was announced that ''Make Believe'' was [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]], and \"Beverly Hills\" was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just behind \"[[Hollaback Girl]]\" by [[Gwen Stefani]].<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Koch\n | first = Karl\n | title = breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch\n |date=2006-01-18\n | url = http://www.weezer.com/community/news_comment.asp?ParentAssetID=1378551&ArtistID=479&Start=&FullStory=Y&type=\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061129185644/http://www.weezer.com/community/news_comment.asp?ParentAssetID=1378551&ArtistID=479&Start=&FullStory=Y&type=\n | archivedate = 2006-11-29\n | accessdate = 2006-11-03 }}</ref> ''Make Believe'''s third single, \"[[Perfect Situation]]\", spent four weeks in a row at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"[[This Is Such a Pity]]\" was the band's fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release.

Since 2001, the band has consisted of [[Rivers Cuomo]] (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), [[Patrick Wilson (musician)|Patrick Wilson]] (drums), [[Brian Bell]] (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and [[Scott Shriner]] (bass, backing vocals).\n\nAfter signing to [[Geffen Records]] in 1993, Weezer released its self-titled debut album, also known as the \"[[Weezer (Blue Album)|Blue Album]]\", in 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", the Blue Album became a [[multiplatinum]] success. Weezer's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve [[cult following|cult status]] and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and ''Pinkerton'' are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for ''Pinkerton'', bassist [[Matt Sharp]] left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with the \"[[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]]\", with new bassist [[Mikey Welsh]]. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"[[Hash Pipe]]\" and \"[[Island in the Sun (Weezer song)|Island in the Sun]]\", the album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left the band and was replaced by current bassist [[Scott Shriner]]. Weezer's fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'' (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]]'' (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"[[Beverly Hills (song)|Beverly Hills]]\" became Weezer's first single to top the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and the first to reach the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\nIn 2008, Weezer released the \"[[Weezer (Red Album)|Red Album]]\", featuring \"[[Roland TR-808|TR-808s]], synths, [[Southern rap]], and [[baroque]] counterpoint\".<ref name=\"PFRiversinterview\">{{cite web |last=Crock |first=Jason |date=2008-01-28 |title=Interview: Rivers Cuomo |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6773-rivers-cuomo/ |accessdate=2017-06-25}}</ref> Its lead single, \"[[Pork and Beans (song)|Pork and Beans]]\", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a  [[Grammy]]-winning YouTube music video.

Shortly after the release, Weezer went on another American tour. The band attracted a new generation of fans thanks to heavy MTV rotation for the videos for hit singles \"[[Hash Pipe]]\" and \"[[Island in the Sun (Weezer song)|Island in the Sun]]\".\n\nWelsh left Weezer in 2001 for mental health reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ex-weezer-bassist-mikey-welsh-dies-234721/|title=Ex-Weezer Bassist Mikey Welsh Dies|last=Eisen|first=Benjy|last2=Eisen|first2=Benjy|date=2011-10-09|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Scott Shriner]].<ref name=\"page 372\">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 372</ref>\n\n===''Maladroit'' (2002)===\n{{Main|Maladroit}}\nWeezer took an experimental approach for the recording process of its fourth album by allowing fans to download in-progress mixes of new songs from its official website in return for feedback.<ref name=\"page 398\">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 398</ref> After the release of the album, the band said that this process was something of a failure, as the fans did not supply the group with coherent, constructive advice. Cuomo eventually delegated song selection for the album to the band's original A&R rep, [http://weezerpedia.com/wiki/Todd_Sullivan Todd Sullivan], saying that Weezer fans chose the \"wackest songs\".

Cuomo had what he then described as a \"massive falling out\" with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer's audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos. Online Weezer fans staged a brief protest, with several websites proclaiming \"Free ''Maladroit''\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"allm\"/>\n\nThe fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'', was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor. The album served as a harder-edged version of the band's trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for \"[[Dope Nose]]\" featured an obscure [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku|Japanese motorcycle gang]], and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"[[Keep Fishin']]\" combined Weezer with [[the Muppets]], and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.\n\nWeezer released its much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The ''[[Weezer \u2013 Video Capture Device: Treasures from the Vault 1991\u20132002|Video Capture Device]]'' DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through ''[[Maladroit]]'''s Enlightenment Tour. Compiled by Karl Koch, the DVD features home video footage, music videos, commercials, rehearsals, concert performances, television performances, and band commentary.

The band's early recording efforts became available to the public through the band's website. The demos were a big hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished album. That album, titled ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]],'' was released on May 10, 2005. Despite commercial success, ''Make Believe'' got a mixed reception from critics, receiving an average score of 52 on review collator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"Metacritic MakeBelieve\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/weezer/makebelieve?q=Make%20Believe |title=Weezer: Make Believe |accessdate=2007-05-30 |work=metacritic |publisher=metacritic }}</ref> Although some reviews, such as AMG's, compared it favorably to ''Pinkerton'',<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r738466|pure_url=yes}} |title= Make Believe: Review |accessdate=2007-05-30 |last= Erlewine |first= Stephen |agency= allmusic |publisher=AMG }}</ref> others, among them ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', panned the album as predictable and lyrically poor.\n\nThe album's first single, \"[[Beverly Hills (song)|Beverly Hills]]\", became a hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release. It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"Beverly Hills\" was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual [[Grammy Awards]], the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The second single released from ''Make Believe'' was \"[[We Are All on Drugs]]\". MTV refused to play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing \"on drugs\" with \"in love\" and renaming the song \"We Are All in Love\". In early 2006, it was announced that ''Make Believe'' was [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]], and \"Beverly Hills\" was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just behind \"[[Hollaback Girl]]\" by [[Gwen Stefani]].<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Koch\n | first = Karl\n | title = breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch\n |date=2006-01-18\n | url = http://www.weezer.com/community/news_comment.asp?ParentAssetID=1378551&ArtistID=479&Start=&FullStory=Y&type=\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061129185644/http://www.weezer.com/community/news_comment.asp?ParentAssetID=1378551&ArtistID=479&Start=&FullStory=Y&type=\n | archivedate = 2006-11-29\n | accessdate = 2006-11-03 }}</ref> ''Make Believe'''s third single, \"[[Perfect Situation]]\", spent four weeks in a row at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"[[This Is Such a Pity]]\" was the band's fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release.

[[Angels and Airwaves]] and [[Tokyo Police Club]] joined the band as support at each show, and Brian Bell's \"other\"band [[The Relationship]] also performed at a handful of dates. Shortly before the encore at each show, the band would bring on fans with various instruments and perform \"[[Island in the Sun (Weezer)|Island in the Sun]]\" and \"[[Beverly Hills (song)|Beverly Hills]]\" with the band. At a show in Austin, after Tokyo Police Club had played its set, Cuomo was wheeled out in a box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, \"My Brain\", dressed in pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again.

After 1900 both Chinese education and Chinese colonization spread among them. When the [[Japanese Empire]] occupied parts of [[Inner Mongolia]] and all of [[Manchuria]] in 1931, the Khorchins became the most energetic proponents of secular learning and reform among the Mongols.

It was settled by [[Dutch people|Dutch immigrants]] on land sold by the Kansas City Southern railroad. It is part of the [[Beaumont\u2013Port Arthur metropolitan area]]. Nederland is also a part of an area known as \"the Golden Triangle\", which comprises [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]], and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]]. The city is adjacent to the [[Jack Brooks Regional Airport]].\n\n== History ==\n\nNederland was founded in 1897 by [[Netherlands|Dutch]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Block, JR|first=W.T|title=TULIPS AMID THE BLUEBONNETS:  THE CENTENNIAL OF NEDERLAND, TEXAS|url=http://www.wtblock.com/wtblockjr/centenni.htm#continuefrom|accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref> settlers as a repayment for financial services of Dutch bankers who financed the Kansas City Southern railroad line that runs through the center of the city. (''Nederland'', which literally translates to \"Lowland\", is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for the Netherlands.) The more prominent families were named Rienstra, Doornbos, and Van Oostrom, and their descendants still live in the area today. Tradition says they were attracted to the flat coastal terrain that reminded them of their homeland (although the heat most certainly did not).\n\nNederland's early economy was driven by rice and dairy farming. However, the [[depression of 1907]] and overproduction caused the rice industry in the town to collapse. Many Dutch settlers moved away from the area during this time, but a small percentage remained. After the [[Spindletop]] gusher discovery of 1901 and the establishment of the [[Sun Oil]] terminal near Nederland, the town became a residential community for the workers of the nearby oil terminals.\n\nNederland became incorporated as a city in 1940. The surrounding larger cities of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]] came to be known as the [[Golden Triangle (Texas)|Golden Triangle]]. In the 1940s and 1950s, the [[Port of Port Arthur]] and the [[Port of Beaumont]] were as important as [[New Orleans]], [[Houston]], or [[Galveston]], and Nederland thrived as a result.\n\nThe refineries also attracted a large population of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] laborers into the area. The area drew particularly heavily from southern [[Louisiana]], and a strong [[Cajun]] flair is evident throughout the community. With the decline of oil prices in the 1980s, the local economy suffered and Nederland experienced slight population losses, but has stabilized in the late 1990s and 2000s.\n\nNederland is the ending location of the [[Keystone Pipeline]].\n\n==Geography==\nNederland is located in eastern Jefferson County at {{Coord|29|58|23|N|93|59|48|W|type:city}} (29.973113, -93.996715).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the east by [[Port Neches, Texas|Port Neches]], to the south by Port Arthur, and to the north by unincorporated [[Central Gardens, Texas|Central Gardens]].

It was settled by [[Dutch people|Dutch immigrants]] on land sold by the Kansas City Southern railroad. It is part of the [[Beaumont\u2013Port Arthur metropolitan area]]. Nederland is also a part of an area known as \"the Golden Triangle\", which comprises [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]], and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]]. The city is adjacent to the [[Jack Brooks Regional Airport]].\n\n== History ==\n\nNederland was founded in 1897 by [[Netherlands|Dutch]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Block, JR|first=W.T|title=TULIPS AMID THE BLUEBONNETS:  THE CENTENNIAL OF NEDERLAND, TEXAS|url=http://www.wtblock.com/wtblockjr/centenni.htm#continuefrom|accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref> settlers as a repayment for financial services of Dutch bankers who financed the Kansas City Southern railroad line that runs through the center of the city. (''Nederland'', which literally translates to \"Lowland\", is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for the Netherlands.) The more prominent families were named Rienstra, Doornbos, and Van Oostrom, and their descendants still live in the area today. Tradition says they were attracted to the flat coastal terrain that reminded them of their homeland (although the heat most certainly did not).\n\nNederland's early economy was driven by rice and dairy farming. However, the [[depression of 1907]] and overproduction caused the rice industry in the town to collapse. Many Dutch settlers moved away from the area during this time, but a small percentage remained. After the [[Spindletop]] gusher discovery of 1901 and the establishment of the [[Sun Oil]] terminal near Nederland, the town became a residential community for the workers of the nearby oil terminals.\n\nNederland became incorporated as a city in 1940. The surrounding larger cities of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]] came to be known as the [[Golden Triangle (Texas)|Golden Triangle]]. In the 1940s and 1950s, the [[Port of Port Arthur]] and the [[Port of Beaumont]] were as important as [[New Orleans]], [[Houston]], or [[Galveston]], and Nederland thrived as a result.\n\nThe refineries also attracted a large population of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] laborers into the area. The area drew particularly heavily from southern [[Louisiana]], and a strong [[Cajun]] flair is evident throughout the community. With the decline of oil prices in the 1980s, the local economy suffered and Nederland experienced slight population losses, but has stabilized in the late 1990s and 2000s.\n\nNederland is the ending location of the [[Keystone Pipeline]].\n\n==Geography==\nNederland is located in eastern Jefferson County at {{Coord|29|58|23|N|93|59|48|W|type:city}} (29.973113, -93.996715).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the east by [[Port Neches, Texas|Port Neches]], to the south by Port Arthur, and to the north by unincorporated [[Central Gardens, Texas|Central Gardens]].

A number of sets of [[Criteria & Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management|criteria and indicators]] have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of SFM at the global, regional, country and management unit level. These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment of the degree to which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice. In 2007, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[United Nations Forum on Forests#Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests|Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests]].

This balance is critical to the survival of forests, and to the prosperity of forest-dependent communities.\n\nFor forest managers, sustainably managing a particular forest tract means determining, in a tangible way, how to use it today to ensure similar benefits, health and productivity in the future.

Seven common thematic areas of sustainable forest management have emerged based on the criteria of the nine ongoing regional and international criteria and indicators initiatives.  The seven thematic areas are:\n\n* Extent of forest resources\n* [[Biological diversity]]\n* [[Forest health]] and vitality\n* Productive functions of forest resources\n* Protective functions of forest resources\n* Socio-economic functions\n* Legal, policy and institutional framework.\n\nThis consensus on common thematic areas (or criteria) effectively provides a common, implicit definition of sustainable forest management.  The seven thematic areas were acknowledged by the international forest community at the fourth session of the [[United Nations Forum on Forests]] and the 16th session of the Committee on Forestry.<ref>[https://www.un.org/esa/forests/ United Nations Forum on Forests] (2004)</ref><ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/007/Y9203e/y9203e09.htm#TopOfPage Committee on Forestry] (2003)</ref> These thematic areas have since been enshrined in the [[United Nations Forum on Forests#Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests|Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests]] as a reference framework for sustainable forest management to help achieve the purpose of the instrument.\n\nOn January 5, 2012, the Montr\u00e9al Process, Forest Europe, the International Tropical Timber Organization, and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], acknowledging the seven thematic areas, endorsed a [http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=33400 joint statement of collaboration] to improve global forest-related data collection and reporting and avoiding the proliferation of monitoring requirements and associated reporting burdens.\n\n==Ecosystem approach==\nThe [[Ecosystem Approach]] has been prominent on the agenda of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) since 1995 . The [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] definition of the Ecosystem Approach and a set of principles for its application were developed at an expert meeting in [[Malawi]] in 1995, known as the Malawi Principles.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/006/Y4773E/y4773e0e.htm Malawi Principles]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223012737/http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=%2FDOCREP%2F006%2FY4773E%2Fy4773e0e.htm |date=23 December 2007 }}</ref> The definition, 12 principles and 5 points of \"operational guidance\" were adopted by the fifth Conference of Parties (COP5) in 2000.  The [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] definition is as follows\n\n<blockquote>The ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. Application of the ecosystem approach will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Convention. An ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization, which encompasses the essential structures, processes, functions and interactions among organisms and their environment. It recognizes that humans, with their [[cultural diversity]], are an integral component of many ecosystems.</blockquote>\n\nSustainable forest management was recognized by parties to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] in 2004 (Decision VII/11 of COP7) to be a concrete means of applying the Ecosystem Approach to forest ecosystems.  The two concepts, sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach, aim at promoting conservation and management practices which are environmentally, socially and economically sustainable, and which generate and maintain benefits for both present and future generations. In Europe, the MCPFE and the Council for the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS) jointly recognized sustainable forest management to be consistent with the Ecosystem Approach in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.org/ |title=MCPFE |publisher=MCPFE |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategyguide.org/stracont.html |title=Council |publisher=Strategyguide.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategyguide.org/straabou.html |title=Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy |publisher=Strategyguide.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategyguide.org/200602/Documents/STRA-CO%202006%202%20_EA%20SFM%20JT%20STMT__E_final.pdf |title=PEBLD Strategy |publisher=Strategyguide.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Independent certification==\n{{Main|Certified wood}}\nGrowing [[environmental awareness]] and [[consumer demand]] for more socially responsible businesses helped third-party forest [[certification]] emerge in the 1990s as a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations.\n\nThere are many potential users of certification, including: forest managers, scientists, policy makers, investors, environmental advocates, business consumers of wood and paper, and individuals.\n\nWith third-party [[Certified wood|forest certification]], an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. Forest certification verifies that forests are well-managed \u2013 as defined by a particular standard \u2013 and chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale.\n\nThis rise of certification led to the emergence of several different systems throughout the world. As a result, there is no single accepted forest management standard worldwide, and each system takes a somewhat different approach in defining standards for sustainable forest management.\n\nIn its 2009\u20132010 Forest Products Annual Market Review United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated: \"Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |title=2009\u20132010 Forest Products Annual Market Review Page 121 |format=PDF |access-date=30 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThird-party forest certification is an important tool for those seeking to ensure that the paper and wood products they purchase and use come from forests that are well-managed and legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product procurement practices can be a centerpiece for comprehensive wood and paper policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.<ref>{{cite web|author=Erin Malec |url=http://www.metafore.org/?s=147 |title=Forest Certification Resource Center |publisher=Metafore.org |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere are more than fifty certification standards worldwide, addressing the diversity of forest types and tenures.

Thus, [[decentralization]] of management offers an alternative solution to forest governance.<ref name=agrawal2008 />\n\nThe shifting of natural resource management responsibilities from central to state and local governments, where this is occurring, is usually a part of broader decentralization process.<ref>Margulis, S. {{date?}}. 'Decentralized environmental management', Annual World Bank Report.</ref> According to Rondinelli and Cheema (1983), there are four distinct decentralization options: these are: (i) Privatization \u2013 the transfer of authority from the central government to non-governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision, (ii) Delegation \u2013 centrally nominated local authority, (iii) [[Devolution]] \u2013 transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and (iv) Deconcentration \u2013 the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government.\nThe major key to effective decentralization is increased broad-based participation in local-public decision making. In 2000, the World Bank report reveals that local government knows the needs and desires of their constituents better than the national government, while at the same time, it is easier to hold local leaders accountable. From the study of West African tropical forest, it is argued that the downwardly accountable and/or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency, development and equity.<ref>Ribott, (1990). 'Accountable representation and power in Participatory and decentralized environmental management', ''[[Unasylva]]'' 50(4).</ref> This collaborates with the World Bank report in 2000 which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation, efficiency, accountability and equity \"by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely\".<ref>World Bank 1988</ref>\n\nMany reasons point to the advocacy of decentralization of forest. (i) Integrated rural development projects often fail because they are top-down projects that did not take local people's needs and desires into account.<ref>Lutz, E and Caldcott (1999) Decentralisation and biodiversity conservation, A World bank symposium. Washington: The World Bank</ref> (ii) National government sometimes have legal authority over vast forest areas that they cannot control,<ref>Enters and Anderson (1999) Rethinking the decentralisation and devolution of biodiversity conservation ''Unasylva 50(4)''</ref> thus, many protected area projects result in increased [[biodiversity loss]] and greater social conflict.<ref>Enters and Anderson (1999)</ref>\nWithin the sphere of forest management, as state earlier, the most effective option of decentralization is \"devolution\"-the transfer of power to locally accountable authority.<ref>Rondinelli and Cheema (1981)Decentralization and development, ''sage publication, London''</ref> However, apprehension about local governments is not unfounded. They are often short of resources, may be staffed by people with low education and are sometimes captured by local elites who promote clientelist relation rather than democratic participation.<ref>M, Larson \"Natural resource and degradation in Nicaragua: Are local governments up to the job?</ref> Enters and Anderson (1999) point that the result of community-based projects intended to reverse the problems of past central approaches to conservation and development have also been discouraging.\n\nBroadly speaking, the goal of forest conservation has historically not been met when, in contrast with [[land use]] changes; driven by demand for food, fuel and profit.<ref>Larson (2002)</ref> It is necessary to recognize and advocate for better forest governance more strongly given the importance of forest in meeting basic [[human needs]] in the future and maintaining ecosystem and biodiversity as well as addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation goal.<ref name=agrawal2008 /> Such advocacy must be coupled with financial incentives for government of [[developing countries]] and greater governance role for local government, civil society, private sector and NGOs on behalf of the \"communities\".<ref>Rondinelli and Chaeema (1999)</ref>\n\n===National Forest Funds===\nThe development of National Forest Funds is one way to address the issue of financing sustainable forest management.<ref>{{cite book|title=2012 STUDY ON FOREST FINANCING|date=June 2012|publisher=Advisory Group on Finance Collaborative Partnership on Forests|url=https://www.un.org/esa/forests/pdf/AGF_Study_July_2012.pdf}}</ref>  National forest funds (NFFs) are dedicated financing mechanisms managed by public institutions designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matta|first1=Rao|title=Towards effective national forest funds, FAO Forestry Paper 174|date=2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|isbn=978-92-5-108706-0|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4359e.pdf}}</ref> As of 2014, there are 70 NFFs operating globally.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matta|first1=Rao|title=Towards effective national forest funds, FAO Forestry Paper 174|date=2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|isbn=978-92-5-108706-0|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4359e.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Forest genetic resources==\nAppropriate use and long-term conservation of [[forest genetic resources]] (FGR) is a part of sustainable forest management.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ([[FAO]])|title=The State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources|journal=[[Commission on genetic resources for food and agriculture]]|date=2014|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3825e.pdf}}</ref> In particular when it comes to the adaptation of [[forests]] and [[forest management]] to [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Koskela, J., Buck, A. and Teissier du Cros, E.

The foundations of a new incentive mechanism for encouraging sustainable forest management measures was therefore laid in hopes of reducing world deforestation rates. This mechanism was formalized and adopted as REDD in November of 2010 at the Climate Change Conference in Cancun by UNFCCC COP 16.  Developing country who are signatories of the [[Convention_on_Biological_Diversity|CBD]] were encouraged to take measure to implement REDD activities in the hope of becoming more active contributors of global efforts aimed at the mitigation greenhouse gas. After all, deforestation and forest degradation account for roughly 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions<ref>{{cite web |title=What is REDD+? |url=https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/what-redd |website=The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) |publisher=Forest Carbon Partnership Facility |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>. The REDD activities are formally tasked with \u201creducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\u201d.  REDD+ works in 3 phases. The first phase consists of developing viable strategies, while the second phase begins work on technology development and technology transfer to the developing countries taking part in REDD+ activities. The last phase measures and reports the implementation of the action taken <ref>{{cite web |title=REDD+ and Biodiversity Benefits |url=https://www.cbd.int/forest/redd-plus/ |website=Convention on Biological Diversity |publisher=United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref> \n\n=== Canada ===\nThe province of [[Ontario]] has its own sustainable forest management measures in place.

Periodically measured indicators reveal the direction of change with respect to each criterion.\n\nCriteria and indicators of sustainable forest management are widely used and many countries produce national reports that assess their progress toward sustainable forest management.  There are nine international and regional criteria and indicators initiatives, which collectively involve more than 150 countries.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/004/AC135E/AC135E00.HTM Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management: A Compendium].

Seven common thematic areas of sustainable forest management have emerged based on the criteria of the nine ongoing regional and international criteria and indicators initiatives.  The seven thematic areas are:\n\n* Extent of forest resources\n* [[Biological diversity]]\n* [[Forest health]] and vitality\n* Productive functions of forest resources\n* Protective functions of forest resources\n* Socio-economic functions\n* Legal, policy and institutional framework.\n\nThis consensus on common thematic areas (or criteria) effectively provides a common, implicit definition of sustainable forest management.  The seven thematic areas were acknowledged by the international forest community at the fourth session of the [[United Nations Forum on Forests]] and the 16th session of the Committee on Forestry.<ref>[https://www.un.org/esa/forests/ United Nations Forum on Forests] (2004)</ref><ref>[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/007/Y9203e/y9203e09.htm#TopOfPage Committee on Forestry] (2003)</ref> These thematic areas have since been enshrined in the [[United Nations Forum on Forests#Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests|Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests]] as a reference framework for sustainable forest management to help achieve the purpose of the instrument.\n\nOn January 5, 2012, the Montr\u00e9al Process, Forest Europe, the International Tropical Timber Organization, and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], acknowledging the seven thematic areas, endorsed a [http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=33400 joint statement of collaboration] to improve global forest-related data collection and reporting and avoiding the proliferation of monitoring requirements and associated reporting burdens.\n\n==Ecosystem approach==\nThe [[Ecosystem Approach]] has been prominent on the agenda of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) since 1995 . The [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] definition of the Ecosystem Approach and a set of principles for its application were developed at an expert meeting in [[Malawi]] in 1995, known as the Malawi Principles.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/006/Y4773E/y4773e0e.htm Malawi Principles]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223012737/http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=%2FDOCREP%2F006%2FY4773E%2Fy4773e0e.htm |date=23 December 2007 }}</ref> The definition, 12 principles and 5 points of \"operational guidance\" were adopted by the fifth Conference of Parties (COP5) in 2000.  The [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] definition is as follows\n\n<blockquote>The ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. Application of the ecosystem approach will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Convention. An ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization, which encompasses the essential structures, processes, functions and interactions among organisms and their environment. It recognizes that humans, with their [[cultural diversity]], are an integral component of many ecosystems.</blockquote>\n\nSustainable forest management was recognized by parties to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] in 2004 (Decision VII/11 of COP7) to be a concrete means of applying the Ecosystem Approach to forest ecosystems.  The two concepts, sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach, aim at promoting conservation and management practices which are environmentally, socially and economically sustainable, and which generate and maintain benefits for both present and future generations. In Europe, the MCPFE and the Council for the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS) jointly recognized sustainable forest management to be consistent with the Ecosystem Approach in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.org/ |title=MCPFE |publisher=MCPFE |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategyguide.org/stracont.html |title=Council |publisher=Strategyguide.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategyguide.org/straabou.html |title=Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy |publisher=Strategyguide.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategyguide.org/200602/Documents/STRA-CO%202006%202%20_EA%20SFM%20JT%20STMT__E_final.pdf |title=PEBLD Strategy |publisher=Strategyguide.org |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Independent certification==\n{{Main|Certified wood}}\nGrowing [[environmental awareness]] and [[consumer demand]] for more socially responsible businesses helped third-party forest [[certification]] emerge in the 1990s as a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations.\n\nThere are many potential users of certification, including: forest managers, scientists, policy makers, investors, environmental advocates, business consumers of wood and paper, and individuals.\n\nWith third-party [[Certified wood|forest certification]], an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. Forest certification verifies that forests are well-managed \u2013 as defined by a particular standard \u2013 and chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale.\n\nThis rise of certification led to the emergence of several different systems throughout the world. As a result, there is no single accepted forest management standard worldwide, and each system takes a somewhat different approach in defining standards for sustainable forest management.\n\nIn its 2009\u20132010 Forest Products Annual Market Review United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated: \"Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |title=2009\u20132010 Forest Products Annual Market Review Page 121 |format=PDF |access-date=30 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThird-party forest certification is an important tool for those seeking to ensure that the paper and wood products they purchase and use come from forests that are well-managed and legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product procurement practices can be a centerpiece for comprehensive wood and paper policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.<ref>{{cite web|author=Erin Malec |url=http://www.metafore.org/?s=147 |title=Forest Certification Resource Center |publisher=Metafore.org |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere are more than fifty certification standards worldwide, addressing the diversity of forest types and tenures. Globally, the two largest umbrella certification programs are:\n* [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC)\n* [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC)\n\nThe area of forest certified worldwide is growing slowly.

A significant barrier for many forest managers in [[developing countries]] is that they lack the capacity to undergo a certification audit and maintain operations to a certification standard.<ref>Auer, M.

Thus, [[decentralization]] of management offers an alternative solution to forest governance.<ref name=agrawal2008 />\n\nThe shifting of natural resource management responsibilities from central to state and local governments, where this is occurring, is usually a part of broader decentralization process.<ref>Margulis, S. {{date?}}. 'Decentralized environmental management', Annual World Bank Report.</ref> According to Rondinelli and Cheema (1983), there are four distinct decentralization options: these are: (i) Privatization \u2013 the transfer of authority from the central government to non-governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision, (ii) Delegation \u2013 centrally nominated local authority, (iii) [[Devolution]] \u2013 transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and (iv) Deconcentration \u2013 the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government.\nThe major key to effective decentralization is increased broad-based participation in local-public decision making. In 2000, the World Bank report reveals that local government knows the needs and desires of their constituents better than the national government, while at the same time, it is easier to hold local leaders accountable. From the study of West African tropical forest, it is argued that the downwardly accountable and/or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency, development and equity.<ref>Ribott, (1990). 'Accountable representation and power in Participatory and decentralized environmental management', ''[[Unasylva]]'' 50(4).</ref> This collaborates with the World Bank report in 2000 which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation, efficiency, accountability and equity \"by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely\".<ref>World Bank 1988</ref>\n\nMany reasons point to the advocacy of decentralization of forest. (i) Integrated rural development projects often fail because they are top-down projects that did not take local people's needs and desires into account.<ref>Lutz, E and Caldcott (1999) Decentralisation and biodiversity conservation, A World bank symposium. Washington: The World Bank</ref> (ii) National government sometimes have legal authority over vast forest areas that they cannot control,<ref>Enters and Anderson (1999) Rethinking the decentralisation and devolution of biodiversity conservation ''Unasylva 50(4)''</ref> thus, many protected area projects result in increased [[biodiversity loss]] and greater social conflict.<ref>Enters and Anderson (1999)</ref>\nWithin the sphere of forest management, as state earlier, the most effective option of decentralization is \"devolution\"-the transfer of power to locally accountable authority.<ref>Rondinelli and Cheema (1981)Decentralization and development, ''sage publication, London''</ref> However, apprehension about local governments is not unfounded. They are often short of resources, may be staffed by people with low education and are sometimes captured by local elites who promote clientelist relation rather than democratic participation.<ref>M, Larson \"Natural resource and degradation in Nicaragua: Are local governments up to the job?</ref> Enters and Anderson (1999) point that the result of community-based projects intended to reverse the problems of past central approaches to conservation and development have also been discouraging.\n\nBroadly speaking, the goal of forest conservation has historically not been met when, in contrast with [[land use]] changes; driven by demand for food, fuel and profit.<ref>Larson (2002)</ref> It is necessary to recognize and advocate for better forest governance more strongly given the importance of forest in meeting basic [[human needs]] in the future and maintaining ecosystem and biodiversity as well as addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation goal.<ref name=agrawal2008 /> Such advocacy must be coupled with financial incentives for government of [[developing countries]] and greater governance role for local government, civil society, private sector and NGOs on behalf of the \"communities\".<ref>Rondinelli and Chaeema (1999)</ref>\n\n===National Forest Funds===\nThe development of National Forest Funds is one way to address the issue of financing sustainable forest management.<ref>{{cite book|title=2012 STUDY ON FOREST FINANCING|date=June 2012|publisher=Advisory Group on Finance Collaborative Partnership on Forests|url=https://www.un.org/esa/forests/pdf/AGF_Study_July_2012.pdf}}</ref>  National forest funds (NFFs) are dedicated financing mechanisms managed by public institutions designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matta|first1=Rao|title=Towards effective national forest funds, FAO Forestry Paper 174|date=2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|isbn=978-92-5-108706-0|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4359e.pdf}}</ref> As of 2014, there are 70 NFFs operating globally.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matta|first1=Rao|title=Towards effective national forest funds, FAO Forestry Paper 174|date=2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|isbn=978-92-5-108706-0|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4359e.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Forest genetic resources==\nAppropriate use and long-term conservation of [[forest genetic resources]] (FGR) is a part of sustainable forest management.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ([[FAO]])|title=The State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources|journal=[[Commission on genetic resources for food and agriculture]]|date=2014|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3825e.pdf}}</ref> In particular when it comes to the adaptation of [[forests]] and [[forest management]] to [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Koskela, J., Buck, A. and Teissier du Cros, E.

The foundations of a new incentive mechanism for encouraging sustainable forest management measures was therefore laid in hopes of reducing world deforestation rates. This mechanism was formalized and adopted as REDD in November of 2010 at the Climate Change Conference in Cancun by UNFCCC COP 16.  Developing country who are signatories of the [[Convention_on_Biological_Diversity|CBD]] were encouraged to take measure to implement REDD activities in the hope of becoming more active contributors of global efforts aimed at the mitigation greenhouse gas. After all, deforestation and forest degradation account for roughly 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions<ref>{{cite web |title=What is REDD+? |url=https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/what-redd |website=The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) |publisher=Forest Carbon Partnership Facility |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>. The REDD activities are formally tasked with \u201creducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\u201d.  REDD+ works in 3 phases. The first phase consists of developing viable strategies, while the second phase begins work on technology development and technology transfer to the developing countries taking part in REDD+ activities. The last phase measures and reports the implementation of the action taken <ref>{{cite web |title=REDD+ and Biodiversity Benefits |url=https://www.cbd.int/forest/redd-plus/ |website=Convention on Biological Diversity |publisher=United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity |accessdate=4 march 2020}}</ref> \n\n=== Canada ===\nThe province of [[Ontario]] has its own sustainable forest management measures in place.

Vikernes \"stated that he was fed up with being harassed by the authorities, and that the police investigation into the Black Metal scene should be stopped\".

[[Beherit (band)|Beherit]]'s mainman 'Nuclear Holocausto' used the rivalry to play a series of telephone pranks on [[Mika Luttinen]] (of Impaled Nazarene) in which he would call him in the dead of the night playing nursery rhymes at high speed on a cassette recorder. At the time, Luttinen maintained that the messages were threats from Norwegian black metallers.<ref>''The End of a Legend? Isten smokes Holocaust Vengeance out of BEHERIT''.

It attracted massive media attention when it was revealed that its members had been responsible for two murders and a wave of church burnings in Norway.\n\nThe scene had an ethos and the core members referred to themselves as \"The Black Circle\" or \"Black Metal Inner Circle\". It consisted primarily of young men, many of whom gathered at the record shop [[#Helvete, ideology and the \"Black Circle\"|Helvete]] (\"Hell\") in [[Oslo]]. In interviews, they voiced extreme [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] and [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] views, presenting themselves as a [[cult]]-like group of militant [[Satanism|Satanists]] who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil. They adopted pseudonyms and appeared in photographs wearing \"[[corpse paint]]\" and wielding medieval weaponry. The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those it deemed to be \"trve\"<ref>{{cite book | title = 'TRVE': The Norwegian Black Metal Scene: A Subcultural Study of Transgression through Music | first =  Kevin | last = Hoffin | date = July 1, 2017 | ISBN = 978-1973703860}}</ref> or committed. Musical integrity was highly important and artists wanted black metal to remain [[Underground music|underground]] and uncorrupted.\n\nIn August 1993, several of its members were arrested and in May 1994 were convicted variously for arson, murder, assault and possession of explosives. Most showed no remorse for their actions at the time. The Norwegian media covered events closely, but the reporting was often [[sensationalist]]. Some referred to them as \"Satanic terrorists\" and one Norwegian TV channel interviewed a woman who claimed Satanists had sacrificed her child and killed her dog.<ref name=grude>{{cite video |people=Grude, Torstein (director) |year=1998 |title=Satan rir Media |medium=motion picture |location=Norway |publisher=Grude, Torstein}}</ref> The early Norwegian black metal scene has since been the subject of books and documentaries.\n\n==Musical innovations==\n[[File:God Seed Hellfest 2009 14.jpg|thumb|Norwegian black metal singer [[Gaahl]] wearing corpsepaint]]\nDuring the 1980s, ''black metal'' was a loose grouping of a handful of heavy metal bands who shared Satanic lyrics, although most of the \"first wave\" bands referred to [[Satanism]] only for shock value.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground]] |last=Moynihan |first=Michael |author2=S\u00f8derlind, Didrik |edition=revised and expanded |year=2003 |origyear=1998 |publisher=Feral House |location= |isbn= |page=16}}</ref> During 1990\u20131992, a number of Norwegian artists, who were strongly influenced by those bands, began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music. The surge of interest and popularity that followed is often referred to as the \"second wave of black metal\". The Norwegian bands developed the style of their 1980s forebears as a distinct genre of heavy metal music. This was partly thanks to a new style of guitar playing developed by [[Snorre Ruch|Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch]] of Stigma Diabolicum/[[Thorns (band)|Thorns]] and [[Euronymous|\u00d8ystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]] of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], in which guitarists played full chords using all the strings of the guitar in place of [[power chords]] using only two or three strings.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=6 October 2007}}</ref><ref name=decibel>{{cite book |title=Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces |last=Mudrian |first=Albert |year=2009 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location= |isbn=030681806X |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780306818066/page/184 184] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780306818066/page/184 }}</ref> [[Fenriz|Gylve 'Fenriz' Nagell]] of [[Darkthrone]] has credited them with this innovation in a number of interviews.

The journalists were summoned to an apartment and, allegedly, warned they would be shot if the police were called.<ref name=LoC95-97/> There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and warned the attacks would continue.

According to ''Lords of Chaos'', citing a police report, Vikernes knocked on their door and \"virtually forced his way into the suite\". He was \"dressed in [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]], carrying two large knives in his belt, and flanked by the two young men who apparently behaved as if they were his bodyguards or henchmen\". Vikernes \"stated that he was fed up with being harassed by the authorities, and that the police investigation into the Black Metal scene should be stopped\".

[[Impaled Nazarene]] printed \"No orders from Norway accepted\" and ''\"{{lang|fi|Kuolema Norjan kusip\u00e4ille!}}\"'' ('Death to the arseholes of Norway!') on early pressings of their first album and innuendo and snarky comments were made in fanzines. [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]]'s mainman 'Nuclear Holocausto' used the rivalry to play a series of telephone pranks on [[Mika Luttinen]] (of Impaled Nazarene) in which he would call him in the dead of the night playing nursery rhymes at high speed on a cassette recorder. At the time, Luttinen maintained that the messages were threats from Norwegian black metallers.<ref>''The End of a Legend? Isten smokes Holocaust Vengeance out of BEHERIT''.

Both the fore and hind legs are covered in small spines. The [[pronotum]] covers only the first [[tergite]] of the abdominal region.

In his research, he traveled to the Antioch Sand Dunes in California, where the specimen was originally collected, but he found no other living specimens. It took several years of researching until he was finally able to identify the species as ''Neduba extincta''.

It is said that in prehistorical times climate alterations separated the dunes from the Mojave, thus isolating species living on the dunes.

Cheaper {{okina}}ukuleles are generally made from [[plywood]] or [[laminate]] woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a [[tonewood]] such as [[spruce]]. More expensive {{okina}}ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as [[mahogany]]. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawai{{okina}}i, called [[koa]].\n\nTypically, {{okina}}ukuleles have a figure-eight body shape similar to that of a small [[acoustic guitar]]. They are also often seen in non-standard shapes, such as cutaway shape and an oval, usually called a \"pineapple\" {{okina}}ukulele, invented by the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company, or a boat-paddle shape, and occasionally a square shape, often made out of an old wooden cigar box.\n\nThese instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in [[Course (music)|courses]], giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.)  The strings themselves were originally made of [[catgut]].  Modern {{okina}}ukuleles use [[nylon]] [[polymer]] strings, with many variations in the material, such as [[fluorocarbon]], [[aluminium]] (as winding on lower-pitched strings),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.martinguitar.com/strings/ukulele/|title=Ukulele Strings - C.F. Martin & Co.|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and Nylgut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquilausa.com/uke_strings.html|title=Aquila Nylgut Ukulele Strings, wholesale source for retailers and dealers|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nInstruments with 6 or 8 strings in four courses are often called taropatches, or taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. They were once common in a concert size, but now the tenor size is more common for six-string taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. The six string, four course version, has two single and two double courses, and is sometimes called a Lili'u, though this name also applies to the eight-string version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|title=110mb.com - Want to start a website?|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621113819/http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|archive-date=2013-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Eight-string baritone taropatches exist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/kamaka-baritone-8-string-hf-48.html|title=Kamaka Baritone 8 String HF-48|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and, 5-string tenors have also been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/shop-by/popular-models/kala-ka-atp5-ctg-solid-cedar-top-5-string-tenor.html|title=Kala -KA-ATP-CTG Solid Cedar Top Tenor Slothead -Gloss Finish|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> A Javanese {{okina}}ukulele commonly has only three strings.

They are now manufactured with only three strings.\n[[File:3 ukes.jpg|thumb|140px|Soprano pineapple ukulele, baritone ukulele and taropatch baritone ukulele.]]\n\n==Types and sizes==\nCommon types of {{okina}}ukuleles include soprano (standard {{okina}}ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone.  Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or \"pocket uke\"), bass, and [[Contrabass|contrabass]] {{okina}}ukuleles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamorindamusic.com/uke_101.htm|title=Lamorinda Music|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The soprano, often called \"standard\" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller [[tenor guitar]]) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/news-features-the-story-behind-the-kala-u-bass/|title=The story behind the wildly popular Kala U-Bass|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunaguitars.com/query?upc=819998182960|title=Uke Baritone Bass w/Preamp Tattoo - Luna Guitars|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Size and popular tunings of standard {{okina}}ukulele types:'''\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px\"   | Type\n! style=\"width:96px\"   | Alternate<br/>names\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | Typical<br/>length\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | [[Scale (string instruments)|Scale<br/> length]]<ref>The \u201cscale\u201d is the length of the playable part of the strings, from the nut at the top to the bridge at the bottom.</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"  | Frets\n! style=\"width:60px;\"  | Range<ref>Exact range depends on the tuning and the number of frets.</ref>\n! style=\"width:100px;\" | Common<br />tuning<ref>On the soprano, concert, and tenor instruments, the most common tuning results in a \"bottom\" string that is ''not'' the lowest in ''pitch'', as it is tuned a 5th&nbsp;higher than the next string (and a major&nbsp;2nd below the \"top\" string).

This is known as a \"[[reentrant tuning]]\"; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording. \n\nMore rarely used with the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> linear tuning, or \"low G\" tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower:  G<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret. \n\nAnother common tuning for the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is the higher string-tension D<sup>6</sup> tuning (or simply D tuning), A<sub>4</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, one step higher than the G<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub> tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s.  D<sup>6</sup> tuning is said by some{{by whom|date=November 2019}} to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D<sup>6</sup> tuning with a low fourth string, A<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes called \"Canadian tuning\" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, and extensive use by [[James Hill (Canadian musician)|James Hill]] and [[J. Chalmers Doane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jameshillmusic.com/faq#tuning|title=James Hill - FAQ|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhether C<sup>6</sup> or D<sup>6</sup> tuning should be the \"standard\" tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate.  There are historic and popular ukulele methods that have used each.<ref>Tranquada, J.; ''The Ukulele:  A History''; University of Hawaii Press; Honolulu:  2012.  0824-83634-0  According to Tranquanda, \"\"This is an old and seemingly never-ending argument. While the pioneering methods of Kaai (1906) and Rollinson (1909) both use C tuning, a sampling of the methods that follow give a sense of the unresolved nature of the debate: Kealakai (1914), D tuning; Bailey (1914), C tuning; Kia (1914), D tuning; Kamiki (1916), D tuning; Guckert (1917), C tuning; Stumpf (1917), D tuning.\"</ref>\n\nFor the concert and tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C<sup>6</sup> tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor {{okina}}ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.\n\nThe baritone {{okina}}ukulele usually uses linear G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>\u2013B<sub>3</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar. \n\nBass {{okina}}ukuleles are tuned similarly to bass guitars: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub> for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E<sub>2</sub>\u2013A<sub>2</sub>\u2013D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>, for Ohana type metal-string basses.\n\nSopranino {{okina}}ukulele tuning is less standardized. They usually are tuned re-entrantly, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>5</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>.\n\nAs is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players.

Cheaper {{okina}}ukuleles are generally made from [[plywood]] or [[laminate]] woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a [[tonewood]] such as [[spruce]]. More expensive {{okina}}ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as [[mahogany]]. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawai{{okina}}i, called [[koa]].\n\nTypically, {{okina}}ukuleles have a figure-eight body shape similar to that of a small [[acoustic guitar]]. They are also often seen in non-standard shapes, such as cutaway shape and an oval, usually called a \"pineapple\" {{okina}}ukulele, invented by the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company, or a boat-paddle shape, and occasionally a square shape, often made out of an old wooden cigar box.\n\nThese instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in [[Course (music)|courses]], giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.)  The strings themselves were originally made of [[catgut]].  Modern {{okina}}ukuleles use [[nylon]] [[polymer]] strings, with many variations in the material, such as [[fluorocarbon]], [[aluminium]] (as winding on lower-pitched strings),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.martinguitar.com/strings/ukulele/|title=Ukulele Strings - C.F.

They were once common in a concert size, but now the tenor size is more common for six-string taropatch {{okina}}ukuleles. The six string, four course version, has two single and two double courses, and is sometimes called a Lili'u, though this name also applies to the eight-string version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|title=110mb.com - Want to start a website?|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621113819/http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/u.htm|archive-date=2013-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Eight-string baritone taropatches exist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/kamaka-baritone-8-string-hf-48.html|title=Kamaka Baritone 8 String HF-48|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> and, 5-string tenors have also been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theukulelesite.com/shop-by/popular-models/kala-ka-atp5-ctg-solid-cedar-top-5-string-tenor.html|title=Kala -KA-ATP-CTG Solid Cedar Top Tenor Slothead -Gloss Finish|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> A Javanese {{okina}}ukulele commonly has only three strings. Apparently, it's a modern innovation, as the first generation of  three-stringed {{okina}}ukuleles were four stringed instruments with one string removed. They are now manufactured with only three strings.\n[[File:3 ukes.jpg|thumb|140px|Soprano pineapple ukulele, baritone ukulele and taropatch baritone ukulele.]]\n\n==Types and sizes==\nCommon types of {{okina}}ukuleles include soprano (standard {{okina}}ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone.  Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or \"pocket uke\"), bass, and [[Contrabass|contrabass]] {{okina}}ukuleles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamorindamusic.com/uke_101.htm|title=Lamorinda Music|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The soprano, often called \"standard\" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller [[tenor guitar]]) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/news-features-the-story-behind-the-kala-u-bass/|title=The story behind the wildly popular Kala U-Bass|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunaguitars.com/query?upc=819998182960|title=Uke Baritone Bass w/Preamp Tattoo - Luna Guitars|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Size and popular tunings of standard {{okina}}ukulele types:'''\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px\"   | Type\n! style=\"width:96px\"   | Alternate<br/>names\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | Typical<br/>length\n! style=\"width:65px;\"  | [[Scale (string instruments)|Scale<br/> length]]<ref>The \u201cscale\u201d is the length of the playable part of the strings, from the nut at the top to the bridge at the bottom.</ref>\n! style=\"width:45px;\"  | Frets\n! style=\"width:60px;\"  | Range<ref>Exact range depends on the tuning and the number of frets.</ref>\n! style=\"width:100px;\" | Common<br />tuning<ref>On the soprano, concert, and tenor instruments, the most common tuning results in a \"bottom\" string that is ''not'' the lowest in ''pitch'', as it is tuned a 5th&nbsp;higher than the next string (and a major&nbsp;2nd below the \"top\" string).

This is known as a \"[[reentrant tuning]]\"; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording. \n\nMore rarely used with the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> linear tuning, or \"low G\" tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower:  G<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret. \n\nAnother common tuning for the soprano {{okina}}ukulele is the higher string-tension D<sup>6</sup> tuning (or simply D tuning), A<sub>4</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, one step higher than the G<sub>4</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub> tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s.  D<sup>6</sup> tuning is said by some{{by whom|date=November 2019}} to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D<sup>6</sup> tuning with a low fourth string, A<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>, is sometimes called \"Canadian tuning\" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, and extensive use by [[James Hill (Canadian musician)|James Hill]] and [[J. Chalmers Doane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jameshillmusic.com/faq#tuning|title=James Hill - FAQ|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhether C<sup>6</sup> or D<sup>6</sup> tuning should be the \"standard\" tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate.  There are historic and popular ukulele methods that have used each.<ref>Tranquada, J.; ''The Ukulele:  A History''; University of Hawaii Press; Honolulu:  2012.  0824-83634-0  According to Tranquanda, \"\"This is an old and seemingly never-ending argument. While the pioneering methods of Kaai (1906) and Rollinson (1909) both use C tuning, a sampling of the methods that follow give a sense of the unresolved nature of the debate: Kealakai (1914), D tuning; Bailey (1914), C tuning; Kia (1914), D tuning; Kamiki (1916), D tuning; Guckert (1917), C tuning; Stumpf (1917), D tuning.\"</ref>\n\nFor the concert and tenor {{okina}}ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C<sup>6</sup> tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor {{okina}}ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.\n\nThe baritone {{okina}}ukulele usually uses linear G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>\u2013B<sub>3</sub>\u2013E<sub>4</sub>, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar. \n\nBass {{okina}}ukuleles are tuned similarly to bass guitars: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub> for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E<sub>2</sub>\u2013A<sub>2</sub>\u2013D<sub>3</sub>\u2013G<sub>3</sub>, for Ohana type metal-string basses.\n\nSopranino {{okina}}ukulele tuning is less standardized. They usually are tuned re-entrantly, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G<sup>6</sup> tuning: D<sub>5</sub>\u2013G<sub>4</sub>\u2013B<sub>4</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>.\n\nAs is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players. For example, special string sets are available to tune the baritone {{okina}}ukulele in linear C<sup>6</sup>. Some players tune {{okina}}ukuleles like other four-string instruments such as the [[mandolin]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://ourpastimes.com/how-to-play-a-ukulele-like-a-mandolin-12450760.html\n| title=How to Play a Ukulele Like a Mandolin\n| first=Robert\n| last=Russell\n| date=15 September 2017\n| publisher=Our Pastimes\n| accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref> Venezuelan [[cuatro (Venezuela)|cuatro]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHF_g96Es3Q\n| title=Cuatro Tuning On a Ukulele\n| first=Ken\n| last=Middleton\n| date=2 May 2018\n| accessdate=19 November 2019\n| via=YouTube}}</ref> or [[dotara]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyr1iT27MzE\n| title=Ukulele Dotara Style Tuning - \u0987\u0989\u0995\u09be\u09b2\u09c7\u09b2\u09bf \u09a6\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u0987\u09b2 \u099f\u09bf\u0989\u09a8\u09bf\u0982\n| first=Rahatul Islam\n| last=Ovi\n| date=24 April 2017\n| publisher=Rahatul & Dukulele\n| accessdate=24 April 2017\n| via=YouTube}}</ref> Ukuleles may also be tuned to [[open tuning]]s, similar to the Hawaiian [[slack key]] style.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Kimura\n| first = Heeday\n| title = How to Play Slack Key Ukulule\n| date =\n| pages =\n| isbn = }}</ref>\n\n==Related instruments==\n{{okina}}Ukulele varieties include hybrid instruments such as the [[guitalele]] (also called guitarlele), [[banjo ukulele|banjo {{okina}}ukulele]] (also called banjolele), [[harp ukulele|harp {{okina}}ukulele]], [[lap steel ukulele|lap steel {{okina}}ukulele]], and the [[ukelin]]. It is very common to find {{okina}}ukuleles mixed with other stringed instruments because of the amount of strings and the easy playing ability. There is also an [[Electric ukulele|electrically amplified variant]] of the {{okina}}ukulele. The [[resonator ukulele|resonator {{okina}}ukulele]] produces sound by one or more spun aluminum cones ([[resonators]]) instead of the wooden soundboard, giving it a distinct and louder tone. The [[Tahitian ukulele|Tahitian {{okina}}ukulele]], another variant, is usually carved from a single piece of wood,<ref name=\"Studies2003\">{{cite book|author=University of the South Pacific.
