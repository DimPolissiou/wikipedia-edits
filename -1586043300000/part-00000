Located to the West of [[Intracoastal Waterway|the Intracoastal Waterway]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], in an area planned by [[International Paper]] in the late 1990s. Regarded as the \"bedroom community\" of [[Myrtle Beach]], Carolina Forest is comprised of [[private community|private subdivisions]] and [[gated community|gated communities]], the majority of which are planned around a multitude of lakes with resort-style amenities. Several [[golf course community|golf course communities]] are also located here, most notably is River Oaks Golf Plantation.\n\n== Geography ==\nCarolina Forest is situated West of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] in Myrtle Beach, and East of Gardner Lacy Road; between [[U.S. Route 501 in South Carolina|U.S. Route 501]] and International Drive. Located between 3.8 and 8 miles from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the average Carolina Forest home is roughly less than 7 miles from [[Grand Strand]] beaches.\n\nCarolina Forest was developed in and around existing [[Longleaf Pine]] forests and [[Eastern savannas of the United States|savannas]], within the [[Waccamaw River]] watershed, part of the greater lower watershed of the [[Pee Dee River]]. The topography of the region between the Waccamaw River and the Intracoastal Waterway is spotted with [[Carolina Bay|Carolina Bays]], which are elliptical-shaped depressions in the land, often filled with thick vegetation and rich in [[biodiversity]]. \n\n== Roads and Intersections ==\n[[Carolina Forest Boulevard]] serves as the main artery of Carolina Forest, other main roads include River Oaks Drive, International Drive, Postal Way, Renee Drive, and [[South Carolina Highway 31|Carolina Bays Parkway]]\n\n== History ==\nCarolina Forest was once part of a larger tract of land in eastern [[Horry County]] called the Buist Tract. Originally owned by Burroughs & Chapin, International Paper bought the {{convert|30000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} Buist Tract in 1937. It was used as part of the Conway Bombing and Gunnery Range during World War II. In 1960, the company donated part of the tract for what is now [[Coastal Carolina University]] (located several miles away from Carolina Forest). In 1989, approximately {{convert|9000|acre|km2|0}} north of Carolina Forest were donated to the state to form the [[Lewis Ocean Bay Heritage Preserve]]. The [[planned unit development]] was initially created to have 20,000 single and multi-family homesites when completed. Most of the development follows the Carolina Forest Master Plan, developed cooperatively between International Paper and the Horry County Government.\n\n\nIn June 1994, Kylee Mueller sold {{convert|125|acre|km2}} of the remaining {{convert|21000|acre|km2|0}} of the Buist Tract to Horry County Schools for development of Carolina Forest Elementary School, Carolina Forest Middle School, and [[Carolina Forest High School]]. In addition, {{convert|350|acre|km2}} were sold to form a golf course and residential property.\n\nBy the end of 1994, International Paper began to sell more of its land. Due to the lack of funding from other sources for road infrastructure, the first {{convert|1.25|mi|km|2}} of Carolina Forest Boulevard were completed by November 1995 by International Paper. Further expansions of both Carolina Forest Boulevard and River Oaks Drive (creating an {{convert|11|mi|km|0|adj=on}} loop) would open up {{convert|11000|acre|km2|0}} to development west of the Intracoastal Waterway. Carolina Forest Boulevard was completed in December 1996, with River Oaks Drive being completed in December 1997.<ref>\"IP Asks Permission to Lengthen Road,\" Mike Soraghan, ''The Sun News'', July 4, 1996</ref>\n\nOn December 2, 1997, [[Horry County]] council voted to freeze zoning rules in an {{convert|11|sqmi|km2|0}} area of Carolina Forest for 20 years in exchange for land to build parks and roads in an 8-3 vote on the development agreement. An estimated 35,000 people would live in the {{convert|7073|acre|km2|0}} covered by the agreement. In the agreement, Horry County did not require International Paper to widen [[Carolina Forest Boulevard]] or River Oaks Drive to four lanes. Land would be given to the county at no cost for the then-future [[South Carolina Highway 31|SC Highway 31]] north and south of the [[Robert Grissom Parkway]] bridge. Approximately {{convert|140|acre|km2}} was set aside for future schools, which would include Ocean Bay Elementary and Middle Schools. Because nearly half of Carolina Forest was open space, the area was exempt from future open space directives set by Horry County.<ref>\"Horry County Approves Carolina Forest Pact,\" Mike Soraghan, ''The Sun News'', December 3, 1997</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Carolina Forest's population increased from 3400 in 2000 to 21,000.<ref name=Dickerson>\"Carolina Forest community hoping for benefits from redistricting,\" Brad Dickerson, ''The Sun News'', June 16, 2011</ref>\n\n==Subdivisions==\nSource:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carolinaforestmyrtlebeach.net/subdivisions/index.html|title=Carolina Forest Subdivisions}}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=12em}}\n*Alta Surf\n*Amherst\n*Ashford Estates\n*Ashley Park\n*Avalon\n*Bay Meadows\n*Bella Vita\n*BelleGrove Preserve\n*Berkshire Forest\n*Black Creek Plantation\n*Brookberry\n*Brighton Lakes\n*Brightwater\n*Canterbury\n*Carolina Willows\n*Clear Pond\n*Covington Lake\n*Covington Lake East\n*Carolina Waterway Plantation\n*Emerald Forest\n*Fairways\n*Garden Homes\n*Indigo Bay\n*Inverness\n*Legends\n*Myrtle Beach National\n*Oakmont Village\n*Ocean Bay Townhomes\n*Perry Place\n*Plantation Lakes\n*River Landing\n*River Oaks\n*Sago Plantation\n*Sawgrass East\n*Seaside Grove\n*Southcreek\n*Southgate\n*Spring Lake\n*Summerlyn\n*The Battery\n*The Bluffs\n*The Cloisters\n*The Farm\n*The Parks\n*The Reserve\n*The Vinings\n*Turnberry\n*Turning Pines\n*Village of Dreams\n*Walkers Woods\n*Waterbridge\n*Waterford Plantation\n*Waterway Palms Plantation\n*Waterway Village\n*Westwood Estates\n*Windsor Green\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Education==\nCarolina Forest has a [[public library]], a branch of the Horry County Memorial Library.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.greenvillelibrary.org/locations-and-hours | title=Locations & Hours | publisher=Greenville County Library System | accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/36941942/carolina-forest-the-20-year-plan Carolina Forest Master Plan]\n\n{{Myrtle Beach}}\n{{Horry County, South Carolina}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Horry County, South Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name          = Carolina Forest, South Carolina\n| settlement_type        = [[Unincorporated area|Unincorporated community]]\n| image_skyline          = Carolina Forest Sign.jpg\n| image_flag             = \n| image_seal             = \n| image_caption          = Sign at the entrance to Carolina Forest at the intersection of US 501 and Carolina Forest Boulevard\n| pushpin_map            = USA South Carolina#USA\n| pushpin_label          = Carolina Forest, SC\n| map_caption            = \n| coordinates            = {{coord|33|45|29|N|78|58|1|W|region:US-SC|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type       = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name       = United States\n| subdivision_type1      = [[U.S. state|State]]\n| subdivision_name1      = [[South Carolina]]\n| subdivision_type2      = [[List of cities in South Carolina|City]]\n| subdivision_name2      = [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]]\n| subdivision_type3      = [[List of counties in South Carolina|County]]\n| subdivision_name3      = [[Horry County, South Carolina|Horry]]\n| area_magnitude         = 1 E8\n| area_total_km2         = 65.7\n| area_land_km2          = 63.9\n| area_water_km2         = 2.8\n| elevation_m            = 12\n| elevation_ft           = 39\n| postal_code_type       = [[ZIP Code]]\n| postal_code            = 29579\n| area_code              = 843\n<!--\n|population_as_of = 2000\n|population_total = 5009\n-->\n| population_total       = 33966\n| population_as_of       = 2014 est.\n| population_density_km2 = 124.1\n| timezone               = [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|EST]]\n| utc_offset             = -5\n| website                = \n}}\n'''Carolina Forest''' is an upscale [[planned community]] in [[Myrtle Beach]], [[South Carolina]], United States.

Located between 3.8 and 8 miles from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the average Carolina Forest home is roughly less than 7 miles from [[Grand Strand]] beaches.\n\nCarolina Forest was developed in and around existing [[Longleaf Pine]] forests and [[Eastern savannas of the United States|savannas]], within the [[Waccamaw River]] watershed, part of the greater lower watershed of the [[Pee Dee River]]. The topography of the region between the Waccamaw River and the Intracoastal Waterway is spotted with [[Carolina Bay|Carolina Bays]], which are elliptical-shaped depressions in the land, often filled with thick vegetation and rich in [[biodiversity]]. \n\n== Roads and Intersections ==\n[[Carolina Forest Boulevard]] serves as the main artery of Carolina Forest, other main roads include River Oaks Drive, International Drive, Postal Way, Renee Drive, and [[South Carolina Highway 31|Carolina Bays Parkway]]\n\n== History ==\nCarolina Forest was once part of a larger tract of land in eastern [[Horry County]] called the Buist Tract. Originally owned by Burroughs & Chapin, International Paper bought the {{convert|30000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} Buist Tract in 1937. It was used as part of the Conway Bombing and Gunnery Range during World War II. In 1960, the company donated part of the tract for what is now [[Coastal Carolina University]] (located several miles away from Carolina Forest). In 1989, approximately {{convert|9000|acre|km2|0}} north of Carolina Forest were donated to the state to form the [[Lewis Ocean Bay Heritage Preserve]]. The [[planned unit development]] was initially created to have 20,000 single and multi-family homesites when completed. Most of the development follows the Carolina Forest Master Plan, developed cooperatively between International Paper and the Horry County Government.\n\n\nIn June 1994, Kylee Mueller sold {{convert|125|acre|km2}} of the remaining {{convert|21000|acre|km2|0}} of the Buist Tract to Horry County Schools for development of Carolina Forest Elementary School, Carolina Forest Middle School, and [[Carolina Forest High School]]. In addition, {{convert|350|acre|km2}} were sold to form a golf course and residential property.\n\nBy the end of 1994, International Paper began to sell more of its land. Due to the lack of funding from other sources for road infrastructure, the first {{convert|1.25|mi|km|2}} of Carolina Forest Boulevard were completed by November 1995 by International Paper. Further expansions of both Carolina Forest Boulevard and River Oaks Drive (creating an {{convert|11|mi|km|0|adj=on}} loop) would open up {{convert|11000|acre|km2|0}} to development west of the Intracoastal Waterway. Carolina Forest Boulevard was completed in December 1996, with River Oaks Drive being completed in December 1997.<ref>\"IP Asks Permission to Lengthen Road,\" Mike Soraghan, ''The Sun News'', July 4, 1996</ref>\n\nOn December 2, 1997, [[Horry County]] council voted to freeze zoning rules in an {{convert|11|sqmi|km2|0}} area of Carolina Forest for 20 years in exchange for land to build parks and roads in an 8-3 vote on the development agreement. An estimated 35,000 people would live in the {{convert|7073|acre|km2|0}} covered by the agreement. In the agreement, Horry County did not require International Paper to widen [[Carolina Forest Boulevard]] or River Oaks Drive to four lanes. Land would be given to the county at no cost for the then-future [[South Carolina Highway 31|SC Highway 31]] north and south of the [[Robert Grissom Parkway]] bridge. Approximately {{convert|140|acre|km2}} was set aside for future schools, which would include Ocean Bay Elementary and Middle Schools. Because nearly half of Carolina Forest was open space, the area was exempt from future open space directives set by Horry County.<ref>\"Horry County Approves Carolina Forest Pact,\" Mike Soraghan, ''The Sun News'', December 3, 1997</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Carolina Forest's population increased from 3400 in 2000 to 21,000.<ref name=Dickerson>\"Carolina Forest community hoping for benefits from redistricting,\" Brad Dickerson, ''The Sun News'', June 16, 2011</ref>\n\n==Subdivisions==\nSource:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carolinaforestmyrtlebeach.net/subdivisions/index.html|title=Carolina Forest Subdivisions}}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=12em}}\n*Alta Surf\n*Amherst\n*Ashford Estates\n*Ashley Park\n*Avalon\n*Bay Meadows\n*Bella Vita\n*BelleGrove Preserve\n*Berkshire Forest\n*Black Creek Plantation\n*Brookberry\n*Brighton Lakes\n*Brightwater\n*Canterbury\n*Carolina Willows\n*Clear Pond\n*Covington Lake\n*Covington Lake East\n*Carolina Waterway Plantation\n*Emerald Forest\n*Fairways\n*Garden Homes\n*Indigo Bay\n*Inverness\n*Legends\n*Myrtle Beach National\n*Oakmont Village\n*Ocean Bay Townhomes\n*Perry Place\n*Plantation Lakes\n*River Landing\n*River Oaks\n*Sago Plantation\n*Sawgrass East\n*Seaside Grove\n*Southcreek\n*Southgate\n*Spring Lake\n*Summerlyn\n*The Battery\n*The Bluffs\n*The Cloisters\n*The Farm\n*The Parks\n*The Reserve\n*The Vinings\n*Turnberry\n*Turning Pines\n*Village of Dreams\n*Walkers Woods\n*Waterbridge\n*Waterford Plantation\n*Waterway Palms Plantation\n*Waterway Village\n*Westwood Estates\n*Windsor Green\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Education==\nCarolina Forest has a [[public library]], a branch of the Horry County Memorial Library.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.greenvillelibrary.org/locations-and-hours | title=Locations & Hours | publisher=Greenville County Library System | accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/36941942/carolina-forest-the-20-year-plan Carolina Forest Master Plan]\n\n{{Myrtle Beach}}\n{{Horry County, South Carolina}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Horry County, South Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "MBSC2030", "label": "safe", "comment": "Geography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Forest,_South_Carolina"}

Directed by [[Ernest Schoedsack]] and featuring special effects by Buzz Gibson and [[Willis O'Brien]], the film stars [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]], [[Helen Mack]] and [[Frank Reicher]]. The film is the lesser-known sequel to ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and was released just nine months after its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the general requirement is that a plot summary should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nThe story picks up about a month after the previous film and follows the further adventures of filmmaker [[Carl Denham]], now implicated in numerous lawsuits following the destruction brought by [[King Kong|Kong]] and threatened with criminal indictment. Denham leaves [[New York City]] with the captain of the ''Venture'', Captain Englehorn, who is certain it is just a matter of time before he is similarly served. Their efforts to make money shipping cargo around the Orient are less than successful. In the Dutch port of Dakang, Denham is amused to see there is a \"show\" being presented, so he and Englehorn attend. It turns out to be a series of performing monkeys, capped by a song (\"Runaway Blues\") sung by a young woman named Hilda Petersen.\n\nThat night, Hilda's father, who runs the show, stays up drinking with a Norwegian skipper named Nils Helstrom, who had lost his ship under questionable circumstances. The two men fight, and Mr. Petersen is killed, their tent burns down, and Hilda releases all the monkeys. Denham and Englehorn run into Helstrom, who was the man who sold Denham the map to [[Skull Island|Kong's Island]], and he convinces the two that there was a treasure on the island. Denham and Englehorn agree to go back and try to retrieve it. Later, Denham meets Hilda while she is trying to recapture her monkeys and tries to cheer her up. Despite her pleas, Denham refuses to take her with him when he leaves Dakang. Shortly after they put out to sea, however, Hilda is found stowing away on board.\n\nHelstrom talks Hilda into silence and incites a mutiny on board the ''Venture'', but the sailors want no more captains and throw him overboard alongside Denham, Englehorn, Hilda, and the cook, Charlie. The five land on Kong's Island where they discover the natives blame Denham for the destruction of their village and they are forced to move to a different part of the island. There, Denham and Hilda meet and befriend an albino [[Gorilla]] just over twice the height of a human. Denham assumes the [[ape]] to be Kong's son and names him \"Little Kong\". Meanwhile, Englehorn, Charlie, and Helstrom are attacked by a ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' which chases them into a cave. Denham and Hilda are attacked by a giant [[Cave bear]], but Little Kong fights and fends it off by swinging a tree branch. Denham bandages Little Kong's injured finger in return. Despite the fact that Helstrom made up his story out of desperation, Denham finds an authentic treasure. Shortly afterwards, Little Kong, Denham, and Hilda are attacked by a [[dragon]]-like ''[[Nothosaurus]]'' which Little Kong kills, while Helstrom tries to escape in the lifeboat but is killed by a [[Sea serpent]]. Hilda, Englehorn, and Charlie run to the lifeboat, but an earthquake strikes the island, and it begins to sink into the ocean. Little Kong has his foot stuck on the top of a mountain, and he sacrifices his life to save Denham by holding him above the water until he can be rescued. The film ends with Denham and Hilda throwing their lot in together, as the treasure will make all four of them (including Englehorn and Charlie) wealthy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as [[Carl Denham]]\n* [[Helen Mack]] as Hilda Petersen\n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Captain Englehorn\n* John Marston as Nils Helstrom\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1906)|Victor Wong]] as Charlie\n* [[Ed Brady (actor)|Ed Brady]] as Red\n* [[Noble Johnson]] as Native Chief (uncredited)\n* [[Steve Clemente]] as Witch Doctor (uncredited)\n* [[Harry Tenbrook]] as Tommy (uncredited)\n* [[Clarence Wilson (actor)|Clarence Wilson]] as Hilda Petersen's Father (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe film was produced and released in 1933, immediately following the success of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), and was a modest success. Script writer [[Ruth Rose]] intentionally made no attempt to make a serious film on the logic that it could not surpass the first. She stated \"If you can't make it bigger, make it funnier.\" For his part, Denham's actor, [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]], preferred the second film, saying that the sequel offered more character development for Carl Denham.\n\nThe script/screenplay featured scenes of tribal warfare and a climactic [[dinosaur]] stampede during the massive cyclone/earthquake that sinks Skull Island at the film's end. The stampede was going to utilize the models that had been built for ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'' (1931) (most being used in the earlier ''King Kong''). However these sequences were never filmed due to the film's tight budget and shooting schedule.\n\nHelen Mack's character is never referred to as \"Hilda\" in the film. The name \"Hilda\" is used in the credits and her father refers to her as \"Madame Helene\" during the show. Denham just calls her \"kid\".\n\nLittle Kong was referred to as \"Kiko\" during production, but this name is never used in the film or in publicity materials.\n\nSeveral models which were used for ''King Kong'' were also utilized for the production of ''The Son of Kong''. The \"long face\" Kong [[armature (sculpture)|armature]], from the log bridge and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' fight sequences, was also used for \"Little Kong\". It is the only known model of Kong still in existence and is currently owned by [[History of film|film historian]] and collector Bob Burns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodlostandfound.net/props/kingkong.html|title=Props - King Kong Armature|website=Hollywoodlostandfound.net|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> Also, the same ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' model used for the raft scene in ''King Kong'' can be glimpsed in the sea as the island is sinking. The [[Stop motion|stop motion animation]] in the film (done by [[Willis O'Brien]] who also did the effects in ''King Kong'') is not as extensive as in the original, but included is a sequence where a ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' chases the explorers through the jungle. Today, the original ''Styracosaurus'' model is owned by director [[Peter Jackson]], who remade ''King Kong'' in [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005]].\n\n==Creatures==\n* \"Little Kong\": Kong's albino son who is half his size and much friendlier.

Unknown if it drowned or escaped when the island sank.\n* [[Cave bear]]: chases Denham and Hilda before being driven off by Little Kong. Drowned when the island sank (off-screen).\n* ''[[Nothosaurus]]'': creature that attacks Denham, Hilda and Little Kong after they uncover the treasure, only to be killed by Little Kong. It seems to resemble a large ''[[Protorosaurus]]''. The strangling was similar to the snake-like ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' strangling from ''King Kong''.\n* ''[[Sea serpent]]'': devours Helstrom when he attempts to escape in the lifeboat. The part of the sea serpent's snapping jaws was similar to the ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' snapping jaws from King Kong.
