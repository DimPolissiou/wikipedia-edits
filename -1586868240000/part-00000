The city is the [[political]], [[economic]] and [[cultural]] centre and capital of the [[Upper Palatinate]].\n\nThe [[medieval]] centre of the city is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

The [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name '''Radasbona''' was the oldest given to a settlement near the present city. Around AD 90, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] built a fort there.\n\nIn 179, a new Roman fort, called '''Castra Regina''' (\"fortress by the river Regen\"), was built for [[Legio III Italica|Legio III ''Italica'']] during the reign of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].<ref name=BeerAdvocate>{{cite web |title=Iron Age Braumeisters of the Teutonic Forests |work=BeerAdvocate |url=http://beeradvocate.com/news/stories_read/668 |accessdate=2006-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613083419/http://beeradvocate.com/news/stories_read/668 |archivedate=2006-06-13 }}</ref> It was an important camp at the most northerly point of the Danube; it corresponds to what is today the core of Regensburg's Old City or ''Altstadt'' east of the Obere and Untere Bachgasse and west of the Schwanenplatz. It is believed that as early as in late Roman times the city was the seat of a bishop, and [[St Boniface]] re-established the [[Diocese of Regensburg|Bishopric of Regensburg]] in 739.\n\nFrom the early 6th century, Regensburg was the seat of a ruling family known as the [[Agilolfings]]. From about 530 to the first half of the 13th century, it was the capital of Bavaria. Regensburg remained an important city during the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. In 792, Regensburg hosted the ecclesiastical section of Charlemagne's General Assembly, the bishops in council who condemned the heresy of [[adoptionism]] taught by their Spanish counterparts, [[Elipandus]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Felix of Urgell]]. After the partition of the Carolingian Empire in 843, the city became the seat of the Eastern [[Franks|Frankish]] ruler, [[Louis the German|Louis II]] the German. Two years later, fourteen [[Bohemia]]n princes came to Regensburg to receive [[baptism]] there. This was the starting point of [[Christianization]] of the [[Czechs]], and the diocese of Regensburg became the mother diocese of that of [[Prague]]. These events had a wide impact on the cultural history of the Czech lands, as they were consequently part of the Roman Catholic and not the [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Conversion of East and South Slavs|Slavic-Orthodox world]]. A memorial plate at St John's Church (the alleged place of the baptism) was unveiled a few years ago, commemorating the incident in the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[German language|German]] languages.\n\nIn 800 the city had 23,000 inhabitants, and by 1000 this had increased to 40,000.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Urban World History: An Economic and Geographical Perspective|author=Tellier, L.N.|date=2009|publisher=Presses de l'Universite du Quebec|isbn=9782760522091|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC|page=266|accessdate=2014-10-10}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 December 899 [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], descendant of [[Charlemagne]], died at Regensburg.<ref>The Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Vol. III, Part II (page 623), printed by William Clowes and Sons, Stamford Street, London, 1844</ref>\n\nIn 1096, on the way to the [[First Crusade]], [[Peter the Hermit]] led a mob of [[crusaders]] that attempted to force the mass conversion of the [[Jews]] of Regensburg and killed all those who resisted.<ref>''Herald of Destiny'' by [[Berel Wein]].

In 1486, Regensburg became part of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], but its independence was restored by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] ten years later. In the city took place the [[Diet of Regensburg (1541)|Diet]] of 1541, was adopted the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1542 and its Town Council remained entirely [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. From 1663 to 1806, the city was the permanent seat of the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire, which became known as the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg]]. Thus, Regensburg was one of the central towns of the Empire, attracting visitors in large numbers.\n[[File:Regensburg Reichstag 1711.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial arrival at the Imperial Diet, 1711]]\n\nA minority of the population remained [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and Roman Catholics were denied civic rights (''{{lang|de|B\u00fcrgerrecht}}''). Although the Imperial city had adopted the Reformation, the town remained the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop and several [[abbey]]s. Three of these, [[St. Emmeram]], [[Niederm\u00fcnster]] and [[Oberm\u00fcnster]], were free imperial estates within the Holy Roman Empire, meaning that they were granted a seat and a vote at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (''{{lang|de|Reichstag}}''). So there was the unique situation that the town of Regensburg comprised five independent \"states\" (in terms of the Holy Roman Empire): the Protestant city itself, the Roman Catholic bishopric, and the three [[monastery|monasteries]]. In addition, it was seen as the traditional capital of the region Bavaria (not the state), acted as functional co-capital of the Empire (second to the Emperor's court at Vienna) due to the presence of the Perpetual Diet, and it was the residence of the Emperor's Commissary-Principal to the same diet, who with one very brief exception was a prince himself (for many years the Prince of [[Thurn and Taxis]], still resident in the town).\n\n\n===Modern history===\nIn 1803 the city lost its status as an imperial city following its incorporation into the [[Principality of Regensburg]]. It was handed over to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop-Elector of Mainz]] and Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire [[Carl von Dalberg]] in compensation for the territory of the Electorate of Mainz located on the left bank of the Rhine which had been annexed by France under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in 1801. The Archbishopric of Mainz was formally transferred to Regensburg. Dalberg united the bishopric, the monasteries, and the town itself, making up the [[Principality of Regensburg]] (''F\u00fcrstentum Regensburg''). Dalberg strictly modernized public life. Most importantly, he awarded equal rights to Protestants and Roman Catholics alike. In 1810 Dalberg ceded Regensburg to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], he himself being compensated by the award of [[Fulda]] and [[Hanau]] to him under the title of \"[[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand Duke of Frankfurt]]\".\n\nBetween April 19 and April 23, 1809, Regensburg was the scene of the [[Battle of Ratisbon]] between forces commanded by [[Henri Gatien Bertrand]] and Napoleon himself and the retreating [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] forces. The city was eventually overrun, after supplies and [[ammunition]] ran out. The city suffered severe damage during the fight, with about 150 houses being burnt and others being looted. [[Robert Browning]]'s poem \"[[Incident at the French Camp]]\" describes the battle from the French perspective, but is filled with historical errors.\n\n===Nazism and World War II===\nThe [[Regensburg Synagogue]] was destroyed on November 9, 1938, during [[Kristallnacht]].\n\nRegensburg was home to both a [[Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109]] aircraft factory and an oil refinery, which were bombed by the Allies on August 17, 1943, in the [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission]], and on February 5, 1945, during the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]]. Although both targets were badly damaged, Regensburg itself suffered little damage from the Allied [[strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]], and the nearly intact medieval city centre is listed as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The city's most important cultural loss was that of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church of [[Oberm\u00fcnster]], which was destroyed in a March 1945 air raid and was not rebuilt (the [[bell tower|belfry]] survived). Also, Regensburg's slow economic recovery after the war ensured that historic buildings were not torn down and replaced by newer ones. When the upswing in restoration{{clarify|date=August 2019}} reached Regensburg in the late 1960s, the prevailing mindset had turned in favour of preserving the city's heritage.\n\n===History after 1945===\n[[File:Ukrainian Camp Post - Regensburg postmark.png|left|thumb|135px|[[Cancellation (mail)|Cancellation]] by the Ukrainian Camp Post at Regensburg DP Camp]]\nBetween 1945 and 1949, Regensburg was the site of the largest [[Displaced persons camp|Displaced persons (DP) camp]] in Germany. At its peak in 1946\u20131947, the workers' district of Ganghofersiedlung housed almost 5,000 [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and 1,000 non-Ukrainian refugees and displaced persons. With the approval of U.S. Military Government in the American [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied Occupation Zone]], Regensburg and other DP camps organised their own camp postal service. In Regensburg, the camp postal service began operation on December 11, 1946.<ref>Karen Lemiski, [http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2001/050120.shtml Focus on Philately: The stamps of Regensburg, Camp Ganghofersiedlung] in ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', February 4, 2001, No. 5, Vol. LXIX</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, Regensburg invested heavily in technical and social [[infrastructure]] to attract industry. [[Siemens]] was the first multinational company to come to Regensburg, a milestone in the city's development after World War II. In 1965, [[Regensburg University]] was founded; [[Regensburg University of Applied Sciences]] was established in 1971. The second multinational company, [[BMW]], came in 1986 to build up a large production plant. Since the 1990s, several well-known [[hightech]] companies have been located in Regensburg, such as Infineon and OSRAM, contributing to the city's current wealth.\n\nIn 1997, Regensburg was awarded the [[Europe Prize]] for its outstanding achievements in [[European integration]].<ref name=\"europeprize\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europeprize.net/|title=Europeprize|publisher=europeprize.net|accessdate=2015-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801085000/http://europeprize.net/|archive-date=2015-08-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Heritage Committee]] listed Regensburg's Old Town a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in July 2006.

Its most famous sights are located mainly in the Old Town, such as:\n\n*The ''[[Regensburg Cathedral|Dom]]'' (Cathedral) is an example of pure German [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and is regarded as the main work of Gothic architecture in Bavaria. It was founded in 1275 and completed in 1634, with the exception of the towers, which were finished in 1869. The interior contains numerous interesting monuments, including one of [[Peter Vischer]]'s masterpieces. Adjoining the [[cloister]]s are two chapels which predate the cathedral. One of these, known as the old cathedral, goes back perhaps to the 8th century.<ref name=EB1911/> The official choir for the liturgical music at St Peter's Cathedral is the famous [[Regensburger Domspatzen]] (\"cathedral sparrows\").\n*The [[Stone Bridge (Regensburg)|stone bridge]], built 1135\u20131146, is a highlight of medieval bridge building. The knights of the 2nd and 3rd [[crusade]]s used it to cross the [[Danube]] on their way to the [[Holy Land]].\n*The [[Regensburg Sausage Kitchen]] is a major tourist destination, but locals eat there as well. It was originally built as the construction headquarters of the stone bridge and now lies adjacent to it.\n*Remains of the Roman fortress' walls including the Porta Praetoria\n*The [[Scots Monastery, Regensburg|Church of St. James]], also called ''Schottenkirche'', a Romanesque basilica of the 12th century, derives its name from the monastery of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Benedictine]]s ([[Scoti]]) to which it was attached; the principal doorway is covered with very unusual grotesque carvings.<ref name=EB1911/> It stands next to the ''Jakobstor'', a medieval city gate named after it.\n*The old parish church of [[Ulrich of Zell|St. Ulrich]] is a good example of the Transition style of the 13th century, and contains a valuable antiquarian collection.<ref name=EB1911/> It houses the diocesan museum of religious art.\n*Examples of the Romanesque basilica style are the church of [[Oberm\u00fcnster]], dating from 1010, and the abbey church of [[St. Emmeram]], built in the 13th century, remarkable as one of the few German churches with a detached bell tower. The cloisters of the ancient abbey, one of the oldest in Germany, are still in a fair state of preservation. In 1809 the conventual buildings were converted into a palace for the prince of [[Thurn und Taxis|Thurn and Taxis]], hereditary postmaster-general of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=EB1911/>\n*The Adler-Apotheke, located nearby the Regensburg Cathedral, was founded in 1610 and is one of the oldest pharmacies in Regensburg.

It is believed that as early as in late Roman times the city was the seat of a bishop, and [[St Boniface]] re-established the [[Diocese of Regensburg|Bishopric of Regensburg]] in 739.\n\nFrom the early 6th century, Regensburg was the seat of a ruling family known as the [[Agilolfings]]. From about 530 to the first half of the 13th century, it was the capital of Bavaria. Regensburg remained an important city during the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. In 792, Regensburg hosted the ecclesiastical section of Charlemagne's General Assembly, the bishops in council who condemned the heresy of [[adoptionism]] taught by their Spanish counterparts, [[Elipandus]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Felix of Urgell]]. After the partition of the Carolingian Empire in 843, the city became the seat of the Eastern [[Franks|Frankish]] ruler, [[Louis the German|Louis II]] the German. Two years later, fourteen [[Bohemia]]n princes came to Regensburg to receive [[baptism]] there. This was the starting point of [[Christianization]] of the [[Czechs]], and the diocese of Regensburg became the mother diocese of that of [[Prague]]. These events had a wide impact on the cultural history of the Czech lands, as they were consequently part of the Roman Catholic and not the [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Conversion of East and South Slavs|Slavic-Orthodox world]]. A memorial plate at St John's Church (the alleged place of the baptism) was unveiled a few years ago, commemorating the incident in the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[German language|German]] languages.\n\nIn 800 the city had 23,000 inhabitants, and by 1000 this had increased to 40,000.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Urban World History: An Economic and Geographical Perspective|author=Tellier, L.N.|date=2009|publisher=Presses de l'Universite du Quebec|isbn=9782760522091|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC|page=266|accessdate=2014-10-10}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 December 899 [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], descendant of [[Charlemagne]], died at Regensburg.<ref>The Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Vol. III, Part II (page 623), printed by William Clowes and Sons, Stamford Street, London, 1844</ref>\n\nIn 1096, on the way to the [[First Crusade]], [[Peter the Hermit]] led a mob of [[crusaders]] that attempted to force the mass conversion of the [[Jews]] of Regensburg and killed all those who resisted.<ref>''Herald of Destiny'' by [[Berel Wein]].

In 1486, Regensburg became part of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], but its independence was restored by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] ten years later. In the city took place the [[Diet of Regensburg (1541)|Diet]] of 1541, was adopted the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1542 and its Town Council remained entirely [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. From 1663 to 1806, the city was the permanent seat of the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire, which became known as the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg]]. Thus, Regensburg was one of the central towns of the Empire, attracting visitors in large numbers.\n[[File:Regensburg Reichstag 1711.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial arrival at the Imperial Diet, 1711]]\n\nA minority of the population remained [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and Roman Catholics were denied civic rights (''{{lang|de|B\u00fcrgerrecht}}''). Although the Imperial city had adopted the Reformation, the town remained the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop and several [[abbey]]s. Three of these, [[St. Emmeram]], [[Niederm\u00fcnster]] and [[Oberm\u00fcnster]], were free imperial estates within the Holy Roman Empire, meaning that they were granted a seat and a vote at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (''{{lang|de|Reichstag}}''). So there was the unique situation that the town of Regensburg comprised five independent \"states\" (in terms of the Holy Roman Empire): the Protestant city itself, the Roman Catholic bishopric, and the three [[monastery|monasteries]]. In addition, it was seen as the traditional capital of the region Bavaria (not the state), acted as functional co-capital of the Empire (second to the Emperor's court at Vienna) due to the presence of the Perpetual Diet, and it was the residence of the Emperor's Commissary-Principal to the same diet, who with one very brief exception was a prince himself (for many years the Prince of [[Thurn and Taxis]], still resident in the town).\n\n\n===Modern history===\nIn 1803 the city lost its status as an imperial city following its incorporation into the [[Principality of Regensburg]]. It was handed over to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop-Elector of Mainz]] and Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire [[Carl von Dalberg]] in compensation for the territory of the Electorate of Mainz located on the left bank of the Rhine which had been annexed by France under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in 1801. The Archbishopric of Mainz was formally transferred to Regensburg. Dalberg united the bishopric, the monasteries, and the town itself, making up the [[Principality of Regensburg]] (''F\u00fcrstentum Regensburg''). Dalberg strictly modernized public life. Most importantly, he awarded equal rights to Protestants and Roman Catholics alike. In 1810 Dalberg ceded Regensburg to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], he himself being compensated by the award of [[Fulda]] and [[Hanau]] to him under the title of \"[[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand Duke of Frankfurt]]\".\n\nBetween April 19 and April 23, 1809, Regensburg was the scene of the [[Battle of Ratisbon]] between forces commanded by [[Henri Gatien Bertrand]] and Napoleon himself and the retreating [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] forces. The city was eventually overrun, after supplies and [[ammunition]] ran out. The city suffered severe damage during the fight, with about 150 houses being burnt and others being looted. [[Robert Browning]]'s poem \"[[Incident at the French Camp]]\" describes the battle from the French perspective, but is filled with historical errors.\n\n===Nazism and World War II===\nThe [[Regensburg Synagogue]] was destroyed on November 9, 1938, during [[Kristallnacht]].\n\nRegensburg was home to both a [[Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109]] aircraft factory and an oil refinery, which were bombed by the Allies on August 17, 1943, in the [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission]], and on February 5, 1945, during the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]]. Although both targets were badly damaged, Regensburg itself suffered little damage from the Allied [[strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]], and the nearly intact medieval city centre is listed as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The city's most important cultural loss was that of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church of [[Oberm\u00fcnster]], which was destroyed in a March 1945 air raid and was not rebuilt (the [[bell tower|belfry]] survived). Also, Regensburg's slow economic recovery after the war ensured that historic buildings were not torn down and replaced by newer ones. When the upswing in restoration{{clarify|date=August 2019}} reached Regensburg in the late 1960s, the prevailing mindset had turned in favour of preserving the city's heritage.\n\n===History after 1945===\n[[File:Ukrainian Camp Post - Regensburg postmark.png|left|thumb|135px|[[Cancellation (mail)|Cancellation]] by the Ukrainian Camp Post at Regensburg DP Camp]]\nBetween 1945 and 1949, Regensburg was the site of the largest [[Displaced persons camp|Displaced persons (DP) camp]] in Germany. At its peak in 1946\u20131947, the workers' district of Ganghofersiedlung housed almost 5,000 [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and 1,000 non-Ukrainian refugees and displaced persons. With the approval of U.S. Military Government in the American [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied Occupation Zone]], Regensburg and other DP camps organised their own camp postal service. In Regensburg, the camp postal service began operation on December 11, 1946.<ref>Karen Lemiski, [http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2001/050120.shtml Focus on Philately: The stamps of Regensburg, Camp Ganghofersiedlung] in ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', February 4, 2001, No. 5, Vol. LXIX</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, Regensburg invested heavily in technical and social [[infrastructure]] to attract industry. [[Siemens]] was the first multinational company to come to Regensburg, a milestone in the city's development after World War II. In 1965, [[Regensburg University]] was founded; [[Regensburg University of Applied Sciences]] was established in 1971. The second multinational company, [[BMW]], came in 1986 to build up a large production plant. Since the 1990s, several well-known [[hightech]] companies have been located in Regensburg, such as Infineon and OSRAM, contributing to the city's current wealth.\n\nIn 1997, Regensburg was awarded the [[Europe Prize]] for its outstanding achievements in [[European integration]].<ref name=\"europeprize\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europeprize.net/|title=Europeprize|publisher=europeprize.net|accessdate=2015-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801085000/http://europeprize.net/|archive-date=2015-08-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Heritage Committee]] listed Regensburg's Old Town a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in July 2006.

While the average temperature of {{convert|8.5|C}} in the period from 1971-2000 is slightly above the German average ({{convert|7.8|C|F|disp=or}}), still only 5 of the 80 cities in Germany above 100000 inhabitants are colder. The average precipitation of {{convert|636|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}} per year ranges slightly below the German average (approximately  {{convert|700|mm|inch|disp=or|abbr=off}} ). For the newer period from 1981-2010 the average temperature and precipitation rose up to {{convert|8.9|C}} respectively {{convert|658|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}}.

Its most famous sights are located mainly in the Old Town, such as:\n\n*The ''[[Regensburg Cathedral|Dom]]'' (Cathedral) is an example of pure German [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and is regarded as the main work of Gothic architecture in Bavaria. It was founded in 1275 and completed in 1634, with the exception of the towers, which were finished in 1869. The interior contains numerous interesting monuments, including one of [[Peter Vischer]]'s masterpieces. Adjoining the [[cloister]]s are two chapels which predate the cathedral. One of these, known as the old cathedral, goes back perhaps to the 8th century.<ref name=EB1911/> The official choir for the liturgical music at St Peter's Cathedral is the famous [[Regensburger Domspatzen]] (\"cathedral sparrows\").\n*The [[Stone Bridge (Regensburg)|stone bridge]], built 1135\u20131146, is a highlight of medieval bridge building. The knights of the 2nd and 3rd [[crusade]]s used it to cross the [[Danube]] on their way to the [[Holy Land]].\n*The [[Regensburg Sausage Kitchen]] is a major tourist destination, but locals eat there as well. It was originally built as the construction headquarters of the stone bridge and now lies adjacent to it.\n*Remains of the Roman fortress' walls including the Porta Praetoria\n*The [[Scots Monastery, Regensburg|Church of St. James]], also called ''Schottenkirche'', a Romanesque basilica of the 12th century, derives its name from the monastery of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Benedictine]]s ([[Scoti]]) to which it was attached; the principal doorway is covered with very unusual grotesque carvings.<ref name=EB1911/> It stands next to the ''Jakobstor'', a medieval city gate named after it.\n*The old parish church of [[Ulrich of Zell|St. Ulrich]] is a good example of the Transition style of the 13th century, and contains a valuable antiquarian collection.<ref name=EB1911/> It houses the diocesan museum of religious art.\n*Examples of the Romanesque basilica style are the church of [[Oberm\u00fcnster]], dating from 1010, and the abbey church of [[St. Emmeram]], built in the 13th century, remarkable as one of the few German churches with a detached bell tower. The cloisters of the ancient abbey, one of the oldest in Germany, are still in a fair state of preservation. In 1809 the conventual buildings were converted into a palace for the prince of [[Thurn und Taxis|Thurn and Taxis]], hereditary postmaster-general of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=EB1911/>\n*The Adler-Apotheke, located nearby the Regensburg Cathedral, was founded in 1610 and is one of the oldest pharmacies in Regensburg. The ancient interior and historical vessels can be viewed.\n*Wealthy patrician families competed against each other to see who could build the highest tower of the city. In 1260, the ''Goldener Turm'' (golden tower) was built on Wahlenstra\u00dfe.\n*The Old Town Hall, dating in part from the 14th century, contains the rooms occupied by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] from 1663 to 1806.<ref name=EB1911/>\n*The ''Gasthof zum Goldenen Kreuz'' (Golden Cross Inn) is also of historical interest: it is where [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] made the acquaintance of Barbara Blomberg, the mother of [[Don John of Austria]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n*The statue of [[John of Austria]], born 1547 in Regensburg, was erected 1978 on the fourth centenary of his death and is a copy of a [[John of Austria (Messina)|monument in Messina, Italy]]. \n*Perhaps the most pleasant modern building in the city is the Gothic villa of the king of Bavaria on the bank of the Danube.<ref name=EB1911/> The grounds are now opened to public and known as VillaPark.\n*Among the public institutions of the city are the public [[library]], picture gallery, [[botanical garden]], and the institute for the making of [[stained glass]].

The abbey is situated on a peninsula in the Danube, on the so-called \"Weltenburg Narrows\" or \"Danube Gorge\". The monastery, founded by Irish or Scottish monks in about 620, is held to be the oldest monastery in Bavaria.\n\nTo the east of Regensburg lies the [[Bavarian Forest]] with its [[Bavarian Forest National Park|National Park]], one of the most visited [[protected area]]s in Germany.\n\nRegensburg is on the designated heritage route, the Route of Emperors and Kings.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Route of Emperors and Kings |url=https://www.routeofemperorsandkings.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===Museums and exhibitions===\nAltogether Regensburg is home to 20 museums.

Then there is the Imperial diet museum (Reichstagsmuseum) in the Old Town Hall describing the life during the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Its main attractions are an original torture chamber and the Reichssaal, the rooms occupied by the Imperial diet from 1663 to 1806.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Regensburg |volume=23 |page=37 |inline=1}}</ref> The Kepler Memorial House (Keplerged\u00e4chtnishaus) illustrates the life of the famous astronomer and mathematician [[Johannes Kepler]]. The Municipal [[Art Gallery]] ''Leerer Beutel'' offers art collections, film events and cultural festivals. Over the last years, the city added several outdoor museums to its cultural landscape, the so-called ''document'' sites. These give an overview on specific topics such as [[Roman History|Roman]], [[Jewish history|Jewish]] and [[Bavarian history]].\n\nBesides, there are the [[diocese]] museums (Bistumsmuseen) of Regensburg and a branch of the [[Bavarian National Museum]] located in the St. Emmeram's Abbey, which contains the Princely Treasure Chamber of the family [[Thurn and Taxis]]. The Domschatzmuseum where church treasures, monstrances and tapestries are displayed is in [[Regensburg Cathedral|St. Peter's Cathedral]].

The [[Velodrom (Regensburg)|Velodrom]] Theater presents musicals and plays. In the Haidplatz Theater mainly literary and modern plays are performed, whereas the Turmtheater at the Goliathplatz shows modern plays as well, but also cabarets, musicals and plays for children.\n\n===Music===\nRegensburg is home to the famous [[Regensburger Domspatzen]]. The [[Regensburger Schlossfestspiele]] has been held in the inner courtyard of the [[St. Emmeram's Abbey]] every July from 2003, sponsored by the former princely house of [[Thurn und Taxis]]. Meanwhile, those were attracting musicians like [[Elton John]], [[David Garrett (musician)|David Garrett]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], or [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]]. Modern music styles, especially [[jazz]], are presented every summer during the Bavarian Jazz weekend during which over a hundred bands, combos, and soloists perform in the Old Town. In 2015, the House of Music was opened, giving a home to skilled musicians and their education.\n\n===Film and cinema===\nThe international [[short film]] season is hosted annually in Regensburg. It is a non-profit event and takes place every March, being one of the most important of its type in Germany.

Regensburg has two [[open air cinemas]] as well.\n\n===Buildings===\nThe Old Town of Regensburg with nearly 1,500 [[listed buildings]] offers a huge cultural diversity from Roman to modern times.\n\n===Recreation===\nThe Old Town of Regensburg is surrounded completely by a [[green belt]]. Numerous inner-city parks like the City Park (''Stadtpark''), the ''Herzogspark'', the ''D\u00f6rnbergpark'', the ''Villapark'' or the university's [[botanical garden]] are a source for recreation and leisure.\n\n===Memorial sites===\nThe city of Regensburg has erected several memorials to combat [[racism]], [[Social tolerance|intolerance]] towards minorities, and all other forms of contempt for [[human dignity]]:\n* Memorial for victims of the [[Holocaust]]\n* Memorial for victims of forced \"[[euthanasia]]\"\n* Memorial for [[concentration camp]] inmates and [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]\n* Memorial for [[violence against women]]\n\nParticular to Regensburg are the so-called ''Stolpersteine'' (stumbling stones) in honor of Jews deported during [[Nazism]].\n\n===Events===\nTwice a year the Regensburg Dult takes place.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Environmental Management Systems in accordance with EMAS are used worldwide by companies and organisations of all sizes and types. EMAS registered organisations commit themselves to evaluate, manage and improve their environmental performance. \nEMAS is open to every type of organisation eager to improve its environmental performance. It spans all economic and service sectors and is applicable worldwide. Currently, more than 4,400 organisations and more than 8,150 sites are EMAS registered.<ref name=\"European Commission. EMAS\">[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/about/index_en.htm]</ref>\nOnly independent environmental verifiers that are accredited/licensed and supervised by government authorities (Accreditation or Licensing Bodies) are authorised to validate EMAS environmental statements. The external and independent nature of the EMAS registration process ensures the credibility of the scheme and the reliability of the information provided by registered organisations.\nThe [[ISO 14001]]: 2004 requirements are a part of EMAS, but EMAS adds several elements to these:\n* stricter requirements on the measurement and evaluation of environmental performance against set targets according to six [[environmental indicator|environmental core indicators]], and the continuous improvement of that environmental performance; \n* compliance with environmental legislation ensured by government supervision: the compliance check is executed by an independent and external environmental verifier, who is in turn subjected to quality checks by national government authorities (EMAS Competent Bodies, EMAS Accreditation Bodies); \n* requirement of employee involvement in the continuous performance improvement process;\n* provision of information to the general public through the obligation to publish an annual public environmental statement that is independently verified; \n* registration by a public authority after verification by an accredited/licensed environmental verifier; and\n* registered organisations can use the EMAS logo to communicate their EMAS compliance\nMore than 80 percent of all EMAS registered organizations are [[Small and medium enterprises|small and medium-sized organisations]] (SMEs).<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/documents/articles_en.htm#statistic {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926154448/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/documents/articles_en.htm |date=2011-09-26 }}</ref> EMAS has specific provisions in place to facilitate EMAS registration for SMEs.

It is widely regarded as one of the most important initiatives for promoting responsible international forest management and was established in 1993 following concerns for global [[deforestation]].<ref name=FSC>{{cite web|last=FSC|title=The Forestry Stewardship Council Factsheet|url=http://www.fsc.org/fileadmin/web-data/public/document_center/publications/Fact_Sheets/Forest-Stewardship-Council-Fact-Sheet-EN.pdf|work=FSC|accessdate=2011-12-13|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231025243/http://www.fsc.org/fileadmin/web-data/public/document_center/publications/Fact_Sheets/Forest-Stewardship-Council-Fact-Sheet-EN.pdf|archive-date=2010-12-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FSC is a voluntary mechanism which involves an inspection of a forest landowners management practices based on criteria for sustainable forest management. This can occur on both privately and publicly owned forests and allows the products manufactured from certified forests to be tracked through the value chain.<ref name=\"European Commission. EMAS\"/> Certificates are not issued by the FSC but by third party independent organisations called certification bodies. These bodies assess the forest management against FSC standards and audits certificate holders at least once a year to ensure continued compliance with FSC standards. To achieve official recognition as an FSC certification body they must comply with a large set of rules and procedures and also be verified by Accreditation Services International (ASI), the company managing the FSC accreditation program.<ref name=FSC />\n\nThe FSC provides an internationally recognized standard, trademark assurance and accreditation services for companies, organizations and communities interested in responsible forestry.

This permission usually comes in the form of a permit, which usually requires it to monitor its emissions.\n\nBusinesses either monitor their emissions all the time, known as continuous monitoring, or at times defined in their permit, known as spot tests or periodic monitoring. In both cases they must meet EA quality requirements.\n\nMCERTS is the Environment Agency's Monitoring Certification Scheme. It provides the framework for businesses to meet EA quality requirements. If it complies with MCERTS then the EA can have confidence in the monitoring of emissions to the environment.\n\nMCERTS is used to approve instruments, people, laboratories and Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS).<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mcerts-performance-standards-and-test-procedures-for-environmental-data-management-software</ref>\n\n<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monitoring-emissions-to-air-land-and-water-mcerts</ref>\n\nSee [[Monitoring Certification Scheme]] for more details\n\n\n=== Blue Planet Friendly certification ===\n\n[[File:Blue Planet Friendly.png|thumb|Blue Planet Friendly certification]]\n\nBlue Planet Friendly is an environmental certification delivered by a french non-profit organization that serves a global movement for assessing  and reducing the pollution generated by companies and cities. \n\nThe companies and cities certified prove emission reductions by product or inhabitant on a year basis and receive a certification with a level (bronze, silver or gold). Each company or city is physically audited every year.\n\n<ref>https://www.blueplanetfriendly.org</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n\n===Positive===\n\nThe most obvious benefit of environmental certification is that it is used as in instrument to allow actors to make important improvements to the way the environment is managed and in achieving sustainable development.<ref name=Klooster06 /> They are usually used as an indicator of the environmental commitment of the organisation thus allowing the organisations involved to have the advantages attributed to environmental proactivity such as gaining a competitive advantage or environmental productivity. Therefore, the environmental certification generally satisfies the ethical and competitive expectations that lead the company to initiate the certification process.<ref name=\"\u201cGonza\u00b4 lez-Benito\u201d\" /> The general scope of the certification process can be looked at by the size of the area that is influenced, either directly or through demonstration of spill-over effects.<ref name=nebs /> For example, the FSC since it was established in 1993 has overseen the certification of forests in sixty countries, totalling nearly 50 million ha, and equivalent to perhaps 1.5 percent of the world's total forest area, thus making it a large and inclusive certification process with a wide scope.<ref name=Klooster06 /> The benefit of environmental certification for consumers is that they can purchase products with the knowledge of the company's environmental standards and procedures, therefore giving the general public the option to consume in an ethical way. As a result of the ethical production, consumers may be willing to pay an additional price as a way of promoting and sustaining ethical production.<ref name=nebs />\n\nCertification has become a differentiating factor that is valued by industrial and financial markets, partly due to its recognition by influential companies in some industries.<ref name=\"\u201cGonza\u00b4 lez-Benito\u201d\" /> As a result of this, certification can act as a catalyst for competitive advantage and lead to economic benefits for producers through more efficient production systems, easier market access and price premiums.<ref name=\"\u201cGonza\u00b4 lez-Benito\u201d\" /><ref name=nebs />\n\nEnvironmental certification is most likely to benefit companies that already have an environmental management system, even if the environmental variable is not effectively integrated into the overall process of strategic planning, and firms that are introducing and/or modifying it, or have to develop it in order to respond to the expected evolution of the external context. It may help them to organise or reorganise a well structured environmental system which will enable them to establish and access the effectiveness of existing operating procedures, achieve conformance with them and demonstrate conformance to external actors. Therefore, environmental certification may help these firms to reduce expenses and efforts and develop autonomously an environmental management system which will help them to improve their green image.<ref name=Azzone /> Certification can also be used by actors in a [[commodity]] network to validate their activities. Therefore, the ethical environmental values linked to environmental certification can be tracked at all stages along the commodity network from the producer to the retailer.<ref name=Klooster05 />\n\n===Negative===\n\nThere are various negative aspects associated with environmental certification one of which is the perception from markets that it is a reactive rather than a proactive investment, meaning that the certification as a standard is initiated as a response to institutional pressure rather than a self-regulation standard showing a desire to move towards a more environmentally sound system.<ref name=canon /> Usually only the best performing operators become certified and approaches operating at the management level cannot always properly address concerns about biodiversity. Also [[tropical deforestation]] is usually a result of conversion of land from forest to other land uses, leaving it outside the influence of [[forest management]] certification.<ref name=nebs />\n\nAt an organisational level, firms with no environmental management system and no interest in introducing one will have little incentive to join an environmental certification scheme, therefore leaving any environmental areas affected by these companies unprotected and liable to degradation. Also if the customer base of the company is not prepared to pay extra for environmentally friendly product there can be no incentive for a company to implement environmental certification.<ref name=Azzone />\n\nThe implementation of environmental certification is expensive, the burden of which is usually felt by the supplier rather than the retailer who must pay for the certification fees and the increased cost of production.<ref name=Klooster05 /> In many cases the profit a supplier can expect to gain for their product does not compensate for the implementation cost.<ref name=canon /> Many certification costs are fixed therefore large produces gain an advantage on their smaller competitors through [[economies of scale]].<ref name=nebs />\n\nThe use of forest certification can marginalise small and community forest managers as the costs are shifted onto them without any means for them to make the money back. Therefore, forest certification tends to be most prevalent in extensive and well documented forests in the global north rather than small or community forests in the global south where they would be more likely to gain more significant benefits.<ref name=Klooster05 /> The dominance of eco-labelling markets in western developed economies may result in smaller producers and suppliers finding it increasingly difficult to enter the market without environmental certification.<ref name=nebs /> As a result of this it has been argued that certification is a means of changing the actions of producers in the global south to serve the interests and alleviate some of the anxieties of consumers in the global north.<ref name=Klooster06 />\n\nCurrently consumption is central to economic and human development therefore many of the efforts to minimise the threats that consumption poses to the environment and the sustainability of the worlds resources have focused on reducing the impact of producing the goods and services rather than addressing and trying to reduce the level of consumption.<ref name=Thompson /> This is true for environmental certification as this primarily focuses on reducing the impact that the production of goods has on the environment. When the possible rebound effect of even increasing levels of \"ethical consumption\" are taken into consideration, the net result might be detrimental for the environment.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Social accountability}}\n\n[[Category:Environmental certification| ]]\n", "text_old": "'''Environmental certification''' is a form of [[environmental regulation]] and [[Environmental Development|development]] where a [[company]] can voluntarily choose to comply with predefined processes or objectives set forth by the [[certification]] service.<ref name=\"Nebel\">Nebel.

If it complies with MCERTS then the EA can have confidence in the monitoring of emissions to the environment.\n\nMCERTS is used to approve instruments, people, laboratories and Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS).<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mcerts-performance-standards-and-test-procedures-for-environmental-data-management-software</ref>\n\n<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monitoring-emissions-to-air-land-and-water-mcerts</ref>\n\nSee [[Monitoring Certification Scheme]] for more details\n\n\n=== Blue Planet Friendly certification ===\n\n[[File:Blue Planet Friendly.png|thumb|Blue Planet Friendly certification]]\n\nBlue Planet Friendly is an environmental certification delivered by a french non-profit organization that serves a global movement for assessing  and reducing the pollution generated by companies and cities. \n\nThe companies and cities certified prove emission reductions by product or inhabitant on a year basis and receive a the certification with a level (bronze, silver or gold). Each company or city is physically audited every year.\n\n<ref>https://www.blueplanetfriendly.org</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n\n===Positive===\n\nThe most obvious benefit of environmental certification is that it is used as in instrument to allow actors to make important improvements to the way the environment is managed and in achieving sustainable development.<ref name=Klooster06 /> They are usually used as an indicator of the environmental commitment of the organisation thus allowing the organisations involved to have the advantages attributed to environmental proactivity such as gaining a competitive advantage or environmental productivity. Therefore, the environmental certification generally satisfies the ethical and competitive expectations that lead the company to initiate the certification process.<ref name=\"\u201cGonza\u00b4 lez-Benito\u201d\" /> The general scope of the certification process can be looked at by the size of the area that is influenced, either directly or through demonstration of spill-over effects.<ref name=nebs /> For example, the FSC since it was established in 1993 has overseen the certification of forests in sixty countries, totalling nearly 50 million ha, and equivalent to perhaps 1.5 percent of the world's total forest area, thus making it a large and inclusive certification process with a wide scope.<ref name=Klooster06 /> The benefit of environmental certification for consumers is that they can purchase products with the knowledge of the company's environmental standards and procedures, therefore giving the general public the option to consume in an ethical way. As a result of the ethical production, consumers may be willing to pay an additional price as a way of promoting and sustaining ethical production.<ref name=nebs />\n\nCertification has become a differentiating factor that is valued by industrial and financial markets, partly due to its recognition by influential companies in some industries.<ref name=\"\u201cGonza\u00b4 lez-Benito\u201d\" /> As a result of this, certification can act as a catalyst for competitive advantage and lead to economic benefits for producers through more efficient production systems, easier market access and price premiums.<ref name=\"\u201cGonza\u00b4 lez-Benito\u201d\" /><ref name=nebs />\n\nEnvironmental certification is most likely to benefit companies that already have an environmental management system, even if the environmental variable is not effectively integrated into the overall process of strategic planning, and firms that are introducing and/or modifying it, or have to develop it in order to respond to the expected evolution of the external context. It may help them to organise or reorganise a well structured environmental system which will enable them to establish and access the effectiveness of existing operating procedures, achieve conformance with them and demonstrate conformance to external actors. Therefore, environmental certification may help these firms to reduce expenses and efforts and develop autonomously an environmental management system which will help them to improve their green image.<ref name=Azzone /> Certification can also be used by actors in a [[commodity]] network to validate their activities. Therefore, the ethical environmental values linked to environmental certification can be tracked at all stages along the commodity network from the producer to the retailer.<ref name=Klooster05 />\n\n===Negative===\n\nThere are various negative aspects associated with environmental certification one of which is the perception from markets that it is a reactive rather than a proactive investment, meaning that the certification as a standard is initiated as a response to institutional pressure rather than a self-regulation standard showing a desire to move towards a more environmentally sound system.<ref name=canon /> Usually only the best performing operators become certified and approaches operating at the management level cannot always properly address concerns about biodiversity. Also [[tropical deforestation]] is usually a result of conversion of land from forest to other land uses, leaving it outside the influence of [[forest management]] certification.<ref name=nebs />\n\nAt an organisational level, firms with no environmental management system and no interest in introducing one will have little incentive to join an environmental certification scheme, therefore leaving any environmental areas affected by these companies unprotected and liable to degradation. Also if the customer base of the company is not prepared to pay extra for environmentally friendly product there can be no incentive for a company to implement environmental certification.<ref name=Azzone />\n\nThe implementation of environmental certification is expensive, the burden of which is usually felt by the supplier rather than the retailer who must pay for the certification fees and the increased cost of production.<ref name=Klooster05 /> In many cases the profit a supplier can expect to gain for their product does not compensate for the implementation cost.<ref name=canon /> Many certification costs are fixed therefore large produces gain an advantage on their smaller competitors through [[economies of scale]].<ref name=nebs />\n\nThe use of forest certification can marginalise small and community forest managers as the costs are shifted onto them without any means for them to make the money back. Therefore, forest certification tends to be most prevalent in extensive and well documented forests in the global north rather than small or community forests in the global south where they would be more likely to gain more significant benefits.<ref name=Klooster05 /> The dominance of eco-labelling markets in western developed economies may result in smaller producers and suppliers finding it increasingly difficult to enter the market without environmental certification.<ref name=nebs /> As a result of this it has been argued that certification is a means of changing the actions of producers in the global south to serve the interests and alleviate some of the anxieties of consumers in the global north.<ref name=Klooster06 />\n\nCurrently consumption is central to economic and human development therefore many of the efforts to minimise the threats that consumption poses to the environment and the sustainability of the worlds resources have focused on reducing the impact of producing the goods and services rather than addressing and trying to reduce the level of consumption.<ref name=Thompson /> This is true for environmental certification as this primarily focuses on reducing the impact that the production of goods has on the environment. When the possible rebound effect of even increasing levels of \"ethical consumption\" are taken into consideration, the net result might be detrimental for the environment.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Social accountability}}\n\n[[Category:Environmental certification| ]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Stray word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_certification"}
