He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Saint Peter's University|St. Peter's College]] in 1958, and his [[Bachelor of Laws]] from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in 1961. Straub served as a First Lieutenant in United States Army Intelligence and Security from 1961 to 1963. In 1963, he began the private practice of law with [[Willkie Farr & Gallagher]], where he became a partner in 1971, and where he remained until his appointment to the federal bench. Straub's private practice was concentrated in litigation, regulatory agencies and governmental affairs.<ref name=\"fjc.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/straub-chester-j.|title=Straub, Chester J. \u2013 Federal Judicial Center|website=fjc.gov}}</ref>\n\n==State legislative service==\nStraub was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1967 to 1972, sitting in the [[177th New York State Legislature|177th]], [[178th New York State Legislature|178th]] and [[179th New York State Legislature]]s; and a member of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1973 to 1975, sitting in the [[180th New York State Legislature|180th]] and [[181st New York State Legislature]]s.<ref name=court>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/Judgesbio.htm|title=Page Not Found|website=ca2.uscourts.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210152921/http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/judgesbio.htm|archivedate=February 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Federal judicial service==\nStraub was nominated by President [[Bill Clinton]] on February 11, 1998, to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] vacated by Judge [[Joseph M. McLaughlin]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on June 1, 1998, and received commission on June 3, 1998. He assumed [[senior status]] on July 16, 2008.<ref name=\"fjc.gov\"/>\n\n==Notable cases==\nIn January 2006, Straub was one of the three judges selected to hear ''National Abortion Federation v. Gonzales'', 437 F.3d 278, one of the cases later folded into and resolved by ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. The Second Circuit thereby became one of three circuits to uphold district court rulings against the constitutionality of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]]. Out of the nine circuit court judges who ruled on this issue, Straub was the only one to dissent, voting to reverse the district court and uphold the Act.\n\nIn the 2006 case of ''MacWade v. Kelly'', Straub wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the Second Circuit that warrantless, suspicionless police searches of [[New York City Subway]] riders in response to terrorism were justified by the \"special needs doctrine\" and so did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Recent Case: Second Circuit Holds New York City Subway Searches Constitutional Under Special Needs Doctrine|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|year=2006|volume=120|page=635|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/criminal_law_second%20_circuit.pdf|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Straub dissented in ''[[Windsor v. United States]]'', a case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held in an opinion written by prominent conservative Chief Judge [[Dennis Jacobs]], that Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) is unconstitutional.<ref name=2ndCir>''[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/12-2335/12-2335-2012-10-18.html Windsor v.

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Saint Peter's University|St. Peter's College]] in 1958, and his [[Bachelor of Laws]] from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in 1961. Straub served as a First Lieutenant in United States Army Intelligence and Security from 1961 to 1963. In 1963, he began the private practice of law with [[Willkie Farr & Gallagher]], where he became a partner in 1971, and where he remained until his appointment to the federal bench. Straub's private practice was concentrated in litigation, regulatory agencies and governmental affairs.<ref name=\"fjc.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/straub-chester-j.|title=Straub, Chester J. \u2013 Federal Judicial Center|website=fjc.gov}}</ref>\n\n==State legislative service==\nStraub was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1967 to 1972, sitting in the [[177th New York State Legislature|177th]], [[178th New York State Legislature|178th]] and [[179th New York State Legislature]]s; and a member of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1973 to 1975, sitting in the [[180th New York State Legislature|180th]] and [[181st New York State Legislature]]s.<ref name=court>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/Judgesbio.htm|title=Page Not Found|website=ca2.uscourts.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210152921/http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/judgesbio.htm|archivedate=February 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Federal judicial service==\nStraub was nominated by President [[Bill Clinton]] on February 11, 1998, to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] vacated by Judge [[Joseph M.

He assumed [[senior status]] on July 16, 2008.<ref name=\"fjc.gov\"/>\n\n==Notable cases==\nIn January 2006, Straub was one of the three judges selected to hear ''National Abortion Federation v. Gonzales'', 437 F.3d 278, one of the cases later folded into and resolved by ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. The Second Circuit thereby became one of three circuits to uphold district court rulings against the constitutionality of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]]. Out of the nine circuit court judges who ruled on this issue, Straub was the only one to dissent, voting to reverse the district court and uphold the Act.\n\nIn the 2006 case of ''MacWade v. Kelly'', Straub wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the Second Circuit that warrantless, suspicionless police searches of [[New York City Subway]] riders in response to terrorism were justified by the \"special needs doctrine\" and so did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Recent Case: Second Circuit Holds New York City Subway Searches Constitutional Under Special Needs Doctrine|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|year=2006|volume=120|page=635|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/criminal_law_second%20_circuit.pdf|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Straub dissented in ''[[Windsor v.

II, Petersburg 1859, p. 106</ref>, incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by [[Sejm]] in 1726.<ref>''Volumina Legum'', t. VI, Petersburg 1860, p. 209.</ref> On 28 March 1795, it was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Third Partition of Poland]].\n\nThere was also a [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|short-lived wartime state]] existing from 8 March to 22 September 1918 with the same name. Plans for it to become part of the [[United Baltic Duchy]], subject to the [[German Empire]], were thwarted by Germany's surrender of the Baltic region at the end of the First World War.  The area became a part of [[Latvia]] at the end of World War I.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kurland Karte.jpg|left|thumb|200px|German map of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (about 1600)]]\nIn 1561, during the [[Livonian Wars]], the [[Livonian Confederation]] was dismantled and the [[Livonian Order]], an order of German knights, was disbanded. On the basis of the [[Treaty of Vilnius (1561)|Treaty of Vilnius]], the southern part of [[Estonia]] and the northern part of [[Latvia]] were ceded to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and formed into the ''[[Ducatus Ultradunensis]]''  (''P\u0101rdaugavas hercogiste''). The part of Latvia between the west bank of the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] River and the [[Baltic Sea]] became the Duchy of [[Courland]] and [[Semigallia]], nominally a vassal state of the [[King of Poland]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} It was ruled by the [[Dukes]] from the [[House of Kettler]] with the exception of [[Ernst Johann von Biron|Ernst Johann Biron]] and his son [[Peter von Biron]]\n\n[[Gotthard Kettler]],<ref name=\"archiv.org.lv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.archiv.org.lv/hercogiste/index.php?lang=en&id=12 |title=Duke Gotthard |work=archiv.org.lv}}</ref> the last Master of the [[Livonian Order]], became the first duke of Courland.  Other members of the Order became the [[Couronian nobility]], with the fiefdoms they had hitherto held becoming their estates.  In all, Kettler received nearly one-third of the land in the new duchy.  [[Mitau]] (Jelgava) was designated as the new capital and a [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] was to meet there twice a year.\n\nSeveral parts of the Courish area did not belong to the Duchy. The Order of Livonia had already loaned the Grobi\u0146a district (on the coast of Baltic Sea) to the [[Duke of Prussia]]. Another district, the [[Bishopric]] of [[Piltene]], also called the \"Bishopric of Courland\" (on the Venta River in western Courland), belonged to [[Duke Magnus of Holstein|Magnus]], son of the king of Denmark. He promised to transfer it to the Duchy of Courland after his death, but this plan failed and only later did [[Wilhelm Kettler]] regain this district.\n\nLike the other members of the Order, Kettler was German and set about establishing the Duchy along the lines of similar German states.  In 1570, he issued the ''Privilegium Gotthardinum'', which allowed the landholders to [[serf|enserf]] the native peasantry on their lands.<ref>Palkans, p. 50.</ref>\n\nWhen Gotthard Kettler died in 1587, his sons, [[Friedrich Kettler|Friedrich]] and [[Wilhelm Kettler|Wilhelm]], became the dukes of Courland. They divided the Duchy into two parts in 1596. Friedrich controlled the eastern part, [[Semigalia]] (''[[Zemgale]]''), with his residence in Mitau ([[Jelgava]]). Wilhelm owned the western part, Courland (''Kurzeme''), with his residence in Goldingen ([[Kuld\u012bga]]). Wilhelm regained the Grobi\u0146a district when he married the daughter of the Duke of Prussia. He also paid out and regained control over the [[Piltene]] district, but eventually, it fell to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Here he developed [[metalwork]]ing and [[shipyard]]s, and the new ships delivered the goods of Courland to other countries.\n\nHowever, relations between the duke and the landowners were quite hostile. In addition, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which was the overlord of the Duchy of Courland, supported the landowners. Wilhelm expressed his disappointment with the landowners, but this ended with his removal from the duke's seat in 1616. Finally, Wilhelm left Courland and spent the rest of his life abroad. Thus, Friedrich became the only duke of Courland after 1616.\n\nFrom 1600 to 1629, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] conducted a war with its main battlefields around [[Riga]]. As a result, Sweden gained control of central and northern [[Latvia]], which became [[Duchy of Livonia (1629\u20131721)|Swedish Livonia]]. The Commonwealth retained the eastern part of the Duchy of Livonia, thereafter called [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] in Polish. Courland was also involved in this war, but did not suffer severe damage.\n\nUnder the next duke, [[Jacob Kettler]], the Duchy reached the peak of its prosperity. During his travels in Western Europe, Jacob became the eager proponent of [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] ideas. Metalworking and shipbuilding became much more developed, and powder mills began producing gunpowder. Trading relations developed not only with nearby countries but also with [[Kingdom of England|Britain]], [[Early Modern France|France]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Jacob established the merchant fleet of the Duchy of Courland, with its main harbours in [[Ventspils]] and [[Liep\u0101ja|Libau]].\n\n===Colonisation===\n{{See also|Couronian colonization|Couronian colonization of the Americas}}\nIn 1651 the Duchy established its first [[colony]] in Africa, [[Kunta Kinteh Island|St. Andrews Island]] at the [[Gambia River]] and founded [[Fort Jakob (Gambia)|Jacob Fort]] there. The main export goods included ivory, gold, furs and spices. Soon afterwards, in 1652, Courlanders established another colony, in [[Tobago]] in the [[West Indies]]. There the main export goods included sugar, tobacco, coffee and spices.\n\nHowever, during this time, the Duchy of Courland remained an object of interest for both Sweden and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1655 the Swedish army entered the territory of the Duchy, starting the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish\u2013Polish war]] (1655\u201360). The Swedish army captured Duke Jacob (1658\u201360). During this period, the Dutch took over both of Courland's colonies that lacked supplies and manpower, and the merchant fleet and factories suffered destruction. This war ended with the peace [[Treaty of Oliwa]] (1660). Courland regained Tobago on the basis of the treaty and held it until 1689. Duke Jacob set about restoring the fleet and factories, but the Duchy of Courland never again reached its pre-war level of prosperity.<ref name=\"latgale.academy\">{{cite web |url=https://latgale.academy/the-fall-of-the-couronian-colonization/ |title=The Fall of Curonian Colonization |work=History & Culture Academy of Latgale}}</ref>\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Biron Rezidenz.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Jelgava Palace]], the main residence of the dukes.]]\nWhen Jacob died in 1682, his son, [[Friedrich Casimir Kettler|Friedrich Casimir]], became the next duke. During his reign production continued to decrease. The duke himself was more interested in glamorous celebrations and spent more money than he had.  This forced him to sell Tobago to the British. During this period, the Commonwealth increased its influence in the political and economic life of the Duchy. Additionally, [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] showed an interest in this area.\n\nFriedrich Casimir died in 1698. His successor, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Kettler]], was only six years old and was under the [[regent|regency]] of his uncle Ferdinand \u2014 a Polish general. During this time the [[Great Northern War]] (1700\u201321) began between Sweden and Russia with its allies \u2014 the Commonwealth, [[Saxony]] and Denmark. As a result of the war, Russia took control of the central part of Latvia starting in 1710. In Courland, Russia also had such a strong influence that its ambassador, [[Pyotr Bestuzhev-Ryumin|Pyotr Bestuzhev]], became the most powerful man in the duchy. The [[Tsar]] of Russia, [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], received a promise from Friedrich Wilhelm that he would marry one of the daughters of the tsar's brother. By having this promise, Peter the Great wished to increase the influence of Russia in Courland. In 1710, Friedrich Wilhelm married [[Anna Ioannovna]] (later Empress of Russia), but on his way back from [[St Petersburg]], he took ill and died. Anne ruled as the duchess of Courland from 1711 to 1730.\n\nAfter the death of Friedrich Wilhelm, the next candidate for the seat of duke was [[Ferdinand Kettler]], who, at the time, lived in [[Danzig]]. Because the law required the duke to reside within the Duchy, the Diet did not recognize him. Because Ferdinand was the last representative of Kettler's family, a remarkable number of candidates tried to gain the dukedom during this period. One favorite was [[Maurice de Saxe]], natural son of [[Frederick Augustus I the Strong]], king of Poland. Saxe had managed to gain support and was even mentioned as marrying [[Anna Ioannovna]], Duchess of Courland at that time.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{cite book |last1=McGee |first1=James E. |title=Sketches of Irish soldiers in every land |date=1873 |publisher=Lang, Little & Hillman |location=New York |page=106 }}</ref>\nHe was elected duke in 1726, but only managed to maintain himself by force of arms till the next year. Russia disliked him and sent an army to western Courland to destroy Maurice's base. When [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine]] was Empress [[Peter Lacy]] was given responsibility for removing Maurice de Saxe from Courland.<ref name=\"McGee\" />\nAs the result Maurice de Saxe had to leave Courland, and Russia increased its influence. This was achieved in good measure due to service of Peter Lacy who was [[Governorate of Livonia| governor of Livonia]] from 1727 until his death in 1751.  Russian influence increased further when [[Augustus III of Poland|Frederick August III]], the [[Elector of Saxony]], in his successful bid to succeed his father on the Polish throne in the 1730s, agreed to grant Anna of Russia her choice of successor to the Courish duchy in exchange for Russian support in the [[War of the Polish Succession]].  (Because of the duchy's position as a vassal of the Commonwealth and Ferdinand Kettler's lack of issue, the duchy would otherwise formally have devolved onto the Polish throne.)  Anna appointed [[Ernst Johann von Biron]] duke of Courland in 1737.\n\nVon Biron received remarkable financial support from Russia and invested it in construction - for example, the castle of [[Rund\u0101le Palace|Schloss Ruhenthal]] projected by the distinguished Italian architect [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]. Anna Ivanovna died in 1740, resulting in von Biron's exile to [[Siberia]] the following year. From there, through the Council of the Duke, he continued to control the Duchy, with the agreement of the king of Poland. However, the landowners of Courland disliked the agreement and even refused to follow the regulations of the Council of the Duke.\n\n[[Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] was selected as Biron's successor on 27 June 1741 with the support of his cousin [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], but while he was in [[St Petersburg]] to get this title ratified, [[Elizabeth of Russia]] carried out a coup on 6 December 1741 and he lost the title.\n\nKing [[Augustus III of Poland]] proclaimed his son, [[Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony]], the next Duke. Thus, the Duchy of Courland had two dukes simultaneously thereafter. The situation became extremely tense \u2014 one part of the landowners accepted von Biron, the other, Carl of Saxony. The Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] (reigned 1762\u201396) solved this situation by recalling Ernst von Biron from exile in 1763. By doing this, she avoided the possible increase of influence of the Commonwealth in Courland. However, political fighting had exhausted Ernst Biron, and he turned the seat of duke over to his son, [[Peter von Biron]], in 1769. But political tumult continued in Courland. Some landowners supported the Commonwealth, some Russia. Ultimately, Russia determined the further fate of Courland when with its allies it began the [[Partitions of Poland|third division of Poland]] (1795). Given a \"nice recommendation\" by Russia, Duke Peter von Biron gave up his rights to Russia in 1795. With the signing of the final document on March 28, 1795, the Duchy of Courland was incorporated into the Russian state and title of Duke of Courland was added to the [[Tsar#Full style of Russian

{{lang-de|Herzogtum Kurland und Semgallen}}; {{lang-lv|Kurzemes un Zemgales hercogiste}}) was a [[duchy]] in the [[Baltic states|Baltic region]] that existed from 1561 to 1569 as a vassal state of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and from 1569 to 1726 of the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]]<ref>Volumina Legum, t. II, Petersburg 1859, p. 106</ref>, incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by [[Sejm]] in 1726.<ref>''Volumina Legum'', t. VI, Petersburg 1860, p. 209.</ref> On 28 March 1795, it was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Third Partition of Poland]].\n\nThere was also a [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|short-lived wartime state]] existing from 8 March to 22 September 1918 with the same name. Plans for it to become part of the [[United Baltic Duchy]], subject to the [[German Empire]], were thwarted by Germany's surrender of the Baltic region at the end of the First World War.  The area became a part of [[Latvia]] at the end of World War I.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kurland Karte.jpg|left|thumb|200px|German map of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (about 1600)]]\nIn 1561, during the [[Livonian Wars]], the [[Livonian Confederation]] was dismantled and the [[Livonian Order]], an order of German knights, was disbanded. On the basis of the [[Treaty of Vilnius (1561)|Treaty of Vilnius]], the southern part of [[Estonia]] and the northern part of [[Latvia]] were ceded to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and formed into the ''[[Ducatus Ultradunensis]]''  (''P\u0101rdaugavas hercogiste''). The part of Latvia between the west bank of the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] River and the [[Baltic Sea]] became the Duchy of [[Courland]] and [[Semigallia]], nominally a vassal state of the [[King of Poland]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} It was ruled by the [[Dukes]] from the [[House of Kettler]] with the exception of [[Ernst Johann von Biron|Ernst Johann Biron]] and his son [[Peter von Biron]]\n\n[[Gotthard Kettler]],<ref name=\"archiv.org.lv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.archiv.org.lv/hercogiste/index.php?lang=en&id=12 |title=Duke Gotthard |work=archiv.org.lv}}</ref> the last Master of the [[Livonian Order]], became the first duke of Courland.  Other members of the Order became the [[Couronian nobility]], with the fiefdoms they had hitherto held becoming their estates.  In all, Kettler received nearly one-third of the land in the new duchy.  [[Mitau]] (Jelgava) was designated as the new capital and a [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] was to meet there twice a year.\n\nSeveral parts of the Courish area did not belong to the Duchy. The Order of Livonia had already loaned the Grobi\u0146a district (on the coast of Baltic Sea) to the [[Duke of Prussia]]. Another district, the [[Bishopric]] of [[Piltene]], also called the \"Bishopric of Courland\" (on the Venta River in western Courland), belonged to [[Duke Magnus of Holstein|Magnus]], son of the king of Denmark. He promised to transfer it to the Duchy of Courland after his death, but this plan failed and only later did [[Wilhelm Kettler]] regain this district.\n\nLike the other members of the Order, Kettler was German and set about establishing the Duchy along the lines of similar German states.  In 1570, he issued the ''Privilegium Gotthardinum'', which allowed the landholders to [[serf|enserf]] the native peasantry on their lands.<ref>Palkans, p. 50.</ref>\n\nWhen Gotthard Kettler died in 1587, his sons, [[Friedrich Kettler|Friedrich]] and [[Wilhelm Kettler|Wilhelm]], became the dukes of Courland. They divided the Duchy into two parts in 1596. Friedrich controlled the eastern part, [[Semigalia]] (''[[Zemgale]]''), with his residence in Mitau ([[Jelgava]]). Wilhelm owned the western part, Courland (''Kurzeme''), with his residence in Goldingen ([[Kuld\u012bga]]). Wilhelm regained the Grobi\u0146a district when he married the daughter of the Duke of Prussia. He also paid out and regained control over the [[Piltene]] district, but eventually, it fell to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Here he developed [[metalwork]]ing and [[shipyard]]s, and the new ships delivered the goods of Courland to other countries.\n\nHowever, relations between the duke and the landowners were quite hostile. In addition, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which was the overlord of the Duchy of Courland, supported the landowners. Wilhelm expressed his disappointment with the landowners, but this ended with his removal from the duke's seat in 1616. Finally, Wilhelm left Courland and spent the rest of his life abroad. Thus, Friedrich became the only duke of Courland after 1616.\n\nFrom 1600 to 1629, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] conducted a war with its main battlefields around [[Riga]]. As a result, Sweden gained control of central and northern [[Latvia]], which became [[Duchy of Livonia (1629\u20131721)|Swedish Livonia]]. The Commonwealth retained the eastern part of the Duchy of Livonia, thereafter called [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] in Polish. Courland was also involved in this war, but did not suffer severe damage.\n\nUnder the next duke, [[Jacob Kettler]], the Duchy reached the peak of its prosperity. During his travels in Western Europe, Jacob became the eager proponent of [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] ideas. Metalworking and shipbuilding became much more developed, and powder mills began producing gunpowder. Trading relations developed not only with nearby countries but also with [[Kingdom of England|Britain]], [[Early Modern France|France]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Jacob established the merchant fleet of the Duchy of Courland, with its main harbours in [[Ventspils]] and [[Liep\u0101ja|Libau]].\n\n===Colonisation===\n{{See also|Couronian colonization|Couronian colonization of the Americas}}\nIn 1651 the Duchy established its first [[colony]] in Africa, [[Kunta Kinteh Island|St. Andrews Island]] at the [[Gambia River]] and founded [[Fort Jakob (Gambia)|Jacob Fort]] there. The main export goods included ivory, gold, furs and spices. Soon afterwards, in 1652, Courlanders established another colony, in [[Tobago]] in the [[West Indies]]. There the main export goods included sugar, tobacco, coffee and spices.\n\nHowever, during this time, the Duchy of Courland remained an object of interest for both Sweden and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1655 the Swedish army entered the territory of the Duchy, starting the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish\u2013Polish war]] (1655\u201360). The Swedish army captured Duke Jacob (1658\u201360). During this period, the Dutch took over both of Courland's colonies that lacked supplies and manpower, and the merchant fleet and factories suffered destruction. This war ended with the peace [[Treaty of Oliwa]] (1660). Courland regained Tobago on the basis of the treaty and held it until 1689. Duke Jacob set about restoring the fleet and factories, but the Duchy of Courland never again reached its pre-war level of prosperity.<ref name=\"latgale.academy\">{{cite web |url=https://latgale.academy/the-fall-of-the-couronian-colonization/ |title=The Fall of Curonian Colonization |work=History & Culture Academy of Latgale}}</ref>\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Biron Rezidenz.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Jelgava Palace]], the main residence of the dukes.]]\nWhen Jacob died in 1682, his son, [[Friedrich Casimir Kettler|Friedrich Casimir]], became the next duke. During his reign production continued to decrease. The duke himself was more interested in glamorous celebrations and spent more money than he had.  This forced him to sell Tobago to the British. During this period, the Commonwealth increased its influence in the political and economic life of the Duchy. Additionally, [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] showed an interest in this area.\n\nFriedrich Casimir died in 1698. His successor, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Kettler]], was only six years old and was under the [[regent|regency]] of his uncle Ferdinand \u2014 a Polish general. During this time the [[Great Northern War]] (1700\u201321) began between Sweden and Russia with its allies \u2014 the Commonwealth, [[Saxony]] and Denmark. As a result of the war, Russia took control of the central part of Latvia starting in 1710. In Courland, Russia also had such a strong influence that its ambassador, [[Pyotr Bestuzhev-Ryumin|Pyotr Bestuzhev]], became the most powerful man in the duchy. The [[Tsar]] of Russia, [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], received a promise from Friedrich Wilhelm that he would marry one of the daughters of the tsar's brother. By having this promise, Peter the Great wished to increase the influence of Russia in Courland. In 1710, Friedrich Wilhelm married [[Anna Ioannovna]] (later Empress of Russia), but on his way back from [[St Petersburg]], he took ill and died. Anne ruled as the duchess of Courland from 1711 to 1730.\n\nAfter the death of Friedrich Wilhelm, the next candidate for the seat of duke was [[Ferdinand Kettler]], who, at the time, lived in [[Danzig]]. Because the law required the duke to reside within the Duchy, the Diet did not recognize him. Because Ferdinand was the last representative of Kettler's family, a remarkable number of candidates tried to gain the dukedom during this period. One favorite was [[Maurice de Saxe]], natural son of [[Frederick Augustus I the Strong]], king of Poland. Saxe had managed to gain support and was even mentioned as marrying [[Anna Ioannovna]], Duchess of Courland at that time.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{cite book |last1=McGee |first1=James E. |title=Sketches of Irish soldiers in every land |date=1873 |publisher=Lang, Little & Hillman |location=New York |page=106 }}</ref>\nHe was elected duke in 1726, but only managed to maintain himself by force of arms till the next year. Russia disliked him and sent an army to western Courland to destroy Maurice's base. When [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine]] was Empress [[Peter Lacy]] was given responsibility for removing Maurice de Saxe from Courland.<ref name=\"McGee\" />\nAs the result Maurice de Saxe had to leave Courland, and Russia increased its influence. This was achieved in good measure due to service of Peter Lacy who was [[Governorate of Livonia| governor of Livonia]] from 1727 until his death in 1751.

(Because of the duchy's position as a vassal of the Commonwealth and Ferdinand Kettler's lack of issue, the duchy would otherwise formally have devolved onto the Polish throne.)  Anna appointed [[Ernst Johann von Biron]] duke of Courland in 1737.\n\nVon Biron received remarkable financial support from Russia and invested it in construction - for example, the castle of [[Rund\u0101le Palace|Schloss Ruhenthal]] projected by the distinguished Italian architect [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]. Anna Ivanovna died in 1740, resulting in von Biron's exile to [[Siberia]] the following year.

With the signing of the final document on March 28, 1795, the Duchy of Courland was incorporated into the Russian state and title of Duke of Courland was added to the [[Tsar#Full style of Russian Sovereigns|title of Russian emperors]].\n\n===Dukes of Courland===\n[[File:Wapen hertogen van Koerland Kettler groot.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of the Dukes of Courland of the [[Ketteler|Kettler family]]]]\n* [[Gotthard Kettler]], 1561\u201387, last Master of the [[Livonian order]] and first Duke of Courland and Semigallia\n* [[Friedrich Kettler|Friedrich]] (1587\u20131642, ruled eastern Semigallia part) and [[Wilhelm Kettler]] (1587\u20131616, ruled western Courland part)\n* [[Jacob Kettler]], 1642\u201382, only son of Wilhelm Kettler; succeeded his childless uncle, Friedrich Kettler\n* [[Friedrich Casimir Kettler]], 1682\u201398, elder surviving son of Jacob Kettler\n* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Kettler]], 1698\u20131711, only surviving son of Friedrich Casimir Kettler; married the future [[Anna of Russia]], no issue\n* [[Ferdinand Kettler]], 1711\u201337, younger surviving son of Jacob Kettler; with his death, the [[Ketteler|Kettler dynasty]] became extinct\n* [[Ernst Johann Biron]], 1737\u201340, a favorite of [[Anna of Russia]]; he was elected by the Courland nobility at her behest\n* [[Council of the Duke]], 1740\u201358, Biron having been exiled to Siberia/[[Yaroslavl]] by [[Elizabeth of Russia]]\n* [[Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], 27 June \u2013 6 December 1741, ousted after a coup in Russia\n* [[Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland|Karl of Saxony]], 1758\u201363, son of [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], King of Poland and Elector of Saxony\n* [[Ernst Johann Biron]], 1763\u201369, re-established in the duchy by [[Catherine the Great]]\n* [[Peter von Biron]], 1769\u201395, son of Ernest Johann Biron; Courland was merged into Russia in 1795, and he received cash compensation\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coat of arms of Courland]]\n* [[Duchess of Courland]]\n* [[Bishopric of Courland]]\n* [[Courland]]\n* [[Couronian colonization|Couronian colonisation]]\n* [[Couronian colonization of the Americas|Couronian colonisation of the Americas]]\n* [[Ernst Friedrich von Ockel]]\n* [[Livonia]]\n* [[Semigallia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Ceaser, Ray A., [https://web.archive.org/web/20060905120710/http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/duchy.html Duchy of Courland], [[University of Washington]], June 2001.\n* Plakans, Andrejs (1995) ''The Latvians: A Short History'', Hoover Institution Press.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jewishgen.org/Courland/rosenthal.htm Courland]\n* [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/eceurope/courland16411795.html  Courland 1641-1795]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061007235903/http://www.fotw.net/flags/lv-cour.html Flags of Courland]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060717082133/http://www.baltische-ritterschaften.de/Ritterschaften/Kurland/Kurland.htm Die Kurl\u00e4ndische Ritterschaft]\n* [http://www.von-stackelberg.de/geschichte/kurland.htm Ritterschaften der Familie in Kurland]\n\n{{History Timeline of Latvia}}\n{{Administrative division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth}}\n{{Fiefs of the Polish Kingdom}}\n\n{{coord|56|38|11|N|23|42|55|E|source:kolossus-ptwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Courland and Semigallia, Duchy of}}\n[[Category:1795 disestablishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n[[Category:Duchy of Courland and Semigallia| ]]\n[[Category:Historical regions in Latvia]]\n[[Category:1561 establishments in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "Kevin9217", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Courland_and_Semigallia"}
{"title_page": "Scottish Midland Junction Railway", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Scottish Midland Junction Railway}}\nThe '''Scottish Midland Junction Railway''' was authorised in 1845 to build a line from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] to [[Forfar]]. Other companies obtained authorisation in the same year, and together they formed a route from central Scotland to [[Aberdeen]]. The SMJR opened its main line on 4 August 1848. Proposals to merge with other railways were rejected by Parliament at first, but in 1856 the SMJR merged with the [[Aberdeen Railway]] to form the [[Scottish North Eastern Railway]]. The SNER was itself absorbed into the larger [[Caledonian Railway]] in 1866. The original SMJR main line was now a small section of a main line from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and central Scotland to Aberdeen.\n\nThe original route was well aligned for fast running, but it by-passed numerous towns and many branches were built to serve them. The rival [[North British Railway]] had its own route from the south to Aberdeen, and spectacular competition for the fastest journey from London to Aberdeen was generated in the final decades of the nineteenth century. In the 1960s there were some reflections of those days when powerful steam engines, displaced by diesel locomotives from other routes, operated a fast [[Glasgow]] - Aberdeen passenger service for some years.\n\nIn the mid 1960s the move to rationalise duplicate routes led to closure of the SMJR main line in 1967 except for a residual goods service to intermediate locations. Now the entire SMJR network has closed, except for the section from Perth to Stanley Junction, serving the main line to Inverness.\n\n==History==\n===The Caledonian Railway===\nFrom the second decade of the nineteenth century, a number of short railway lines had been operating in Scotland; in most cases these were connected with mineral extraction, and there was little thought to connecting between them to form a network. The [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in England showed that longer railway routes could be worthwhile, and thoughts turned to trunk railways in Scotland, and to connection to the emerging English network.  \n\nIn the 1840s business people in Scotland made definite moves which resulted in proposals for trunk lines to connect the central belt of Scotland with England, and in 1845 there was a frenzy of Parliamentary Bills for Scottish railways. The [[Caledonian Railway]] was authorised on 12 April 1845 with capital of \u00a31,500,000. Its main line was to run between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Carlisle.\n\nThe Caledonian policy was to capture as much territory in Scotland as possible: they foresaw a \"Caledonian system\" controlled by themselves. At this period it was expected that a district could only support one railway line, so that the first to serve an area would secure a near-monopoly. Even before authorisation the Caledonian made provisional agreements with the promoters of other lines to lease their railways. This was done by agreeing a guaranteed periodical lease payment; it did not require money at the time of making the agreement, but it incurred a financial obligation later.<ref name = ross>{{cite book| first=David| last=Ross| title=The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History| publisher=Stenlake Publishing Limited| location=Catrine| year=2014| isbn=978-1840-335842}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Authorisation===\n[[File:Smjr 1855.gif|thumb|System map of the SMJR in 1855]]In the 1845 session of Parliament, a large number of Scottish trunk lines were proposed. In the period prior to the hearings, discussions about alliances and leases accelerated. The [[Scottish Central Railway]] was to build from Perth to Castlecary where it would join the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]] and the Caledonian Railway, and it had discussed merging with the Scottish Midland Junction but at the same time it discussed leasing its line to the E&GR or the Caledonian.\n\nThe Scottish Midland Junction Railway was authorised on 31 July 1845, with capital of \u00a3300,000, for a line just over 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) in length from Perth to Forfar. At Perth it was to connect with the SCR and at Forfar with the [[Arbroath and Forfar Railway]] which gave rail access on to Aberdeen over the [[Aberdeen Railway]]. The Scottish Central Railway and the Caledonian Railway were also authorised on 31 July 1845.<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book| first=Peter| last=Marshall| title=The Scottish Central Railway: Perth to Stirling| publisher=Oakwood Press| location=Usk| year=1998| isbn=0-8536-1522-5}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe [[Dundee and Newtyle Railway]] had been built in 1831 to connect the growing Burgh of Dundee with the fertile broad valley of [[Strathmore, Angus|Strathmore]]; it terminated at Newtyle which was then no more than a farm, intended as a railhead. This proved unpopular and two nominally independent extension railways were built, the ''Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway'' and the ''Newtyle and Glammiss Railway''. (Glammiss is spelt Glamis nowadays.) These railways opened in 1837, but they hardly added to the traffic of the Dundee line.\n\nLeaving Newtyle the two lines turned away from one another and together formed a nearly straight axis that suited the intended route of the SMJR; the authorising Act empowered the SMJR to acquire them and incorporate their lines into the SMJR main line.<ref name = ross/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref name = lythe>{{cite journal| first=S.G.E.| last=Lythe| title=The Dundee and Newtyle Railway: 1 - Promotion and Management, 1825 - 1846| journal=Railway Magazine| date=August 1951}}</ref><ref name = lee>{{cite journal| first=Charles E.| last=Lee| title=The Dundee and Newtyle Railway: 2 - Engineering and Operation| journal=Railway Magazine| date=October 1951}}</ref><ref name=\"marshall2\">{{cite book| first=Peter| last=Marshall| title=The Railways of Dundee| publisher=The Oakwood Press| location=Headington| year=1996| isbn=0-85361-482-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===A possible lease===\nAfter lengthy discussions, the SMJR agreed to lease its line to the Scottish Central Railway by decision of 18 February 1847; the lease charge was to be 6% on the SMJR capital of \u00a3600,000.<ref group = note>From Ross, page 39; the capital quoted is at considerable variance from Carter. On page 45 Ross quotes the SMJR capital as \u00a3500,000.</ref>\n\nThe Caledonian had assumed that it was going to lease the Scottish Central  Railway, but this was not confirmed. The SCR lease of the SMJR seems not to have proceeded, for in 1848 the Caledonian was negotiating to lease the  SMJR direct, and on 5 May 1848 agreement was finalised; the Caledonian would pay 6% on the SMJR capital, now quoted as \u00a3500,000.<ref name = ross46>Ross, page 46</ref> The lease arrangement was modified to be joint with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway on an agreed traffic sharing system; but it needed to be ratified by Parliament.<ref name = ross47>Ross, page 47</ref>\n\n===Opening===\nThe two Newtyle lines had been constructed to the track gauge of {{track gauge|4ft6.5in}} as a single line using stone block sleepers. This had to be converted to a more robust track construction as a double line; they were closed in 1847 for the purpose. The SMJR main line, including the converted sections, was opened on 20 August 1848.

The lease of the SMJR required Parliamentary authorisation, and a joint Bill was prepared for the 1849 session. However, in February 1849 it became clear that any alliance between the Caledonian and the E&GR was impossible and the Caledonian declined to proceed with the Bill, and the lease.<ref name = ross/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1854 the SCR was still independent, and was negotiating with the SMJR for an amalgamation of the two companies. At this time the attitude of Parliament was hostile to mergers of railways, and the proposal was rejected.\n\nFrom this time there was a \"loose amalgamation\" between the SCR, the SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway: they worked collaboratively but remained separate companies. This ended on 29 July 1856 when they formally amalgamated, to form the Scottish North Eastern Railway.<ref name = ross/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Branches===\nOn 26 June 1846 the SMJR obtained authorisation to build three branches: to Dunkeld, to Kirriemuir and to Blairgowrie.<ref name = carter/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} In fact only the Blairgowrie branch was constructed during the lifetime of the SMJR. The Dunkeld branch was actually built by an independent company, the [[Perth and Dunkeld Railway]]. It left the SMJR main line at Stanley Junction, and was opened on 7 April 1856. It was worked by the SMJR. The Perth and Dunkeld Railway was taken over in 1864 as part of a scheme to connect Perth and Inverness, by what became the [[Highland Railway]].\n\nThe Kirriemuir branch was opened in November 1854.<ref group = note>According to Bradshaw; Quick says December 1854; Ferguson says (on page 80) that in November 1854 the SMJR informed Captain Tyler that improvements he had required during a previous inspection had been carried out, and Tyler advised the Board of Trade that the line could open without a re-inspection; Awdry says November 1855 (on page 102); Cobb says 1855; Thomas and Turnock say 12 August 1861 (page 314); Butt says 12 August 1861 (for passengers); Stansfield says August 1861; Ferguson is silent on the matter.</ref><ref name = bradshaw254>{{cite book| title=Bradshaw's Railway Manual, Shareholders' Guide, and Official Directory for 1862| publisher=W.J.

Blairgowrie was an industrial centre for jute manufacture, and for soft fruit. The line descended sharply from Coupar Angus to the crossing of the River Isla, and then climbed again to the terminus. The Isla bridge was at first a twelve-span timber viaduct. On 3 February 1881 the river was in spate with large blocks of ice striking the piers of the bridge. The structure survived, but it was replaced by a stone and wrought iron bridge soon afterwards.<ref name = smith>{{cite book| first1=W.A.C.| last1=Smith| first2=Paul| last2=Anderson| title=Tayside's Railways - Dundee and Perth| publisher=Irwell Press| location=Clophill| year=1997| isbn=1-871608-73-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} In later years there were typically five passenger trains daily.<ref name = perthshire/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe SMJR had inherited the short branch to Newtyle by its acquisition of the Coupar Angus and Glammiss lines.\n\nOther branches were constructed off the SMJR main line after the company was amalgamated.\n\n==Absorption==\nOn 29 July 1856 the [[Scottish North Eastern Railway]] was formed by the amalgamation of the SMJR, the Scottish Central Railway and the Aberdeen Railway, forming a continuous line between Perth and Aberdeen.

While express passenger trains caught the public eye, there was a substantial goods traffic; cattle were particularly dominant. Large structures on the line were constructed in laminated timber, but in the 1880s these were in poor condition and inadequate for the heavier and faster traffic of those days, and widespread reconstruction in stone and wrought iron was undertaken.\n\nAs part of a route between London and Aberdeen, the line was rivalled by the North British Railway route on the east coast via Dundee. As publicity became important, the two routes competed for the title of the fastest transit, and in 1888 and again in 1895 spectacularly fast journeys were made; the rivalry was known as the [[Race to the North|Railway race to the north]].<ref name = nock>{{cite book| first=O.S.| last=Nock| title=The Railway Race to the North| publisher=Ian Allan| location=Shepperton| year=1958}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Hugh llewelyn 769 (6324836085).jpg|thumb|Model of Caledonian Railway Class \"769\" or \"Dunalastair II\".

The original SMJR main line was now a small section of a main line from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and central Scotland to Aberdeen.\n\nThe original route was well aligned for fast running, but it by-passed numerous towns and many branches were built to serve them. The rival [[North British Railway]] had its own route from the south to Aberdeen, and spectacular competition for the fastest journey from London to Aberdeen was generated in the final decades of the nineteenth century. In the 1960s there were some reflections of those days when powerful steam engines, displaced by diesel locomotives from other routes, operated a fast [[Glasgow]] - Aberdeen passenger service for some years.\n\nIn the mid 1960s the move to rationalise duplicate routes led to closure of the SMJR main line in 1967 except for a residual goods service to intermediate locations. Now the entire SMJR network has closed, except for the section from Perth to Stanley Junction, serving the main line to Inverness.\n\n==History==\n===The Caledonian Railway===\nFrom the second decade of the nineteenth century, a number of short railway lines had been operating in Scotland; in most cases these were connected with mineral extraction, and there was little thought to connecting between them to form a network. The [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in England showed that longer railway routes could be worthwhile, and thoughts turned to trunk railways in Scotland, and to connection to the emerging English network.  \n\nIn the 1840s business people in Scotland made definite moves which resulted in proposals for trunk lines to connect the central belt of Scotland with England, and in 1845 there was a frenzy of Parliamentary Bills for Scottish railways. The [[Caledonian Railway]] was authorised on 12 April 1845 with capital of \u00a31,500,000. Its main line was to run between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Carlisle.\n\nThe Caledonian policy was to capture as much territory in Scotland as possible: they foresaw a \"Caledonian system\" controlled by themselves. At this period it was expected that a district could only support one railway line, so that the first to serve an area would secure a near-monopoly. Even before authorisation the Caledonian made provisional agreements with the promoters of other lines to lease their railways. This was done by agreeing a guaranteed periodical lease payment; it did not require money at the time of making the agreement, but it incurred a financial obligation later.<ref name = ross>{{cite book| first=David| last=Ross| title=The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History| publisher=Stenlake Publishing Limited| location=Catrine| year=2014| isbn=978-1840-335842}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Authorisation===\n[[File:Smjr 1855.gif|thumb|System map of the SMJR in 1855]]In the 1845 session of Parliament, a large number of Scottish trunk lines were proposed. In the period prior to the hearings, discussions about alliances and leases accelerated. The [[Scottish Central Railway]] was to build from Perth to Castlecary where it would join the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]] and the Caledonian Railway, and it had discussed merging with the Scottish Midland Junction but at the same time it discussed leasing its line to the E&GR or the Caledonian.\n\nThe Scottish Midland Junction Railway was authorised on 31 July 1845, with capital of \u00a3300,000, for a line just over 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) in length from Perth to Forfar. At Perth it was to connect with the SCR and at Forfar with the [[Arbroath and Forfar Railway]] which gave rail access on to Aberdeen over the [[Aberdeen Railway]]. The Scottish Central Railway and the Caledonian Railway were also authorised on 31 July 1845.<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref name = marshall>{{cite book| first=Peter| last=Marshall| title=The Scottish Central Railway: Perth to Stirling| publisher=Oakwood Press| location=Usk| year=1998| isbn=0-8536-1522-5}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe [[Dundee and Newtyle Railway]] had been built in 1831 to connect the growing Burgh of Dundee with the fertile broad valley of [[Strathmore, Angus|Strathmore]]; it terminated at Newtyle which was then no more than a farm, intended as a railhead. This proved unpopular and two nominally independent extension railways were built, the ''Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway'' and the ''Newtyle and Glammiss Railway''. (Glammiss is spelt Glamis nowadays.) These railways opened in 1837, but they hardly added to the traffic of the Dundee line.\n\nLeaving Newtyle the two lines turned away from one another and together formed a nearly straight axis that suited the intended route of the SMJR; the authorising Act empowered the SMJR to acquire them and incorporate their lines into the SMJR main line.<ref name = ross/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref name = lythe>{{cite journal| first=S.G.E.| last=Lythe| title=The Dundee and Newtyle Railway: 1 - Promotion and Management, 1825 - 1846| journal=Railway Magazine| date=August 1951}}</ref><ref name = lee>{{cite journal| first=Charles E.| last=Lee| title=The Dundee and Newtyle Railway: 2 - Engineering and Operation| journal=Railway Magazine| date=October 1951}}</ref><ref name = marshall>{{cite book| first=Peter| last=Marshall| title=The Railways of Dundee| publisher=The Oakwood Press| location=Headington| year=1996| isbn=0-85361-482-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===A possible lease===\nAfter lengthy discussions, the SMJR agreed to lease its line to the Scottish Central Railway by decision of 18 February 1847; the lease charge was to be 6% on the SMJR capital of \u00a3600,000.<ref group = note>From Ross, page 39; the capital quoted is at considerable variance from Carter.

The SCR lease of the SMJR seems not to have proceeded, for in 1848 the Caledonian was negotiating to lease the  SMJR direct, and on 5 May 1848 agreement was finalised; the Caledonian would pay 6% on the SMJR capital, now quoted as \u00a3500,000.<ref name = ross46>Ross, page 46</ref> The lease arrangement was modified to be joint with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway on an agreed traffic sharing system; but it needed to be ratified by Parliament.<ref name = ross47>Ross, page 47</ref>\n\n===Opening===\nThe two Newtyle lines had been constructed to the track gauge of {{track gauge|4ft6.5in}} as a single line using stone block sleepers. This had to be converted to a more robust track construction as a double line; they were closed in 1847 for the purpose. The SMJR main line, including the converted sections, was opened on 20 August 1848.

The lease of the SMJR required Parliamentary authorisation, and a joint Bill was prepared for the 1849 session. However, in February 1849 it became clear that any alliance between the Caledonian and the E&GR was impossible and the Caledonian declined to proceed with the Bill, and the lease.<ref name = ross/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1854 the SCR was still independent, and was negotiating with the SMJR for an amalgamation of the two companies. At this time the attitude of Parliament was hostile to mergers of railways, and the proposal was rejected.\n\nFrom this time there was a \"loose amalgamation\" between the SCR, the SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway: they worked collaboratively but remained separate companies. This ended on 29 July 1856 when they formally amalgamated, to form the Scottish North Eastern Railway.<ref name = ross/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Branches===\nOn 26 June 1846 the SMJR obtained authorisation to build three branches: to Dunkeld, to Kirriemuir and to Blairgowrie.<ref name = carter/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} In fact only the Blairgowrie branch was constructed during the lifetime of the SMJR. The Dunkeld branch was actually built by an independent company, the [[Perth and Dunkeld Railway]]. It left the SMJR main line at Stanley Junction, and was opened on 7 April 1856. It was worked by the SMJR. The Perth and Dunkeld Railway was taken over in 1864 as part of a scheme to connect Perth and Inverness, by what became the [[Highland Railway]].\n\nThe Kirriemuir branch was opened in November 1854.<ref group = note>According to Bradshaw; Quick says December 1854; Ferguson says (on page 80) that in November 1854 the SMJR informed Captain Tyler that improvements he had required during a previous inspection had been carried out, and Tyler advised the Board of Trade that the line could open without a re-inspection; Awdry says November 1855 (on page 102); Cobb says 1855; Thomas and Turnock say 12 August 1861 (page 314); Butt says 12 August 1861 (for passengers); Stansfield says August 1861; Ferguson is silent on the matter.</ref><ref name = bradshaw254>{{cite book| title=Bradshaw's Railway Manual, Shareholders' Guide, and Official Directory for 1862| publisher=W.J.

Blairgowrie was an industrial centre for jute manufacture, and for soft fruit. The line descended sharply from Coupar Angus to the crossing of the River Isla, and then climbed again to the terminus. The Isla bridge was at first a twelve-span timber viaduct. On 3 February 1881 the river was in spate with large blocks of ice striking the piers of the bridge. The structure survived, but it was replaced by a stone and wrought iron bridge soon afterwards.<ref name = smith>{{cite book| first1=W.A.C.| last1=Smith| first2=Paul| last2=Anderson| title=Tayside's Railways - Dundee and Perth| publisher=Irwell Press| location=Clophill| year=1997| isbn=1-871608-73-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} In later years there were typically five passenger trains daily.<ref name = perthshire/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe SMJR had inherited the short branch to Newtyle by its acquisition of the Coupar Angus and Glammiss lines.\n\nOther branches were constructed off the SMJR main line after the company was amalgamated.\n\n==Absorption==\nOn 29 July 1856 the [[Scottish North Eastern Railway]] was formed by the amalgamation of the SMJR, the Scottish Central Railway and the Aberdeen Railway, forming a continuous line between Perth and Aberdeen.

While express passenger trains caught the public eye, there was a substantial goods traffic; cattle were particularly dominant. Large structures on the line were constructed in laminated timber, but in the 1880s these were in poor condition and inadequate for the heavier and faster traffic of those days, and widespread reconstruction in stone and wrought iron was undertaken.\n\nAs part of a route between London and Aberdeen, the line was rivalled by the North British Railway route on the east coast via Dundee. As publicity became important, the two routes competed for the title of the fastest transit, and in 1888 and again in 1895 spectacularly fast journeys were made; the rivalry was known as the [[Race to the North|Railway race to the north]].<ref name = nock>{{cite book| first=O.S.| last=Nock| title=The Railway Race to the North| publisher=Ian Allan| location=Shepperton| year=1958}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Hugh llewelyn 769 (6324836085).jpg|thumb|Model of Caledonian Railway Class \"769\" or \"Dunalastair II\".
