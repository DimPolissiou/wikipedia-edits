the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8&nbsp;cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time.

It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010.

In addition to increasing the primary proton beam power, the current in the [[magnetic horn|horns]] focusing secondary particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, etc.) with a chosen [[electric charge]] will also be increased from 250 kA to 320 kA. This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment.

It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8&nbsp;cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle.

The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water.

Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=The Super-Kamiokande Collaboration |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=April 2003 |volume=501 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=418\u2013462 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(03)00425-X|bibcode=2003NIMPA.501..418F }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nT2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka ([[K2K experiment|K2K]]) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004.

The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010.

In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s.

Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment. The HK experiment is expected to start operation around the year 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\">{{cite news|url=http://www.j-parc.jp/c/en/topics/2020/02/12000416.html|title=The Hyper-Kamiokande project is officially approved.|date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboraion |title=Physics potential of a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using a J-PARC neutrino beam and Hyper-Kamiokande |journal=Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics |date=19 May 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=53C02\u20130 |doi=10.1093/ptep/ptv061 |arxiv=1502.05199|bibcode=2015PTEP.2015e3C02A }}</ref>\n\n====Hyper-Kamiokande detector====\n\nThe Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be a [[water]] [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] detector, 5 times larger (258 kton of water) than the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector. It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Batmann", "label": "safe", "comment": "wiki links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2K_experiment"}

In reviewing both the literature and fossil record in 2007 Wood and Constantino recognised two competing hypotheses, one that aethiopicus, boisei and robustus are a distinct [[clade]] with boisei and robustus evolving from aethiopicus. The second is that there was some parallel evolution of two distinct lines, with boisei evolving from aethiopicus, but robustus evolving separately from A. Africanus.

Although the intelligence of these early hominids was likely no more sophisticated than in modern apes, the bipedal stature is the key element that distinguishes the group from previous primates, which were [[quadrupeds]]. The morphology of ''Australopithecus'' upset what scientists previously believed \u2014 namely, that strongly increased brain size had preceded bipedalism.\n\nIf ''A. afarensis'' was the definite hominid that left the footprints at [[Laetoli]], that strengthens the notion that ''A. afarensis'' had a small brain, but was a biped. Fossil evidence such as this makes it clear that bipedalism far predated large brains. However, it remains a matter of controversy as to how bipedalism first emerged (several concepts are still being studied). The advantages of bipedalism were that it left the hands free to grasp objects (e.g., carry food and young), and allowed the eyes to look over tall grasses for possible food sources or predators. However, many anthropologists argue that these advantages were not large enough to cause the emergence of bipedalism.\n\nA recent study of primate evolution and morphology noted that all apes, both modern and fossil, show skeletal adaptations to erect posture of the trunk, and that fossils such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggested that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Studies of modern [[orangutan]]s in [[Sumatra]] have shown that these apes use four legs when walking on large, stable branches, and swing underneath slightly smaller branches, but are bipedal and keep their legs very straight when walking on multiple flexible branches under 4&nbsp;cm diameter, while also using their arms for balance and additional support. This enables them to get nearer to the edge of the tree canopy to get fruit or cross to another tree.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thorpe |first1=SK |last2=Holder |first2=RL |last3=Crompton |first3=RH. |year=2007 |title=Origin of human bipedalism as an adaptation for locomotion on flexible branches |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=316 |issue=5829| pages=1328\u201331 |pmid=17540902 |doi=10.1126/science.1140799|bibcode=2007Sci...316.1328T }}</ref>\n\nThe ancestors of [[gorilla]]s and [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s are suggested to have become more specialised in climbing vertical tree trunks, using a bent hip and bent knee posture that matches the knuckle-walking posture they use for ground travel.

Their molars were parallel, like those of great apes, and they had a slight pre-canine diastema. But, their canines were smaller, like modern humans, and with the teeth less interlocked than in previous hominins. In fact, in some australopithecines the canines are shaped more like incisors.<ref name=\"Kay1985\">Kay, R.F., 1985, 'DENTAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DIET OF ''AUSTRALOPITHECUS''<nowiki/>', ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', 14, pp. 315-341.</ref>\n\nThe molars of ''Australopithicus'' fit together in much the same way human's do, with low crowns and four low, rounded cusps used for crushing.

It is possible that they had more tough, fibrous plant material in their diets while the smaller species of ''Australopithecus'' had more meat. But it is also possibly due to their generally larger build requiring more food. Their larger molars do support a slightly different diet, including some hard food.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nAustralopithecines also had thick enamel, like those in genus ''Homo'', while other great apes have markedly thinner enamel. One explanation for the thicker enamel is that these hominins were living more on the ground than in the trees and were foraging for tubers, nuts, and cereal grains. They would also have been eating a lot of gritty dirt with the food, which would wear at enamel, so thicker enamel would be advantageous. Or, it could simply indicate a change in diet. Robust australopithecines wore their molar surfaces down flat, unlike the more gracile species, who kept their crests, which certainly seems to suggest a different diet. The gracile ''Australopithecus'' had larger incisors, which indicates tearing and more meat in the diet, likely scavenged. The wear patterns on the tooth surfaces support a largely herbivorous diet.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nWhen we examine the buccal microwear patterns on the teeth of ''A. afarensis'' and ''A. anamensis'', we see that ''A. afarensis'' did not consume a lot of grasses or seeds, but rather ate fruits and leaves, but ''A. anamensis'' did eat grasses and seeds in addition to fruits and leaves.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mart\u00ednez | first1 = L. | last2 = Estebaranz-S\u00e1nchez | first2 = F. | last3 = Galbany | first3 = J. | last4 = P\u00e9rez-P\u00e9rez | first4 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Testing Dietary Hypotheses of East African Hominines Using Buccal Dental Microwear Data | url = | journal = [[PLOS One]] | volume = 11 | issue = 11| pages = 1\u201325 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0165447 | pmid = 27851745 | pmc = 5112956 }}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\n[[Image:A.afarensis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Artistic interpretation of ''Australopithecus afarensis'']]\nIn a 1979 preliminary microwear study of ''Australopithecus'' fossil teeth, anthropologist Alan Walker theorized that robust australopiths were largely [[frugivorous]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Billings, Tom |accessdate=2007-01-06 |title=Humanity's Evolutionary Prehistoric Diet and Ape Diets--continued, Part D) |url= http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview1d.shtml#microwear%20studies| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070108045411/http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview1d.shtml| archivedate= 8 January 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''Australopithecus'' species mainly ate fruit, vegetables, small lizards, and tubers.

In reviewing both the literature and fossil record in 2007 Wood and Constantino recognised two competing hypotheses, one that aethiopicus, boisei and robustus are a distinct [[clade]] with boisei and robustus evolving from aethiopicus. The second is that there was some parallel evolution of two distinct lines, with boisei evolving from aethiopicus, but robustus evolving separately from A. Africanus.

Although the intelligence of these early hominids was likely no more sophisticated than in modern apes, the bipedal stature is the key element that distinguishes the group from previous primates, which were [[quadrupeds]]. The morphology of ''Australopithecus'' upset what scientists previously believed \u2014 namely, that strongly increased brain size had preceded bipedalism.\n\nIf ''A. afarensis'' was the definite hominid that left the footprints at [[Laetoli]], that strengthens the notion that ''A. afarensis'' had a small brain, but was a biped. Fossil evidence such as this makes it clear that bipedalism far predated large brains. However, it remains a matter of controversy as to how bipedalism first emerged (several concepts are still being studied). The advantages of bipedalism were that it left the hands free to grasp objects (e.g., carry food and young), and allowed the eyes to look over tall grasses for possible food sources or predators. However, many anthropologists argue that these advantages were not large enough to cause the emergence of bipedalism.\n\nA recent study of primate evolution and morphology noted that all apes, both modern and fossil, show skeletal adaptations to erect posture of the trunk, and that fossils such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggested that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Studies of modern [[orangutan]]s in [[Sumatra]] have shown that these apes use four legs when walking on large, stable branches, and swing underneath slightly smaller branches, but are bipedal and keep their legs very straight when walking on multiple flexible branches under 4&nbsp;cm diameter, while also using their arms for balance and additional support. This enables them to get nearer to the edge of the tree canopy to get fruit or cross to another tree.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thorpe |first1=SK |last2=Holder |first2=RL |last3=Crompton |first3=RH. |year=2007 |title=Origin of human bipedalism as an adaptation for locomotion on flexible branches |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=316 |issue=5829| pages=1328\u201331 |pmid=17540902 |doi=10.1126/science.1140799|bibcode=2007Sci...316.1328T }}</ref>\n\nThe ancestors of [[gorilla]]s and [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s are suggested to have become more specialised in climbing vertical tree trunks, using a bent hip and bent knee posture that matches the knuckle-walking posture they use for ground travel.

In fact, in some australopithecines the canines are shaped more like incisors.<ref name=\"Kay1985\">Kay, R.F., 1985, 'DENTAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DIET OF ''AUSTRALOPITHECUS''<nowiki/>', ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', 14, pp. 315-341.</ref>\n\nThe molars of ''Australopithicus'' fit together in much the same way human's do, with low crowns and four low, rounded cusps used for crushing. They have cutting edges on the crests.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nRobust australopithecines (like ''A. boisei'' and ''A. robustus'') had larger cheek, or buccal, teeth than the smaller \u2013 or gracile \u2013 species (like ''A. afarensis'' and ''A. africanus''). It is possible that they had more tough, fibrous plant material in their diets while the smaller species of ''Australopithecus'' had more meat. But it is also possibly due to their generally larger build requiring more food. Their larger molars do support a slightly different diet, including some hard food.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nAustralopithecines also had thick enamel, like those in genus ''Homo'', while other great apes have markedly thinner enamel. One explanation for the thicker enamel is that these hominins were living more on the ground than in the trees and were foraging for tubers, nuts, and cereal grains. They would also have been eating a lot of gritty dirt with the food, which would wear at enamel, so thicker enamel would be advantageous. Or, it could simply indicate a change in diet. Robust australopithecines wore their molar surfaces down flat, unlike the more gracile species, who kept their crests, which certainly seems to suggest a different diet. The gracile ''Australopithecus'' had larger incisors, which indicates tearing and more meat in the diet, likely scavenged. The wear patterns on the tooth surfaces support a largely herbivorous diet.<ref name=\"Kay1985\" />\n\nWhen we examine the buccal microwear patterns on the teeth of ''A. afarensis'' and ''A. anamensis'', we see that ''A. afarensis'' did not consume a lot of grasses or seeds, but rather ate fruits and leaves, but ''A. anamensis'' did eat grasses and seeds in addition to fruits and leaves.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mart\u00ednez | first1 = L. | last2 = Estebaranz-S\u00e1nchez | first2 = F. | last3 = Galbany | first3 = J. | last4 = P\u00e9rez-P\u00e9rez | first4 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Testing Dietary Hypotheses of East African Hominines Using Buccal Dental Microwear Data | url = | journal = [[PLOS One]] | volume = 11 | issue = 11| pages = 1\u201325 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0165447 | pmid = 27851745 | pmc = 5112956 }}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\n[[Image:A.afarensis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Artistic interpretation of ''Australopithecus afarensis'']]\nIn a 1979 preliminary microwear study of ''Australopithecus'' fossil teeth, anthropologist Alan Walker theorized that robust australopiths were largely [[frugivorous]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Billings, Tom |accessdate=2007-01-06 |title=Humanity's Evolutionary Prehistoric Diet and Ape Diets--continued, Part D) |url= http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview1d.shtml#microwear%20studies| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070108045411/http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview1d.shtml| archivedate= 8 January 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''Australopithecus'' species mainly ate fruit, vegetables, small lizards, and tubers.

The specimen was studied by the Australian anatomist [[Raymond Dart]], who was then working at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]]. The fossil skull was from a three-year-old [[bipedal]] primate that he named ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''. The first report was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in February 1925. Dart realised that the fossil contained a number of humanoid features, and so, he came to the conclusion that this was an early ancestor of humans.<ref name=\"historyofstudy\">{{cite book|title= Human Evolution: An Illustrated Introduction |last=Lewin |first=Roger |chapter=The Australopithecines |year=1999 |publisher= Blackwell Science |isbn=0632043091 |pages=112\u2013113}}</ref> Later, Scottish paleontologist [[Robert Broom]] and Dart set about to search for more early hominin specimens, and at several sites they found more ''A. africanus'' remains, as well as fossils of a species Broom named ''Paranthropus'' (which would now be recognised as ''P. robustus''). Initially, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] were largely hostile to the idea that these discoveries were anything but apes, though this changed during the late 1940s.<ref name=\"historyofstudy\" />. By 1950, Mayr was treating ''Australopithecus'' as a species of Homo, ''Homo transvaalensis'', on the grounds that all bipedal apes should be treated as part of Homo.<ref name=\"Schwartz2015\" /> However, the contra view taken by Robinson in 1954, excluding Australopiths from Homo, became the prevalent view in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Schwartz2015\" />\n\nThe first australopithecine discovered in eastern Africa was a skull belonging to an ''A. boisei'' that was excavated in 1959 in the [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] by [[Mary Leakey]]. Since then, the Leakey family have continued to excavate the gorge, uncovering further evidence for australopithecines, as well as for ''[[Homo habilis]]'' and ''[[Homo erectus]]''.<ref name=\"historyofstudy\" /> The scientific community took 20 years to widely accept ''Australopithecus'' as a member of the family tree.\n\nThen, in 1997, an almost complete ''Australopithecus'' skeleton with skull was found in the [[Sterkfontein caves]] of [[Gauteng]], South Africa.

Devraj, the son of a former crime boss, declares himself the next leader of the crime syndicate; he is supported by some members but opposed by the rest. Ibrahim reveals to Kalki, legal advisor of the Roy group that Roy's family has been killed and he has been raising a secret for 25 years when he was alive. The secret was that he had a son who survived named Vishwank. Vishwank foils Devraj's plans by succeeding his father as the next boss. Vishwank is also determined to unmask his father's murderer and sets out to lead Waaji City.\n\nRoy had to set up a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in India but was opposed by the external affairs minister of India. However, he manages to get the permission signature on a letter from him. Then, the gangsters' money is on a ship that gets destroyed in a bomb blast.\n\nThe story then turns to India, where a mastermind steals about two trillion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] with ease. A nationwide manhunt ensues to find the culprit. Undercover agent Ashok Chakravarthy is assigned as head of the manhunt task-force. Although he initially refuses, he relents after finding out that Amritha Nair, a woman whom he is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with, will also be on the task-force. The task-force uncovers the whereabouts of a thief named Jai and traps him during his next robbery, after Amritha and Ashok fall in love. They let Jai take a black box that Vishwank introduces to Kalki and others and that can open his locker containing treasures at a secure building in Waaji City.\n\nLater, there is a chase in which Amritha, Ashok, and David (a hacker) confront Jai at a bridge. It is then revealed that the thief was real Ashok and the officer who was with them is  Saaho, who is the actual person committing the robberies and Jai was actually the undercover police officer Ashok Chakravarthy. As Saaho escapes with his partner David, Amritha, along with the entire Indian police department, is stunned.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed that Devraj killed Roy in order to gain power and that the money of the gangsters is with him and that he was the one who planned the blast. Amritha then tracks Saaho and pretends that she is still in love with him but is actually helping Ashok. Meanwhile, Amritha actually falls for Saaho and betrays Ashok. Saaho takes Amritha to different places, which are nothing but the drawings in Amrita's book which Saaho saw when they were in [[Mumbai]]. Even after this, Amrita feels that they are opposite and can never be one but Saaho clears that and when he tries to kiss her, she is shot and taken away by Devraj. Saaho is forced by Devraj to give him the black box but later betrays him as he strikes a deal and gives the black box to Vishwank. Saaho also destroys Devraj's building and steals the money that he had with him. Amritha is then subsequently saved by Ibrahim, one of Vishwank's associates. Saaho is then chased by Ashok and the police, with Amritha in a helicopter with a sniper. As the sniper is shooting him, Amritha tries to save Saaho by distracting the sniper, but the sniper pushes her towards the very end of the helicopter. Saaho saves her with a [[jet pack]] but is later arrested by the police.\n\nKalki who was with Vishwank the whole time is revealed to be on Devraj's side. She goes to the vault and opens it with Vishwank's fingerprint which she had stolen it earlier. She accesses the vault with the black box and finds pictures of Roy and his son. She also finds a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', thus revealing Roy's two most precious things in the vault, meanwhile Amritha locates and chases Alex, a man who ran away seeing her in a bar in [[Mumbai]]  and Ashok meets up with Vishwank.\n\nSaaho is taken to Karana village by Shinde, where he battles with Devraj's goons and defeats them easily. Devraj arrives, and Saaho reveals to him that he is Siddhant Nandan Saaho, the real son of Roy. He also reveals to Devraj that he did this to avenge his father's death. Vishwank and Alex also reveal this to Ashok and Amritha, respectively. Kalki also witnesses a portrait of Roy and Saaho inside the vault, thereby shocking all of them. After all of this, Saaho kills Devraj, thereby avenging Roy's death.\n\nIbrahim reveals that Vishwank was not Roy's son, but was his own son and his real name was Iqbal. He then tells them that Iqbal was there to save Roy's throne. He also reveals Saaho's real identity to the gang members, and Saaho becomes the next king of the underworld. Months later, Saaho locates Amritha in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and confesses his love for her; they share a kiss and hug each other. In a distance, a sniper aims at Saaho as he opens his eye to the danger, hinting at a potential sequel for the movie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhas]] as Ashok Chakravarthy/Siddhant Nandan Saaho\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Amritha Nair\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Narantak Roy \n* [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] as Jai/Ashok Chakravarthy \n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Vishwank Roy/Iqbal\n* [[Chunky Pandey]] as Devraj \n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Goswami\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as David\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Ibrahim\n* [[Supreeth]] as Alex Fernandes\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Kalki\n* [[Prakash Belawadi]] as Shinde\n* [[Evelyn Sharma]] as Jennifer\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Prince \n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as Prithviraj \n* [[Ravi Varma (actor)|Ravi Varma]] as Ajay\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as IG\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Mani\n* Sasha Chettri\n* Girish Garladinne\n* Damini Chopra<ref>{{cite news |title= Saaho actress Damini Chopra's gorgeous looks|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/gorgeous-alert-saaho-debutante-damini-chopra-is-a-dazzling-bombshell-on-instagram/photostory/68080477.cms|accessdate=20 February 2019 |work=Times of India |date=20 February 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* Kumar Raja Venati\n* Naveen Varma Ganapathiraju\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as an item number in the song \"Bad Boy\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacqueline and Prabhas sizzle in Saaho's Bad Boy|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jacqueline-and-prabhas-sizzle-in-saahos-bad-boy/articleshow/70723531.cms|accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=Times of India |date=19 August 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Indian external affairs minister Ramaswamy Allagadda (cameo)\n{{colend}}\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as sub police\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on a budget of {{INR}}350 [[crore]].<ref name=\"Budget\"/> The film was shot in [[Austria]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Romania]], and other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e.telugurajyam.com/team-saaho-lands-in-austria-for-crucial-scenes/|title=Team Saaho lands in Austria for crucial scenes|date=17 June 2019|website=telugurajyam|language=en-US|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/saaho-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-chill-in-austria-after-shoot-see-viral-pics-1555557-2019-06-25|title=Saaho: Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor chill in Austria after shoot.

Devraj, the son of a former crime boss, declares himself the next leader of the crime syndicate; he is supported by some members but opposed by the rest. Ibrahim reveals to Kalki, legal advisor of the Roy group that Roy's family has been killed and he has been raising a secret for 25 years when he was alive. The secret was that he had a son who survived named Vishwank. Vishwank foils Devraj's plans by succeeding his father as the next boss. Vishwank is also determined to unmask his father's murderer and sets out to lead Waaji City.\n\nRoy had to set up a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in India but was opposed by the external affairs minister of India. However, he manages to get the permission signature on a letter from him. Then, the gangsters' money is on a ship that gets destroyed in a bomb blast.\n\nThe story then turns to India, where a mastermind steals about two trillion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] with ease. A nationwide manhunt ensues to find the culprit. Undercover agent Ashok Chakravarthy is assigned as head of the manhunt task-force. Although he initially refuses, he relents after finding out that Amritha Nair, a woman whom he is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with, will also be on the task-force. The task-force uncovers the whereabouts of a thief named Jai and traps him during his next robbery, after Amritha and Ashok fall in love. They let Jai take a black box that Vishwank introduces to Kalki and others and that can open his locker containing treasures at a secure building in Waaji City.\n\nLater, there is a chase in which Amritha, Ashok, and David (a hacker) confront Jai at a bridge. It is then revealed that the thief was real Ashok and the officer who was with them is  Saaho, who is the actual person committing the robberies and Jai was actually the undercover police officer Ashok Chakravarthy. As Saaho escapes with his partner David, Amritha, along with the entire Indian police department, is stunned.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed that Devraj killed Roy in order to gain power and that the money of the gangsters is with him and that he was the one who planned the blast. Amritha then tracks Saaho and pretends that she is still in love with him but is actually helping Ashok. Meanwhile, Amritha actually falls for Saaho and betrays Ashok. Saaho takes Amritha to different places, which are nothing but the drawings in Amrita's book which Saaho saw when they were in [[Mumbai]]. Even after this, Amrita feels that they are opposite and can never be one but Saaho clears that and when he tries to kiss her, she is shot and taken away by Devraj. Saaho is forced by Devraj to give him the black box but later betrays him as he strikes a deal and gives the black box to Vishwank. Saaho also destroys Devraj's building and steals the money that he had with him. Amritha is then subsequently saved by Ibrahim, one of Vishwank's associates. Saaho is then chased by Ashok and the police, with Amritha in a helicopter with a sniper. As the sniper is shooting him, Amritha tries to save Saaho by distracting the sniper, but the sniper pushes her towards the very end of the helicopter. Saaho saves her with a [[jet pack]] but is later arrested by the police.\n\nKalki who was with Vishwank the whole time is revealed to be on Devraj's side. She goes to the vault and opens it with Vishwank's fingerprint which she had stolen it earlier. She accesses the vault with the black box and finds pictures of Roy and his son. She also finds a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', thus revealing Roy's two most precious things in the vault, meanwhile Amritha locates and chases Alex, a man who ran away seeing her in a bar in [[Mumbai]]  and Ashok meets up with Vishwank.\n\nSaaho is taken to Karana village by Shinde, where he battles with Devraj's goons and defeats them easily. Devraj arrives, and Saaho reveals to him that he is Siddhant Nandan Saaho, the real son of Roy. He also reveals to Devraj that he did this to avenge his father's death. Vishwank and Alex also reveal this to Ashok and Amritha, respectively. Kalki also witnesses a portrait of Roy and Saaho inside the vault, thereby shocking all of them. After all of this, Saaho kills Devraj, thereby avenging Roy's death.\n\nIbrahim reveals that Vishwank was not Roy's son, but was his own son and his real name was Iqbal. He then tells them that Iqbal was there to save Roy's throne. He also reveals Saaho's real identity to the gang members, and Saaho becomes the next king of the underworld. Months later, Saaho locates Amritha in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and confesses his love for her; they share a kiss and hug each other. In a distance, a sniper aims at Saaho as he opens his eye to the danger, hinting at a potential sequel for the movie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhas]] as Ashok Chakravarthy/Siddhant Nandan Saaho\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Amritha Nair\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Narantak Roy \n* [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] as Jai/Ashok Chakravarthy \n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Vishwank Roy/Iqbal\n* [[Chunky Pandey]] as Devraj \n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Goswami\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as David\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Ibrahim\n* [[Supreeth]] as Alex Fernandes\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Kalki\n* [[Prakash Belawadi]] as Shinde\n* [[Evelyn Sharma]] as Jennifer\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Prince \n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as Prithviraj \n* [[Ravi Varma (actor)|Ravi Varma]] as Ajay\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as IG\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Mani\n* Sasha Chettri\n* Girish Garladinne\n* Damini Chopra<ref>{{cite news |title= Saaho actress Damini Chopra's gorgeous looks|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/gorgeous-alert-saaho-debutante-damini-chopra-is-a-dazzling-bombshell-on-instagram/photostory/68080477.cms|accessdate=20 February 2019 |work=Times of India |date=20 February 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* Kumar Raja Venati\n* Naveen Varma Ganapathiraju\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as an item number in the song \"Bad Boy\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacqueline and Prabhas sizzle in Saaho's Bad Boy|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jacqueline-and-prabhas-sizzle-in-saahos-bad-boy/articleshow/70723531.cms|accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=Times of India |date=19 August 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Indian external affairs minister Ramaswamy Allagadda (cameo)\n{{colend}}\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as sub police\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on a budget of {{INR}}350 [[crore]].<ref name=\"Budget\"/> The film was shot in [[Austria]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Romania]], and other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e.telugurajyam.com/team-saaho-lands-in-austria-for-crucial-scenes/|title=Team Saaho lands in Austria for crucial scenes|date=17 June 2019|website=telugurajyam|language=en-US|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/saaho-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-chill-in-austria-after-shoot-see-viral-pics-1555557-2019-06-25|title=Saaho: Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor chill in Austria after shoot.
