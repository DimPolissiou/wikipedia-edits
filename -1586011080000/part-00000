In computers, BFRs are used in four main applications: in [[printed circuit board]]s, in components such as [[Electrical connector|connector]]s, in plastic covers, and in [[electrical cable]]s. BFRs are also used in a multitude of products, including, but not exclusively, plastic covers of television sets, carpets, pillows, paints, upholstery, and domestic kitchen appliances.\n\n==Testing for BFR in plastics==\n\nUntil recently testing for BFR has been cumbersome. Cycle time, cost and level of expertise required for the test engineer has precluded the implementation of any screening of plastic components in a manufacturing or in a product qualification/validation environment.\n\nRecently, with the introduction of a new analytical instrument [[IA-Mass]], screening of plastic material alongside a manufacturing line became possible. A five-minute detection cycle and a 20-minute quantification cycle is available to test and to qualify plastic parts as they reach the assembly line. IA-Mass identifies the presence of bromine (PBB, PBDE, and some others), but cannot characterize all the BFRs present in the plastic matrix.\n\nIn February 2009, the [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements|Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM)]] released two certified reference materials (CRMs) to help analytical laboratories better detect two classes of flame retardants, namely polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs). The two reference materials were custom made to contain all relevant PBDEs and PBBs at levels close to the legal limit set out in the [[RoHS Directive]] of 1 g/kg for the sum of PBBs and PBDEs.\n\n==Environmental and safety issues==\nMany brominated chemicals are under increasing criticism in their use in household furnishings and where children would come into contact with them. Some believe PBDEs could have harmful effects on humans and animals. Increasing concern has prompted some European countries to ban some of them, following the [[precautionary principle]] more common in Europe.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Stiffler | first=Lisa | title=PBDEs: They are everywhere, they accumulate and they spread | newspaper=[[Seattle Post Intelligencer]] | date=March 28, 2007 | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/309169_pbde28.html}}</ref> Some PBDEs are [[lipophilic]] and bioaccumulative.

In computers, BFRs are used in four main applications: in [[printed circuit board]]s, in components such as [[Electrical connector|connector]]s, in plastic covers, and in [[electrical cable]]s. BFRs are also used in a multitude of products, including, but not exclusively, plastic covers of television sets, carpets, pillows, paints, upholstery, and domestic kitchen appliances.\n\n==Testing for BFR in plastics==\n\nUntil recently testing for BFR has been cumbersome. Cycle time, cost and level of expertise required for the test engineer has precluded the implementation of any screening of plastic components in a manufacturing or in a product qualification/validation environment.\n\nRecently, with the introduction of a new analytical instrument [[IA-Mass]], screening of plastic material alongside a manufacturing line became possible. A five-minute detection cycle and a 20-minute quantification cycle is available to test and to qualify plastic parts as they reach the assembly line. IA-Mass identifies the presence of bromine (PBB, PBDE, and some others), but cannot characterize all the BFRs present in the plastic matrix.\n\nIn February 2009, the [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements|Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM)]] released two certified reference materials (CRMs) to help analytical laboratories better detect two classes of flame retardants, namely polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs). The two reference materials were custom made to contain all relevant PBDEs and PBBs at levels close to the legal limit set out in the [[RoHS Directive]] of 1 g/kg for the sum of PBBs and PBDEs.\n\n==Environmental and safety issues==\nMany brominated chemicals are under increasing criticism in their use in household furnishings and where children would come into contact with them. Some believe PBDEs could have harmful effects on humans and animals. Increasing concern has prompted some European countries to ban some of them, following the [[precautionary principle]] more common in Europe.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Stiffler | first=Lisa | title=PBDEs: They are everywhere, they accumulate and they spread | newspaper=[[Seattle Post Intelligencer]] | date=March 28, 2007 | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/309169_pbde28.html}}</ref> Some PBDEs are [[lipophilic]] and bioaccumulative.

No central government existed, and in times of crisis the people were led by ad hoc leaders known as [[Biblical judges|Judges]] (see the [[Book of Judges]]). With the growth of the threat from Philistine incursions, the Israelite tribes decided to form a strong centralised monarchy to meet the challenge, and the Tribe of Naphtali joined the new kingdom with [[Saul]] as the first king. After the death of Saul, all the tribes other than Judah remained loyal to the House of Saul, but after the death of [[Ish-bosheth]], Saul's son and successor to the throne of Israel, the Tribe of Naphtali joined the other northern Israelite tribes in making [[David]], who was then the king of Judah, king of a re-united Kingdom of Israel. However, on the accession of [[Rehoboam]], David's grandson, in c. 930 BC the northern tribes split from the [[Davidic line|House of David]] to reform a Kingdom of Israel as the Northern Kingdom.\n\nIn c. 732 BCE, [[Pekah]] allied with [[Rezin]], king of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], threatened [[Jerusalem]], and [[Ahaz]], [[king of Judah]], appealed to [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], the king of [[Assyria]], for help. After Ahaz paid tribute to Tiglath-Pileser, ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:7-9|NIV}}) Tiglath-Pileser sacked Damascus and Israel, annexing Aram<ref name=Grabbe>Lester L. Grabbe, ''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?'' (New York: T&T Clark, 2007): 134</ref> and a large part of Israel, \"including all the land of Naphtali.\" According to {{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|NIV}} and {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|NIV}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria. The kingdom of Israel continued to exist until c. 723 BC, when it was again invaded by [[Assyria]] and the rest of the population deported.\n\nFrom that time, the Tribe of Naphtali has been counted as one of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel.

Again, in the reign of Pekah this tribe was among the first to feel the iron hand of Assyria and to suffer the deportation of many captives ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|15:20|KJV}}; {{bibleverse|2 Kings|15:20|KJV}}). In a reference to this incident ([[Isaiah 9:1]]\u2013[[Isaiah 9:2|2]]) the prophet Isaiah anticipates that the same region will see the dawn of the Messianic deliverance.

This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel.\n\nUnlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians do not need ''Letters of Bourgeoisie'' to prove their status.\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris (but not in the [[suburb]]s) as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris.

This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel.\n\nUnlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians do not need ''Letters of Bourgeoisie'' to prove their status.\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris (but not in the [[suburb]]s) as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris.

Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities. This urban system in Europe dates back for many cities still existing today to [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Latin antiquity]], others were founded around the year one thousand.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Les villes du Moyen \u00c2ge, essai d\u2019histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'', Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927.

Other ingredients may include [[gum arabic]] and [[glycerol]]. An advantage of this medium includes a high [[refractive index]] and clearing (macerating) properties of small specimens (especially advantageous if specimens require observation with [[differential interference contrast microscopy]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Melzer's reagent====\nChloral hydrate is an ingredient used to make [[Melzer's reagent]], an [[aqueous solution]] that is used to identify certain species of [[fungi]]. The other ingredients are [[potassium iodide]], and [[iodine]].

It achieved wide use in both [[Lunatic asylum|asylums]] and the homes of those socially refined enough to avoid asylums. Upper- and middle-class women, well-represented in the latter category, were particularly susceptible to chloral hydrate [[addiction]]. After the 1904 invention of [[barbital]], the first of the [[barbiturate]] family, chloral hydrate began to disappear from use among those with means.<ref name=\":0\" /> It remained common in asylums and hospitals until the Second World War as it was quite cheap.

In 1875, [[Claude Bernard]] tried to determine if chloral hydrate exerted its action through a metabolic conversion to [[chloroform]].

However, chloral hydrate was quite polar but nonetheless a potent hypnotic. Overton was unable to explain this mystery. Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard's experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that was converted into the more [[lipophilic]] molecule [[2,2,2-Trichloroethanol]]. This metabolite fit much better with the Meyer\u2013Overton correlation than chloral had.

Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard's experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that was converted into the more [[lipophilic]] molecule [[2,2,2-Trichloroethanol]].

Frank Baum]] is a children's novel, the seventh in the [[Oz series]]. Characters include the [[List of Oz characters#Woozy|Woozy]], [[Ojo the Lucky|Ojo]] \"the Unlucky\", [[List of Oz characters#Unc Nunkie|Unc Nunkie]], [[List of Oz characters#Dr. Pipt|Dr. Pipt]], [[List of Oz characters#Patchwork Girl|Scraps]] (the patchwork girl), and others. The book was first published on July 1, 1913, with illustrations by [[John R. Neill]]. In 1914, Baum adapted the book to film through his \"[[Oz Film Manufacturing Company]].\"\n\nIn the previous Oz book, ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'', [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] was used to isolate Oz from all contact with the outside world. Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardship.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|1997|page=171}}</ref> In the prologue, he reconciles Oz's isolation with the appearance of a new Oz book by explaining that he contacted [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in Oz via [[wireless telegraphy]], and she obtained Ozma's permission to tell Baum this story.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|1997|page=176}}</ref> \n\nThe book was dedicated to Sumner Hamilton Britton, the young son of one of its publishers, Sumner Charles Britton of [[Reilly & Britton]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ojo the Lucky|Ojo]], known as Ojo the Unlucky, lives in poverty with his laconic uncle [[Unc Nunkie]] in the woods of the [[Munchkin Country]] in [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. They visit their neighbor, the magician [[List of Oz characters#Dr. Pipt|Dr. Pipt]] who is about to complete the six-year process of preparing the magical Powder of Life, which can bring inanimate objects to life. Pipt's wife has constructed a life-sized stuffed girl out of [[patchwork]], and wishes her husband to animate her to serve as an obedient household servant. They also meet another of Pipt's creations, Bungle, an extremely vain talking cat made of glass. The Powder of Life successfully animates the patchwork girl, but an accident causes both Pipt's wife and Unc Nunkie to be turned to stone. Dr. Pipt tells Ojo that he must obtain five ingredients to make a compound to counteract the petrifaction spell.\n\nOjo and the patchwork girl, who calls herself Scraps, along with Bungle, embark on a journey to obtain the magic ingredients: a six-leaved clover, the wing of a yellow butterfly, water from a dark well, a drop of oil from a live man's body, and three hairs from a Woozy's tail. Scraps exhibits a wild, carefree personality, and is prone to spontaneous recitation of nonsense poetry. After several adventures, they meet a Woozy, a blocky quadruped who agrees to let them have three hairs from its tail. But they are unable to remove the hairs, so they take the Woozy along with them.\n\nThe party is captured by large animate plants, but they are rescued by the fortuitous arrival of the [[Shaggy Man]]. He leads them to the [[Emerald City]] to meet [[Ozma]], but warns Ojo that picking a six-leaved clover is forbidden by law in Oz. Along the way they meet the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who is quite smitten with Scraps, as she is with him. Just outside the Emerald City, Ojo sees a six-leaved clover by the road and, believing himself to be unobserved, picks it. When they arrive at the city gates, the [[Soldier with the Green Whiskers]] approaches them and announces that Ojo is under arrest.\n\nBrought to trial before Ozma, Ojo confesses and Ozma pardons him and allows him to keep the clover. [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] and the Scarecrow join Ojo and Scraps as they continue their search for the remaining ingredients. Along the way they meet [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], the playful but annoying Tottenhots, and the man-eating 21-foot-tall giant [[List of Oz characters (created by Baum)#Mr. Yoop|Mr. Yoop]], before reaching the subterranean dwellings of the Hoppers, who each have just one leg, and the neighboring Horners, who each have one horn on their head. The two groups are on the verge of war due to a misunderstanding, but Scraps reconciles them. A grateful Horner leads the group to a well in a dark [[radium]] mine, and Ojo collects a flask of water from it.\n\nThe group continues to the castle of the [[Tin Woodsman]] who rules the [[Winkie Country]], since yellow butterflies are most likely to be found in that yellow-dominated quadrant of Oz. While talking to the Tin Woodsman, Ojo notices a drop of oil about to drip from his body, and he catches it in a vial. He explains that he now has all the ingredients except one. But when he describes the last one, the Tin Woodsman is horrified at the idea of killing an innocent butterfly, and forbids them from doing so in his realm. Ojo is devastated, but the Tin Woodsman proposes that they all travel back to the Emerald City to ask Ozma's advice.\n\nOzma tells them that Dr. Pipt has been practicing magic illegally and has therefore been deprived of his powers. But the petrified Unc Nunkie and Pipt's wife have been brought to the Emerald City and as they all watch, the [[Wizard of Oz]] restores them to life. Ojo and Unc Nunkie are given a new house to live in near the Emerald City and the Tin Woodsman calls Ojo \"Ojo the Lucky\".\n\n==Background and analysis==\nIn reference to ''The Patchwork Girl of Oz,'' one of Baum's letters to his publisher, Sumner Britton of [[Reilly & Britton]], offers unusual insight on Baum's manner of creating his Oz fantasies:\n\n{{quote|\nA lot of thought is required on one of these fairy tales.

'''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019, presenter and poet Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer, and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech at the Radio 4 listening festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSoul Music has no presenter, focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began, it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.  When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol, Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world.  He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day, a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning.  Here is a blog by Sarah Blunt, the distinguished natural history radio producer, writing about the birth of Tweet.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/3143388d-5c2f-3e73-a3c1-727bb8c6b65d</ref>\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nBristol Network Radio still makes original and groundbreaking Natural History content for public service radio (not for profit)\nand produced the first eco-thriller drama podcast 'FOREST 404' for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3</ref>\n\nSet in the 24th century, after a data crash called 'The Cataclysm'. Pan, the main character, is a young woman with a boring job sorting and deleting old sound files that survived the crash. She uncovers a set of sound recordings from the early 21st century that haunt her. \n\nThis immersive sci-fi thriller stars Pearl Mackie, Tanya Moodie, and Pippa Haywood \u2013 with original music by Bonobo. You can still hear it on BBC Sounds.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p074m60p</ref>\n\nForest 404 was used to launch a groundbreaking public experiment investigating the impact of natural sounds on well-being and mental health. This was done in partnership with the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council), Natural History Television, Exeter University, Bristol University, and the Open University. The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>  \n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas.  The series has won critical acclaim and some awards include a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack and a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten.  Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\n\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime, and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\".  \nThe BBC acquired the Christchurch Studios in Clifton to record dramas. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001).  As drama changed, the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as the performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers, and broadcasters.  The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.  \n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city.  More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012.  Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster.  The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes.  The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living.  The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\n\nPresenters associated with Bristol include: \n\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nIn March 2012 The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in Bristol called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership. It was staged to celebrate the best of BBC Radio 4 in conjunction with appropriate non-commercial partners including St George's Bristol, The British Library, Bristol City Council, University of the West of England, Pervasive Media Studios, Bristol University, QEH Bristol and BBC Radio Bristol.\n\nSome of the events and involvement with the creative people of Bristol were captured in this blog\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2012/03/more_than_words_festival_-_day_1.html</ref>\n\nIn March 2013 BBC Network Radio in Bristol celebrated the arrival of Radio 4's Food Programme to the city by inviting food professionals, food groups and food lovers to join them in an innovative community partnership festival called \"Bristol Food Connections\", bringing people together around good food.  The first Bristol Food Connections festival was an ambitious 11-day initiative, born out of a five-year partnership between the BBC and public bodies in the city to drive much stronger engagement between the BBC in Whiteladies Road and local people. The aim of Bristol Food Connections was to open up food education, aspiring entrepreneurs and the food industry to the widest possible talent pool through outreach and education initiatives via BBC broadcasting.<ref>https://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/the-bbc-at-bristol-food-connections/</ref><ref>https://visitbristol.co.uk/whats-on/bristol-food-connections-p2196433</ref>\n\n== BBC Food and Farming Awards ==\n\nThe BBC Food and Farming Awards has been an annual event in the city since 2013 although the awards themselves were launched in 2000 in London by HRH Prince Charles.

'''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies.
