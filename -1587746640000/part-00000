By 1363, Wenceslaus II was appointed as a Canon of the [[cathedral chapter]] in Breslau (although he only took formal possession of this post in 1368).\n\nAfter his father's death in 1364, Wenceslaus II and his brothers were placed under the guardianship of their uncle [[Ludwik I the Fair]] and later by his older brother Rupert I. Louis I took a special interest in the spiritual career of his nephew and since 1371, prepared him for the future post of Bishop of Breslau.\n\nSince 1363, Wenceslaus II began his studies in the University of [[Prague]], and in the decade of 1370 he travelled to [[Montpellier]], [[France]], where he obtained a degree in canon law. In 1373, he was chosen as canon of [[Olomouc]].\n\nOn 3 December 1375, Wenceslaus II was appointed by [[Pope Gregory XI]] as Bishop of [[Lebus]], although by canon law, the legal minimum age for this type of post was thirty years. From the rule of Wenceslaus II in Lebus was known little; only some information was found on Wenceslaus as bishop as to the [[Synod]] in [[Kalisz]] in 1378, convening the bishops of the suffragans with Lebus' then metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]].\n\nThe diocese of Lebus produced few incomes. In addition, its location on the border between [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[Bohemia]] left Lebus considerably damaged during the war between [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbachs]] the [[House of Luxemburg|Luxemburgs]]. For this, Wenceslaus decided to move the diocesan capital to [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]].\n\nIn 1378 appeared before Wenceslaus II the chance to obtain the Diocese of Breslau, because the Bishop Elect Theodore of Klatow didn't receive papal approval. Initially it appeared that the election of Wenceslaus II would not cause any problems, but the death of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]] and the [[Western Schism]] in the Church left the post vacant during almost six years, until 19 April 1382, when Wenceslaus II finally received confirmation of the Pope as the new Bishop. Facilitated the nomination that during 1379-1382 Wenceslaus II's brother Henry VIII acted as Administrator of the Diocese.\n\nWenceslaus II quickly became known by his forceful politics, standing invariably at the side of the Roman Papacy; at a reward for his loyalty in 1385, [[Pope Urban VI]] wanted to give him the title of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]. For unknown reasons, the Duke-Bishop refused.\n\nThe first years of his rule in the Breslau Diocese, Wenceslaus II was merged in a bitter dispute with the local nobility, who tried to eliminate the law immunities of the Church. Shortly afterwards he was requested to make a settlement of the dispute to [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|King Wenceslaus IV]], which Breslau, whose bishops resisted to allow the King to grant them the church property, including churches, as a fiefs. The case was even more serious for Wenceslaus II, because he didn't have yet the king's approval for his episcopal dignity.\n\nThe settlement was finally made in 1382: Breslau obtained the right to import goods from outside the clergy district (permitted only on the acquisition of their own needs, without the possibility of sales). In addition, King Wenceslaus IV approved for young Liegnitz Duke the Episcopal dignity and then Wenceslaus II officially received the Duchy of Neisse-Ottmachau as a fief belonging to the Diocese of Breslau.\n\nAs Bishop of Wroclaw, Wenceslaus II was an efficient administrator. In 1415 he ordered the imposition and modification in the episcopal diocese of a secular law court, which most of his items in the next few centuries become in patterns for the rest of Silesian courts. Wenceslaus II's activities were expressed in Synods organized by him (in 1401, 1405, 1406 and 1410).\n\nThe Duke-Bishop was also known for giving large sums to the Church foundations. During this time were founded: the Canon College in Ottmachau, and [[collegiate church]]es in both [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]]) and [[Niemodlin|Falkenberg (Niemodlin)]]. In the disputes between the Silesian Duchies and the Church, he didn't hesitate to use the excommunication to his relatives (for example, the ban was applied by him to Duke [[Bolko IV of Opole]]).\n\nThis attitude caused several problems to Wenceslaus II, in particular the attacks of estates whose leaders were banned by him (like Duke [[Henry IX of L\u00fcben]]). In order to raise funds for the defense, Wenceslaus didn't hesitate to pledge Church property.\n\nOn 12 January 1409, after the death of his last surviving brother [[Rupert I of Legnica|Rupert I]] without male issue, Wenceslaus II became the sole heir of the Duchy of Legnica; two months later, on 19 March, he designated as his heirs the brothers Henry IX and [[Louis II of Brieg]], grandsons of Louis I the Fair. In 1413, Wenceslaus managed to unite the Diocese of Breslau and the Duchy of Liegnitz in one state, trying in that way to save the title of Bishop to his successors.\n\nOn 16 March 1413, Wenceslaus II resigned from the government of the duchy and gave it to Louis II. That decision triggered in several war between Henry IX and Louis II, because the older brother Henry IX resented that the whole principality was given to Louis II. Henry protested to Wenceslaus II and tried to convince him to revert his decision, but the Duke-Bishop maintain the inheritance over Louis.\n\nIn 1417, the tired and old Wenceslaus II sent to [[Pope Martin V]] his resignation from the bishopric. Soon, Rome decided to approve it and on 17 December 1417 was chosen the new Bishop of Breslau: Duke [[Konrad IV the Older|Conrad the Elder]].\n\nWenceslaus II then retired to the Episcopal seat of Ottmachau, where he spent his last years.

By 1363, Wenceslaus II was appointed as a Canon of the [[cathedral chapter]] in Breslau (although he only took formal possession of this post in 1368).\n\nAfter his father's death in 1364, Wenceslaus II and his brothers were placed under the guardianship of their uncle [[Ludwik I the Fair]] and later by his older brother Rupert I. Louis I took a special interest in the spiritual career of his nephew and since 1371, prepared him for the future post of Bishop of Breslau.\n\nSince 1363, Wenceslaus II began his studies in the University of [[Prague]], and in the decade of 1370 he travelled to [[Montpellier]], [[France]], where he obtained a degree in canon law. In 1373, he was chosen as canon of [[Olomouc]].\n\nOn 3 December 1375, Wenceslaus II was appointed by [[Pope Gregory XI]] as Bishop of [[Lebus]], although by canon law, the legal minimum age for this type of post was thirty years. From the rule of Wenceslaus II in Lebus was known little; only some information was found on Wenceslaus as bishop as to the [[Synod]] in [[Kalisz]] in 1378, convening the bishops of the suffragans with Lebus' then metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]].\n\nThe diocese of Lebus produced few incomes. In addition, its location on the border between [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[Bohemia]] left Lebus considerably damaged during the war between [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbachs]] the [[House of Luxemburg|Luxemburgs]]. For this, Wenceslaus decided to move the diocesan capital to [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]].\n\nIn 1378 appeared before Wenceslaus II the chance to obtain the Diocese of Breslau, because the Bishop Elect Theodore of Klatow didn't receive papal approval. Initially it appeared that the election of Wenceslaus II would not cause any problems, but the death of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]] and the [[Western Schism]] in the Church left the post vacant during almost six years, until 19 April 1382, when Wenceslaus II finally received confirmation of the Pope as the new Bishop. Facilitated the nomination that during 1379-1382 Wenceslaus II's brother Henry VIII acted as Administrator of the Diocese.\n\nWenceslaus II quickly became known by his forceful politics, standing invariably at the side of the Roman Papacy; at a reward for his loyalty in 1385, [[Pope Urban VI]] wanted to give him the title of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]. For unknown reasons, the Duke-Bishop refused.\n\nThe first years of his rule in the Breslau Diocese, Wenceslaus II was merged in a bitter dispute with the local nobility, who tried to eliminate the law immunities of the Church. Shortly afterwards he was requested to make a settlement of the dispute to [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|King Wenceslaus IV]], which Breslau, whose bishops resisted to allow the King to grant them the church property, including churches, as a fiefs. The case was even more serious for Wenceslaus II, because he didn't have yet the king's approval for his episcopal dignity.\n\nThe settlement was finally made in 1382: Breslau obtained the right to import goods from outside the clergy district (permitted only on the acquisition of their own needs, without the possibility of sales). In addition, King Wenceslaus IV approved for young Liegnitz Duke the Episcopal dignity and then Wenceslaus II officially received the Duchy of Neisse-Ottmachau as a fief belonging to the Diocese of Breslau.\n\nAs Bishop of Wroclaw, Wenceslaus II was an efficient administrator. In 1415 he ordered the imposition and modification in the episcopal diocese of a secular law court, which most of his items in the next few centuries become in patterns for the rest of Silesian courts. Wenceslaus II's activities were expressed in Synods organized by him (in 1401, 1405, 1406 and 1410).\n\nThe Duke-Bishop was also known for giving large sums to the Church foundations. During this time were founded: the Canon College in Ottmachau, and [[collegiate church]]es in both [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]]) and [[Niemodlin|Falkenberg (Niemodlin)]]. In the disputes between the Silesian Duchies and the Church, he didn't hesitate to use the excommunication to his relatives (for example, the ban was applied by him to Duke [[Bolko IV of Opole]]).\n\nThis attitude caused several problems to Wenceslaus II, in particular the attacks of estates whose leaders were banned by him (like Duke [[Henry IX of L\u00fcben]]). In order to raise funds for the defense, Wenceslaus didn't hesitate to pledge Church property.\n\nOn 12 January 1409, after the death of his last surviving brother [[Rupert I of Legnica|Rupert I]] without male issue, Wenceslaus II became the sole heir of the Duchy of Legnica; two months later, on 19 March, he designated as his heirs the brothers Henry IX and [[Louis II of Brieg]], grandsons of Louis I the Fair. In 1413, Wenceslaus managed to unite the Diocese of Breslau and the Duchy of Liegnitz in one state, trying in that way to save the title of Bishop to his successors.\n\nOn 16 March 1413, Wenceslaus II resigned from the government of the duchy and gave it to Louis II. That decision triggered in several war between Henry IX and Louis II, because the older brother Henry IX resented that the whole principality was given to Louis II. Henry protested to Wenceslaus II and tried to convince him to revert his decision, but the Duke-Bishop maintain the inheritance over Louis.\n\nIn 1417, the tired and old Wenceslaus II sent to [[Pope Martin V]] his resignation from the bishopric. Soon, Rome decided to approve it and on 17 December 1417 was chosen the new Bishop of Breslau: Duke [[Konrad IV the Older|Conrad the Elder]].\n\nWenceslaus II then retired to the Episcopal seat of Ottmachau, where he spent his last years. He died on 30 December 1419, and was buried in the local collegiate church of St. Nicholas. After the transfer of the Chapter all the Bishop's remains with their tombstones were moved to Neisse. Since 1682 Wenceslaus II's remains and tombstone were placed in the Church of St. Jakob.\n\n==References==\n*{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SILESIA.htm#Barbaradied1436 |title-date= |title= SILESIA|date=August 2012}}\n*{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast5.html#W1 |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast: Silesia |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}\n*''This article was translated from his Polish Wikipedia version''.\n\n== External links ==\n*Ilona Matejko-Peterka: [https://www.academia.edu/39290472/System_sfragistyczny_ksi%C4%99cia-biskupa_Wac%C5%82awa_II_legnickiego_1348_1419_The_sphragistic_system_of_the_duke_and_bishop_Wenceslaus_II_1348_1419_from_the_Legnica-Brzeg System sfragistyczny ksi\u0119cia-biskupa Wac\u0142awa II legnickiego (1348\u20131419) / The sphragistic system of the duke and bishop Wenceslaus II (1348\u2013 1419) from the Legnica-Brzeg]. \u010casopis Slezsk\u00e9ho zemsk\u00e9ho muzea \u2013 s\u00e9rie B, v\u011bdy historick\u00e9 62, \u010d. 1, 2013.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of Piast]]||1348|30 December|1419 in [[Otmuch\u00f3w|Ottmachau/Otmuch\u00f3w]]|}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Wenceslaus I of Legnica|Wenceslaus I]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Legnica]]<br/>''with Rupert I (until 1409), <br/>Boles\u0142aw IV (until 1394),<br/> and Henry VIII (until 1398)'' |years=1364\u20131413}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Louis II of Brieg|Louis II]]}}\n{{s-rel|ca}}\n{{s-bef | before=[[Peter of Oppeln|Peter I of Oppeln]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Bishop of Lebus]]|years=1375-1382}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[John von Kittlitz|John II von Kittlitz]]}}\n|-\n{{s-vac|rows=2 | last=[[Przec\u0142aw of Pogorzela]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of bishops of Wroc\u0142aw|Bishop of Wroclaw]]|years=1382\u20131417}}\n{{s-aft|rows=2 | after=[[Konrad IV the Older|Konrad IV]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Duchy of Nysa|Duke of Nysa]]|years=1382\u20131417}}\n{{end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wenceslaus 02 Of Legnica}}\n[[Category:1348 births]]\n[[Category:1419 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Legnica]]\n[[Category:Prince-Bishops of Breslau]]\n", "name_user": "ArisMethymna", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_II_of_Legnica"}

[[administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (region) in [[western Ukraine]]. Its [[administrative center]] is the city of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]. As is the case with most other oblasts of [[Ukraine]] this region has the same name as its administrative center \u2013 which was renamed by the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukrainian authorities]] after the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]] on November 9, 1962. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2016|1,382,352}}.\n\nIvano-Frankivsk Oblast is also known to Ukrainians by a deep-rooted alternative name: ''[[Prykarpattia]]'' (although some sources may also consider the southern [[Lviv Oblast]] including such cities as [[Stryi]], [[Truskavets]], and [[Drohobych]], as also part of Prykarpattia).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}  Prykarpattia, together with [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] and [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] regions, was the main body of the historic region of eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Halychyna]]; which in the 13th century was a part of the Kingdom of Rus and the Halych-Volyn Principality (see [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]). Along with the Lviv and Ternopil regions ''Prykarpattia'' is a component of the [[Carpathian Euroregion]].\n\nDuring the times of the [[Second Polish Republic]] the area was known as [[Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] (1918\u20131939) and later, after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], as '''Stanislav Oblast''' (1939\u20131962). During [[World War II]] it was part of the [[District of Galicia]] in [[General Governorate]]. Until the 20th century the major center of the region was the city of [[Kolomyia]] (which is a major cultural center of [[Pokuttya]], the traditional name for the southern part of the oblast).\n\n==Name==\nAs with the rest of Ukraine's oblasts Ivano-Frankivsk may also be known by its matronymical name ''Ivano-Frankivshchyna''. However, that name did not receive general public acceptance and commonly Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is almost always called ''[[Prykarpattya]]'' \u2013 a historic name for the same region. (Geographically the historic region covers a much larger portion of Ukraine than just the Ivano-Frankivsk region.)\n\n==Geography==\nIvano-Frankivsk Oblast borders [[Lviv Oblast]] to its north and west, [[Zakarpattya Oblast]] to its south-west, has a 50-km long state border with [[Romania]] ([[Maramure\u0219 County]]) to its immediate south, and it borders [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] to the south-east and [[Ternopil Oblast]] to the east. It is situated partly in the [[Eastern European Plain]] and partly [[Carpathian Foothills (Ukraine)|Carpathian Foothills]]. The oblast may be divided into three regions: mountainous, pre-mountainous, and plains.\n\nThe climate is mildly-continental and damp with cool summers and mild winters. The average monthly temperature in June is {{convert|18|C|F|0}} with {{convert|12|to|16|C|F|0}} in the mountains. The average monthly temperature in January is {{convert|-4|C|F|0}} with {{convert|-6|C|F|0}} in the mountains. Average precipitation varies annually around {{convert|650|mm|1|abbr=on}}  with {{convert|1550|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the mountains.\n\n===Relief===\n{{see also|Divisions of the Carpathians}}\n[[File:Ukraine geology.png|300px|thumb|Geology of Ukraine]]\nThe region is situated between two main regional tectonic plates: Carpathian fold belt and Volhynia-Podillya plate. The most prominent features of the first one are the [[Carpathian Mountains]], while the second one - [[Dniester]] river.\n\nThe Carpathian Mountains contribute tremendously to the change in relief of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast and their elevation rises from north-east to south-west stretching along the oblast's south-western border. The elevation of the oblast varies from 230m to 2,061m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The mountains occupy almost one half of the whole Oblast and consist of two main mountain ranges: the [[Gorgany]] (highest peak \u2013 Mt. Syvulya Major (1,836m)) and the [[Chornohora]] range (highest peak \u2013 Mt. [[Hoverla]] (2,061m)).\n\nThe rest of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is located within the [[Dniester|Dniester river]] and [[Prut|Prut river]] valleys. The plains of the oblast are part of the [[Carpathian Foothills (Ukraine)|Carpathian Foothills]] and [[Opillia Upland]] (part of [[Podolian Upland|Podillia Upland]]) which are cut through by [[Dniester]]. The [[Highland (geography)|upland]] has a temperate-climate habitat mixed with [[grassland]] and [[woodland]] \u2013 also known as the [[forest steppe]]. The relief of the region consists mostly of [[rolling hill]]s of 230-400m over the sea level. Near river valleys are common [[canyon]]s and [[ravine]]s.\n\n{{main|Opillia Upland}}\nThe Dniester flows mainly through the [[Halych Raion]] and along the administrative border between Ivano-Frankivsk and [[Ternopil Oblast]]s. The territory of the region within immediate proximity to the river is traditionally known as ''Opillia''. Opillia, however, stretches far beyond the oblast and only covers two of its raions: [[Halych Raion]] and [[Rohatyn Raion]], both located in the north. Relief in the area consists of rolling hills uplands.\n\n{{main|Carpathian Foothills (Ukraine)}}\nThe Carpathian foothills consist mostly of low denudation accumulative uplands, while the right bank of Dniester along the border with the [[Ternopil Oblast]] depicts [[karst]] type relief of [[Pokuttia Upland]]. Because of it near that area along [[Dniester]] relief shows forms of [[canyon]]. Pokuttia Upland between [[Bystrytsia of Nadvirna]] and [[Prut River]] (Prut-Bystrytsia Upland) serves as drainage divide within the oblast between Dniester and Prut. Carpathian foothills have two depressions: one is at the confluence of [[Bystrytsia of Solotvyn]], [[Bystrytsia of Nadvirna]], [[Vorona River (Bystrytsia)|Vorona]] and [[Bystrytsia River|Bystrytsia]] rivers, called Bystrytsia Depression, and another is around the city of [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]], called Kalush Depression.\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{main|Rivers in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast}}\nOblast has plethora of rivers, waterfalls, mountainous brooks, and smaller ponds, but there is almost no other type of bodies of water such as lakes and water reservoirs. Most of rivers either flow into [[Dniester]] or [[Prut River]] (tributary of [[Danube]]). The total water drainage area of the region is {{convert|13900|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Segments of Dniester and [[Cheremosh River]] are used as administrative borders with [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] and [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]] oblasts respectfully.\n\nThe water drainage divide between Dniester and Prut cuts the region through middle of following districts: [[Nadvirna Raion]], [[Kolomyia Raion]], [[Tlumach Raion]], and [[Horodenka Raion]].\n\n===Nature Sanctuaries===\nThe region is a home to some 456 preserved areas (on June 1, 2006) of some {{convert|195,633|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, 30 out of which are of all-national importance with an area of {{convert|108,742|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and the rest of a local importance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.orada.if.ua/fileadmin/documents/Programi/215-9.pdf |title=Tourism in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region (government website) |access-date=2011-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007161332/http://www.orada.if.ua/fileadmin/documents/Programi/215-9.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the Ivano-Frankivsk Region is located a strict nature reserve Gorgany that was created in 1996.

The governor appoints his deputies forming his regional governing cabinet to supervise the government policies in the region. Aside of the state administration the region has its own council that is headed by its chairman.

[[Burshtyn]] became the 6th city of regional importance in 2014. The formation of the region was established in 1921 in the [[Second Polish Republic]] and was in majority preserved during the Soviet times. Most of the districts (former powiats) were reestablished as well in 1960s. The major industrial and cultural centers of the region were given a wider form of autonomy and assigned as the cities of regional subordination.\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;

Five of those cities are of regional importance and the other ten are of district importance. All cities have its own council and mayor that represent a local form of self-government allowed by the laws on local administration and the [[Constitution of Ukraine]]. City municipalities of the region are independent from any district administration.\n;Town municipalities (councils)\nWithin the region there are 24 urbanized settlements (towns) which are a special settlement classification inherited from the Soviet municipal organization. Three of those towns serve as administrative centers of their respective districts. Each town has its own council that along with surrounding village councils compose a district administration which has its own executive branch, District State Administration, appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. Towns do not have a mayoral office and their head of the council serves as the main representative of the whole settlement. \n;Village municipalities (councils)\nAll other settlements in the region are considered rural and accounted for some 765 localities including villages and 20 selyshches (smaller villages) which are administered by 477 village councils. Some village municipalities consist of several villages, while others are a single-village municipality. There are several villages that are part of city municipalities such as Ivano-Frankivsk, Bolekhiv, and Yaremcha, while all others are spread out across the districts of the region.\n\n===Historical overview of subdivisions===\nWhen on November 27, 1939 the Soviet regime was established in [[Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship]], the Polish administrative division of it was kept almost the same until January 17, 1940. Only two powiats Stryi and Zydaczow were transferred away.\n\nOn December 4, 1939 the voivodeship was officially renamed into Stanislav Oblast. In 1940 the oblast was redivided into 37 raions and two municipalities (cities of oblast subordination). The administrative centers of the former raions were following settlements: Bohorodchany (town), Bolekhiv (city), Bilshivtsi (town), Bukachivtsi (village), Burshtyn (town), Voinylov (village), Vyhoda (village), Halych (town), Hvizdets (town), Horodenka (town), Delyatyn (town), Dolyna (city), [[Verkhovyna|Zhabie]] (village), [[Yezupil|Zhovten]] (town), Zabolotiv (town), Kalush (city), Kolomyia (city), Korshiv (village), Kosiv (city), Kuty (town), Lanchyn (town), Lysets (town), Nadvirna (city), Novytsya (village), Obertyn (town), Otynya (town), Pechenizhyn (town), Rohatyn (city), Rozhnyativ (town), Snyatyn (city), Solotvyn (town), Stanislav (city), Tlumach (city), Tysmenytsya (town), Chernelytsya (town), Yabluniv (town), Yaremcha (village). Two municipalities were cities of Stanislav and Kolomyia. On November 11, 1940 Delyatyn Raion was liquidated. On November 16, 1940 Novytsya Raion was re-administrated under town of Perehinske.\n\nDuring the World War II the region was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany]] (see [[Operation Barbarossa]]). Along with Lviv, Drohobych and Tarnopil oblasts, it was reorganized on August 1, 1941 into [[Distrikt Galizien]] centered in Lemberg and annexed to the [[General Government]]. The area of the former Stanislav Oblast was divided into three kreis (counties): Kalusz, Stanislau, and Kolomea. On July 27, 1944 the region was liberated from the [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[Soviet Army]] (see [[Lvov\u2013Sandomierz Offensive]]).\n\nThe administrative division of Stanislav Oblast was reinstated and confirmed on January 1, 1947 with the same 36 raions and two municipalities as their existed before the war. Several settlements, however, had their status elevated. The status of a town obtained Bukachivtsi, Vyhoda, and Yaremcha, while Halych and Horodenka became recognized as cities. The next major changes in the region took place in the late 1950s. In 1957 five raions were liquidated: Vyhoda, Zhovten, Kuty, Pechenizhyn, and Chernelytsya. Then another five were liquidated in 1959: Bukachivtsi, Korshiv, Perehinske, Solotvyn, and Stanislav. On December 30, 1962 within the oblast was created the Verkhovyna Industrial Raion, centered in a town of Verkhovyna.<ref>[http://uapravo.net/akty/postanowa-main/akt8phny1h.htm \u041f\u0440\u043e \u0443\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0456\u0432 \u0456 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f]</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 1963 another major change took place when raions of the oblast were re-administered into the six rural raions, one \u2013 industrial, and two municipalities. There were the following administrative centers: Bohorodchany, Halych, Horodenka, Kalush, Kolomyia, Kosiv, Dolyna (municipalities \u2013 Ivano-Frankivsk (new name) and Kolomyia). On January 4, 1965 Dolyna Industrial Raion Raion was redesigned into the regular raion, while five other previous raions were recreated: Nadvirna, Rohatyn, Rozhnyativ, Snyatyn, and Tlumach. On December 8, 1966 there were created Verkhovyna and Ivano-Frankivsk raions. That was the last major re-administration of the oblast.\n\nOn March 20, 1972 in the city of Kalush was created a municipality and it became a city of oblast subordination. On December 30, 1977 the same thing happened to Yaremcha status of which was elevated as well. On March 28, 1982 the Ivano-Frankivsk Raion was re-administrated under the Tysmenytsya Raion. On October 21, 1993 the city of Bolekhiv became of an oblast subordination with its own municipality.

There are numerous natural and architectural benchmarks that are scattered throughout the region.\n\nOne of the famous festivals is the Ukrainian International festival of [[ethnic music]] and [[land art]] \"Sheshory\" that usually takes place in the picturesque [[Hutsul]] village of the [[Kosiv Raion]] Sheshory since 2003.<ref>[http://sheshory.ua/index.html Shehsory festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809063723/http://sheshory.ua/index.html |date=2011-08-09 }} {{in lang|uk}}</ref> From 2007, however the festival has spread throughout the country taking place in [[Podillya]], [[Kiev Oblast]], and other places. In August 2010 the village of Spas in the [[Kolomyia Raion]] hosted a culinary event ''Smachny Spas'' in association with \"Sheshory\", while in July of the same year another eco-cultural event ''[[Trypilske kolo]]'' in the [[Rzhyschiv]] city of [[Kiev region]].\n\nThe city of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] hosts several other festivals such as the All-Ukrainian festival of art collectives \"Carpathian Spring\" that takes place every May. Every two year the festival of modern art \"Impreza\" takes place every other year. Every odd year the city hosts the festival national-patriotic music and poetry \"Freedom\". Since May 2001 every year the city of Ivano-Frankivsk is the capital of the European blacksmith movement hosting the \"Festival of blacksmith\" and the art exhibition \"Ornamental Forging\" that takes place at the Mickewicz Square and neighboring Andrei Sheptytsky Square in city's [[old town]].\n\nOn the territory of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast are located numerous monuments of architectural heritage. On February 8, 1994 near the city of [[Halych]] was established the National preserve '''\"Ancient Halych\"'''.<ref>[http://www.davniyhalych.if.ua/ \u041e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 Ancient Halych] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116131839/http://www.davniyhalych.if.ua/ |date=2010-01-16 }}</ref> Among other important sites in the region is the Church of the Holy Spirit located in the city of [[Rohatyn]] as well as the '''[[Manyava]] [[Skete]]''' near the village of Manyava in [[Bohorodchany Raion]]. The oblast also accounts for some number of various wooden churches of [[Boykos]] and [[Hutsuls]] traditional architecture.\n\nIn the [[Dolyna Raion]] (western region) visitors can find the '''Carpathian Train''' that still uses the [[narrow gauge railway]] system. Train is used for its direct purpose transporting wood as well as for a tourist recreation. The biggest benchmark of the region is the '''[[Hoverla]]''' mountain, the tallest in the nation. However, due to increased touristic activities in the post-Soviet times the mountain is a subject to a high degree of pollution. No less interesting destination serve the '''[[Dovbush rocks]]''' that are located near the city of [[Bolekhiv]] in mountains. That location was a base of an anti-Polish Peasant movement. Near the [[Manyava Skete]] is located the highest waterfall in [[Ukraine]], the '''[[Maniava waterfall]]''' (20m). In the same [[Bohorodchany Raion]] visitors may find the local '''[[mud volcano]]''' located near the village of [[Starunia]]. It was noticed for the first time in 1977 after an earthquake that took place in [[Romania]].\n[[File:\u041c\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u0456\u0441\u043b\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0449\u0443.jpg|border|thumb|203x203px|[[Maniava waterfall]]]]\n[[Bukovel]] ski resort, centralized around the village of [[Polianytsia]], on the ridge-lines of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] Mountain range at an elevation of 900m (3,000ft) represents a major all seasons tourist destination in the region. It is one of the most popular ski resorts in Eastern Europe and in 2012 was named the fastest growing ski resort in the world. Bukovel consists of 16 ski lifts with approximately 50 kilometers of [[Piste|pistes]]. As well as skiing visitors to the resort can enjoy 7 world class hotels, chalets with swimming pools and saunas, as well as numerous other recreational activities ranging from family friendly leisurely activities to extreme sports. During the warmer months the resort boasts cross-country and downhill mountain biking trails. Over 6,000 people visit the resort every year.\n\n==Historical and Cultural Sites==\n\n* Recently, a monument of cultural heritage was erected in the city of [[Kolomyya]] in Pokuttya. The [[Pysanka Museum|museum ''\"Pysanka\"'']] was built in 2000 and is the only one in the world.\n* Another interesting historical site is the cavern complex in the [[Dovbush Rock]]. The site is dedicated to the legendary freedom fighter [[Oleksa Dovbush]] who in the legend fights against the Polish [[szlachta]]. The rock complex is located about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=out}} south west from [[Bolekhiv]] near village of [[Bubnysche]].\n* The [[Church of the Holy Spirit (Rohatyn)|Church of the Holy Spirit]], built in 1598, is located in the north of the Oblast in the small city of [[Rohatyn]].\n\n===Popular culture===\nIn 1979 [[Sofia Rotaru]] performed the song \"Krai\" (''[Native] Land'') about ''[[Prykarpattia]]''.<ref>{{YouTube|MmLh0laIlug|Krai by Rotaru}}</ref> In the song Rotaru calls ''Prykarpattia'' the land of the [[Cheremosh]] and [[Prut]] rivers.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Roads===\n;State Highways\nThrough Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast runs one European route <small>{{jct|country=EUR|E|50 }}</small> which travels through the city of [[Rohatyn]] in the north.

[[administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (region) in [[western Ukraine]]. Its [[administrative center]] is the city of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]. As is the case with most other oblasts of [[Ukraine]] this region has the same name as its administrative center \u2013 which was renamed by the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukrainian authorities]] after the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]] on November 9, 1962. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2016|1,382,352}}.\n\nIvano-Frankivsk Oblast is also known to Ukrainians by a deep-rooted alternative name: ''[[Prykarpattia]]'' (although some sources may also consider the southern [[Lviv Oblast]] including such cities as [[Stryi]], [[Truskavets]], and [[Drohobych]], as also part of Prykarpattia).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}  Prykarpattia, together with [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] and [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] regions, was the main body of the historic region of eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Halychyna]]; which in the 13th century was a part of the Kingdom of Rus and the Halych-Volyn Principality (see [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]). Along with the Lviv and Ternopil regions ''Prykarpattia'' is a component of the [[Carpathian Euroregion]].\n\nDuring the times of the [[Second Polish Republic]] the area was known as [[Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] (1918\u20131939) and later, after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], as '''Stanislav Oblast''' (1939\u20131962). During [[World War II]] it was part of the [[District of Galicia]] in [[General Governorate]]. Until the 20th century the major center of the region was the city of [[Kolomyia]] (which is a major cultural center of [[Pokuttya]], the traditional name for the southern part of the oblast).\n\n==Name==\nAs with the rest of Ukraine's oblasts Ivano-Frankivsk may also be known by its matronymical name ''Ivano-Frankivshchyna''. However, that name did not receive general public acceptance and commonly Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is almost always called ''[[Prykarpattya]]'' \u2013 a historic name for the same region. (Geographically the historic region covers a much larger portion of Ukraine than just the Ivano-Frankivsk region.)\n\n==Geography==\nIvano-Frankivsk Oblast borders [[Lviv Oblast]] to its north and west, [[Zakarpattya Oblast]] to its south-west, has a 50-km long state border with [[Romania]] ([[Maramure\u0219 County]]) to its immediate south, and it borders [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] to the south-east and [[Ternopil Oblast]] to the east. It is situated partly in the [[Eastern European Plain]] and partly [[Carpathian Foothills (Ukraine)|Carpathian Foothills]]. The oblast may be divided into three regions: mountainous, pre-mountainous, and plains.\n\nThe climate is mildly-continental and damp with cool summers and mild winters. The average monthly temperature in June is {{convert|18|C|F|0}} with {{convert|12|to|16|C|F|0}} in the mountains. The average monthly temperature in January is {{convert|-4|C|F|0}} with {{convert|-6|C|F|0}} in the mountains. Average precipitation varies annually around {{convert|650|mm|1|abbr=on}}  with {{convert|1550|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the mountains.\n\n===Relief===\n{{see also|Divisions of the Carpathians}}\n[[File:Ukraine geology.png|300px|thumb|Geology of Ukraine]]\nThe region is situated between two main regional tectonic plates: Carpathian fold belt and Volhynia-Podillya plate. The most prominent features of the first one are the [[Carpathian Mountains]], while the second one - [[Dniester]] river.\n\nThe Carpathian Mountains contribute tremendously to the change in relief of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast and their elevation rises from north-east to south-west stretching along the oblast's south-western border. The elevation of the oblast varies from 230m to 2,061m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The mountains occupy almost one half of the whole Oblast and consist of two main mountain ranges: the [[Gorgany]] (highest peak \u2013 Mt. Syvulya Major (1,836m)) and the [[Chornohora]] range (highest peak \u2013 Mt. [[Hoverla]] (2,061m)).\n\nThe rest of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is located within the [[Dniester|Dniester river]] and [[Prut|Prut river]] valleys. The plains of the oblast are part of the [[Carpathian Foothills (Ukraine)|Carpathian Foothills]] and [[Opillia Upland]] (part of [[Podolian Upland|Podillia Upland]]) which are cut through by [[Dniester]]. The [[Highland (geography)|upland]] has a temperate-climate habitat mixed with [[grassland]] and [[woodland]] \u2013 also known as the [[forest steppe]]. The relief of the region consists mostly of [[rolling hill]]s of 230-400m over the sea level. Near river valleys are common [[canyon]]s and [[ravine]]s.\n\n{{main|Opillia Upland}}\nThe Dniester flows mainly through the [[Halych Raion]] and along the administrative border between Ivano-Frankivsk and [[Ternopil Oblast]]s. The territory of the region within immediate proximity to the river is traditionally known as ''Opillia''. Opillia, however, stretches far beyond the oblast and only covers two of its raions: [[Halych Raion]] and [[Rohatyn Raion]], both located in the north. Relief in the area consists of rolling hills uplands.\n\n{{main|Carpathian Foothills (Ukraine)}}\nThe Carpathian foothills consist mostly of low denudation accumulative uplands, while the right bank of Dniester along the border with the [[Ternopil Oblast]] depicts [[karst]] type relief of [[Pokuttia Upland]]. Because of it near that area along [[Dniester]] relief shows forms of [[canyon]]. Pokuttia Upland between [[Bystrytsia of Nadvirna]] and [[Prut River]] (Prut-Bystrytsia Upland) serves as drainage divide within the oblast between Dniester and Prut. Carpathian foothills have two depressions: one is at the confluence of [[Bystrytsia of Solotvyn]], [[Bystrytsia of Nadvirna]], [[Vorona River (Bystrytsia)|Vorona]] and [[Bystrytsia River|Bystrytsia]] rivers, called Bystrytsia Depression, and another is around the city of [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]], called Kalush Depression.\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{main|Rivers in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast}}\nOblast has plethora of rivers, waterfalls, mountainous brooks, and smaller ponds, but there is almost no other type of bodies of water such as lakes and water reservoirs. Most of rivers either flow into [[Dniester]] or [[Prut River]] (tributary of [[Danube]]). The total water drainage area of the region is {{convert|13900|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Segments of Dniester and [[Cheremosh River]] are used as administrative borders with [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] and [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]] oblasts respectfully.\n\nThe water drainage divide between Dniester and Prut cuts the region through middle of following districts: [[Nadvirna Raion]], [[Kolomyia Raion]], [[Tlumach Raion]], and [[Horodenka Raion]].\n\n===Nature Sanctuaries===\nThe region is a home to some 456 preserved areas (on June 1, 2006) of some {{convert|195,633|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, 30 out of which are of all-national importance with an area of {{convert|108,742|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and the rest of a local importance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.orada.if.ua/fileadmin/documents/Programi/215-9.pdf |title=Tourism in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region (government website) |access-date=2011-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007161332/http://www.orada.if.ua/fileadmin/documents/Programi/215-9.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the Ivano-Frankivsk Region is located a strict nature reserve Gorgany that was created in 1996.

[[Burshtyn]] became the 6th city of regional importance in 2014. The formation of the region was established in 1921 in the [[Second Polish Republic]] and was in majority preserved during the Soviet times. Most of the districts (former powiats) were reestablished as well in 1960s. The major industrial and cultural centers of the region were given a wider form of autonomy and assigned as the cities of regional subordination.\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;

Five of those cities are of regional importance and the other ten are of district importance. All cities have its own council and mayor that represent a local form of self-government allowed by the laws on local administration and the [[Constitution of Ukraine]]. City municipalities of the region are independent from any district administration.\n;Town municipalities (councils)\nWithin the region there are 24 urbanized settlements (towns) which are a special settlement classification inherited from the Soviet municipal organization. Three of those towns serve as administrative centers of their respective districts. Each town has its own council that along with surrounding village councils compose a district administration which has its own executive branch, District State Administration, appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. Towns do not have a mayoral office and their head of the council serves as the main representative of the whole settlement. \n;Village municipalities (councils)\nAll other settlements in the region are considered rural and accounted for some 765 localities including villages and 20 selyshches (smaller villages) which are administered by 477 village councils. Some village municipalities consist of several villages, while others are a single-village municipality. There are several villages that are part of city municipalities such as Ivano-Frankivsk, Bolekhiv, and Yaremcha, while all others are spread out across the districts of the region.\n\n===Historical overview of subdivisions===\nWhen on November 27, 1939 the Soviet regime was established in [[Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship]], the Polish administrative division of it was kept almost the same until January 17, 1940. Only two powiats Stryi and Zydaczow were transferred away.\n\nOn December 4, 1939 the voivodeship was officially renamed into Stanislav Oblast. In 1940 the oblast was redivided into 37 raions and two municipalities (cities of oblast subordination). The administrative centers of the former raions were following settlements: Bohorodchany (town), Bolekhiv (city), Bilshivtsi (town), Bukachivtsi (village), Burshtyn (town), Voinylov (village), Vyhoda (village), Halych (town), Hvizdets (town), Horodenka (town), Delyatyn (town), Dolyna (city), [[Verkhovyna|Zhabie]] (village), [[Yezupil|Zhovten]] (town), Zabolotiv (town), Kalush (city), Kolomyia (city), Korshiv (village), Kosiv (city), Kuty (town), Lanchyn (town), Lysets (town), Nadvirna (city), Novytsya (village), Obertyn (town), Otynya (town), Pechenizhyn (town), Rohatyn (city), Rozhnyativ (town), Snyatyn (city), Solotvyn (town), Stanislav (city), Tlumach (city), Tysmenytsya (town), Chernelytsya (town), Yabluniv (town), Yaremcha (village). Two municipalities were cities of Stanislav and Kolomyia. On November 11, 1940 Delyatyn Raion was liquidated. On November 16, 1940 Novytsya Raion was re-administrated under town of Perehinske.\n\nDuring the World War II the region was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany]] (see [[Operation Barbarossa]]). Along with Lviv, Drohobych and Tarnopil oblasts, it was reorganized on August 1, 1941 into [[Distrikt Galizien]] centered in Lemberg and annexed to the [[General Government]]. The area of the former Stanislav Oblast was divided into three kreis (counties): Kalusz, Stanislau, and Kolomea. On July 27, 1944 the region was liberated from the [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[Soviet Army]] (see [[Lvov\u2013Sandomierz Offensive]]).\n\nThe administrative division of Stanislav Oblast was reinstated and confirmed on January 1, 1947 with the same 36 raions and two municipalities as their existed before the war. Several settlements, however, had their status elevated. The status of a town obtained Bukachivtsi, Vyhoda, and Yaremcha, while Halych and Horodenka became recognized as cities. The next major changes in the region took place in the late 1950s. In 1957 five raions were liquidated: Vyhoda, Zhovten, Kuty, Pechenizhyn, and Chernelytsya. Then another five were liquidated in 1959: Bukachivtsi, Korshiv, Perehinske, Solotvyn, and Stanislav. On December 30, 1962 within the oblast was created the Verkhovyna Industrial Raion, centered in a town of Verkhovyna.<ref>[http://uapravo.net/akty/postanowa-main/akt8phny1h.htm \u041f\u0440\u043e \u0443\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0456\u0432 \u0456 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0434\u0435\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f]</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 1963 another major change took place when raions of the oblast were re-administered into the six rural raions, one \u2013 industrial, and two municipalities. There were the following administrative centers: Bohorodchany, Halych, Horodenka, Kalush, Kolomyia, Kosiv, Dolyna (municipalities \u2013 Ivano-Frankivsk (new name) and Kolomyia). On January 4, 1965 Dolyna Industrial Raion Raion was redesigned into the regular raion, while five other previous raions were recreated: Nadvirna, Rohatyn, Rozhnyativ, Snyatyn, and Tlumach. On December 8, 1966 there were created Verkhovyna and Ivano-Frankivsk raions. That was the last major re-administration of the oblast.\n\nOn March 20, 1972 in the city of Kalush was created a municipality and it became a city of oblast subordination. On December 30, 1977 the same thing happened to Yaremcha status of which was elevated as well. On March 28, 1982 the Ivano-Frankivsk Raion was re-administrated under the Tysmenytsya Raion. On October 21, 1993 the city of Bolekhiv became of an oblast subordination with its own municipality. On December 14, 2006 Yaremcha was renamed into Yaremche.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Ukraine}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;width:10%;\" align=\"right\"\n|-\n!

Train is used for its direct purpose transporting wood as well as for a tourist recreation. The biggest benchmark of the region is the '''[[Hoverla]]''' mountain, the tallest in the nation. However, due to increased touristic activities in the post-Soviet times the mountain is a subject to a high degree of pollution. No less interesting destination serve the '''[[Dovbush rocks]]''' that are located near the city of [[Bolekhiv]] in mountains. That location was a base of an anti-Polish Peasant movement. Near the [[Manyava Skete]] is located the highest waterfall in [[Ukraine]], the '''[[Maniava waterfall]]''' (20m).

[http://www.musicbox-online.com/gd-mcree.html \"Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions''], ''The Music Box''</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions''''' is an [[American folk music]] album. It was recorded live by the band of the same name at the Top of the Tangent coffee house in [[Palo Alto, California]] in July, 1964, and released in 1999.\n\nThe band Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions was a precursor of the rock group the [[Grateful Dead]], and included three future members of that band \u2013 [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Weir]], and [[Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan]].\n\n==The jug band tapes==\n\nMother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions was a [[jug band]]. Jug band music is a type of folk music that uses traditional musical instruments such as [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|guitar]], [[mandolin]], and [[banjo]], combined with homemade instruments, including [[washtub bass]], [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]], [[kazoo]], and, eponymously, a [[jug (musical instrument)|jug]], played by blowing into it as if it were a [[brass instrument]]. Jug bands were popular in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1960s, jug band music enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence as part of the [[American folk music revival]]. Jug bands of the 1960s often played popular music from the earlier jug band era, along with more contemporary folk and [[blues]] songs, as can be heard on the ''Mother McCree's'' album.\n\nThe performances on the album were recorded by [[Stanford University]] students Pete Wanger and Wayne Ott. They played the recordings on the folk music show ''Live from the Top of the Tangent'' which was broadcast on Stanford's FM radio station [[KZSU]]. The tapes were thought to be lost to history until Pete Wanger and his brother Michael found them in the attic of their mother's house after she died in 1997.

It was recorded live by the band of the same name at the Top of the Tangent coffee house in [[Palo Alto, California]] in July, 1964, and released in 1999.\n\nThe band Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions was a precursor of the rock group the [[Grateful Dead]], and included three future members of that band \u2013 [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Weir]], and [[Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan]].\n\n==The jug band tapes==\n\nMother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions was a [[jug band]]. Jug band music is a type of folk music that uses traditional musical instruments such as [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|guitar]], [[mandolin]], and [[banjo]], combined with homemade instruments, including [[washtub bass]], [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]], [[kazoo]], and, eponymously, a [[jug (musical instrument)|jug]], played by blowing into it as if it were a [[brass instrument]]. Jug bands were popular in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1960s, jug band music enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence as part of the [[American folk music revival]]. Jug bands of the 1960s often played popular music from the earlier jug band era, along with more contemporary folk and [[blues]] songs, as can be heard on the ''Mother McCree's'' album.\n\nThe performances on the album were recorded by [[Stanford University]] students Pete Wanger and Wayne Ott. They played the recordings on the folk music show ''Live from the Top of the Tangent'' which was broadcast on Stanford's FM radio station [[KZSU]]. The tapes were thought to be lost to history until Pete Wanger and his brother Michael found them in the attic of their mother's house after she died in 1997. They found enough material there for a whole album. The recordings were subsequently [[audio mastering|mastered]] for CD by Grateful Dead recording engineer Jeffrey Norman. Michael Wanger, a boyhood friend of Bob Weir, wrote the liner notes for the CD.\n\n''Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions'' includes several songs that were later played in concert by the Grateful Dead \u2013 \"Overseas Stomp\" (also known as \"Lindy\"), \"Ain't It Crazy\" (a.k.a. \"The Rub\"), \"On the Road Again\", \"The Monkey and the Engineer\", and \"Beat It On Down the Line\".\n\n==Track listing==\n\n#\"Overseas Stomp\" ([[Will Shade]])\n#\"Ain't It Crazy\" ([[Lightnin' Hopkins|Sam \"Lightning\" Hopkins]])\n#Boo Break\n#\"Yes She Do, No She Don't\" ([[Peter DeRose]], Jo Trent)\n#\"[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis]]\" ([[Chuck Berry]])\n#\"Boodle Am Shake\" ([[Jack Palmer (composer)|Jack Palmer]], [[Spencer Williams]])\n#\"Big Fat Woman\" ([[Lead Belly|Huddie Ledbetter]])\n#\"Borneo\" (traditional)\n#\"My Gal\" (traditional)\n#\"Shake That Thing\" ([[Papa Charlie Jackson]])\n#\"[[Beat It On Down the Line]]\" ([[Jesse Fuller]])\n#\"[[Take a Whiff on Me|Cocaine Habit Blues]]\" (traditional)\n#\"Beedle Um Bum\" (Booker T.
