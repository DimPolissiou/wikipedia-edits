Related to \"revanchism\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges]]\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine); and the \"[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]\", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), L\u00e9on Gambetta (republican) and [[Eug\u00e8ne Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group. After the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism instead became increasingly associated with the far-right.<ref>[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extr\u00eame droite en France'' (1993).</ref>\n\nThe [[Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan: \"[[Workers of the world, unite!]]\", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.\n\nProletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],<ref>Szporluk, Roman.

Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism|first=Fredy|last=Perlman|location=Detroit|publisher=Black & Red|year=1985|isbn=978-0317295580}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient, but by the end of that year in the second edition of the book he argued that the \"[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country\". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043c \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.\n\nEuropean social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.\n\n[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maioism-Third Wolrdism?|publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]].

In 1918, \"ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot\" and \"children were deprived of any religious education outside the home\".<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006), p. 41\u201343.</ref> Today in the [[Western world]] those on the Left usually support [[secularization]] and the [[separation of church and state]].\n\nHowever, ,religious beliefs have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html|title=Does God Want You To Be Rich?|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the 20th century, the [[Liberation theology|theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].\n\nOther left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state and others opposing the prohibition based on personal freedom.\n\n=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===\n{{see also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}\n[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],<ref>James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. \"[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'.\" (page 40).</ref> [[women's suffrage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html|title=For Teachers (Library of Congress)|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> [[civil rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], support for [[abortion]] rights, [[cognitive liberty]], [[LGBT rights]] including legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, and public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.\n\nVarious [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the \"[[New Left]]\". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[Labour movement|union]] activism, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The New Left in the United States is associated with the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements, and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of \"Old Left\".\n\nThe New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed \"The Establishment\" and became known as \"anti-Establishment\". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers but rather concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as \"substitutionism\", which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could \"substitute\" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960)|publisher=Marxists.org|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism|title=Against Substitutionism|publisher=Scribd.com|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by contemporaries.

[[Socialist feminism]], as exemplified by the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Women]]; and [[Marxist feminism]], as with [[Selma James]], saw themselves as a part of the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the Left. [[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]], and in America, with the left wing of mainstream politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).\n\nThe connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], among others.\n\n== Varieties ==\nThe spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term center-left describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms far-left and ultra-left refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].\n\nIn several countries, the terms far-left and radical left have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]] and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the left ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the far-left ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s and [[anarchist]]s).<ref>Cosseron, Serge (ed.).

During the French Revolution, nationalism was a policy of the Republican Left.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-925298-5|edition=2nd|quote=\"An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...\", \"The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world.\"|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoff00doyl}}</ref> The Republican Left advocated [[civic nationalism]]<ref name=\"Knapp\"/> and argued that the nation is a \"daily plebiscite\" formed by the subjective \"will to live together\". Related to \"revanchism\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges]]\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine); and the \"[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]\", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), L\u00e9on Gambetta (republican) and [[Eug\u00e8ne Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group. After the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism instead became increasingly associated with the far-right.<ref>[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extr\u00eame droite en France'' (1993).</ref>\n\nThe [[Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan: \"[[Workers of the world, unite!]]\", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.\n\nProletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],<ref>Szporluk, Roman.

Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism|first=Fredy|last=Perlman|location=Detroit|publisher=Black & Red|year=1985|isbn=978-0317295580}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient, but by the end of that year in the second edition of the book he argued that the \"[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country\". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043c \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.\n\nEuropean social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.\n\n[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maioism-Third Wolrdism?|publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]].

In 1918, \"ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot\" and \"children were deprived of any religious education outside the home\".<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006), p. 41\u201343.</ref> Today in the [[Western world]] those on the Left usually support [[secularization]] and the [[separation of church and state]].\n\nHowever, ,religious beliefs have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html|title=Does God Want You To Be Rich?|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the 20th century, the [[Liberation theology|theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].\n\nOther left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state and others opposing the prohibition based on personal freedom.\n\n=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===\n{{see also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}\n[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],<ref>James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. \"[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'.\" (page 40).</ref> [[women's suffrage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html|title=For Teachers (Library of Congress)|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> [[civil rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], support for [[abortion]] rights, [[cognitive liberty]], [[LGBT rights]] including legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, and public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.\n\nVarious [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the \"[[New Left]]\". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[Labour movement|union]] activism, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The New Left in the United States is associated with the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements, and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of \"Old Left\".\n\nThe New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed \"The Establishment\" and became known as \"anti-Establishment\". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers but rather concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as \"substitutionism\", which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could \"substitute\" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960)|publisher=Marxists.org|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism|title=Against Substitutionism|publisher=Scribd.com|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by contemporaries.

[[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]], and in America, with the left wing of mainstream politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).\n\nThe connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], among others.\n\n== Varieties ==\nThe spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term center-left describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms far-left and ultra-left refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].\n\nIn several countries, the terms far-left and radical left have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]] and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the left ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the far-left ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s and [[anarchist]]s).<ref>Cosseron, Serge (ed.).

A permanent building was constructed in 1924 in Flagler Park along the [[Intracoastal Waterway]].

Prior to 1992, the county had been carried by a Republican every four years since [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]]. Palm Beach County was the center of a nationwide media storm in 2000 when it appeared to have impacted the [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|presidential election]] that year between eventual winner [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]]. A major source of controversy was the butterfly ballot used in Palm Beach County, a confusing ballot design that may have caused many voters to mistakenly vote for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan instead of Al Gore. Buchanan had an unexpectedly strong showing in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucdata.berkeley.edu/pubs/MapBuchanan.PDF|title=Mapping the Buchanon Vote Escarpment|website=ucdata.berkeley.edu|format=PDF|access-date=2013-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614124555/http://ucdata.berkeley.edu/pubs/MapBuchanan.PDF|archive-date=2013-06-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the end, Gore carried the county, but Bush captured the state of Florida by 537 votes after the recount was effectively halted by the Supreme Court of the United States in ''[[Bush v.

In the late 1980s, there were plans to construct two additional expressways in Palm Beach County. One was to be an {{convert|11.5|mi}} toll freeway from Royal Palm Beach to downtown West Palm Beach.

Her mother, Natalia Petrovna Krasnoyarskaya, now [[director]] at [[Bolshoi Theater]], learned classical singing and performed [[Romance (music)|romance]]) and period songs. Her father, Mikha\u00efl Ivanovitch Porochin, was a soloist in the famous \"Ensemble Berezka\". Her grandmother was an opera singer. Poroshina's parents divorced, and her mother remarries actor Dmitri Yurievich Nazarov. He gets along well with his adopted daughter, checks her homework and questions her. She then has little free time. She studied at school n \u00b0 59 (now 1286), specializing in the study of French, and learned to dance within the troupe of the \"Ensemble Berezka\".\n\nAt the end of her studies, Maria enrolled at the [[Moscow Art Theatre School]], which she left after a year to join the [[Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute]].She directs the program \"Expand the circle\", plays in various productions of the classical and contemporary repertoire, notably at the Pokrovka Theater, under the direction of Sergei Artsibachev. Maria is currently part of Sergei Vinogradov's theater troupe, \"THE THEATER\", where she begins by playing the role of \"'Chlo\u00e9' 'in the play by [[Boris Vian]],''[[Froth on the Daydream]]''.\n\nPorochina took her first steps in the cinema by playing small roles in television series. It is thanks to that of ''Tamara'' in the series entitled The Brigade (2002) and to the main role held in the series Always say: Always (2003) that she knows fame. Then her following main roles on the big screen include, in The 4th Wishes (2003), or, among the fantastic team of [[Timur Bekmambetov]], on the set of [[Night Watch (2004 film)|Night Watch]] (2004). In 2005, Poroshina re-assumes the role of the Great Magic Svetlana in the sequel, [[Day Watch (film)|Day Watch]], a film which at the time achieved the most box office entrances.\n\n== Private life ==\nPoroshina's first husband is the actor [[Gosha Kutsenko]]. Their daughter Polina was born from this union in 1996.

Her mother, Natalia Petrovna Krasnoyarskaya, now [[director]] at [[Bolshoi Theater]], learned classical singing and performed [[Romance (music)|romance]]) and period songs. Her father, Mikha\u00efl Ivanovitch Porochin, was a soloist in the famous \"Ensemble Berezka\". Her grandmother was an opera singer. Poroshina's parents divorced, and her mother remarries actor Dmitri Yurievich Nazarov. He gets along well with his adopted daughter, checks her homework and questions her. She then has little free time. She studied at school n \u00b0 59 (now 1286), specializing in the study of French, and learned to dance within the troupe of the \"Ensemble Berezka\".\n\nAt the end of her studies, Maria enrolled at the [[Moscow Art Theatre School]], which she left after a year to join the [[Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute]].She directs the program \"Expand the circle\", plays in various productions of the classical and contemporary repertoire, notably at the Pokrovka Theater, under the direction of Sergei Artsibachev. Maria is currently part of Sergei Vinogradov's theater troupe, \"THE THEATER\", where she begins by playing the role of \"'Chlo\u00e9' 'in the play by [[Boris Vian]],''[[Froth on the Daydream]]''.\n\nPorochina took her first steps in the cinema by playing small roles in television series. It is thanks to that of ''Tamara'' in the series entitled The Brigade (2002) and to the main role held in the series Always say: Always (2003) that she knows fame. Then her following main roles on the big screen include, in The 4th Wishes (2003), or, among the fantastic team of [[Timur Bekmambetov]], on the set of [[Night Watch (2004 film)|Night Watch]] (2004). In 2005, Poroshina re-assumes the role of the Great Magic Svetlana in the sequel, [[Day Watch (film)|Day Watch]], a film which at the time achieved the most box office entrances.\n\n== Private life ==\nPoroshina's first husband is the actor [[Gosha Kutsenko]]. Their daughter Polina was born from this union in 1996. In 2007, Polina appeared in the television series \"On the way to the heart\", and in 2010, with her father, the role of  ''Christine'' in '''La compensation'''.

During the [[Second World War]], British-trained Nigerian troops saw action with the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade]], the [[81st (West Africa) Division|81st]] and the [[82nd (West Africa) Division]]s which fought in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)]] and in the Far East.\n\nThe roots of the ethnic cleavages which started to rip through the army after independence had some of their origins in British recruiting practices, with line infantry and the artillery being raised from the North, but during the expansion of the force during the [[Second World War]] a large proportion of more educated southerners being brought in to take up posts that required more technical training. Like in [[Ghana Army|Ghana]], there was significant pressure to \"Nigerianize\" the armed forces, with, for example, two officers being promoted to Brigadier as a concession to public opinion on the occasion of the last British commander arriving in Lagos. From a force of 8,000 in five infantry battalions and supporting units,<ref>Gutteridge, Military in African Politics, 1969, 97.</ref> strength rose to around 120,000 in three divisions by the end of the [[Nigerian Civil War]] in 1970.<ref>Scott report, ''Sunday Telegraph'', 11 January 1970, via N.J. Miners, ''The Nigerian Army 1956-65'', Methuen and Co. Ltd, London, 1971, p. 229</ref> In terms of doctrine, the task of the Federal Nigerian army did not fundamentally change: its task remained to close with and defeat an organized enemy.\n\nThe rapid expansion saw a severe decline in troop quality.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/the-nigerian-military-is-so-broken-its-soldiers-are-refusing-to-fight/2015/05/06/d56fabac-dcae-11e4-b6d7-b9bc8acf16f7_story.html</ref> The Nigerian expansion process led to an extreme shortage of commissioned officers, with newly created lieutenant-colonels commanding brigades, and platoons and companies often commanded by sergeants and warrant officers. This resulted in tentative [[command and control|command-and-control]] and in rudimentary staff work.<ref>Neville Brown, \"The Nigerian Civil War,\" Military Review, vol. 48, October 1968, p. 28, cited in Major Michael Stafford, Quick Kill in Slow Motion, Marine Corps CSC, 1984, at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/SMR.htm</ref> One result of the weak direction was that the Federals' three divisions fought independently, and competed for men and material. Writing in a 1984 study, Major Michael Stafford of the US Marine Corps noted that \"Inexperienced, poorly trained and ineptly led soldiers manifested their lack of professionalism and indiscipline by massacres of innocent civilians and a failure to effectively execute infantry tactics.\"<ref>Stafford study, 1984</ref> Among the results was the 1967 [[Asaba massacre]].\n\nThe influence of individual personalities is generally greater in the armies of developing states, as they tend to have weaker institutional frameworks. Key personalities involved in Nigeria included then-Colonel [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]. Obasanjo is particularly important due to his efforts to reorganize his command, [[3rd Division (Nigeria)|3 Division]], during the civil war to improve its logistics and administration. The reorganization he instituted made the Division capable of carrying out the offensive that ended the civil war.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded in November 1970 that \"..The [[Nigerian Civil War]] ended with relatively little rancor. The Igbos are accepted as fellow citizens in many parts of Nigeria, but not in some areas of former [[Biafra]] where they were once dominant. Igboland is an overpopulated, economically depressed area where massive unemployment is likely to continue for many years.<ref name=NIE64-2-70>{{citation|title=National Intelligence Estimate 64.2-70: Prospects for Postwar Nigeria |author=Central Intelligence Agency |url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/53862.pdf |date=2 November 1970 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090809041637/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/53862.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2009 }}</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\nThe U.S. analysts said that \"..Nigeria is still very much a tribal society...\" where local and tribal alliances count more than \"national attachment. General [[Yakubu Gowon]], head of the Federal Military Government (FMG) is the accepted national leader and his popularity has grown since the end of the war. The FMG is neither very efficient nor dynamic, but the recent announcement that it intends to retain power for six more years has generated little opposition so far. The Nigerian Army, vastly expanded during the war, is both the main support to the FMG and the chief threat to it. The troops are poorly trained and disciplined and some of the officers are turning to conspiracies and plotting. We think Gowon will have great difficulty in staying in office through the period which he said is necessary before the turnover of power to civilians. His sudden removal would dim the prospects for Nigerian stability.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Army fought the Civil War significantly under-resourced; Obasanjo's memoirs chronicle the lack of any stocks of extra equipment for mobilisation and the \"haphazard and unreliable system of procurement and provisioning\" which lasted for the entire period of the war.<ref>Olusegun Obasanjo, ''My Command: An Account of the Nigerian Civil War'', Heinemann, Ibadan/London/Nairobi, 1980, p. 61</ref> Arms embargoes imposed by several Western countries made the situation more difficult.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, the three divisions of the Army were reorganised into four divisions, with each controlling territories running from North to South in order to deemphasise the former regional structure. Each division thus had access to the sea thereby making triservice cooperation and logistic support easier. This deployment formula was later abandoned in favour of the present assignment of sectors to the divisions. Thus 1 Division with HQ at Kaduna is allocated the North West sector; 2 Division with HQ at Ibadan South West sector, 3 Division with HQ at Jos North East sector and 82 Division with HQ at Enugu South East sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://logbaby.com/directory/nigerian-army_6193.html|title=Nigerian Army Logbaby|website=logbaby.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIts formations include the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1 Division]], headquartered in [[Kaduna]] in the north-west, and [[2 Division (Nigeria)|2 Division]] (HQ [[Ibadan]] in the South-West, which includes 32 Artillery Brigade at [[Abeokuta]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2004/04/20/20040420spo06.html|title=Home|website=Thisdayonline.com|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115213808/http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2004/04/20/20040420spo06.html|archive-date=15 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 2nd Division also possibly includes 4 Brigade at [[Benin City]], with 19 Battalion at [[Okitipupa]] and 195 Battalion at [[Agenebode]]. 52 Signal Regiment may be the divisional signals unit.

During the [[Second World War]], British-trained Nigerian troops saw action with the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade]], the [[81st (West Africa) Division|81st]] and the [[82nd (West Africa) Division]]s which fought in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)]] and in the Far East.\n\nThe roots of the ethnic cleavages which started to rip through the army after independence had some of their origins in British recruiting practices, with line infantry and the artillery being raised from the North, but during the expansion of the force during the [[Second World War]] a large proportion of more educated southerners being brought in to take up posts that required more technical training. Like in [[Ghana Army|Ghana]], there was significant pressure to \"Nigerianize\" the armed forces, with, for example, two officers being promoted to Brigadier as a concession to public opinion on the occasion of the last British commander arriving in Lagos. From a force of 8,000 in five infantry battalions and supporting units,<ref>Gutteridge, Military in African Politics, 1969, 97.</ref> strength rose to around 120,000 in three divisions by the end of the [[Nigerian Civil War]] in 1970.<ref>Scott report, ''Sunday Telegraph'', 11 January 1970, via N.J. Miners, ''The Nigerian Army 1956-65'', Methuen and Co. Ltd, London, 1971, p. 229</ref> In terms of doctrine, the task of the Federal Nigerian army did not fundamentally change: its task remained to close with and defeat an organized enemy.\n\nThe rapid expansion saw a severe decline in troop quality.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/the-nigerian-military-is-so-broken-its-soldiers-are-refusing-to-fight/2015/05/06/d56fabac-dcae-11e4-b6d7-b9bc8acf16f7_story.html</ref> The Nigerian expansion process led to an extreme shortage of commissioned officers, with newly created lieutenant-colonels commanding brigades, and platoons and companies often commanded by sergeants and warrant officers. This resulted in tentative [[command and control|command-and-control]] and in rudimentary staff work.<ref>Neville Brown, \"The Nigerian Civil War,\" Military Review, vol. 48, October 1968, p. 28, cited in Major Michael Stafford, Quick Kill in Slow Motion, Marine Corps CSC, 1984, at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/SMR.htm</ref> One result of the weak direction was that the Federals' three divisions fought independently, and competed for men and material. Writing in a 1984 study, Major Michael Stafford of the US Marine Corps noted that \"Inexperienced, poorly trained and ineptly led soldiers manifested their lack of professionalism and indiscipline by massacres of innocent civilians and a failure to effectively execute infantry tactics.\"<ref>Stafford study, 1984</ref> Among the results was the 1967 [[Asaba massacre]].\n\nThe influence of individual personalities is generally greater in the armies of developing states, as they tend to have weaker institutional frameworks. Key personalities involved in Nigeria included then-Colonel [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]. Obasanjo is particularly important due to his efforts to reorganize his command, [[3rd Division (Nigeria)|3 Division]], during the civil war to improve its logistics and administration. The reorganization he instituted made the Division capable of carrying out the offensive that ended the civil war.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded in November 1970 that \"..The [[Nigerian Civil War]] ended with relatively little rancor. The Igbos are accepted as fellow citizens in many parts of Nigeria, but not in some areas of former [[Biafra]] where they were once dominant. Igboland is an overpopulated, economically depressed area where massive unemployment is likely to continue for many years.<ref name=NIE64-2-70>{{citation|title=National Intelligence Estimate 64.2-70: Prospects for Postwar Nigeria |author=Central Intelligence Agency |url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/53862.pdf |date=2 November 1970 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090809041637/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/53862.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2009 }}</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\nThe U.S. analysts said that \"..Nigeria is still very much a tribal society...\" where local and tribal alliances count more than \"national attachment. General [[Yakubu Gowon]], head of the Federal Military Government (FMG) is the accepted national leader and his popularity has grown since the end of the war. The FMG is neither very efficient nor dynamic, but the recent announcement that it intends to retain power for six more years has generated little opposition so far. The Nigerian Army, vastly expanded during the war, is both the main support to the FMG and the chief threat to it. The troops are poorly trained and disciplined and some of the officers are turning to conspiracies and plotting. We think Gowon will have great difficulty in staying in office through the period which he said is necessary before the turnover of power to civilians. His sudden removal would dim the prospects for Nigerian stability.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Army fought the Civil War significantly under-resourced; Obasanjo's memoirs chronicle the lack of any stocks of extra equipment for mobilisation and the \"haphazard and unreliable system of procurement and provisioning\" which lasted for the entire period of the war.<ref>Olusegun Obasanjo, ''My Command: An Account of the Nigerian Civil War'', Heinemann, Ibadan/London/Nairobi, 1980, p. 61</ref> Arms embargoes imposed by several Western countries made the situation more difficult.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, the three divisions of the Army were reorganised into four divisions, with each controlling territories running from North to South in order to deemphasise the former regional structure. Each division thus had access to the sea thereby making triservice cooperation and logistic support easier. This deployment formula was later abandoned in favour of the present assignment of sectors to the divisions. Thus 1 Division with HQ at Kaduna is allocated the North West sector; 2 Division with HQ at Ibadan South West sector, 3 Division with HQ at Jos North East sector and 82 Division with HQ at Enugu South East sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://logbaby.com/directory/nigerian-army_6193.html|title=Nigerian Army Logbaby|website=logbaby.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIts formations include the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1 Division]], headquartered in [[Kaduna]] in the north-west, and [[2 Division (Nigeria)|2 Division]] (HQ [[Ibadan]] in the South-West, which includes 32 Artillery Brigade at [[Abeokuta]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2004/04/20/20040420spo06.html|title=Home|website=Thisdayonline.com|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115213808/http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2004/04/20/20040420spo06.html|archive-date=15 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 2nd Division also possibly includes 4 Brigade at [[Benin City]], with 19 Battalion at [[Okitipupa]] and 195 Battalion at [[Agenebode]]. 52 Signal Regiment may be the divisional signals unit.
