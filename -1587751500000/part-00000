In addition, it was the third-most intense [[Atlantic hurricane]] to make [[landfall]] in the contiguous United States in terms of [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]], behind the [[1935 Labor Day hurricane]] and [[Hurricane Camille]] in [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]]. It was the first Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on record to impact the [[Florida Panhandle]], the fourth-strongest landfalling hurricane in the contiguous United States, in terms of wind speed, and was the most intense hurricane on [[Atlantic hurricane records|record]] to strike the United States in the month of October.\n\nThe thirteenth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], seventh [[hurricane]], and second [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale|major hurricane]] of the [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season]], Michael originated from a broad [[low-pressure area]] that formed in the southwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] on October 1. The disturbance became a tropical depression on October 7, after nearly a week of slow development. By the next day, Michael had intensified into a hurricane near the [[Guanahacabibes Peninsula|western tip]] of [[Cuba]], as it moved northward. The hurricane rapidly intensified in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], reaching major hurricane status on October 9. As it approached the Florida Panhandle, Michael reached Category&nbsp;5 status with [[maximum sustained wind|peak winds]] of 160 mph (260 km/h)<ref name=\"MichaelTCR\">{{cite web| author=John L.

Michael subsequently strengthened into a powerful extratropical cyclone and eventually impacted the [[Iberian Peninsula]], before dissipating on October 16.\n\nAt least 74 deaths were attributed to the storm, including 59 in the United States and 15 in [[Central America]].

Valtteri Bottas started his slow run towards what would become a second place, overtaking both [[McLaren Honda]] driver [[Stoffel Vandoorne]] and [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] in a [[Force India]], who started from eight and sixth respectively. \nA crash of the Toro Rosso drivers [[Carlos Sainz Jr.]] and [[Daniil Kvyat]], caused by Kvyat, brought out the [[safety car]] on lap 2, with Sainz retiring while Kvyat continued but finished the race only fifteenth after receiving a drive-through penalty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daniil Kvyat in trouble again, facing suspension after British GP fiasco|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/motorsport/formula-one/daniil-kvyat-in-trouble-again-faces-suspension-after-british-gp-fiasco/news-story/9afc683c2239da45845b0ac1ae86101b|website=News.com.au|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the restart, once again Hamilton pulled away and, in the following laps, opened a gap towards second placed Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen which allowed him to cruise to victory. Meanwhile, Bottas continued his charge and got up to fifth place before lap 7, overtaking [[Esteban Ocon]] and [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]].\nVettel, after the restart, was stuck behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and the two banged wheels as Vettel tried to overtake. Verstappen stayed in third but Vettel eventually got out in front of him after he pitted on lap 18, one lap earlier than Verstappen.\n\nBottas, who was the only one of the top ten who started on the slower but more durable soft tyres instead of the supersofts, stayed out until lap 32 and then pitted for supersofts. As he set fastest lap he soon caught up to Vettel and overtook him on lap 44, moving up into third.\nMeanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo, who started from 19th on the grid, also moved up, overtaking, among others, [[Fernando Alonso]], Sergio P\u00e9rez and [[Kevin Magnussen]]. He eventually finished fifth.\n\nIn the final laps, both Ferraris suffered punctures. On lap 49 Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen suffered a puncture on his left front tyre. With a relatively short distance to the pits, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen only lost second place to Bottas and still managed to finish third. Vettel's puncture came on lap 51 with almost the entire lap remaining to return to the pits with a blown tire. Losing a significant amount of time, the blow out dropped him down to seventh place.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 British Grand Prix Race Highlights|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0WHNqwDjXc|publisher=Formula 1|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the race, [[Lewis Hamilton|Hamilton]] narrowed the gap to [[Sebastian Vettel|Vettel]] in the Drivers' Championship to just one point, while [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] expanded their lead in the Constructors' Championship to 55 points over [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].\n\nThe result marked Hamilton's fifth career [[Grand Slam (Formula One)|grand slam]]. Additionally, Hamilton equalled the record for most [[British Grand Prix]] wins held jointly by [[Alain Prost]] and [[Jim Clark]].\n\n==Classification==\n===Qualifying===\n{|class=wikitable

1 Rolex British Grand Prix''') was a [[Formula One racing|Formula One motor race]] that took place on 16 July 2017 at the [[Silverstone Circuit]] in [[Silverstone]], [[United Kingdom]]. This race was the seventy-second running of the [[British Grand Prix]], the sixty-eighth time that the race has been run as a World Championship event, and the fifty-first time that the World Championship event has been held at the Silverstone Circuit. \n\n[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Sebastian Vettel]] entered the round with a twenty-point lead over [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]]'s [[Lewis Hamilton]] in the Drivers' Championship. Mercedes led Ferrari by thirty-three points in the Constructors' Championship.\n\nThe race was dominantly won by Lewis Hamilton, who achieved a [[Grand Slam (Formula One)|grand slam]], starting from pole position, leading every lap of the race, setting fastest lap, and finally winning with a 14-second lead over Mercedes teammate [[Valtteri Bottas]]. \n\nWith his fifth British Grand Prix win he equalled the records of [[Alain Prost]] and [[Jim Clark]], who won the race five times each. In contrast, his championship rival Sebastian Vettel suffered a tyre failure with two laps to go, subsequently only finishing seventh. As a result, his lead over Hamilton in the Drivers' standings was cut down to one point.

[[Daniel Ricciardo]]'s [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] experienced a turbo failure, ending his qualifying run. [[Fernando Alonso]] opted to change to supersofts during the final minutes of Q1 as the track dried. He subsequently set the fastest time of the session, a 1:37.598.\n\nIn Q3, Lewis Hamilton secured pole position with a 1:26.600, 0.547 seconds quicker than Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in second, and 0.756 seconds quicker than Vettel in third. [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]] gave [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] team its best qualifying result since its return to F1 in 2016, with fifth. Hamilton's pole equalled Jim Clark's record for most poles at the British Grand Prix. Valtteri Bottas set the fourth fastest time during Q3 but started from ninth position after being set back five places as a result of an unauthorised gearbox change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bottas braced for Silverstone gearbox penalty|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/7/bottas-braced-for-silverstone-gearbox-penalty-.html|publisher=Formula 1|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref> Subsequently, [[Max Verstappen]] started fourth.\n\n=== Race ===\nIn the formation lap Jolyon Palmer suffered a hydraulic failure and retired from the race. Another formation lap was held and thus the grand prix was shortened to 51 laps instead of the scheduled 52 laps.\n\nAt the start, Hamilton easily pulled away opening a 1.6 seconds gap to R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen after just one lap. Sebastian Vettel, starting from third, was overtaken by Max Verstappen. Valtteri Bottas started his slow run towards what would become a second place, overtaking both [[McLaren Honda]] driver [[Stoffel Vandoorne]] and [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] in a [[Force India]], who started from eight and sixth respectively. \nA crash of the Toro Rosso drivers [[Carlos Sainz Jr.]] and [[Daniil Kvyat]], caused by Kvyat, brought out the [[safety car]] on lap 2, with Sainz retiring while Kvyat continued but finished the race only fifteenth after receiving a drive-through penalty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daniil Kvyat in trouble again, facing suspension after British GP fiasco|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/motorsport/formula-one/daniil-kvyat-in-trouble-again-faces-suspension-after-british-gp-fiasco/news-story/9afc683c2239da45845b0ac1ae86101b|website=News.com.au|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the restart, once again Hamilton pulled away and, in the following laps, opened a gap towards second placed Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen which allowed him to cruise to victory. Meanwhile, Bottas continued his charge and got up to fifth place before lap 7, overtaking [[Esteban Ocon]] and [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]].\nVettel, after the restart, was stuck behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and the two banged wheels as Vettel tried to overtake. Verstappen stayed in third but Vettel eventually got out in front of him after he pitted on lap 18, one lap earlier than Verstappen.\n\nBottas, who was the only one of the top ten who started on the slower but more durable soft tyres instead of the supersofts, stayed out until lap 32 and then pitted for supersofts. As he set fastest lap he soon caught up to Vettel and overtook him on lap 44, moving up into third.\nMeanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo, who started from 19th on the grid, also moved up, overtaking, among others, [[Fernando Alonso]], Sergio P\u00e9rez and [[Kevin Magnussen]]. He eventually finished fifth.\n\nIn the final laps, both Ferraris suffered punctures. On lap 49 Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen suffered a puncture on his left front tyre. With a relatively short distance to the pits, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen only lost second place to Bottas and still managed to finish third. Vettel's puncture came on lap 51 with almost the entire lap remaining to return to the pits with a blown tire. Losing a significant amount of time, the blow out dropped him down to seventh place.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 British Grand Prix Race Highlights|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0WHNqwDjXc|publisher=Formula 1|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the race, [[Lewis Hamilton|Hamilton]] narrowed the gap to [[Sebastian Vettel|Vettel]] in the Drivers' Championship to just one point, while [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] expanded their lead in the Constructors' Championship to 55 points over [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].\n\nThe result marked Hamilton's fifth career [[Grand Slam (Formula One)|grand slam]]. Additionally, Hamilton equalled the record for most [[British Grand Prix]] wins held jointly by [[Alain Prost]] and [[Jim Clark]].\n\n==Classification==\n===Qualifying===\n{|class=wikitable

{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Fry1989", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:New Zealand road sign R1-8.1 (80) (obsolete) + R1-8.1 (obsolete).svg\u2192File:New Zealand road sign R1-8.1 (80) + R1-8.1 (1987\u20132016).svgEdit file name to add years of use.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_New_Zealand"}

All packages are also compiled with stack-smashing protection to help mitigate the effects of userland [[buffer overflow]]s.\n* Alpine Linux, by default, includes patches that allow using efficient meshed VPNs using the [[DMVPN]] standard.\n* Alpine Linux has reliably had excellent support of Xen hypervisors in up-to-date versions, which avoids issues as experienced with Enterprise Distributions. (The standard Linux hypervisor KVM, is also available.)\n* Alpine Linux allows very small [[Linux containers]], around 8 MB in size, while a minimal installation to disk might be around 130 MB.<ref>{{cite web|title=About |url=https://alpinelinux.org/about/}}</ref> \n* Alpine Configuration Framework (ACF): While optional, ACF is an application for configuring an Alpine Linux machine, with goals similar to [[Debian|Debian's]] [[Debconf (software package)|debconf]]. It is a standard framework based on simple Lua scripts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alpine Configuration Framework |url=https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Configuration_Framework_Design}}</ref>\n* Alpine Linux previously used [[uClibc]] as its [[C standard library]] instead of the traditional [[GNU C Library]] (glibc) most commonly used. Although it is more lightweight, it does have the significant drawback of being [[Binary code compatibility|binary incompatible]] with glibc. Thus, all software must be compiled for use with uClibc to work properly. As of April 9, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|title=Release notes|url=https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.0.0-released.html|website=alpinelinux.org|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> Alpine Linux switched to [[musl]], which is partially binary compatible with glibc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musl-libc.org/faq.html|title=musl FAQ|publisher=}}</ref>\n* The lightweight [[OpenRC]] is the [[init system]] currently used by Alpine Linux.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_Init_System|title=Alpine Linux Init System|publisher=}}</ref> Unlike many distributions, including [[Debian]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[RHEL]], [[Arch Linux]] and [[CentOS]], Alpine does not use [[systemd]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"infoworld\">[https://www.infoworld.com/article/3206644/linux/review-alpine-linux-is-made-for-docker.html Review: Alpine Linux is made for Docker | InfoWorld]</ref>\n<ref name=\"linuxbsdos\">[http://linuxbsdos.com/2010/08/23/alpine-linux-2-review/ Alpine Linux 2 review | LinuxBSDos.com]</ref>\n<ref name=\"softpedia\">[https://news.softpedia.com/news/security-oriented-alpine-linux-3-7-has-uefi-support-grub-support-in-installer-518820.shtml Security-Oriented Alpine Linux 3.7 Has UEFI Support, GRUB Support in Installer], '''Softpedia News'''</ref>\n<ref name=\"fossbytes\">[https://fossbytes.com/secure-linux-distros-privacy-anonymity/ 10 Most Secure Linux Distros For Complete Privacy & Anonymity | 2017 Edition], '''FossBytes'''</ref>\n<ref name=\"networkworld\">[https://www.networkworld.com/article/3031762/is-docker-ditching-ubuntu-linux-confusion-reigns.html Is Docker ditching Ubuntu Linux?

In 1972, KANUPP was inaugurated by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]; KANUPP was successfully commissioned marking Pakistan's entry in the nuclear age as the second developing \u2013 and the only Muslim \u2013 country to draw energy from the heart of the [[atom]].\n\nDr. Usmani peacefully died in [[Karachi]] on 17 June 1992, and the occasion brought tears to the eyes of many scientists and reformers who regarded him with affection. In May 1998, the [[Government of Pakistan]] belatedly recognised Usmani's vital services by awarding the [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|Pakistan's highest civilian award]], [[Nishan-i-Imtiaz]] posthumously by the prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] when Pakistan conducted its [[Chagai-I|first successful nuclear tests]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Cite web\n |author=R.

In May 1998, the [[Government of Pakistan]] belatedly recognised Usmani's vital services by awarding the [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|Pakistan's highest civilian award]], [[Nishan-i-Imtiaz]] posthumously by the prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] when Pakistan conducted its [[Chagai-I|first successful nuclear tests]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Cite web\n |author=R.
