A close friend and associate of [[Sheriff|lawman]] [[Wyatt Earp]], Holliday is best known for his role in the events leading up to and following the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]. He developed a reputation as having killed more than a dozen men in various altercations, but modern researchers have concluded that, contrary to popular myth-making, Holliday killed only one to three men. Holliday's colorful life and character have been depicted in many books and portrayed by well-known actors in numerous movies and television series.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|415}}\n\nAt age 21, Holliday earned a [[Dental degree|degree in dentistry]] from the [[Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery]]. He set up practice in Griffin, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15, having acquired it while tending to her needs while she was still in the contagious phase of the illness. Hoping the climate in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] would ease his symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona in that day.<ref>{{cite web| title=Gambling in the Old West| url=http://www.historynet.com/gambling-in-the-old-west.htm| website=History Net| publisher=Wild West Magazine| accessdate=April 13, 2015| date=June 12, 2006| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424035923/http://www.historynet.com/gambling-in-the-old-west.htm| archivedate=April 24, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations.

In Tombstone, local members of the outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys]] repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a [[Stagecoach|stage]]. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal [[Virgil Earp]]. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys near the O.K. Corral on the west side of town, which resulted in the 30-second shootout.\n\nFollowing the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants while [[Morgan Earp]] was murdered. Unable to obtain justice in the courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the recently appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they [[Earp Vendetta Ride|pursued]] the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found [[Frank Stilwell]] [[lying in wait]] as Virgil boarded a train for California and killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of five members of the federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April 1882, before they rode to the [[New Mexico Territory]]. Wyatt Earp learned of an extradition request for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor [[Frederick Walker Pitkin]] to deny Holliday's extradition. Holliday spent the few remaining years of his life in Colorado, and died of tuberculosis in his bed at the Hotel Glenwood at age 36.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web |last1=[[The Associated Press]] |title=A New Tombstone Sets the Record Straight for Doc Holliday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/us/a-new-tombstone-sets-the-record-straight-for-doc-holliday.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=NYT |accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\n[[File:DocHollidayCloseUp.jpg|left|thumb|Holliday's graduation photo in March 1872 from the Pennsylvania School of Dentistry.]]\n\nHolliday was born in [[Griffin, Georgia]], to Henry Burroughs Holliday and Alice Jane (McKey) Holliday.<ref name=\"genealogy2\">{{cite web| url=http://www.kansasheritage.org/families/holliday.html| title=John Henry Holliday Family History| publisher=Kansas Heritage Group| accessdate=March 30, 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514215437/http://www.kansasheritage.org/families/holliday.html| archivedate=May 14, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref> He was of [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry.<ref name=tanner/>{{rp| 236}} His father served in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (as a Confederate).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/soldiers.cfm|title=Civil War Soldiers and Sailors| publisher= The National Park Service|accessdate=January 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814171239/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/soldiers.cfm|archivedate=August 14, 2008 }}</ref> When the Mexican\u2013American War ended, Henry brought home an adopted son named Francisco.

When he left Kansas, he went to [[Breckenridge, Texas]], where he gambled. On July 4, 1877, he had a disagreement with gambler Henry Kahn, and Holliday beat him repeatedly with his walking stick.

He received reports that cowboys with whom they had had repeated confrontations were armed in violation of the [[Cochise County Cowboys#Weapon ordinance|city ordinance]] that required them to deposit their weapons at a saloon or stable soon after arriving in town. The cowboys had repeatedly threatened the Earps and Holliday.  Fearing trouble, Virgil temporarily deputized Holliday and sought backup from his brothers Wyatt and Morgan.

Cowboys witnesses testified that Holliday first pulled out a nickel-plated pistol he was known to carry, while others reported he first fired a longer, bronze-colored gun, possibly the coach gun.

Following that, [[Morgan Earp]] was ambushed and killed in March 1882. Several Cowboys were identified by witnesses as suspects in the shooting of [[Virgil Earp]] on December 27, 1881, and the assassination of Morgan Earp on March 19, 1882.

When Wyatt Earp learned of the charges, he feared his friend Holliday would not receive a fair trial in Arizona.

Since Holliday died in November, the ground may have been frozen. Some modern authors such as Bob Boze Bell<ref>{{cite book | last1=Bell| first1=Bob Boze| title=The Illustrated Life and Times of Doc Holliday| date=1995| publisher=Tri Star-Boze Publications| location=Phoenix, Arizona| isbn=1-887576-00-2| edition=Second}}</ref> speculate that it would have been impossible to transport him to the cemetery, which was only accessible by a difficult mountain road, or to dig a grave because the ground was frozen.

Contemporary newspaper reports explicitly state that Holliday was buried in the Linwood Cemetery, but the exact location of his grave is uncertain.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n== Public reputation ==\n\nHolliday maintained a fierce persona as was sometimes needed for a gambler to earn respect. He had a contemporary reputation as a skilled gunfighter which modern historians generally regard as accurate.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|410}} Tombstone resident [[George W. Parsons]] wrote that Holliday confronted [[Johnny Ringo]] in January 1882, telling him, \"All I want of you is ten paces out in the street.\" Ringo and he were prevented from a gunfight by the Tombstone police, who arrested both. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Holliday initially carried a shotgun and shot at and may have killed Tom McLaury. Holliday was grazed by a bullet fired by Frank McLaury, and shot back. After [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] was maimed in a January ambush, Holliday was part of a federal posse led by Deputy U.S. Marshal Earp who guarded him on his way to the railroad in Tucson. There they found Frank Stilwell apparently waiting for the Earps in the rail yard. A warrant for Holliday's arrest was issued after Stilwell was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds. Holliday was part of Earp's federal posse when they killed three other outlaw Cowboys during the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]]. Holliday reported that he had been arrested 17 times, four attempts had been made to hang him, and that he survived ambush five times.<ref name=Natural>{{cite web |url=http://thenaturalamerican.com/holliday.htm |title=The Natural American: Doc Holliday |quote=based on information found in ''The Chronicles of Tombstone'' by Ben Traywick |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021201753/http://thenaturalamerican.com/holliday.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2014  |access-date=October 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Character ===\nThroughout his lifetime, Holliday was known by many of his peers as a tempered, calm, Southern gentleman.

However, he showed great skill in gambling and gunfights. His tuberculosis did not hamper his ability as a gambler and as a marksman.

The only men he is known to have killed are Mike Gordon in 1879; probably Frank Mclaury and Tom McLaury in Tombstone; and possibly Frank Stilwell in Tucson.

Only one arrest was for murder, which occurred in an 1879 shootout with Mike Gordon in New Mexico, for which he was acquitted. In the preliminary hearing following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated Holliday's actions as those of a duly appointed lawman. In Denver, the Arizona warrant against Holliday for Frank Stilwell's murder went unserved when the governor was persuaded by Trinidad Chief of Police Bat Masterson to release Holliday to his custody for bunco charges.<ref name=\"holliday2001\">{{cite book | last=Holliday| first=Karen Tanner| title=Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait| year=2001| publisher=University of Oklahoma Press| location=Norman| isbn=978-0-8061-3320-1}}</ref>\n\nAmong his other arrests, Holliday pleaded guilty to two gambling charges, one charge of carrying a deadly weapon in the city (in connection with the argument with Ringo), and one misdemeanor assault and battery charge (for his shooting of Joyce and Parker). The others were all dismissed or returned as \"not guilty.\"<ref name=\"holliday2001\"/>\n\n=== Alleged murder of Ed Bailey ===\n\nWyatt Earp recounted one event during which Holliday killed a fellow gambler named Ed Bailey. Earp and his common-law wife [[Mattie Blaylock]] were in [[Fort Griffin, Texas]], during the winter of 1878, looking for gambling opportunities. Earp visited the saloon of his old friend from Cheyenne, John Shannsey, and met Holliday at the Cattle Exchange.<ref name=lee>{{cite web | last=Paul| first=Lee| title=John Henry Holliday| url=http://www.theoutlaws.com/outlaws1.htm| accessdate=October 29, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216201643/http://www.theoutlaws.com/outlaws1.htm|archivedate=February 16, 2008}}</ref> The story of Holliday killing Bailey first appeared nine years after Holliday's death in an 1896 interview with Wyatt Earp that was published in the ''San Francisco Enquirer''.<ref name=wilcox>{{cite web| last1=Wilcox| first1=Victoria| title=Doc Holliday and the Ghost of Ed Bailey {{!}}| url=http://victoriawilcoxbooks.com/doc-holliday-history/doc-holliday-and-the-ghost-of-ed-bailey/| website=victoriawilcoxbooks.com| accessdate=November 1, 2016| date=August 11, 2015| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103234127/http://victoriawilcoxbooks.com/doc-holliday-history/doc-holliday-and-the-ghost-of-ed-bailey/| archivedate=November 3, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to Earp, Holliday was playing poker with a well-liked local man named Ed Bailey. Holliday caught Bailey \"monkeying with the dead wood\" or the discard pile, which was against the rules. According to Earp, Holliday reminded Bailey to \"play poker\", which was a polite way to caution him to stop cheating. When Bailey made the same move again, Holliday took the pot without showing his hand, which was his right under the rules. Bailey immediately went for his pistol, but Holliday whipped out a knife from his breast pocket and \"caught Bailey just below the brisket\" or upper chest. Bailey died and Holliday, new to town, was detained in his room at the Planter's Hotel.<ref name=holliday2001/>{{rp|115}}\n\nIn [[Stuart N. Lake|Stuart Lake]]'s best-selling biography, ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'' (1931), Earp added to the story. He is quoted as saying that Holliday's girlfriend, \"Big Nose Kate\" Horony, devised a diversion. She procured a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol.<ref name=lee/> However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey's death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed \"a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room.\" She laughed at the idea of \"a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw up his hands, disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies.\"<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|87}}\n\nAuthor and Earp expert Ben Traywick doubts that Holliday killed Bailey. He could find no newspaper articles or court records to support the story. He found evidence to support that Holliday was being held in his hotel room under guard, but for \"illegal gambling\", and that the story of Horony starting a fire as a diversion to free him was true. The story about Bailey as told in  ''San Francisco Enquirer'' interview of Earp was likely fabricated by the writer. Years later, Earp wrote:\n\n{{quote|Of all the nonsensical guff which has been written around my life, there has been none more inaccurate or farfetched than that which has dealt with Doc Holliday.  After Holliday died, I gave a San Francisco newspaper reporter a short sketch of his life.  Apparently the reporter was not satisfied.  The sketch appeared in print with a lot of things added that never existed outside the reporter's imagination ...<ref name=wilcox/>}}\n\n== Photos of Holliday ==\n\nThree photos of unknown provenance are often reported to be of Holliday, some of them supposedly taken by [[C.S. Fly]] in Tombstone, but sometimes reported to have been taken in Dallas. Holliday lived in a rooming house in front of Fly's photography studio. Many persons share similar facial features, and the faces of people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers, and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.<ref name=rowe>{{cite web |url=http://maineantiquedigest.com/articles_archive/articles/oct02/josi1002.htm |first=Jeremy |last=Rowe |year=2002 |title=Thoughts on Kaloma, the Purported Photograph of Josie Earp |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320071207/http://maineantiquedigest.com/articles_archive/articles/oct02/josi1002.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2012  }}</ref>\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:DocHollidayCloseUp.jpg|Cropped from a larger version, Holliday's graduation photo from the Pennsylvania School of Dental Surgery in March 1872, age 20, known [[provenance]] and authenticated as Holliday\nImage:Doc Holliday in Prescott AZ (closeup).jpg|Cropped from a larger version, Holliday in Prescott, Arizona in 1879, age 27, known [[provenance]] and authenticated as Holliday\nImage:DocHolliday.jpg|Uncreased print of supposed 1882 Tombstone photo of Holliday, left side is upturned, detachable shirt collar toward camera, no cowlick, unknown provenance\nImage:HollidayLcollar.jpg|Creased and darker version of photo at left, unknown provenance\nImage:Doc Holliday.jpg|Person most often reported to be Holliday with a [[cowlick]] and folded-down collar, heavily retouched, oval, inscribed portrait, unknown provenance\nImage:HollidayandBowler.jpg|Person with a [[bowler hat]] and open vest and coat, unknown provenance\n</gallery>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n[[File:Wyatt and Doc.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Life-sized statues of lawman Wyatt Earp and deputy Doc Holliday at the [[Tucson (Amtrak station)|Historic Railroad Depot]]]]\nDoc Holliday is one of the most recognizable figures in the American Old West, but he is most remembered for his friendship with Wyatt Earp and his role in the Gunfight at the O.K.

A close friend and associate of [[Sheriff|lawman]] [[Wyatt Earp]], Holliday is best known for his role in the events leading up to and following the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]. He developed a reputation as having killed more than a dozen men in various altercations, but modern researchers have concluded that, contrary to popular myth-making, Holliday killed only one to three men. Holliday's colorful life and character have been depicted in many books and portrayed by well-known actors in numerous movies and television series.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|415}}\n\nAt age 21, Holliday earned a [[Dental degree|degree in dentistry]] from the [[Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery]]. He set up practice in Griffin, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15, having acquired it while tending to her needs while she was still in the contagious phase of the illness. Hoping the climate in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] would ease his symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona in that day.<ref>{{cite web| title=Gambling in the Old West| url=http://www.historynet.com/gambling-in-the-old-west.htm| website=History Net| publisher=Wild West Magazine| accessdate=April 13, 2015| date=June 12, 2006| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424035923/http://www.historynet.com/gambling-in-the-old-west.htm| archivedate=April 24, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations.

In Tombstone, local members of the outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys]] repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a [[Stagecoach|stage]]. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal [[Virgil Earp]]. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys near the O.K. Corral on the west side of town, which resulted in the 30-second shootout.\n\nFollowing the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants while [[Morgan Earp]] was murdered. Unable to obtain justice in the courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the recently appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they [[Earp Vendetta Ride|pursued]] the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found [[Frank Stilwell]] [[lying in wait]] as Virgil boarded a train for California and killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of five members of the federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April 1882, before they rode to the [[New Mexico Territory]]. Wyatt Earp learned of an extradition request for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor [[Frederick Walker Pitkin]] to deny Holliday's extradition. Holliday spent the few remaining years of his life in Colorado, and died of tuberculosis in his bed at the Hotel Glenwood at age 36.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web |last1=[[The Associated Press]] |title=A New Tombstone Sets the Record Straight for Doc Holliday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/us/a-new-tombstone-sets-the-record-straight-for-doc-holliday.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=NYT |accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\n[[File:DocHollidayCloseUp.jpg|left|thumb|Holliday's graduation photo in March 1872 from the Pennsylvania School of Dentistry.]]\n\nHolliday was born in [[Griffin, Georgia]], to Henry Burroughs Holliday and Alice Jane (McKey) Holliday.<ref name=\"genealogy2\">{{cite web| url=http://www.kansasheritage.org/families/holliday.html| title=John Henry Holliday Family History| publisher=Kansas Heritage Group| accessdate=March 30, 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514215437/http://www.kansasheritage.org/families/holliday.html| archivedate=May 14, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref> He was of [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry.<ref name=tanner/>{{rp| 236}} His father served in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (as a Confederate).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/soldiers.cfm|title=Civil War Soldiers and Sailors| publisher= The National Park Service|accessdate=January 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814171239/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/soldiers.cfm|archivedate=August 14, 2008 }}</ref> When the Mexican\u2013American War ended, Henry brought home an adopted son named Francisco.

The cowboys had repeatedly threatened the Earps and Holliday.  Fearing trouble, Virgil temporarily deputized Holliday and sought backup from his brothers Wyatt and Morgan.

No baptismal record has been found in either St. Stephen's Catholic Church in Glenwood Springs or at the Annunciation Catholic Church in nearby Leadville.<ref name=holliday2001/>{{rp|300}} Holliday's mother had been raised a Methodist and later joined a Presbyterian church (her husband's faith), but objected to the Presbyterian doctrine of [[predestination]] and reconverted to [[Methodism]] publicly before she died, saying that she wanted her son John to know what she believed.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|14, 41}} Holliday himself was later to say that he had joined a Methodist church in Dallas.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|70}} At the end of his life, Holliday had struck up friendships with both a Catholic priest, Father E.T. Downey, and a Presbyterian minister, Rev. W.S. Randolph, in Glenwood Springs. When he died, Father Downey was out of town, and so Rev. Randolph presided over the burial at 4pm on the same day that Holliday died. The services were reportedly attended by \"many friends\".<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|370, 372}}\n\n=== Burial ===\n\nHolliday is buried in Linwood Cemetery overlooking Glenwood Springs. Since Holliday died in November, the ground may have been frozen. Some modern authors such as Bob Boze Bell<ref>{{cite book | last1=Bell| first1=Bob Boze| title=The Illustrated Life and Times of Doc Holliday| date=1995| publisher=Tri Star-Boze Publications| location=Phoenix, Arizona| isbn=1-887576-00-2| edition=Second}}</ref> speculate that it would have been impossible to transport him to the cemetery, which was only accessible by a difficult mountain road, or to dig a grave because the ground was frozen. Author Gary Roberts located evidence that other bodies were transported to the Linwood Cemetery at the same time of the month that year. Contemporary newspaper reports explicitly state that Holliday was buried in the Linwood Cemetery, but the exact location of his grave is uncertain.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n== Public reputation ==\n\nHolliday maintained a fierce persona as was sometimes needed for a gambler to earn respect. He had a contemporary reputation as a skilled gunfighter which modern historians generally regard as accurate.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|410}} Tombstone resident [[George W. Parsons]] wrote that Holliday confronted [[Johnny Ringo]] in January 1882, telling him, \"All I want of you is ten paces out in the street.\" Ringo and he were prevented from a gunfight by the Tombstone police, who arrested both. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Holliday initially carried a shotgun and shot at and may have killed Tom McLaury. Holliday was grazed by a bullet fired by Frank McLaury, and shot back. After [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] was maimed in a January ambush, Holliday was part of a federal posse led by Deputy U.S. Marshal Earp who guarded him on his way to the railroad in Tucson. There they found Frank Stilwell apparently waiting for the Earps in the rail yard. A warrant for Holliday's arrest was issued after Stilwell was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds. Holliday was part of Earp's federal posse when they killed three other outlaw Cowboys during the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]]. Holliday reported that he had been arrested 17 times, four attempts had been made to hang him, and that he survived ambush five times.<ref name=Natural>{{cite web |url=http://thenaturalamerican.com/holliday.htm |title=The Natural American: Doc Holliday |quote=based on information found in ''The Chronicles of Tombstone'' by Ben Traywick |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021201753/http://thenaturalamerican.com/holliday.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2014  |access-date=October 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Character ===\nThroughout his lifetime, Holliday was known by many of his peers as a tempered, calm, Southern gentleman. In an 1896 article, Wyatt Earp said:\n\n{{quote|I found him a loyal friend and good company. He was a dentist whom necessity had made a gambler; a gentleman whom disease had made a vagabond; a philosopher whom life had made a caustic wit; a long, lean blonde fellow nearly dead with consumption and at the same time the most skillful gambler and nerviest, speediest, deadliest man with a six-gun I ever knew.<ref>{{cite web | title=Doc Holliday- Deadly Doctor of the West | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/CP-DocHolliday.html | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211105333/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/CP-DocHolliday.html | archivedate=December 11, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a newspaper interview, Holliday was once asked if his conscience ever troubled him.

Holliday had a mean disposition and an ungovernable temper, and under the influence of liquor was a most dangerous man\u2026. Physically, Doc Holliday was a weakling who could not have whipped a healthy fifteen-year-old boy in a go-as-you-please fist fight.<ref name=\"westdoc\"/>}}\n\n=== Stabbings and shootings ===\n\nMuch of Holliday's violent reputation was nothing but rumors and [[self promotion]]. However, he showed great skill in gambling and gunfights. His tuberculosis did not hamper his ability as a gambler and as a marksman. Holliday was [[ambidextrous]].<ref name=lubet/>{{rp|96}}\n\nNo contemporaneous newspaper accounts or legal records offer proof of the many unnamed men whom Holliday is credited with killing in popular folklore. The only men he is known to have killed are Mike Gordon in 1879; probably Frank Mclaury and Tom McLaury in Tombstone; and possibly Frank Stilwell in Tucson. Some scholars argue that Holliday may have encouraged the stories about his reputation, although his record never supported those claims.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|410}}\n\nIn a March 1882 interview with the ''Arizona Daily Star'', Virgil Earp told the reporter:\n\n{{quote|There was something very peculiar about Doc. He was gentlemanly, a good dentist, a friendly man, and yet outside of us boys I don't think he had a friend in the Territory. Tales were told that he had murdered men in different parts of the country; that he had robbed and committed all manner of crimes, and yet when persons were asked how they knew it, they could only admit that it was hearsay, and that nothing of the kind could really be traced up to Doc's account.<ref name=interviewone>{{cite web | title=Interview with Virgil Earp Arizona Daily Star| accessdate=May 24, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428084917/http://www.angelfire.com/co4/earpgang/interviewone.html| archivedate=April 28, 2009| date=May 30, 1882 | work=Arizona Affairs |url=http://www.angelfire.com/co4/earpgang/interviewone.html}} Originally published in the ''Arizona Daily Star'' on May 30, 1882</ref>}}\n\n=== Arrests and convictions ===\n\nBiographer Karen Holliday Tanner found that Holliday had been arrested 17 times before his 1881 shootout in Tombstone. Only one arrest was for murder, which occurred in an 1879 shootout with Mike Gordon in New Mexico, for which he was acquitted. In the preliminary hearing following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated Holliday's actions as those of a duly appointed lawman. In Denver, the Arizona warrant against Holliday for Frank Stilwell's murder went unserved when the governor was persuaded by Trinidad Chief of Police Bat Masterson to release Holliday to his custody for bunco charges.<ref name=\"holliday2001\">{{cite book | last=Holliday| first=Karen Tanner| title=Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait| year=2001| publisher=University of Oklahoma Press| location=Norman| isbn=978-0-8061-3320-1}}</ref>\n\nAmong his other arrests, Holliday pleaded guilty to two gambling charges, one charge of carrying a deadly weapon in the city (in connection with the argument with Ringo), and one misdemeanor assault and battery charge (for his shooting of Joyce and Parker). The others were all dismissed or returned as \"not guilty.\"<ref name=\"holliday2001\"/>\n\n=== Alleged murder of Ed Bailey ===\n\nWyatt Earp recounted one event during which Holliday killed a fellow gambler named Ed Bailey. Earp and his common-law wife [[Mattie Blaylock]] were in [[Fort Griffin, Texas]], during the winter of 1878, looking for gambling opportunities. Earp visited the saloon of his old friend from Cheyenne, John Shannsey, and met Holliday at the Cattle Exchange.<ref name=lee>{{cite web | last=Paul| first=Lee| title=John Henry Holliday| url=http://www.theoutlaws.com/outlaws1.htm| accessdate=October 29, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216201643/http://www.theoutlaws.com/outlaws1.htm|archivedate=February 16, 2008}}</ref> The story of Holliday killing Bailey first appeared nine years after Holliday's death in an 1896 interview with Wyatt Earp that was published in the ''San Francisco Enquirer''.<ref name=wilcox>{{cite web| last1=Wilcox| first1=Victoria| title=Doc Holliday and the Ghost of Ed Bailey {{!}}| url=http://victoriawilcoxbooks.com/doc-holliday-history/doc-holliday-and-the-ghost-of-ed-bailey/| website=victoriawilcoxbooks.com| accessdate=November 1, 2016| date=August 11, 2015| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103234127/http://victoriawilcoxbooks.com/doc-holliday-history/doc-holliday-and-the-ghost-of-ed-bailey/| archivedate=November 3, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to Earp, Holliday was playing poker with a well-liked local man named Ed Bailey. Holliday caught Bailey \"monkeying with the dead wood\" or the discard pile, which was against the rules. According to Earp, Holliday reminded Bailey to \"play poker\", which was a polite way to caution him to stop cheating. When Bailey made the same move again, Holliday took the pot without showing his hand, which was his right under the rules. Bailey immediately went for his pistol, but Holliday whipped out a knife from his breast pocket and \"caught Bailey just below the brisket\" or upper chest. Bailey died and Holliday, new to town, was detained in his room at the Planter's Hotel.<ref name=holliday2001/>{{rp|115}}\n\nIn [[Stuart N. Lake|Stuart Lake]]'s best-selling biography, ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'' (1931), Earp added to the story. He is quoted as saying that Holliday's girlfriend, \"Big Nose Kate\" Horony, devised a diversion. She procured a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol.<ref name=lee/> However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey's death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed \"a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room.\" She laughed at the idea of \"a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw up his hands, disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies.\"<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|87}}\n\nAuthor and Earp expert Ben Traywick doubts that Holliday killed Bailey. He could find no newspaper articles or court records to support the story. He found evidence to support that Holliday was being held in his hotel room under guard, but for \"illegal gambling\", and that the story of Horony starting a fire as a diversion to free him was true. The story about Bailey as told in  ''San Francisco Enquirer'' interview of Earp was likely fabricated by the writer. Years later, Earp wrote:\n\n{{quote|Of all the nonsensical guff which has been written around my life, there has been none more inaccurate or farfetched than that which has dealt with Doc Holliday.  After Holliday died, I gave a San Francisco newspaper reporter a short sketch of his life.  Apparently the reporter was not satisfied.  The sketch appeared in print with a lot of things added that never existed outside the reporter's imagination ...<ref name=wilcox/>}}\n\n== Photos of Holliday ==\n\nThree photos of unknown provenance are often reported to be of Holliday, some of them supposedly taken by [[C.S. Fly]] in Tombstone, but sometimes reported to have been taken in Dallas. Holliday lived in a rooming house in front of Fly's photography studio. Many persons share similar facial features, and the faces of people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers, and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.<ref name=rowe>{{cite web |url=http://maineantiquedigest.com/articles_archive/articles/oct02/josi1002.htm |first=Jeremy |last=Rowe |year=2002 |title=Thoughts on Kaloma, the Purported Photograph of Josie Earp |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320071207/http://maineantiquedigest.com/articles_archive/articles/oct02/josi1002.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2012  }}</ref>\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:DocHollidayCloseUp.jpg|Cropped from a larger version, Holliday's graduation photo from the Pennsylvania School of Dental Surgery in March 1872, age 20, known [[provenance]] and authenticated as Holliday\nImage:Doc Holliday in Prescott AZ (closeup).jpg|Cropped from a larger version, Holliday in Prescott, Arizona in 1879, age 27, known [[provenance]] and authenticated as Holliday\nImage:DocHolliday.jpg|Uncreased print of supposed 1882 Tombstone photo of Holliday, left side is upturned, detachable shirt collar toward camera, no cowlick, unknown provenance\nImage:HollidayLcollar.jpg|Creased and darker version of photo at left, unknown provenance\nImage:Doc Holliday.jpg|Person most often reported to be Holliday with a [[cowlick]] and folded-down collar, heavily retouched, oval, inscribed portrait, unknown provenance\nImage:HollidayandBowler.jpg|Person with a [[bowler hat]] and open vest and coat, unknown provenance\n</gallery>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n[[File:Wyatt and Doc.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Life-sized statues of lawman Wyatt Earp and deputy Doc Holliday at the [[Tucson (Amtrak station)|Historic Railroad Depot]]]]\nDoc Holliday is one of the most recognizable figures in the American Old West, but he is most remembered for his friendship with Wyatt Earp and his role in the Gunfight at the O.K.

It resulted in a surprise victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under leader [[Edward Heath]], which defeated the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under [[Harold Wilson]]. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], under its new leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]], lost half its seats. The Conservatives, including the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), secured a majority of 31 seats. This general election was the first in which people could vote from the age of 18, after passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1969|Representation of the People Act]] the previous year.\n\nMost opinion polls prior to the election indicated a comfortable Labour victory, and put Labour up to 12.4% ahead of the Conservatives. On election day, however, a late swing gave the Conservatives a 3.4% lead and ended almost six years of Labour government, although Wilson remained leader of the Labour Party in opposition. Writing in the aftermath of the election, the political scientist [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] described the Conservative victory as \"surprising\" and noted a significant shift in votes between the two main parties.<ref name=\"RoseTimes\">{{cite book |author1=Richard Rose |authorlink1=Richard Rose (political scientist) |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |page=31 |chapter=Voting Trends Surveyed}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' journalist George Clark wrote that the election would be \"remembered as the occasion when the people of the United Kingdom hurled the findings of the opinion polls back into the faces of the pollsters\".<ref name=\"ClarkTimes\">{{cite book |author1=George Clark |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |page=26 |chapter=The General Election Campaign, 1970}}</ref>\n\nThe result would provide the mandate for Heath as Prime Minister to begin formal negotiations for the United Kingdom to become a member of the [[European Communities]] (EC)\u2014or the \"Common Market\" as it was more widely known at the time, before it later became the [[European Union]]; the [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|UK officially joined the EC]] on 1 January 1973, along with the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.\n\nFrontbench Labour politicians [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] and [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]] were voted out at this election.\n\nThis marked the end of a series of elections, recommencing [[1997 United Kingdom general election|27 years later]], where the Labour Party won over 40% of the vote. This was the most recent election at which a House of Commons majority for one party immediately before election day was replaced by a Commons majority for a different party on election day.\n\nCast as a two-party politics outcome, such an outcome would not be mirrored until [[2017 United Kingdom general election|the 2017 election]], namely that no third party reached 10% of the (total) vote.\n\nThe election was the last in which a nationwide UK party gained seats in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{citation |first=Dan |last=Keohane |year=2000 |title=Security in British Politics 1945\u201399 |p=183}}</ref> The UUP sat with the Conservative Party at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], traditionally taking the Conservative parliamentary [[Whip (politics)|whip]]. To all intents and purposes the UUP functioned as the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservative Party.

Interviewed by [[Robin Day]], the outgoing Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] highlighted the possibility that \"complacency engendered by the opinion polls\" may have resulted in a poor turnout of Labour supporters.<ref name=\"BBC Election Results Programme 1970\">{{citation |title=BBC Election Results Programme |date=18\u201319 July 1970}}</ref> As [[1966 FIFA World Cup|defending world champions]], England's venture in the World Cup attracted a much keener public interest than the general election did.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1970_over.stm|title=Heath: The victory few predicted |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAmerican pollster Douglas Schoen and [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] academic [[R.

Brown had held the seat since 1945.\n\nUnusually for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the by-elections between 1966 and 1970 had proved almost fruitless, with many Liberal candidates losing deposits. The one exception was its [[1969 Birmingham Ladywood by-election|by-election gain of Birmingham Ladywood]] in June 1969; this was promptly lost in the 1970 general election. The party found itself struggling to introduce its new leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] to the public, owing to the extensive coverage and attention paid to [[Enoch Powell]]. The election result was poor for the Liberals, with Thorpe only narrowly winning his own seat in [[North Devon]].<ref name=\"SusVic\"/>\n\nThe BBC's election coverage was led by [[Cliff Michelmore]], along with [[Robin Day]], [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]].<ref name=SusVic/> There were periodic cutaways to the BBC regions.

Therefore, despite 1.1 million more people voting in 1970 compared to 1966, turnout actually fell by 3%. This 72% turnout was the lowest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|the 1935 general election]] and compared with a post-War high of 84% in [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]]. [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Professor Richard Rose]] described the low turnout, which he noted was \"one of the lowest since the introduction of the democratic franchise\", as surprising to politician and pollsters. Changes to electoral law as part of the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]] had made postal voting easier and polling stations were open an hour later than in past elections, and this would have been expected to improve turnout. On top of this it was reported by Rose that an estimated 25% of 18\u201321-year olds who were now eligible to vote had not put their names on the electoral register, meaning the turnout was even lower than the percentage figure suggested. Rose also argued that the turnout figures in Britain were \"now among the lowest in the Western world.\"<ref name=\"RoseTimes\"/> Labour's number of votes, 12.2 million, was ironically the same amount they had needed to win in 1964. The Conservative vote surge cost Labour in many marginal seats. Rose suggested the absolute fall in the number of Labour votes suggested that many of the party's supporters had decided to abstain. He also noted that the Labour Party's local organisation was poorer than that of the Conservatives, but did not feel this was a significant factor in Labour supporters failing to come out to vote for the Party given that this organisational difference had been the case in past elections without having this effect.<ref name=\"RoseTimes\"/> For the Liberals, a small 1% drop in their vote share saw them lose 6 seats, 3 of which were held by the narrowest of margins.\n\nIn the end the Conservatives achieved a swing of 4.7%, enough to give them a comfortable working majority. As for the smaller parties, they increased their number in the Commons from 2 to 6 seats.\n{{Election Summary Begin with Leaders| title = UK General Election 1970}}\n{{Election Summary Party with

It resulted in a surprise victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under leader [[Edward Heath]], which defeated the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under [[Harold Wilson]]. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], under its new leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]], lost half its seats. The Conservatives, including the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), secured a majority of 31 seats. This general election was the first in which people could vote from the age of 18, after passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1969|Representation of the People Act]] the previous year.\n\nMost opinion polls prior to the election indicated a comfortable Labour victory, and put Labour up to 12.4% ahead of the Conservatives. On election day, however, a late swing gave the Conservatives a 3.4% lead and ended almost six years of Labour government, although Wilson remained leader of the Labour Party in opposition. Writing in the aftermath of the election, the political scientist [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] described the Conservative victory as \"surprising\" and noted a significant shift in votes between the two main parties.<ref name=\"RoseTimes\">{{cite book |author1=Richard Rose |authorlink1=Richard Rose (political scientist) |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |page=31 |chapter=Voting Trends Surveyed}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' journalist George Clark wrote that the election would be \"remembered as the occasion when the people of the United Kingdom hurled the findings of the opinion polls back into the faces of the pollsters\".<ref name=\"ClarkTimes\">{{cite book |author1=George Clark |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1970 |date=1970 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |page=26 |chapter=The General Election Campaign, 1970}}</ref>\n\nThe result would provide the mandate for Heath as Prime Minister to begin formal negotiations for the United Kingdom to become a member of the [[European Communities]] (EC)\u2014or the \"Common Market\" as it was more widely known at the time, before it later became the [[European Union]]; the [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|UK officially joined the EC]] on 1 January 1973, along with the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.\n\nFrontbench Labour politicians [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] and [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]] were voted out at this election.\n\nThis marked the end of a series of elections, recommencing [[1997 United Kingdom general election|27 years later]], where the Labour Party won over 40% of the vote. This was the most recent election at which a House of Commons majority for one party immediately before election day was replaced by a Commons majority for a different party on election day.\n\nCast as a two-party politics outcome, such an outcome would not be mirrored until [[2017 United Kingdom general election|the 2017 election]], namely that no third party reached 10% of the (total) vote.\n\nThe election was the last in which a nationwide UK party gained seats in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{citation |first=Dan |last=Keohane |year=2000 |title=Security in British Politics 1945\u201399 |p=183}}</ref> The UUP sat with the Conservative Party at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], traditionally taking the Conservative parliamentary [[Whip (politics)|whip]]. To all intents and purposes the UUP functioned as the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservative Party. In 1972, in protest over the permanent prorogation of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the Westminster UUP MPs withdrew from the alliance.<ref>{{citation |first=Stuart |last=Bell |first2=Anthony |last2=Seldon |title=The Heath Government 1970\u201374: A Reappraisal}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2018}}\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1964|1966|1970|February 1974|October 1974}}\n\n==Election date==\nThe date of 18 June was supposedly chosen because [[Harold Wilson]] wanted as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] to go to the polls before the [[Decimal Day|introduction of decimal coinage]] in early 1971, for which his government had been responsible and which he thought was hugely unpopular,<ref name=\"Joe Haines 2003\">{{citation |first=Joe |last=Haines |title=Glimmers of Twilight |location=London |publisher=Politico's Publishers |year=2003}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2018}} and because Wilson sought to gain some momentum by surprising the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], who were expecting an October election.<ref name=\"Joe Haines 2003\"/>{{page needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Overview==\nCommentators believed that an unexpectedly bad set of balance of payments figures (a \u00a331-million trade deficit) published three days before the election and a loss of national prestige after the England football team's defeat by West Germany on 15 June in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] contributed to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] defeat.<ref name=SusVic>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393297.stm |title=1970: Heath's surprise victory |date=5 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther factors that were cited as reasons for the Conservative victory included union indiscipline, rising prices, the risk of devaluation, the imposition of [[Selective Employment Tax]] (SET), and a set of jobless figures released on final week of the campaign showing unemployment at its highest level since 1940. Interviewed by [[Robin Day]], the outgoing Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] highlighted the possibility that \"complacency engendered by the opinion polls\" may have resulted in a poor turnout of Labour supporters.<ref name=\"BBC Election Results Programme 1970\">{{citation |title=BBC Election Results Programme |date=18\u201319 July 1970}}</ref> As [[1966 FIFA World Cup|defending world champions]], England's venture in the World Cup attracted a much keener public interest than the general election did.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1970_over.stm|title=Heath: The victory few predicted |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAmerican pollster Douglas Schoen and [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] academic [[R. W. Johnson]] asserted that [[Enoch Powell]] had attracted 2.5 million votes to the Conservatives, although the Conservative vote only increased by 1.7 million.

Brown had held the seat since 1945.\n\nUnusually for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the by-elections between 1966 and 1970 had proved almost fruitless, with many Liberal candidates losing deposits. The one exception was its [[1969 Birmingham Ladywood by-election|by-election gain of Birmingham Ladywood]] in June 1969; this was promptly lost in the 1970 general election. The party found itself struggling to introduce its new leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] to the public, owing to the extensive coverage and attention paid to [[Enoch Powell]]. The election result was poor for the Liberals, with Thorpe only narrowly winning his own seat in [[North Devon]].<ref name=\"SusVic\"/>\n\nThe BBC's election coverage was led by [[Cliff Michelmore]], along with [[Robin Day]], [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]].<ref name=SusVic/> There were periodic cutaways to the BBC regions.

Therefore, despite 1.1 million more people voting in 1970 compared to 1966, turnout actually fell by 3%. This 72% turnout was the lowest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|the 1935 general election]] and compared with a post-War high of 84% in [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]]. [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Professor Richard Rose]] described the low turnout, which he noted was \"one of the lowest since the introduction of the democratic franchise\", as surprising to politician and pollsters. Changes to electoral law as part of the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]] had made postal voting easier and polling stations were open an hour later than in past elections, and this would have been expected to improve turnout. On top of this it was reported by Rose that an estimated 25% of 18\u201321-year olds who were now eligible to vote had not put their names on the electoral register, meaning the turnout was even lower than the percentage figure suggested. Rose also argued that the turnout figures in Britain were \"now among the lowest in the Western world.\"<ref name=\"RoseTimes\"/> Labour's number of votes, 12.2 million, was ironically the same amount they had needed to win in 1964. The Conservative vote surge cost Labour in many marginal seats. Rose suggested the absolute fall in the number of Labour votes suggested that many of the party's supporters had decided to abstain. He also noted that the Labour Party's local organisation was poorer than that of the Conservatives, but did not feel this was a significant factor in Labour supporters failing to come out to vote for the Party given that this organisational difference had been the case in past elections without having this effect.<ref name=\"RoseTimes\"/> For the Liberals, a small 1% drop in their vote share saw them lose 6 seats, 3 of which were held by the narrowest of margins.\n\nIn the end the Conservatives achieved a swing of 4.7%, enough to give them a comfortable working majority. As for the smaller parties, they increased their number in the Commons from 2 to 6 seats.\n{{Election Summary Begin with Leaders| title = UK General Election 1970}}\n{{Election Summary Party with

It derives from the [[Ankole (cattle)|Ankole]] group of [[Sanga cattle]] breeds of central Africa. It is characterized by very large horns.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Ankole-Watusi derives from central African cattle of the [[Ankole (cattle)|Ankole]] group of [[Sanga cattle]] breeds. Some of these were brought to Germany as zoo specimens in the early twentieth century, and from there spread to other European zoos. Some were imported to the United States, and in 1960 a herd was started in [[New York State]] by [[cross-breeding]] some of them with an unrelated Canadian bull.{{r|cabi|page=110}} A [[breed society]], the Ankole Watusi International Registry, was set up in 1983,{{r|cabi|page=110}} and in 1989 a [[breed standard]] was drawn up.{{r|awir}} In 2016 the total number for the breed was thought to be approximately 1500 head, some 80% of them in the United States.{{r|cabi|page=110}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Ankole-Watusi may be a number of different colors, but is usually red. The horns are unusually large, with a wide spread{{r|cabi|page=110}} and the largest [[circumference]] found in any cattle breed. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists a bull named {{vanchor|CT Woodie}} with a horn circumference of {{Convert|103.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a steer named Lurch, with horns measuring {{Convert|95.25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, as record-holders.{{r|gwr|gwr2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=awir>[http://www.awir.org Ankole-Watusi Cattle].

It derives from the [[Ankole (cattle)|Ankole]] group of [[Sanga cattle]] breeds of central Africa. It is characterized by very large horns.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Ankole-Watusi derives from central African cattle of the [[Ankole (cattle)|Ankole]] group of [[Sanga cattle]] breeds. Some of these were brought to Germany as zoo specimens in the early twentieth century, and from there spread to other European zoos. Some were imported to the United States, and in 1960 a herd was started in [[New York State]] by [[cross-breeding]] some of them with an unrelated Canadian bull.{{r|cabi|page=110}} A [[breed society]], the Ankole Watusi International Registry, was set up in 1983,{{r|cabi|page=110}} and in 1989 a [[breed standard]] was drawn up.{{r|awir}} In 2016 the total number for the breed was thought to be approximately 1500 head, some 80% of them in the United States.{{r|cabi|page=110}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Ankole-Watusi may be a number of different colors, but is usually red. The horns are unusually large, with a wide spread{{r|cabi|page=110}} and the largest [[circumference]] found in any cattle breed. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists a bull named {{vanchor|CT Woodie}} with a horn circumference of {{Convert|103.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a steer named Lurch, with horns measuring {{Convert|95.25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, as record-holders.{{r|gwr|gwr2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=awir>[http://www.awir.org Ankole-Watusi Cattle].

This has influenced the evolution of their scripts. The rounded letters of many of the [[Brahmic scripts|scripts of southern India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia]] such as [[Oriya script|Oriya]] and [[Sinhala script|Sinhala]], [[Burmese script|Burmese]], and [[Javanese alphabet|Javanese]], for example, are thought to have been influenced by this: Sharp angles and tracing straight lines along the vein of the leaf with a sharp writing implement would risk splitting the leaf and ruining the surface, so rounded letters, or letters with straight lines only in the vertical or diagonal direction, were required for practical daily use.<ref>Sanford Steever, 'Tamil Writing', in Daniels & Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'', 1996, p. 426</ref>\n\nIn such situations, the ribs of the leaves function as the dividing lines of [[ruled paper]], separating lines of text.

An old woman said that the song of the bird, 'Grip', would restore it.  The king's eldest son offered to fetch the bird, from where it was kept in a cage by another king; but on his way to fetch the bird, he stayed at a merry inn, where he enjoyed himself so much that he forgot about his journey.  His two brothers followed; the second also stayed at the inn, but the [[Youngest son|youngest]] said that he had to fetch the bird 'Grip', and continued on instead of remaining at the inn.\n\nHe stayed at a house in the woods where he heard shrieks in the night.  In the morning, he asked about the shrieks.  A girl told him that they came from a dead man, whom the innkeeper had beat and killed for not being able to pay the bill, and whom he refused to bury without the money for the funeral.  The prince paid his bill, but was afraid to stay longer, so he asked the girl to help him escape in the night.  She told him the host kept the key to the stables under his pillow, but she would help him if he would take her with him.  He did so, and got her a place at a good inn before he went on.\n\nThe youngest son then met a fox, which told him it could help him.  When they got to the castle where the bird was, the fox gave him three grains:  one for the guardroom, one for the room with the cage, one for the cage itself.  Then he could take the bird, but he must not stroke it.  He obeyed with the grains, but when he decided to stroke the bird, it woke and screamed.  He was captured.  In prison, the fox appeared and told him to answer \"Yes\" to everything at the trial.  He was asked whether he was a master thief and he answered yes.  The king offered to pardon him if he carried off the world's most beautiful princess, from the next kingdom.\n\nThe fox gave him three grains again: for the guardroom, the princess's chamber, and her bed, and warned him not to kiss the princess, but he failed again at the kiss. Again at the trial, he was asked whether he was a master thief and he answered yes. The king offered to pardon him if he carried off the horse with the four golden shoes, from the next kingdom.\n\nThe fox gave him three grains again, for the guardroom, the stable, and the horse's stall, and warned him against the golden saddle, and that this time, the fox would not be able to help him if the boy failed in his task. When the boy saw the saddle, he reached for it, but something struck his arm, and he led out the horse without it. He confessed to the fox, who said that it had been he who had struck his arm. Returning to the princess's castle, he confessed that he would gladly take her to his father's castle on the horse, and so the fox gave him the grains again, and this time he carried the princess off. He asked the fox if he could try the bird again, and this time, he succeeded in catching the bird.\n\nThe fox then warned the boy against ransoming anyone with the money. The prince rode on and discovered that his brothers had gone into debt at the inn and were to be hanged. He paid off the debt. His [[False hero|brothers]], jealous, threw him into a den of lions and took the bird, the horse, and the princess, threatening to kill her if she did not say they had won them. They told their father that their youngest had been hanged for debt. But the bird did not sing, the horse would let no one in the stall, and the princess wept unceasingly.\n\nIn the lions' den, the prince found the fox; the lions did not harm him, and the fox led him out, saying only that sons that would forget their father would also betray their brother. The fox asked him to cut off his head. The prince tried to refuse, but the fox insisted that he would kill the prince if he did not. The prince did, and the fox told him that he was the [[Grateful dead (folklore)|dead man]] whose debts he had paid.\n\nThe prince disguised himself as a horse-shoer and went to the castle. He put shoes on the horse with four golden shoes, and hearing the bird Grip would not sing, declared that it lacked something and if he could see it, he could learn what it was. He called the bird by name. It began to sing, and caused the princess to smile. The king's sight recovered, and he recognized the horse-shoer as his youngest son. He banished the older sons, but the youngest married the princess and lived happily ever after.\n\n==Motifs==\nWhile the hero in these stories is normally aided by a [[talking animal]], for it to be a ghost is unusual.

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a strong ability with [[the Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has said the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same [[Yoda's species|alien species]] as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character

The character of the Child was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and Filoni, the latter of whom drew a rough sketch of the character on cocktail napkins during the talks.<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Multiple artists worked to refine the image of the Child created by Filoni, but the definitive imagery came from a concept drawing by artist Christian Alzmann, which depicted the character's makeshift garment.<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Favreau said of this rendering: \"It looked cute, but it also looked a little weird. That's part of Yoda. It can't just be cute. It can't just be a straight-up Disney baby, it has to be a little bit tweaked.\"<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> The team sought to establish mannerisms and expressions for the Child that would remind viewers of a pet with whom they might share a connection. These characteristics include the Child's ears, posture, and the way he cocks his head.<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" />\n\nDisney [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Bob Iger]] said of the Child: \"The moment I laid eyes on the character, I had a strong feeling that it was going to connect with audiences.

While filming one scene, Dave Filoni began to remove the puppet to shoot an alternate take, in case they decided to use a CGI version of the Child in its place. Herzog passionately urged him not to do so and to remain committed to the animatronics and puppetry, saying: \"You are cowards. Leave it.

This occasionally proved challenging for Rosas, who also had to manage the weight of the animatronics in her own costume and face mask, as well as the weight of the Child prop.<ref name=\"Rosas5440\" /> One full day of filming the episode focused upon Kuiil riding the [[blurrg]] creature, a process Rosas described as \"intense\" due to the amount of time she spent on the fake creature and the speeds at which it was made to run. The process was made further challenging because she was carrying the heavy animatronic Child puppet throughout the scenes, and she occasionally needed breaks between takes. Rosas said: \"My legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Rosas|Ballance|2020|loc=53:41\u201354:29 Rosas: \"It was Deb's episode, which was very intense.

And, I mean, my legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies.

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a strong ability with [[the Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has said the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same [[Yoda's species|alien species]] as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref name=\"Giardina1205\">{{cite news |last=Giardina |first=Carolyn |title=Why Jon Favreau Chose Baby Yoda: 'We Don't Know a Lot of Details About His Species' |work=[[The Hollywood

While filming one scene, Dave Filoni began to remove the puppet to shoot an alternate take, in case they decided to use a CGI version of the Child in its place. Herzog passionately urged him not to do so and to remain committed to the animatronics and puppetry, saying: \"You are cowards. Leave it.

This occasionally proved challenging for Rosas, who also had to manage the weight of the animatronics in her own costume and face mask, as well as the weight of the Child prop.<ref name=\"Rosas5440\" /> One full day of filming the episode focused upon Kuiil riding the [[blurrg]] creature, a process Rosas described as \"intense\" due to the amount of time she spent on the fake creature and the speeds at which it was made to run. The process was made further challenging because she was carrying the heavy animatronic Child puppet throughout the scenes, and she occasionally needed breaks between takes. Rosas said: \"My legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Rosas|Ballance|2020|loc=53:41\u201354:29 Rosas: \"It was Deb's episode, which was very intense.

And, I mean, my legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.

During the first take of filming the scene, Pally punched the animatronic Child puppet hard, prompting Favreau to inform the actor that the puppet costs about $5 million to make.

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly [[arm wrestling]] match.

Miller suggested the Child could be putting on a similar performance.<ref name=\"Miller1218\" /> One fan theory suggests the Child could be related to a prophecy in a past ''Star Wars'' work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy, described in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Master and Apprentice]]'' (2019), says: \"The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire.\" Fans theorized this could refer to the Child, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in ''The Mandalorian''.<ref name=\"Abdulbaki0106\" /> Others have theorized the reason the Imperial remnant wants the Child is to turn him over to the dark side of the Force,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /> or for use as a weapon.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> Moff Gideon in the season finale says: \"You may think you have some idea what you\u2019re in possession of, but you do not.\" Peter Foy of ''Comic Book Resources'' suggested this could allude to the Child's potential to cause mass destruction.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" />\n\nCaitlin Gallagher of ''[[Bustle (website)|Bustle]]'' suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> All season long, the Child has witnessed those around him committing violent acts.<ref name=\"Milner1222\">{{cite news |last=Milner |first=Sarah Bea |title=The Mandalorian: Baby Yoda Learns About Good & Bad In A Powerful Way |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 22, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223125659/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |archive-date=December 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> For example, ''Vulture'' writer Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, the Child has a \"look of wonder\" in his eyes, which Phipps said \"is hilarious, but also a little chilling\".<ref name=\"Phipps1227\" /> Some writers applied a [[nature versus nurture]] argument to this, contending the Child is becoming violent because of what he is learning based on the actions around him.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> This suggests the Child is not inherently good or evil,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /><ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him.

[[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.\n\nThe [[OED]] first cites \"archaeologist\" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. \"Archaeology\", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call \"ancient history\" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.\n\n===First excavations===\n[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of [[Stonehenge]] taken July 1877]]\nOne of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626\u20131697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings.

These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.<ref>[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)</ref>\n\n===Development of archaeological method===\n[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]\nThe father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754\u20131810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,<ref>Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441\u201353</ref> funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.<ref>Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40\u201343</ref>\n\nOne of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.\n\nA major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],<ref>Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.</ref> who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or \"[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or \"chronologically\". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.<ref>{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=978-1-905739-58-5}}</ref>\n\n[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].\n\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured, are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]\nThe first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of [[Hissarlik]], on the site of ancient [[Troy]], carried out by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Frank Calvert]] and [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].<ref>{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].\n\nArchaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.<ref name=\"Renfrew_Bahn1991#5\">Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33\u201335)</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]\nThe purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5&nbsp;million years ago when we find the first stone tools \u2013 [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.<ref name=\"ncl\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].<ref name=\"archaeological\"/>\n\nOften, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization \u2013 the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities \u2013 must come from archaeology.\n\nIn addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.\n\nThis view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.\n\n===Theory===\n{{main|Archaeological theory}}\n[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThere is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.<ref name=\"Binford1962\"/><ref name=\"Flannery1967\"/> They proposed a \"New Archaeology\", which would be more \"scientific\" and \"anthropological\", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],<ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1987\"/><ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1988\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1991\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1993\"/> [[Christopher Tilley]],<ref name=\"Tilley1993\"/> [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],<ref name=\"Miller_Tilley1984\"/><ref name=\"Miller_etal1989\"/> and [[Ian Hodder]],<ref name=\"Hodder1982\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1985\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1987\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1990\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1991\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1992\"/> which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.<ref name=\"Pauketat2001\"/>\n\nArchaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],<ref name=\"Hinshaw2000\"/>[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|<span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[35]</span>]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].\n\n==Methods==\n[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]\nAn archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the information collected during the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.<ref name=\"renfrew\"/>\n\n===Remote sensing===\nBefore actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments\u2014passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:\n\n'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)\nA lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\n'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''\nA laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.\n<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Field survey===\n{{main|Archaeological survey}}\n[[File:Monte Alb\u00e1n archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]\nThe archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.\n\nSurvey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],<ref name=\"Willey1953\"/><ref name=\"Willey1968\"/> and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.<ref name=\"Billmand_Feinman1999\"/>\n\nSurvey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)<ref name=\"Redman1974\"/> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.\n[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]\nThe simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].\n\n[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].<ref>{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102\u201307|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}</ref>\n\n[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.\n\nAlthough some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.<ref>{{citation |last=S\u00e1nchez |first=Rosal\u00eda |title=Para los arque\u00f3logos es un ladr\u00f3n, para los buscadores de tesoros un \u00eddolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].\n\nRegional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.<ref>{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.\n\nModern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.\n\nExcavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and \"method statement\" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.\n\nThe next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}\n[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]], the [[Philippines]].]]\nOnce artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.\n\nAt a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[stable isotopes]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10256016.2019.1598986 | pmid=30943760 | volume=55 | issue=3 | title=Is the 'canine surrogacy approach' (CSA) still valid for dogs and humans in market-oriented and subsistence-oriented communities in Brazil? | year=2019 | journal=Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies | pages=227\u2013236 | author=Luiz Abdalla Filho Adibe, Bielefeld Nardoto Gabriela, de Aro Galera Leonardo, Leite de Souza Janaina, Santos Reis Luiza, Almoza Hernandez Yeleine, Sales Rebeca, Guimar\u00e3es Gerardi Daniel, Antonio Martinelli Luiz}}</ref> while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].\n\nThese techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.\n\n===Computational and virtual archaeology===\n{{main|Computational archaeology}}\n{{main|Virtual archaeology}}\n[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.<ref name=\"virt\"/> [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].<ref name=virt/> [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes.

Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.\n\n===Archaeometry===\n{{Main|Archaeological science}}\n\n[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.<ref name=\"Glasscock_et_al1994\"/> Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.<ref name=\"GIS, critique, representation and beyond\"/> [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\"/>  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.<ref name=\"mit\"/>\n\n===Cultural resources management===\n{{Main|Cultural resources management}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}\n\nArchaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called [[Cultural heritage management]] (CHM) in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology\"/> CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].\n\nThe application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]<ref name=\"Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government\"/> has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].\n\nIn England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]<ref name=\"Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment\"/> in association with [[English Heritage]].<ref name=\"English Heritage - Stonehenge & the History of England: English Heritage\"/> In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Cadw]]<ref name=\"Cadw\"/> and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]<ref name=\"Built Environment\"/> respectively.\n\nIn France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.\n\nAmong the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.\n\nCultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.\n\nThe annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with \"strong backs and weak minds,\"<ref name=\"Flannery1982\"/> has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.\n\n==Popular views of archaeology==\n\n[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]\n[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]\n\nEarly archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a \"romantic adventurist occupation\".<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\">{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|issue=3\u20134|pages=174\u201385|doi=10.1086/NEA25067670|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10ec642c63fb8691174749138c5429ce983936e2}}</ref> and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of \"who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted\",<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\"/> and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.\n\nMuch thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop\u00e1n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as \"[[pseudoarchaeology]]\".<ref name=\"Romancing the Past-Archaeology\"/>\nArchaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.<ref name=\"Denning2004\"/>\n\n==Current issues and controversy==\n\n===Public archaeology===\n[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]\nMotivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\"/> They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.\n\nOne audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.<ref name=\"rapidcityjournal\"/>\n\nTelevision programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience.

Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nArchaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.\n\nArchaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission \"to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible.\"<ref name=\"The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute\"/>\n\n===Pseudoarchaeology===\n{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}\n\n[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].\n\nAn example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively D\u00e4niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.\n\n===Looting===\n[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]\n\n[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=\"civilizations\" /> Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nIn 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.<ref name=\"Hodge1937\" /> The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721]; {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.<ref name=\"Munson_et_al1995\" />\n\nArchaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by [[metal detector]] hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology. Efforts are underway among all major Archaeological organizations to increase education and legitimate cooperation between amateurs and professionals in the metal detecting community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals \u2013 Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step |url=https://sha.org/blog/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step/ |website=The Society for Historical Archaeology |publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|date=10 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most looting is deliberate, accidental looting can occur when amateurs, who are unaware of the importance of Archaeological rigor, collect artifacts from sites and place them into private collections.\n\n===Descendant peoples===\nIn the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.\n\nAs a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.\n\nArchaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.\n\nWhile this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.\n\n====Repatriation====\n:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''\nA new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods\u2014some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.\n\nThe remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].\n\nAn inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.<ref name=\"Canadian Geographic Online\" />\n\n[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeobiology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeogenetics}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeology of religion and ritual}}\n* {{annotated link|Area of archaeological potential}}\n* {{annotated link|Chronological dating}}\n* {{annotated link|Classical archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Dump digging}}\n* {{annotated link|GIS in archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Harris matrix}}\n* {{annotated link|Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage project}}\n* {{annotated link|Paleoanthropology|Palaeoanthropology}}\n\n'''Lists'''\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological periods}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological sites by country}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeologists}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeology awards}}\n* {{annotated link|List of paleoethnobotanists}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\">{{Citation |title= An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns |author1=Saiano, F.  |author2=Scalenghe, R.|year= 2009|volume=36|issue=11|pages=2502\u201306|doi= 10.1016/j.jas.2009.06.025|journal= Journal of Archaeological Science}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\">{{Citation|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html |title=Anthropological Studies Center (ASC) |publisher=Sonoma.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090328003841/http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html| archivedate= 28 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"archaeological\">{{citation | author = Schiffer M.

Antiquarians studied [[history]] with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites. Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], \"We speak from facts not theory\". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a [[science]] took place during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{citation|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/historyofarchaeology/a/history_series.htm|last=Hirst|first=K.

[[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.\n\nThe [[OED]] first cites \"archaeologist\" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. \"Archaeology\", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call \"ancient history\" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.\n\n===First excavations===\n[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of [[Stonehenge]] taken July 1877]]\nOne of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626\u20131697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 156\u201357, 162\u201366, 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 }}</ref>\n\nExcavations were also carried out by the Spanish military engineer [[Roque Joaqu\u00edn de Alcubierre]] in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.<ref>[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)</ref>\n\n===Development of archaeological method===\n[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]\nThe father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754\u20131810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,<ref>Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441\u201353</ref> funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.<ref>Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40\u201343</ref>\n\nOne of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.\n\nA major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],<ref>Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.</ref> who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or \"[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or \"chronologically\". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.<ref>{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=978-1-905739-58-5}}</ref>\n\n[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].\n\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured, are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]\nThe first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of [[Hissarlik]], on the site of ancient [[Troy]], carried out by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Frank Calvert]] and [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].<ref>{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].\n\nArchaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.<ref name=\"Renfrew_Bahn1991#5\">Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33\u201335)</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]\nThe purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5&nbsp;million years ago when we find the first stone tools \u2013 [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.<ref name=\"ncl\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].<ref name=\"archaeological\"/>\n\nOften, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization \u2013 the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities \u2013 must come from archaeology.\n\nIn addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.\n\nThis view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.\n\n===Theory===\n{{main|Archaeological theory}}\n[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThere is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.<ref name=\"Binford1962\"/><ref name=\"Flannery1967\"/> They proposed a \"New Archaeology\", which would be more \"scientific\" and \"anthropological\", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],<ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1987\"/><ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1988\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1991\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1993\"/> [[Christopher Tilley]],<ref name=\"Tilley1993\"/> [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],<ref name=\"Miller_Tilley1984\"/><ref name=\"Miller_etal1989\"/> and [[Ian Hodder]],<ref name=\"Hodder1982\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1985\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1987\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1990\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1991\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1992\"/> which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.<ref name=\"Pauketat2001\"/>\n\nArchaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],<ref name=\"Hinshaw2000\"/>[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|<span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[35]</span>]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].\n\n==Methods==\n[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]\nAn archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation are studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.<ref name=\"renfrew\"/>\n\n===Remote sensing===\nBefore actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments\u2014passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:\n\n'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)\nA lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\n'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''\nA laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.\n<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Field survey===\n{{main|Archaeological survey}}\n[[File:Monte Alb\u00e1n archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]\nThe archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.\n\nSurvey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],<ref name=\"Willey1953\"/><ref name=\"Willey1968\"/> and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.<ref name=\"Billmand_Feinman1999\"/>\n\nSurvey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)<ref name=\"Redman1974\"/> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.\n[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]\nThe simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].\n\n[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].<ref>{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102\u201307|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}</ref>\n\n[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.\n\nAlthough some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.<ref>{{citation |last=S\u00e1nchez |first=Rosal\u00eda |title=Para los arque\u00f3logos es un ladr\u00f3n, para los buscadores de tesoros un \u00eddolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].\n\nRegional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.<ref>{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.\n\nModern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.\n\nExcavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and \"method statement\" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.\n\nThe next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}\n[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]], the [[Philippines]].]]\nOnce artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.\n\nAt a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[stable isotopes]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10256016.2019.1598986 | pmid=30943760 | volume=55 | issue=3 | title=Is the 'canine surrogacy approach' (CSA) still valid for dogs and humans in market-oriented and subsistence-oriented communities in Brazil? | year=2019 | journal=Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies | pages=227\u2013236 | author=Luiz Abdalla Filho Adibe, Bielefeld Nardoto Gabriela, de Aro Galera Leonardo, Leite de Souza Janaina, Santos Reis Luiza, Almoza Hernandez Yeleine, Sales Rebeca, Guimar\u00e3es Gerardi Daniel, Antonio Martinelli Luiz}}</ref> while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].\n\nThese techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.\n\n===Computational and virtual archaeology===\n{{main|Computational archaeology}}\n{{main|Virtual archaeology}}\n[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.<ref name=\"virt\"/> [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].<ref name=virt/> [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes. [[Data mining]] can be applied to large bodies of archaeological 'grey literature'.\n\n===Drones===\n\nArchaeologists around the world use drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. In Peru, small drones helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps \u2013 and in days and weeks instead of months and years.<ref name=peru>{{citation|author=Reuters in Lima |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins |title=Peru's archaeologists turn to drones to help protect and explore ancient ruins &#124; World news |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825124451/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins|archivedate=25 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDrones costing as little as \u00a3650 have proven useful.

Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.\n\n===Archaeometry===\n{{Main|Archaeological science}}\n\n[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.<ref name=\"Glasscock_et_al1994\"/> Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.<ref name=\"GIS, critique, representation and beyond\"/> [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\"/>  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.<ref name=\"mit\"/>\n\n===Cultural resources management===\n{{Main|Cultural resources management}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}\n\nArchaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called [[Cultural heritage management]] (CHM) in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology\"/> CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].\n\nThe application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]<ref name=\"Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government\"/> has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].\n\nIn England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]<ref name=\"Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment\"/> in association with [[English Heritage]].<ref name=\"English Heritage - Stonehenge & the History of England: English Heritage\"/> In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Cadw]]<ref name=\"Cadw\"/> and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]<ref name=\"Built Environment\"/> respectively.\n\nIn France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.\n\nAmong the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.\n\nCultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.\n\nThe annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with \"strong backs and weak minds,\"<ref name=\"Flannery1982\"/> has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.\n\n==Popular views of archaeology==\n\n[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]\n[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]\n\nEarly archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a \"romantic adventurist occupation\".<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\">{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|issue=3\u20134|pages=174\u201385|doi=10.1086/NEA25067670|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10ec642c63fb8691174749138c5429ce983936e2}}</ref> and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of \"who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted\",<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\"/> and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.\n\nMuch thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop\u00e1n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as \"[[pseudoarchaeology]]\".<ref name=\"Romancing the Past-Archaeology\"/>\nArchaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.<ref name=\"Denning2004\"/>\n\n==Current issues and controversy==\n\n===Public archaeology===\n[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]\nMotivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\"/> They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.\n\nOne audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.<ref name=\"rapidcityjournal\"/>\n\nTelevision programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project<ref>{{citation|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archivedate=16 May 2015 }}</ref> integrated a one-hour HD documentary,<ref name=\"Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck\">{{citation|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}</ref> short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach.

Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nArchaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.\n\nArchaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission \"to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible.\"<ref name=\"The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute\"/>\n\n===Pseudoarchaeology===\n{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}\n\n[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].\n\nAn example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively D\u00e4niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.\n\n===Looting===\n[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]\n\n[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=\"civilizations\" /> Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nIn 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.<ref name=\"Hodge1937\" /> The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721]; {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.<ref name=\"Munson_et_al1995\" />\n\nArchaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by [[metal detector]] hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology. Efforts are underway among all major Archaeological organizations to increase education and legitimate cooperation between amateurs and professionals in the metal detecting community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals \u2013 Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step |url=https://sha.org/blog/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step/ |website=The Society for Historical Archaeology |publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|date=10 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most looting is deliberate, accidental looting can occur when amateurs, who are unaware of the importance of Archaeological rigor, collect artifacts from sites and place them into private collections.\n\n===Descendant peoples===\nIn the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.\n\nAs a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.\n\nArchaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.\n\nWhile this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.\n\n====Repatriation====\n:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''\nA new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods\u2014some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.\n\nThe remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].\n\nAn inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.<ref name=\"Canadian Geographic Online\" />\n\n[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeobiology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeogenetics}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeology of religion and ritual}}\n* {{annotated link|Area of archaeological potential}}\n* {{annotated link|Chronological dating}}\n* {{annotated link|Classical archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Dump digging}}\n* {{annotated link|GIS in archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Harris matrix}}\n* {{annotated link|Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage project}}\n* {{annotated link|Paleoanthropology|Palaeoanthropology}}\n\n'''Lists'''\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological periods}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological sites by country}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeologists}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeology awards}}\n* {{annotated link|List of paleoethnobotanists}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\">{{Citation |title= An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns |author1=Saiano, F.  |author2=Scalenghe, R.|year= 2009|volume=36|issue=11|pages=2502\u201306|doi= 10.1016/j.jas.2009.06.025|journal= Journal of Archaeological Science}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\">{{Citation|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html |title=Anthropological Studies Center (ASC) |publisher=Sonoma.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090328003841/http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html| archivedate= 28 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"archaeological\">{{citation | author = Schiffer M.
