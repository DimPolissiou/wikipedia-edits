In June 2012, Charli XCX released her first original mixtape, titled ''Heartbreaks and Earthquakes'', a one-track file consisting of eight songs.

It was noted as being a transitional phase for Charli XCX, with the newer genres of the song being later incorporated into her third album. In 2014, Charli XCX released the single \"[[Boom Clap]]\", originally from the [[The Fault in Our Stars (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the film ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]''. The song was an international success, peaking at number six on the [[UK Singles Chart]], number eight on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and reaching the top 10 in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. \"Boom Clap\" was later included on Charli XCX's second studio album, ''[[Sucker (album)|Sucker]]'', released in December 2014. The album also spawned the top-40 UK single \"[[Break the Rules (Charli XCX song)|Break the Rules]]\" and the top-10 UK single \"[[Doing It (Charli XCX song)|Doing It]]\", which features English singer [[Rita Ora]]. The singer's third studio album, ''[[Charli (album)|Charli]]'', was released in September 2019. Charli XCX has been featured on two internationally successful singles, the first being [[Icona Pop]]'s song \"[[I Love It (Icona Pop song)|I Love It]]\", which peaked at number one in the UK and reached the top 10 in various countries including the US, Canada, Ireland and Germany. The second single, [[Iggy Azalea]]'s breakthrough song \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\", topped the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and charted in the top 10 in several countries including the UK, Canada, Ireland and Australia.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and sales figures\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Sales\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br><ref name=\"UK\">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/21419/charli-xcx/ |title=Charli XCX |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br><ref name=\"AUS-albums\">Peak chart positions for albums in Australia:\n* ''Sucker'': {{cite journal |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20150108-1009/Issue1297.pdf |title=ARIA Top 100 Albums \u2013 Week Commencing 5th January 2015 |journal=Australian Recording Industry Association |issue=1297 |page=5 |date=5 January 2015 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}\n* ''Number 1 Angel'': {{cite web|url=https://www.auspop.com.au/2017/03/aria-chart-watch-412/|title=ARIA CHART WATCH #412|publisher=auspOp|date=18 March 2017|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| [[\u00d63 Austria Top 40|AUT]]<br><ref name=\"AUT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Charli+XCX&titel=Boom+Clap&cat=s |title=Discography Charli XCX |publisher=austriancharts.com.

Yay\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the modern local government system came into operation in the late 19th century it was described as being \"in the [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] of Buttinghill, in the [[Rape (county subdivision)|rape]] of [[Lewes]]\". The civil parish covers an area of 431.58&nbsp;ha (1066&nbsp;acres), and had a population of 3,266 persons in the 2001 census, increasing to 3,500<ref name=ONS/> at the 2011 Census.\n\nThe origin of the name, Cuckfield (earlier spelled Kukefeld, Cucufeld, and Cucufelda), is debated but it is generally associated with the [[cuckoo]] which is the village emblem.\n\nThe village grew as a [[market town]]; and an important [[coaching inn|coaching]] stop between London and [[Brighton]], since it lay on the [[toll road|turnpike]]. In 1820, 50 coaches a day were passing through; but when the [[Brighton Main Line|railway]] to Brighton was to be constructed in the 1840s, local landowners objected to its projected route: it was therefore built through neighbouring [[Haywards Heath]] instead. The village lost its importance as a result. Today the [[A272 road]] also bypasses the village centre.\n\nIt became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in 1894 under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], and was greatly enlarged in 1934 under a [[Local Government Act 1929|County Review Order]] by adding part of [[Chailey]] [[Rural District]], Cuckfield Rural District (including the parish of [[Lindfield, West Sussex|Lindfield]]) and [[Haywards Heath]] Urban District.\n\nThe Parish Council, Cuckfield Museum and village library reside within the Queen's Hall, built in 1897 to celebrate [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] [[Diamond Jubilee]]. The [[Holy Trinity Church, Cuckfield|parish church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity]], has [[Normans|Norman]] foundations, although the building itself is 13th century. The [[lych gate]]s are [[listed building]]s and several of the [[stained glass]] windows as well as the pulpit and the ceiling's painting were designed by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]] (1837\u20131907).\n\nIn 1822, [[Mary Ann Mantell]], wife of Dr. [[Gideon Mantell]], found the first known [[iguanodon]] fossils among many others close to Cuckfield at [[Whitemans Green]], where a monument to him now stands though the quarry from where he acquired them is long gone.<ref name=BurtonThesis>{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alex|title=A Taphonomic Study of the Wealden Beds of Southern Britain|date=May 1998|location=Cambridge University|url=http://wealdentaphonomy.webs.com/cuckfield.htm|accessdate=10 October 2015|chapter=Cuckfield}} The author writes: It is also of note here that there is a great deal of material collected by Mantell recorded in museum catalogues simply as having come from Tilgate Forest. It is highly likely that all of this came from Cuckfield (S.D. Chapman, pers. comm.). The fact that this has not been specifically recorded may reflect the fact that in his publications Mantell was habitually no more specific, perhaps because he did not consider it necessary. By saying that his fossils had come from Tilgate Forest, Mantell was actually being quite specific about the stratigraphic unit and area they had come from. The strata exposed in the quarry at Whiteman\u2019s Green were collectively referred to by Mantell as \u2018Strata of Tilgate Forest\u2019.</ref><ref name=\"Dean\">{{cite book|last1=Dean|first1=Dennis R.|title=Gideon Mantell and the Discovery of Dinosaurs|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|quote=In actuality, however, his famous Tilgate Forest consisted of two adjacent quarries at Whiteman's Green just north of Cuckfield.}}</ref> He also features in the town's museum. Other attractions include the [[Elizabethan]] stately home, Cuckfield Park, to the west of the village. Cuckfield Park is reputedly haunted by its former resident Anne Pritchard Sergison, who was known to the locals as 'Wicked Dame Sergison', and who died in 1748.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lawrence, Ruth|title=Ghostly Stories from The Cuckfield : Sussex Living Magazine|url=http://sussexliving.com/ghostly-stories-from-cuckfield/|publisher=Sussex Living Magazine|accessdate=22 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140726062557/http://sussexliving.com/ghostly-stories-from-cuckfield/|archivedate=26 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] celebrations are held here.

Other endowments were added, but in 1589, the original endowment was leased at a perpetual rent of \u00a320.  In consequence in 1819, the schoolmaster had an income of a mere \u00a328.8s.0d.  In 1844, as a result of local discontent, the [[Court of Chancery]] made a scheme reorganising the school like a [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] and the existing National School (established in 1812) was discontinued.  The teaching of [[Latin]] and Greek were discontinued and the fees fixed at a maximum of a [[shilling]].  The teacher no longer had to be a [[clergyman]].\n\nIn 1886, the National Society gave \u00a315 and the school formally became a National School.  A proposal to rebuild the school between 1935 and 1950, and money collected for this was returned to the donors.  The school was reorganised again in 1964 under the [[Diocese of Chichester|Chichester Diocesan Board of Finance]].

It is highly likely that all of this came from Cuckfield (S.D. Chapman, pers. comm.). The fact that this has not been specifically recorded may reflect the fact that in his publications Mantell was habitually no more specific, perhaps because he did not consider it necessary. By saying that his fossils had come from Tilgate Forest, Mantell was actually being quite specific about the stratigraphic unit and area they had come from. The strata exposed in the quarry at Whiteman\u2019s Green were collectively referred to by Mantell as \u2018Strata of Tilgate Forest\u2019.</ref><ref name=\"Dean\">{{cite book|last1=Dean|first1=Dennis R.|title=Gideon Mantell and the Discovery of Dinosaurs|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|quote=In actuality, however, his famous Tilgate Forest consisted of two adjacent quarries at Whiteman's Green just north of Cuckfield.}}</ref> He also features in the town's museum.

In 1844, as a result of local discontent, the [[Court of Chancery]] made a scheme reorganising the school like a [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] and the existing National School (established in 1812) was discontinued.  The teaching of [[Latin]] and Greek were discontinued and the fees fixed at a maximum of a [[shilling]].

A proposal to rebuild the school between 1935 and 1950, and money collected for this was returned to the donors.  The school was reorganised again in 1964 under the [[Diocese of Chichester|Chichester Diocesan Board of Finance]].

{"title_page": "History of the Dallas Mavericks", "text_new": "{{Main article|Dallas Mavericks}}\n{{Duplication|dupe=Dallas Mavericks|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[Dallas Mavericks]] (also known as the Mavs) are a professional [[basketball]] team based in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], USA, belonging to the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. In their history, the Mavericks have won one NBA championship, three division titles, and two conference championships.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1979&ndash;1981: Beginnings ===\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:DallasMavericksoldlogo.png|thumb|left|200px|Dallas Mavericks Original Logo used from 1980 to 2001 (script logo used from 1991 to 2001). This logo was created by Texas professional graphic artist Patrick B. Stark]] -->\nIn 1979, businessman [[Don Carter (Businessman)|Don Carter]] and partner Norm Sonju requested the right to bring an NBA franchise to [[Dallas]]. The last professional basketball team in Dallas had been the Dallas Chaparrals of the [[American Basketball Association]], which moved to [[San Antonio]] in 1973 to become the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nAt the [[1980 NBA All-Star Game]], league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957&ndash;1962 television western ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' the name was chosen by the fans with 4600 postcards received beating ''Wranglers'' and ''Express''. [[James Garner]], who played the namesake character, was a member of the ownership group. There was some controversy at the time since the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] also uses the Mavericks nickname.  They joined the Midwest Division of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004&ndash;05 season]]. [[Dick Motta]], who had guided the [[Washington Bullets]] to the NBA Championship in [[1977\u201378 NBA season|1977&ndash;78]], was hired as the team's first [[head coach]]. He had a well-earned reputation of being a stern disciplinarian, but was also a great teacher of the game.\n\n[[Kiki Vandeweghe]] of [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the [[1980 NBA draft]], but Vandeweghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into the team's inaugural season. Vandeweghe was traded to the [[Denver Nuggets]], along with a first-round pick in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into [[Rolando Blackman]] in [[1981 NBA draft|1981]] and [[Sam Vincent (basketball)|Sam Vincent]] in [[1985 NBA draft|1985]].\n\n[[File:Don Carter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mavs' founder Don Carter.]]\nIn the Mavericks' debut game, taking place in the brand-new [[Reunion Arena]], the Mavericks stunned the Spurs, 103&ndash;92. But the Mavs started the season with a discouraging 6&ndash;40 record on their way to finishing 15&ndash;67. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a very important role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6'3\" guard [[Brad Davis (basketball)|Brad Davis]], who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the [[Continental Basketball Association]], was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had. But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his #15 jersey was retired.\n\nThe 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected 6'6\" forward [[Mark Aguirre]] with the first pick, 6'6\" guard [[Rolando Blackman]] 9th, and 6'7\" forward [[Jay Vincent]] 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavs career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the biggest difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28&ndash;54, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished on top of the [[Utah Jazz]].\n\n=== 1982&ndash;1985: Rise to power ===\nIn [[1982\u201383 NBA season|1982&ndash;83]], the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time.  At the [[1983 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]], they were 25&ndash;24 and had won 12 of their last 15 games.  They could not sustain this momentum, and finishing seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38\u201344 record signified a 10-game improvement from the previous season, and the fact that a third-year expansion team had even been in playoff contention at ''all'' was quite remarkable.\n\nMark Aguirre led the 1982&ndash;83 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. [[Jay Vincent]] and [[Rolando Blackman]] contributed 18.7 and 17.7 ppg, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game, and shot .845 from the line, 6th in the league. [[Derek Harper]] was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the [[1983 NBA draft]]. The 6'4\" guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' hard work paid off in [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983&ndash;84]] as they posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43&ndash;39 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game\u2014second in the league only to Utah's [[Adrian Dantley]].\n\nDallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and their first playoff trip was modestly successful as they defeated the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at [[Moody Coliseum]], as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks, was hosting a tennis tournament. The [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[1983\u201384 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984, because they owned [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cleveland]]'s first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward/center [[Sam Perkins]], a former [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heel]] with surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas.\n\nAbout this time, the [[Dallas Cowboys]], once one of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1\u201315 in [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989]]. The Mavs were hitting their stride at about the same time, and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex' team. The [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385]] team finished a game better than the previous year at 44\u201338. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, [[Sam Perkins]] made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the [[1985 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Mavs returned to the [[1985 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1985]], but were not as successful as they had been the previous year. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the [[1984\u201385 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season.\n\n=== 1985&ndash;1988: A true contender ===\nDallas had the eighth pick in the [[1985 NBA draft]]\u2014again due to a trade with the Cavaliers\u2014and drafted German-born forward [[Detlef Schrempf]] out of [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]]. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center [[Kurt Nimphius]] to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for center [[James Donaldson (basketball)|James Donaldson]], who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991&ndash;92 season]]. This allowed the Mavericks to have the steady hand at center that had been lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson would represent the only All-Star center in Dallas Maverick history.\n\n[[Rolando Blackman]] represented the Mavericks in the [[1986 NBA All-Star Game]], hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985&ndash;86 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining them their third straight playoff appearance. They defeated [[1985\u201386 Utah Jazz season|Utah]] three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the [[1985\u201386 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or less, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] center [[Roy Tarpley]] with the seventh overall pick, who would go on to become a very talented\u2014but troubled\u2014member of the roster.\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986&ndash;87]] Mavericks team had their most successful regular-season to date, going 55&ndash;27 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the [[1986\u201387 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]] by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing in Game 4 in [[Seattle]]. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. [[John MacLeod (basketball)|John MacLeod]], who had led the [[Phoenix Suns]] to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement.\n\nThe [[1987\u201388 NBA season]] saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season\u2014finishing 53&ndash;29 and losing their Midwest Division title to the [[Denver Nuggets]]\u2014but it was another successful year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the [[1988 NBA All-Star Game]], the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and [[Rolando Blackman]] scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the [[NBA Sixth Man Award]] with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the [[Houston Rockets]] in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion [[1987\u201388 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] between them and their first-ever trip to the [[1988 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, but in the end the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.\n\n=== 1988&ndash;1990: Injuries sting Mavs ===\nDespite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured [[patella]] tendon on March 10, 1989 and missed the rest of the season as a result. The Mavericks were left undermanned, demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38&ndash;44 record, losing the eighth and final playoff seed in the Western Conference via tiebreaker to the [[Denver Nuggets]]. It was their first losing season since 1982&ndash;83\u2014which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.\n\nThe Mavericks returned to the [[1990 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] with a 47\u201335 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for [[driving while intoxicated]] and resisting arrest. The team started 5\u20136 and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach [[Richie Adubato]]. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs, but went down rather meekly to the [[1989\u201390 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and last playoff appearance until 2001.\n\n=== 1990&ndash;1993: Free-falling ===\nThe team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]] starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire\u2014[[Rodney McCray (basketball)|Rodney McCray]], [[Fat Lever]] and [[Alex English]]\u2014were all in the twilight of their careers. In March 9 it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28\u201354, the worst in the NBA, falling behind even the second-year [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Orlando Magic]]. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of [[driving while intoxicated]] and was suspended again by the NBA.\n \t\t\nIt got even worse in [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392]]. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season\u2014hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22\u201360 record.\n \t\t\nIn [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992&ndash;93]] the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading [[Rolando Blackman]]\u2014who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer\u2014to the [[New York Knicks]] for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. [[Herb Williams]] joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992\u201393 season. Derek Harper was the team's sole bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game.\n\n=== 1992&ndash;1994: Flirting with futility ===\nThe Mavericks selected [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] guard [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1992 NBA draft]], but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], a year that was also ruined by trades, a coaching change and injuries. The Mavericks started 2&ndash;27 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with [[Gar Heard]]. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9&ndash;73 by the [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1972&ndash;73]] [[1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs managed to rally, closing the season with a 7\u201314 mark, including two straight wins to end the season. That year the Mavericks finished 11\u201371 which was the 2nd worst record in NBA history.\n \t\t\nDallas selected [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] forward [[Jamal Mashburn]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1993 NBA draft]] and hired [[Quinn Buckner]] as coach, but the team's progress was minimal. Part of the problem was that Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, [[Bobby Knight]]. The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style, and started 1\u201323. By the end of January they were 3\u201340, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5\u20139 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13\u201369. It was still by far the worst record in the league, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record.  They did, however manage to tie the NBA's ''single-season'' record for consecutive losses at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|20 games]] (since broken).\n \t\t\nBuckner was fired after garnering the worst full-season record for a rookie head coach\u2014a record that only lasted two years, until [[Bill Hanzlik]] broke it with the [[Denver Nuggets]].  The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the #2 pick in the [[1994 NBA draft]], and picked up [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|Cal]] point guard [[Jason Kidd]], giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn and Kidd which would become known as \"The Three Js\".\n\n=== 1994&ndash;1996: Three Js give Dallas hope ===\nThe addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and even led the league in triple-doubles. [[Roy Tarpley]] was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points, but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward [[Popeye Jones]] had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.\n \t\t\nThe Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. They jumped to 36\u201346, 10th in the Western Conference and only five games behind the [[1994\u201395 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the biggest one-year improvement in the team's history, and the highest in the NBA that season. Many expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA Playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4\u20130 start, the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] was a disappointment in about every conceivable way. For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy\u2014he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule.\n \t\t\nThe team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson, bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had any trouble establishing his individual stardom. Jackson led the team in scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers and was the only Mav to start in all 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game, and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. [[George McCloud]], who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.\n\nOverall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. But that particular statistic is more indicative of the Mavs' desperation to get points from ''somewhere'' than of how well they did as a team. The Mavs finished 26\u201356, fifth in the Midwest Division and 33 games out of first place. At season's end, Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach [[Jim Cleamons]]. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by [[H. Ross Perot, Jr.]]\n\n=== 1996&ndash;2001: Dirk/Cuban comes to town ===\nThe [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]] was a year of transition for the Mavericks, as they basically re-designed their ''entire'' team; 27 different players saw action for this Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over, only rookie forward [[Samaki Walker]] remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, [[Loren Meyer]] and [[Tony Dumas]] were traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for guards [[Michael Finley]] and [[Sam Cassell]] and forward [[A. C. Green]]. By far the most important of these acquisitions was Finley who, after his first half-season in Dallas, would go on to average over or near 20 ppg for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game, and even played in each of the Mavs' games until the 2004\u201305 season.\n \t\t\n[[Don Nelson]] was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7, and it didn't take him long to leave his own mark on the team. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavs had released [[Fred Roberts]] and [[Oliver Miller]] and traded Jamal Mashburn to the [[Miami Heat]] for forwards [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] and [[Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp]] and guard [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sasha Danilovi\u0107]]. This particular trade didn't really pan out for the Mavs. Thomas did not play in 1996\u201397, and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the [[New York Knicks]]. Danilovi\u0107 played in 13 games for the Mavs before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna of the Italian League, and M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA.\n \t\t\n[[Chris Gatling]] was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the largest two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Chris Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud and [[Eric Montross]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for 7'6\" center [[Shawn Bradley]], forward [[Ed O'Bannon]] and guards [[Khalid Reeves]] and [[Robert Pack (basketball)|Robert Pack]]. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell went on to become a consistent floor leader and Jackson, Gatling and McCloud all continued to be solid contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any sort of time in Dallas and would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for the Mavs and giving them solid numbers in terms of blocked shots.\n\nUndrafted rookie guard [[Erick Strickland]] was a pleasant surprise for the Mavs as he averaged 10.6 ppg. He, along with Finley and Bradley, were expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any sort of team chemistry in 1996\u201397, and the Mavericks finished 24\u201358. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997\u201398, despite a poor record of 20\u201362, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time, as they beat the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], [[New York Knicks]], [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]]. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17\u20132 run to force overtime, where they won 104\u201397.  Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach.\n \t\t\nIn the [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout|lockout-shortened]] [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399]] season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19\u201331 record, but Michael Finley and [[Gary Trent]] put up solid numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15\u201310) since 1989\u201390. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and point guard [[Steve Nash]], two seemingly unspectacular moves which would make a great impact in the future. In the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|following season]] the [[1999\u20132000 Dallas Mavericks season|team]] finally \"clicked\" and started to win on a consistent basis. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989\u201390. He was greatly helped by Nowitzki, who finally \"arrived\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat.\n\nOn January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder [[Mark Cuban]] for $285 million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed [[Dennis Rodman]] to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas and garnered the team lots of press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.\n \t\t\nIn [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]], the Mavericks improved further and finished with an impressive 53\u201329 record, fueled by an impressive offensive triangle of Nowitzki, Finley and Nash. The Mavs made a blockbuster trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent [[Hubert Davis]], [[Christian Laettner]], [[Courtney Alexander]], [[Loy Vaught]], and [[Etan Thomas]] to the [[Washington Wizards]] for [[Juwan Howard]], [[Calvin Booth]] and [[Obinna Ekezie]]. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, [[Wang Zhizhi]] became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with the Eduardo N\u00e1jera, bringing Dallas a decent international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. In the [[2001 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the Mavericks won the first round against the [[Utah Jazz]], advancing to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though they would be eliminated by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in seriously contending for an NBA title. This was also the last season in the old [[Reunion Arena]] before making the move to the modern [[American Airlines Center]].\n\n=== 2001&ndash;2004: \"Big Three\" of Nash, Nowitzki, and Finley ===\nThese years also saw Nowitzki win the first two of his five consecutive [[Euroscar Award]]s as the top player in Europe, in 2002 and 2003. (Note that this award is presented at the end of a calendar year, as opposed to the end of the season as in the NBA awards.)\n\n==== 2001\u201302 ====\nThe [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001&ndash;02 season]] was a great season for the Mavericks, with a 57\u201325 record and many sellout crowds in the [[American Airlines Center]]. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo. In addition, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent [[Juwan Howard]], [[Tim Hardaway]] and [[Donnell Harvey]] to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Tariq Abdul-Wahad]] and [[Avery Johnson]], the Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the [[Utah Jazz]]'s star [[Karl Malone]]. The Mavericks swept the [[Kevin Garnett]]-led [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] [[2002 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]] but lost again in the second round, this time to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n\n==== 2002\u201303 ====\nBut it was only in the next season when the Mavericks finally broke through. They started the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]] with a 14\u20130 record which was 1 shy of tying the NBA record set by the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] [[1993\u201394 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] (15\u20130). The Mavericks finished with a 60\u201322 record in the regular season, astonishing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. The \"Big Three\" Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash were a 100-point-game waiting to happen and led the Mavericks into the Conference Finals against the [[Tim Duncan]]-led [[San Antonio Spurs]]. However, with the series tied 1\u20131 Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out of the rest of the series. This worsened the Mavs depth problem in the front court (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series) and the Spurs took the series in 6 games.\n\n==== 2003\u201304 ====\nIn [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]], two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired [[Antawn Jamison]], [[Danny Fortson]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch]] and [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] from [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]] in exchange for Nick Van Exel, [[Evan Eschmeyer]], Popeye Jones, [[Avery Johnson]] and [[Antoine Rigaudeau]]. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills and Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch to Boston for [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Tony Delk]]. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks easily qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the best offensive team in the NBA. Notable were two rookies, [[Josh Howard]] and [[Marquis Daniels]], who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly [[2004 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]], losing in the first round to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[Sacramento Kings]], a team which clearly played better defense. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy.\n\n=== 2004&ndash;2006: Roster changes ===\n\n==== 2004\u201305 ====\nThe [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004&ndash;05 season]] brought in blockbuster trades which (among others) brought in burly center [[Erick Dampier]], combo guard [[Jason Terry]], speedy rookie point guard [[Devin Harris]], scoring machine [[Jerry Stackhouse]], and defensive stalwart [[Alan Henderson]]. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired [[Keith Van Horn]] for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson resigned and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the defense of the Mavericks became stronger and they easily qualified for [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] with an impressive 58\u201324 record. The Mavericks defeated the [[Houston Rockets]] in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the [[Phoenix Suns]] 4\u20132, led by former Maverick star [[Steve Nash]].\n\n==== 2005\u201306: First finals appearance ====\n{{Main article|2005\u201306 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nPrior to the [[2005 NBA draft]], the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \"Allan Houston Rule\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id%3D3286%26NAV%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 23, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920153034/http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id=3286&NAV=1 |archivedate=September 20, 2014 }}</ref> Under this rule, the [[Orlando Magic]] waived [[Doug Christie (basketball)|Doug Christie]], who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed [[Darrell Armstrong]], and introduced Christie, [[DeSagana Diop]], [[Rawle Marshall]], and [[Josh Powell]] as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was very limited amidst a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and [[Mr. Europa]], a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural [[FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award|FIBA Europe Player of the Year]].\n\nUp until the very end of the season, the Mavericks would be toe-to-toe with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for the crown of the Southwest Division as well as the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60\u201322 record, with [[Avery Johnson]] winning [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|NBA Coach of the Year]] honors. [[2006 NBA Playoffs|In the playoffs]], they swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the Conference Finals against former teammate [[Steve Nash]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series, as they defeated the [[Phoenix Suns]] in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals on June 3, 2006 in the [[US Airways Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.\n\n{{Main article|2006 NBA Finals}}\nIn the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the [[2005\u201306 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], held home-court advantage and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard [[Dwyane Wade]]. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the last possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The [[tragic flaw|tragic figure]] was [[Josh Howard]], who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than halfcourt for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by [[Alonzo Mourning]]'s five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] was fined a total of $250,000 for \"several acts of misconduct\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5.  Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room.  [[Jerry Stackhouse]] was suspended for Game 5 after fouling [[Shaquille O'Neal]] on a breakaway dunk attempt.  The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs.\n\nThe Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the Finals after taking a 2\u20130 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead with under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22\u20137 in the momentum-changing 98\u201396 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's greatest postseason comeback in team history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html |title=NBA.com: A Total Turnaround |publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017120059/http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html |archive-date=2015-10-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== 2006&ndash;2010: First round exits ===\nAfter a disappointing end to their magnificent playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a rocky 0\u20134 start, the Mavericks then went on a historic run and posted a 52\u20135 record over their next 57 games. They finished out the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|regular season]] with a record of 67\u201315, good enough to be tied for 6th place all-time, 1st in the league and the #1 seed in the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference playoffs]]. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season, and was named the NBA MVP at its end. [[Josh Howard]] was named to the all-star team.\n\nHowever, the first place Mavericks were defeated in 6 games by the 8th seeded [[2006\u201307 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]], which is regarded by some as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history, while others don't consider it an upset at all.  The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting matchups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. Former NBA champion and All-Star legend Bill Russell stated in his NBA.com blog that he didn't consider it to be an upset, since Golden State was 3&ndash;0 vs. the Mavericks in the regular season. On the year, the Mavericks went 67\u201312 against the rest of the league and 0\u20133 against Golden State, giving credibility to Russell's belief that the Warriors' win shouldn't have surprised NBA fans. Ironically, the Warriors were coached by [[Don Nelson]], the immediate past manager/coach of the Mavericks until he stepped down at the end of 2005\u201306, and he had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006\u201307 midseason\n\nNowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's stunning first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony.  Traditionally, the MVP award is given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second round of the playoffs.  But it has been believed that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted in the playoffs.\n\n==== 2007\u201308 ====\n{{Main article|2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season}}\n[[File:Jason Kidd drives Feb 24 2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kidd drives to the basket during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.]]\nThe Mavericks dealt [[Devin Harris]], two first round picks and others in a blockbuster trade to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for veteran all-star [[Jason Kidd]] and other role players, Cuban also tried to sign the free agent [[Kevin Garnett]] unsuccessfully. The Mavericks were 3 and 11 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the [[2008\u201309 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in a 111\u201386 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the [[2008\u201309 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in a 105\u201398 win on April 6. This win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] 97&ndash;94 on April 10.  This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their 8th consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated once again, by the \nNew Orleans Hornets 4&ndash;1 on the road, 99&ndash;94.\n\nJust one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as Head Coach of the Dallas Mavericks. On May 9, 2008, [[Rick Carlisle]] was hired as the head coach.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050308dnspomavs.c4fc389e.html Dallas Mavericks, Carlisle seem to like potential match | Dallas Mavericks News | Sports News | Dallas Morning News]</ref><ref>[http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050808dnspomavslede.da0f12fa.html Deal with Dallas Mavericks, Carlisle could come today | WFAA.com | Sports: Basketball: Mavericks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108022515/http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050808dnspomavslede.da0f12fa.html |date=2009-01-08 }}</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3389463 ESPN \u2013 Sources: Carlisle, Mavs reach agreement on 4-year deal \u2013 NBA]</ref><ref name=\"Mavs sign Carlisle\">[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jl2w-wzycOVHOI8JdZ8VAB4dLbVw AFP: Mavericks reach four-year coaching deal with Carlisle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514114056/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jl2w-wzycOVHOI8JdZ8VAB4dLbVw |date=2008-05-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Carlisle_signs051008.html |title=MAVERICKS: Official release: Rick Carlisle named coach |publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514120414/http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Carlisle_signs051008.html |archive-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== 2008\u201309 ====\n{{Main article|2008\u201309 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nAfter getting off to a rocky start at 2\u20137, the Mavericks eventually found themselves with the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2009]]. This was after going 50-32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about three to four weeks earlier, weren't even sure if they were going to make the eighth and final spot. A run of 5\u20131 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] also entered the postseason with a streak of 25 consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, [[2008\u201309 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nThe Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 105\u201397 in San Antonio. The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was just trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they couldn't do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106\u201393. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference Semi-finals for the first time since 2006.\n\nIn the semifinals, they would face the two-seeded [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]], who were fresh off an easy 4\u20131 series win against the [[2008\u201309 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]], including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks would stay close with the Nuggets in the first three quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter where [[Carmelo Anthony]] and the Nuggets would finally wake up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas seemed to be going on to win, leading by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a cold-blooded three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106\u2013105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy, because Maverick guard Antoine Wright clearly fouled Anthony, but since there is no replay used in the NBA, the Mavericks suffered a heart breaking game 3 loss. It was later announced by the league that the referees made the wrong call, but despite this the Mavericks still faced a 3\u20130 deficit in the series.\n\n44 points in Game 4 from Dirk Nowitzki would save the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, the series in Denver's favor, 3\u20131. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as they would be ousted by a score of 124\u2013110. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team.\n\n==== 2009\u201310: Return to the elites ====\n{{Main article|2009\u201310 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nAfter a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the future construction of the team. They began by re-signing [[Jason Kidd]] to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a move to compound their age problem, by trading for former all-star small forward [[Shawn Marion]]. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swing-man Antoine Wright along with defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired burly center [[Nathan Jawai]], and [[Kris Humphries]]. Many analysts{{Who|date=April 2010}} viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, being that it countered their age issues, while simultaneously providing them with more depth on the bench. The Mavericks also added veteran forwards [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]], [[Drew Gooden]], and [[Quinton Ross]].\n\n[[File:Jason Terry.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jason Terry.]]\nThese moves proved successful, because after dropping the season opener to the [[2009\u201310 Washington Wizards season|Wizards]], the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the [[2009\u201310 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], [[2009\u201310 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], [[2009\u201310 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and the [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] which was something that the Mavericks had been unable to do the last two seasons.\n\nA day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a block-buster deal. The trade sent [[Josh Howard]], [[James Singleton (basketball)|James Singleton]], and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for [[Caron Butler]], [[Brendan Haywood]], and [[Deshawn Stevenson]]. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Many NBA analysts{{Who|date=April 2010}} felt that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128\u201378. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 83\u201377. The Mavericks finished the season with an impressive 55\u201327 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.\n\nDuring the playoffs though, this optimism proved to be short lived, because after winning game one 100\u201394, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97\u201387, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status.\n\n==== 2010 Offseason ====\nAfter yet another first round melt-down, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early offseason. The first order of business for [[Mark Cuban]] and the Mavericks was to re-sign [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Dirk agreed to a 4-year deal worth $80M. On July 13, the Dallas Mavericks after losing the opportunity to sign [[LeBron James]], [[Dwyane Wade]], and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] acquired centers [[Tyson Chandler]] and [[Alexis Ajinca]] from the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for center [[Erick Dampier]], forward [[Eduardo N\u00e1jera]] and guard [[Matt Carroll (basketball)|Matt Carroll]].\n\n=== 2010\u20132011 season: Championship season ===\nThe 2010\u201311 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks momentum, combined with the team's second-leading scorer [[Caron Butler]] suffering a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later, raising questions of if the Mavericks could make it 11 straight 50-win seasons. The Mavericks then went on to drop their next seven games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. This however would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games, and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense, and consequently they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010\u201311 campaign, mostly in part{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team). The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the 3rd seed, with a 57\u201325 record. However, due to the Mavericks reputation as playoff chokers, many{{Who|date=September 2011}} predicted them to be ousted in the first round against the six-seeded [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Yahoo! Sports analyst [[Adrian Wojnarowski]] even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers.\n\nThe Mavs entered the [[2011 NBA Playoffs|post-season]] as the 3rd seed and despite toting a 57\u201325 record, were predicted by the media to be ousted by the injury-riddled Trail Blazers. The Mavericks won games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion, however upon their arrival to the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks were going to allow another impressive regular season to go down the drain.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the Western Conference Semifinals. This series was the first time that [[Kobe Bryant]] had met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; that however did not prove to be the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, and took a two games to none lead heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98\u201392 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect exclamation mark,{{According to whom|date=September 2011}} crushing the Lakers in game 4 by a score of 122\u201386. In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the Western Conference Finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking game 1 by a score of 121\u2013112. The Thunder then responded with 106\u2013100 victory in game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in game 4, to take the series in five games. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history, and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the [[Miami Heat]].\n\nThe Mavs entered the 2010\u20132011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's \"Big Three\" coming together during the course of the 2010\u201311 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92\u201384, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88\u201373, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22\u20135 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88\u201386. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat with a 112\u2013103 victory, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105\u201395 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility.\n\n=== 2011&ndash;2018: Post-championship decline ===\nThe following season was cut to 66 games due to a [[2011 NBA lockout|lockout]], which meant the Mavericks had to wait until [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day]] to raise their first championship banner. During the brief offseason owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting key contributors Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the [[New York Knicks]], Stevenson joined the [[New Jersey Nets]], Barea went to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], and Butler joined the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] [[Lamar Odom]] via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans [[Vince Carter]] and [[Delonte West]].\n\nThe Mavericks raised their championship banner prior to their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day, but in what would soon become a mirror image of the [[2006\u201307 Miami Heat season|2006\u201307 Heat]]'s eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105\u201394 loss, marking Dallas's first regular season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things didn't get better for Dallas after starting the season 0\u20133, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks started off on a high note, winning 13 of 18 games in January, but they limped to a 22\u201322 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing 7th with a 36\u201330 record, their lowest finish since the 2007\u201308 season. Nowitzki normed just 21.6 points, 6 rebounds and 45.7% shooting, his lowest numbers since the 2000\u201301 season. Meanwhile, Odom proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, and they decided to sit him out for the final two months of the season.\n\nIn a rematch from last year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the [[2012 NBA Playoffs]]. Games 1 and 2 went down the wire, but the Mavericks' fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant bailed the Thunder out with a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks fell flat throughout the game and suffered a humiliating 95\u201379 defeat to fall behind 0\u20133. With their backs behind the wall in Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but [[James Harden (basketball)|James Harden]]'s 15-point fourth quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103\u201397 win and eliminated the Mavericks from contention. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series, and became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006\u201307 Heat and the 1956\u201357 Philadelphia Warriors.\n\n=== 2018&ndash;present: The Luka Don\u010di\u0107 era ===\n\nThe Mavericks finished the 2017&ndash;18 season with a 24&ndash;58 record, their worst in twenty years. In the [[2018 NBA draft]], the Mavericks were awarded the fifth pick. With their eyes on Slovenian guard [[Luka Don\u010di\u0107]], a projected top-three pick, the Mavericks worked out a deal with the [[Atlanta Hawks]], who owned the third pick. The Hawks agreed to draft Don\u010di\u0107 for Dallas, while the Mavericks drafted point guard [[Trae Young]] for Atlanta. The two teams traded the draft rights to their selections, with the Mavericks packaging in a top-5 protected 2019 first round pick.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.dallasmavericks.com/ Dallas Mavericks official website]\n* [http://www.dallasbasketball.com/ DallasBasketball.com website]\n* [http://nbahoopsonline.com/teams/DallasMavericks/Index.html Dallas Mavericks History] NBA Hoops Online\n\n{{NBA team histories navbox}}\n{{Dallas Mavericks}}\n{{Dallas Mavericks seasons}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Dallas Mavericks}}\n[[Category:Dallas Mavericks]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association history by team|Dallas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Main article|Dallas Mavericks}}\n{{Duplication|dupe=Dallas Mavericks|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[Dallas Mavericks]] (also known as the Mavs) are a professional [[basketball]] team based in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], USA, belonging to the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. In their history, the Mavericks have won one NBA championship, three division titles, and two conference championships.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1979&ndash;1981: Beginnings ===\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:DallasMavericksoldlogo.png|thumb|left|200px|Dallas Mavericks Original Logo used from 1980 to 2001 (script logo used from 1991 to 2001). This logo was created by Texas professional graphic artist Patrick B. Stark]] -->\nIn 1979, businessman [[Don Carter (Businessman)|Don Carter]] and partner Norm Sonju requested the right to bring an NBA franchise to [[Dallas]]. The last professional basketball team in Dallas had been the Dallas Chaparrals of the [[American Basketball Association]], which moved to [[San Antonio]] in 1973 to become the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nAt the [[1980 NBA All-Star Game]], league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957&ndash;1962 television western ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' the name was chosen by the fans with 4600 postcards received beating ''Wranglers'' and ''Express''. [[James Garner]], who played the namesake character, was a member of the ownership group. There was some controversy at the time since the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] also uses the Mavericks nickname.  They joined the Midwest Division of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004&ndash;05 season]]. [[Dick Motta]], who had guided the [[Washington Bullets]] to the NBA Championship in [[1977\u201378 NBA season|1977&ndash;78]], was hired as the team's first [[head coach]]. He had a well-earned reputation of being a stern disciplinarian, but was also a great teacher of the game.\n\n[[Kiki Vandeweghe]] of [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the [[1980 NBA draft]], but Vandeweghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into the team's inaugural season. Vandeweghe was traded to the [[Denver Nuggets]], along with a first-round pick in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into [[Rolando Blackman]] in [[1981 NBA draft|1981]] and [[Sam Vincent (basketball)|Sam Vincent]] in [[1985 NBA draft|1985]].\n\n[[File:Don Carter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mavs' founder Don Carter.]]\nIn the Mavericks' debut game, taking place in the brand-new [[Reunion Arena]], the Mavericks stunned the Spurs, 103&ndash;92. But the Mavs started the season with a discouraging 6&ndash;40 record on their way to finishing 15&ndash;67. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a very important role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6'3\" guard [[Brad Davis (basketball)|Brad Davis]], who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the [[Continental Basketball Association]], was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had. But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his #15 jersey was retired.\n\nThe 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected 6'6\" forward [[Mark Aguirre]] with the first pick, 6'6\" guard [[Rolando Blackman]] 9th, and 6'7\" forward [[Jay Vincent]] 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavs career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the biggest difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28&ndash;54, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished on top of the [[Utah Jazz]].\n\n=== 1982&ndash;1985: Rise to power ===\nIn [[1982\u201383 NBA season|1982&ndash;83]], the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time.  At the [[1983 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]], they were 25&ndash;24 and had won 12 of their last 15 games.  They could not sustain this momentum, and finishing seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38\u201344 record signified a 10-game improvement from the previous season, and the fact that a third-year expansion team had even been in playoff contention at ''all'' was quite remarkable.\n\nMark Aguirre led the 1982&ndash;83 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. [[Jay Vincent]] and [[Rolando Blackman]] contributed 18.7 and 17.7 ppg, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game, and shot .845 from the line, 6th in the league. [[Derek Harper]] was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the [[1983 NBA draft]]. The 6'4\" guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' hard work paid off in [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983&ndash;84]] as they posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43&ndash;39 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game\u2014second in the league only to Utah's [[Adrian Dantley]].\n\nDallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and their first playoff trip was modestly successful as they defeated the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at [[Moody Coliseum]], as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks, was hosting a tennis tournament. The [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[1983\u201384 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984, because they owned [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cleveland]]'s first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward/center [[Sam Perkins]], a former [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heel]] with surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas.\n\nAbout this time, the [[Dallas Cowboys]], once one of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1\u201315 in [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989]]. The Mavs were hitting their stride at about the same time, and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex' team. The [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385]] team finished a game better than the previous year at 44\u201338. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, [[Sam Perkins]] made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the [[1985 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Mavs returned to the [[1985 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1985]], but were not as successful as they had been the previous year. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the [[1984\u201385 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season.\n\n=== 1985&ndash;1988: A true contender ===\nDallas had the eighth pick in the [[1985 NBA draft]]\u2014again due to a trade with the Cavaliers\u2014and drafted German-born forward [[Detlef Schrempf]] out of [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]]. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center [[Kurt Nimphius]] to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for center [[James Donaldson (basketball)|James Donaldson]], who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991&ndash;92 season]]. This allowed the Mavericks to have the steady hand at center that had been lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson would represent the only All-Star center in Dallas Maverick history.\n\n[[Rolando Blackman]] represented the Mavericks in the [[1986 NBA All-Star Game]], hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985&ndash;86 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining them their third straight playoff appearance. They defeated [[1985\u201386 Utah Jazz season|Utah]] three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the [[1985\u201386 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or less, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] center [[Roy Tarpley]] with the seventh overall pick, who would go on to become a very talented\u2014but troubled\u2014member of the roster.\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986&ndash;87]] Mavericks team had their most successful regular-season to date, going 55&ndash;27 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the [[1986\u201387 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]] by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing in Game 4 in [[Seattle]]. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. [[John MacLeod (basketball)|John MacLeod]], who had led the [[Phoenix Suns]] to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement.\n\nThe [[1987\u201388 NBA season]] saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season\u2014finishing 53&ndash;29 and losing their Midwest Division title to the [[Denver Nuggets]]\u2014but it was another successful year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the [[1988 NBA All-Star Game]], the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and [[Rolando Blackman]] scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the [[NBA Sixth Man Award]] with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the [[Houston Rockets]] in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion [[1987\u201388 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] between them and their first-ever trip to the [[1988 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, but in the end the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.\n\n=== 1988&ndash;1990: Injuries sting Mavs ===\nDespite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured [[patella]] tendon on March 10, 1989 and missed the rest of the season as a result. The Mavericks were left undermanned, demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38&ndash;44 record, losing the eighth and final playoff seed in the Western Conference via tiebreaker to the [[Denver Nuggets]]. It was their first losing season since 1982&ndash;83\u2014which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.\n\nThe Mavericks returned to the [[1990 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] with a 47\u201335 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for [[driving while intoxicated]] and resisting arrest. The team started 5\u20136 and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach [[Richie Adubato]]. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs, but went down rather meekly to the [[1989\u201390 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and last playoff appearance until 2001.\n\n=== 1990&ndash;1993: Free-falling ===\nThe team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]] starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire\u2014[[Rodney McCray (basketball)|Rodney McCray]], [[Fat Lever]] and [[Alex English]]\u2014were all in the twilight of their careers. In March 9 it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28\u201354, the worst in the NBA, falling behind even the second-year [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Orlando Magic]]. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of [[driving while intoxicated]] and was suspended again by the NBA.\n \t\t\nIt got even worse in [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392]]. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season\u2014hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22\u201360 record.\n \t\t\nIn [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992&ndash;93]] the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading [[Rolando Blackman]]\u2014who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer\u2014to the [[New York Knicks]] for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. [[Herb Williams]] joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992\u201393 season. Derek Harper was the team's sole bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game.\n\n=== 1992&ndash;1994: Flirting with futility ===\nThe Mavericks selected [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] guard [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1992 NBA draft]], but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], a year that was also ruined by trades, a coaching change and injuries. The Mavericks started 2&ndash;27 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with [[Gar Heard]]. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9&ndash;73 by the [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1972&ndash;73]] [[1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs managed to rally, closing the season with a 7\u201314 mark, including two straight wins to end the season. That year the Mavericks finished 11\u201371 which was the 2nd worst record in NBA history.\n \t\t\nDallas selected [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] forward [[Jamal Mashburn]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1993 NBA draft]] and hired [[Quinn Buckner]] as coach, but the team's progress was minimal. Part of the problem was that Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, [[Bobby Knight]]. The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style, and started 1\u201323. By the end of January they were 3\u201340, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5\u20139 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13\u201369. It was still by far the worst record in the league, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record.  They did, however manage to tie the NBA's ''single-season'' record for consecutive losses at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|20 games]] (since broken).\n \t\t\nBuckner was fired after garnering the worst full-season record for a rookie head coach\u2014a record that only lasted two years, until [[Bill Hanzlik]] broke it with the [[Denver Nuggets]].  The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the #2 pick in the [[1994 NBA draft]], and picked up [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|Cal]] point guard [[Jason Kidd]], giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn and Kidd which would become known as \"The Three Js\".\n\n=== 1994&ndash;1996: Three Js give Dallas hope ===\nThe addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and even led the league in triple-doubles. [[Roy Tarpley]] was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points, but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward [[Popeye Jones]] had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.\n \t\t\nThe Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. They jumped to 36\u201346, 10th in the Western Conference and only five games behind the [[1994\u201395 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the biggest one-year improvement in the team's history, and the highest in the NBA that season. Many expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA Playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4\u20130 start, the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] was a disappointment in about every conceivable way. For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy\u2014he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule.\n \t\t\nThe team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson, bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had any trouble establishing his individual stardom. Jackson led the team in scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers and was the only Mav to start in all 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game, and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. [[George McCloud]], who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.\n\nOverall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. But that particular statistic is more indicative of the Mavs' desperation to get points from ''somewhere'' than of how well they did as a team. The Mavs finished 26\u201356, fifth in the Midwest Division and 33 games out of first place. At season's end, Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach [[Jim Cleamons]]. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by [[H. Ross Perot, Jr.]]\n\n=== 1996&ndash;2001: Dirk/Cuban comes to town ===\nThe [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]] was a year of transition for the Mavericks, as they basically re-designed their ''entire'' team; 27 different players saw action for this Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over, only rookie forward [[Samaki Walker]] remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, [[Loren Meyer]] and [[Tony Dumas]] were traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for guards [[Michael Finley]] and [[Sam Cassell]] and forward [[A. C. Green]]. By far the most important of these acquisitions was Finley who, after his first half-season in Dallas, would go on to average over or near 20 ppg for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game, and even played in each of the Mavs' games until the 2004\u201305 season.\n \t\t\n[[Don Nelson]] was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7, and it didn't take him long to leave his own mark on the team. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavs had released [[Fred Roberts]] and [[Oliver Miller]] and traded Jamal Mashburn to the [[Miami Heat]] for forwards [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] and [[Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp]] and guard [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sasha Danilovi\u0107]]. This particular trade didn't really pan out for the Mavs. Thomas did not play in 1996\u201397, and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the [[New York Knicks]]. Danilovi\u0107 played in 13 games for the Mavs before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna of the Italian League, and M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA.\n \t\t\n[[Chris Gatling]] was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the largest two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Chris Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud and [[Eric Montross]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for 7'6\" center [[Shawn Bradley]], forward [[Ed O'Bannon]] and guards [[Khalid Reeves]] and [[Robert Pack (basketball)|Robert Pack]]. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell went on to become a consistent floor leader and Jackson, Gatling and McCloud all continued to be solid contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any sort of time in Dallas and would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for the Mavs and giving them solid numbers in terms of blocked shots.\n\nUndrafted rookie guard [[Erick Strickland]] was a pleasant surprise for the Mavs as he averaged 10.6 ppg. He, along with Finley and Bradley, were expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any sort of team chemistry in 1996\u201397, and the Mavericks finished 24\u201358. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997\u201398, despite a poor record of 20-62, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time, as they beat the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], [[New York Knicks]], [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]]. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17-2 run to force overtime, where they won 104-97.  Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach.\n \t\t\nIn the [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout|lockout-shortened]] [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399]] season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19\u201331 record, but Michael Finley and [[Gary Trent]] put up solid numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15\u201310) since 1989\u201390. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and point guard [[Steve Nash]], two seemingly unspectacular moves which would make a great impact in the future. In the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|following season]] the [[1999\u20132000 Dallas Mavericks season|team]] finally \"clicked\" and started to win on a consistent basis. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989\u201390. He was greatly helped by Nowitzki, who finally \"arrived\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat.\n\nOn January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder [[Mark Cuban]] for $285 million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed [[Dennis Rodman]] to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas and garnered the team lots of press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.\n \t\t\nIn [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]], the Mavericks improved further and finished with an impressive 53\u201329 record, fueled by an impressive offensive triangle of Nowitzki, Finley and Nash. The Mavs made a blockbuster trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent [[Hubert Davis]], [[Christian Laettner]], [[Courtney Alexander]], [[Loy Vaught]], and [[Etan Thomas]] to the [[Washington Wizards]] for [[Juwan Howard]], [[Calvin Booth]] and [[Obinna Ekezie]]. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, [[Wang Zhizhi]] became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with the Eduardo N\u00e1jera, bringing Dallas a decent international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. In the [[2001 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the Mavericks won the first round against the [[Utah Jazz]], advancing to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though they would be eliminated by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in seriously contending for an NBA title. This was also the last season in the old [[Reunion Arena]] before making the move to the modern [[American Airlines Center]].\n\n=== 2001&ndash;2004: \"Big Three\" of Nash, Nowitzki, and Finley ===\nThese years also saw Nowitzki win the first two of his five consecutive [[Euroscar Award]]s as the top player in Europe, in 2002 and 2003. (Note that this award is presented at the end of a calendar year, as opposed to the end of the season as in the NBA awards.)\n\n==== 2001\u201302 ====\nThe [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001&ndash;02 season]] was a great season for the Mavericks, with a 57\u201325 record and many sellout crowds in the [[American Airlines Center]]. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo. In addition, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent [[Juwan Howard]], [[Tim Hardaway]] and [[Donnell Harvey]] to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Tariq Abdul-Wahad]] and [[Avery Johnson]], the Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the [[Utah Jazz]]'s star [[Karl Malone]]. The Mavericks swept the [[Kevin Garnett]]-led [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] [[2002 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]] but lost again in the second round, this time to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n\n==== 2002\u201303 ====\nBut it was only in the next season when the Mavericks finally broke through. They started the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]] with a 14\u20130 record which was 1 shy of tying the NBA record set by the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] [[1993\u201394 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] (15\u20130). The Mavericks finished with a 60\u201322 record in the regular season, astonishing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. The \"Big Three\" Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash were a 100-point-game waiting to happen and led the Mavericks into the Conference Finals against the [[Tim Duncan]]-led [[San Antonio Spurs]]. However, with the series tied 1\u20131 Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out of the rest of the series. This worsened the Mavs depth problem in the front court (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series) and the Spurs took the series in 6 games.\n\n==== 2003\u201304 ====\nIn [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]], two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired [[Antawn Jamison]], [[Danny Fortson]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch]] and [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] from [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]] in exchange for Nick Van Exel, [[Evan Eschmeyer]], Popeye Jones, [[Avery Johnson]] and [[Antoine Rigaudeau]]. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills and Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch to Boston for [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Tony Delk]]. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks easily qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the best offensive team in the NBA. Notable were two rookies, [[Josh Howard]] and [[Marquis Daniels]], who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly [[2004 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]], losing in the first round to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[Sacramento Kings]], a team which clearly played better defense. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy.\n\n=== 2004&ndash;2006: Roster changes ===\n\n==== 2004\u201305 ====\nThe [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004&ndash;05 season]] brought in blockbuster trades which (among others) brought in burly center [[Erick Dampier]], combo guard [[Jason Terry]], speedy rookie point guard [[Devin Harris]], scoring machine [[Jerry Stackhouse]], and defensive stalwart [[Alan Henderson]]. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired [[Keith Van Horn]] for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson resigned and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the defense of the Mavericks became stronger and they easily qualified for [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] with an impressive 58\u201324 record. The Mavericks defeated the [[Houston Rockets]] in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the [[Phoenix Suns]] 4\u20132, led by former Maverick star [[Steve Nash]].\n\n==== 2005\u201306: First finals appearance ====\n{{Main article|2005\u201306 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nPrior to the [[2005 NBA draft]], the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \"Allan Houston Rule\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id%3D3286%26NAV%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 23, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920153034/http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id=3286&NAV=1 |archivedate=September 20, 2014 }}</ref> Under this rule, the [[Orlando Magic]] waived [[Doug Christie (basketball)|Doug Christie]], who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed [[Darrell Armstrong]], and introduced Christie, [[DeSagana Diop]], [[Rawle Marshall]], and [[Josh Powell]] as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was very limited amidst a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and [[Mr. Europa]], a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural [[FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award|FIBA Europe Player of the Year]].\n\nUp until the very end of the season, the Mavericks would be toe-to-toe with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for the crown of the Southwest Division as well as the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60\u201322 record, with [[Avery Johnson]] winning [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|NBA Coach of the Year]] honors. [[2006 NBA Playoffs|In the playoffs]], they swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the Conference Finals against former teammate [[Steve Nash]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series, as they defeated the [[Phoenix Suns]] in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals on June 3, 2006 in the [[US Airways Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.\n\n{{Main article|2006 NBA Finals}}\nIn the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the [[2005\u201306 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], held home-court advantage and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard [[Dwyane Wade]]. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the last possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The [[tragic flaw|tragic figure]] was [[Josh Howard]], who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than halfcourt for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by [[Alonzo Mourning]]'s five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] was fined a total of $250,000 for \"several acts of misconduct\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5.  Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room.  [[Jerry Stackhouse]] was suspended for Game 5 after fouling [[Shaquille O'Neal]] on a breakaway dunk attempt.  The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs.\n\nThe Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the Finals after taking a 2\u20130 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead with under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22\u20137 in the momentum-changing 98\u201396 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's greatest postseason comeback in team history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html |title=NBA.com: A Total Turnaround |publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017120059/http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html |archive-date=2015-10-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== 2006&ndash;2010: First round exits ===\nAfter a disappointing end to their magnificent playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a rocky 0\u20134 start, the Mavericks then went on a historic run and posted a 52\u20135 record over their next 57 games. They finished out the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|regular season]] with a record of 67\u201315, good enough to be tied for 6th place all-time, 1st in the league and the #1 seed in the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference playoffs]]. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season, and was named the NBA MVP at its end. [[Josh Howard]] was named to the all-star team.\n\nHowever, the first place Mavericks were defeated in 6 games by the 8th seeded [[2006\u201307 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]], which is regarded by some as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history, while others don't consider it an upset at all.  The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting matchups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. Former NBA champion and All-Star legend Bill Russell stated in his NBA.com blog that he didn't consider it to be an upset, since Golden State was 3&ndash;0 vs. the Mavericks in the regular season. On the year, the Mavericks went 67-12 against the rest of the league and 0-3 against Golden State, giving credibility to Russell's belief that the Warriors' win shouldn't have surprised NBA fans. Ironically, the Warriors were coached by [[Don Nelson]], the immediate past manager/coach of the Mavericks until he stepped down at the end of 2005\u201306, and he had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006\u201307 midseason\n\nNowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's stunning first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony.  Traditionally, the MVP award is given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second round of the playoffs.  But it has been believed that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted in the playoffs.\n\n==== 2007\u201308 ====\n{{Main article|2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season}}\n[[File:Jason Kidd drives Feb 24 2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kidd drives to the basket during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.]]\nThe Mavericks dealt [[Devin Harris]], two first round picks and others in a blockbuster trade to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for veteran all-star [[Jason Kidd]] and other role players, Cuban also tried to sign the free agent [[Kevin Garnett]] unsuccessfully. The Mavericks were 3 and 11 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the [[2008\u201309 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in a 111\u201386 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the [[2008\u201309 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in a 105\u201398 win on April 6. This win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] 97&ndash;94 on April 10.  This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their 8th consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51-31. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated once again, by the \nNew Orleans Hornets 4&ndash;1 on the road, 99&ndash;94.\n\nJust one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as Head Coach of the Dallas Mavericks. On May 9, 2008, [[Rick Carlisle]] was hired as the head coach.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050308dnspomavs.c4fc389e.html Dallas Mavericks, Carlisle seem to like potential match | Dallas Mavericks News | Sports News | Dallas Morning News]</ref><ref>[http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050808dnspomavslede.da0f12fa.html Deal with Dallas Mavericks, Carlisle could come today | WFAA.com | Sports: Basketball: Mavericks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108022515/http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050808dnspomavslede.da0f12fa.html |date=2009-01-08 }}</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3389463 ESPN \u2013 Sources: Carlisle, Mavs reach agreement on 4-year deal \u2013 NBA]</ref><ref name=\"Mavs sign Carlisle\">[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jl2w-wzycOVHOI8JdZ8VAB4dLbVw AFP: Mavericks reach four-year coaching deal with Carlisle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514114056/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jl2w-wzycOVHOI8JdZ8VAB4dLbVw |date=2008-05-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Carlisle_signs051008.html |title=MAVERICKS: Official release: Rick Carlisle named coach |publisher=Nba.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514120414/http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Carlisle_signs051008.html |archive-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== 2008\u201309 ====\n{{Main article|2008\u201309 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nAfter getting off to a rocky start at 2-7, the Mavericks eventually found themselves with the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2009]]. This was after going 50-32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about three to four weeks earlier, weren't even sure if they were going to make the eighth and final spot. A run of 5-1 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] also entered the postseason with a streak of 25 consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, [[2008\u201309 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nThe Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 105-97 in San Antonio. The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was just trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they couldn't do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106-93. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference Semi-finals for the first time since 2006.\n\nIn the semifinals, they would face the two-seeded [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]], who were fresh off an easy 4-1 series win against the [[2008\u201309 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]], including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks would stay close with the Nuggets in the first three quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter where [[Carmelo Anthony]] and the Nuggets would finally wake up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas seemed to be going on to win, leading by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a cold-blooded three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106-105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy, because Maverick guard Antoine Wright clearly fouled Anthony, but since there is no replay used in the NBA, the Mavericks suffered a heart breaking game 3 loss. It was later announced by the league that the referees made the wrong call, but despite this the Mavericks still faced a 3-0 deficit in the series.\n\n44 points in Game 4 from Dirk Nowitzki would save the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, the series in Denver's favor, 3-1. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as they would be ousted by a score of 124-110. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team.\n\n==== 2009\u201310: Return to the elites ====\n{{Main article|2009\u201310 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nAfter a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the future construction of the team. They began by re-signing [[Jason Kidd]] to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a move to compound their age problem, by trading for former all-star small forward [[Shawn Marion]]. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swing-man Antoine Wright along with defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired burly center [[Nathan Jawai]], and [[Kris Humphries]]. Many analysts{{Who|date=April 2010}} viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, being that it countered their age issues, while simultaneously providing them with more depth on the bench. The Mavericks also added veteran forwards [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]], [[Drew Gooden]], and [[Quinton Ross]].\n\n[[File:Jason Terry.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jason Terry.]]\nThese moves proved successful, because after dropping the season opener to the [[2009\u201310 Washington Wizards season|Wizards]], the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the [[2009\u201310 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], [[2009\u201310 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], [[2009\u201310 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and the [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] which was something that the Mavericks had been unable to do the last two seasons.\n\nA day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a block-buster deal. The trade sent [[Josh Howard]], [[James Singleton (basketball)|James Singleton]], and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for [[Caron Butler]], [[Brendan Haywood]], and [[Deshawn Stevenson]]. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Many NBA analysts{{Who|date=April 2010}} felt that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128\u201378. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 83\u201377. The Mavericks finished the season with an impressive 55\u201327 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.\n\nDuring the playoffs though, this optimism proved to be short lived, because after winning game one 100\u201394, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97-87, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status.\n\n==== 2010 Offseason ====\nAfter yet another first round melt-down, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early offseason. The first order of business for [[Mark Cuban]] and the Mavericks was to re-sign [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Dirk agreed to a 4-year deal worth $80M. On July 13, the Dallas Mavericks after losing the opportunity to sign [[LeBron James]], [[Dwyane Wade]], and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] acquired centers [[Tyson Chandler]] and [[Alexis Ajinca]] from the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for center [[Erick Dampier]], forward [[Eduardo N\u00e1jera]] and guard [[Matt Carroll (basketball)|Matt Carroll]].\n\n=== 2010\u20132011 season: Championship season ===\nThe 2010\u201311 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks momentum, combined with the team's second-leading scorer [[Caron Butler]] suffering a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later, raising questions of if the Mavericks could make it 11 straight 50-win seasons. The Mavericks then went on to drop their next seven games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. This however would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games, and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense, and consequently they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010\u201311 campaign, mostly in part{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team). The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the 3rd seed, with a 57\u201325 record. However, due to the Mavericks reputation as playoff chokers, many{{Who|date=September 2011}} predicted them to be ousted in the first round against the six-seeded [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Yahoo! Sports analyst [[Adrian Wojnarowski]] even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers.\n\nThe Mavs entered the [[2011 NBA Playoffs|post-season]] as the 3rd seed and despite toting a 57-25 record, were predicted by the media to be ousted by the injury-riddled Trail Blazers. The Mavericks won games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion, however upon their arrival to the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks were going to allow another impressive regular season to go down the drain.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the Western Conference Semifinals. This series was the first time that [[Kobe Bryant]] had met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; that however did not prove to be the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, and took a two games to none lead heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98-92 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect exclamation mark,{{According to whom|date=September 2011}} crushing the Lakers in game 4 by a score of 122\u201386. In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the Western Conference Finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking game 1 by a score of 121-112. The Thunder then responded with 106-100 victory in game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in game 4, to take the series in five games. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history, and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the [[Miami Heat]].\n\nThe Mavs entered the 2010\u20132011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's \"Big Three\" coming together during the course of the 2010\u201311 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92-84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88-73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22-5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88-86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat with a 112-103 victory, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105-95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility.\n\n=== 2011&ndash;2018: Post-championship decline ===\nThe following season was cut to 66 games due to a [[2011 NBA lockout|lockout]], which meant the Mavericks had to wait until [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day]] to raise their first championship banner. During the brief offseason owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting key contributors Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the [[New York Knicks]], Stevenson joined the [[New Jersey Nets]], Barea went to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], and Butler joined the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] [[Lamar Odom]] via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans [[Vince Carter]] and [[Delonte West]].\n\nThe Mavericks raised their championship banner prior to their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day, but in what would soon become a mirror image of the [[2006\u201307 Miami Heat season|2006\u201307 Heat]]'s eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105\u201394 loss, marking Dallas's first regular season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things didn't get better for Dallas after starting the season 0\u20133, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks started off on a high note, winning 13 of 18 games in January, but they limped to a 22\u201322 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing 7th with a 36\u201330 record, their lowest finish since the 2007\u201308 season. Nowitzki normed just 21.6 points, 6 rebounds and 45.7% shooting, his lowest numbers since the 2000\u201301 season. Meanwhile, Odom proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, and they decided to sit him out for the final two months of the season.\n\nIn a rematch from last year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the [[2012 NBA Playoffs]]. Games 1 and 2 went down the wire, but the Mavericks' fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant bailed the Thunder out with a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks fell flat throughout the game and suffered a humiliating 95\u201379 defeat to fall behind 0\u20133. With their backs behind the wall in Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but [[James Harden (basketball)|James Harden]]'s 15-point fourth quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103\u201397 win and eliminated the Mavericks from contention. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series, and became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006\u201307 Heat and the 1956\u201357 Philadelphia Warriors.\n\n=== 2018&ndash;present: The Luka Don\u010di\u0107 era ===\n\nThe Mavericks finished the 2017&ndash;18 season with a 24&ndash;58 record, their worst in twenty years. In the [[2018 NBA draft]], the Mavericks were awarded the fifth pick. With their eyes on Slovenian guard [[Luka Don\u010di\u0107]], a projected top-three pick, the Mavericks worked out a deal with the [[Atlanta Hawks]], who owned the third pick. The Hawks agreed to draft Don\u010di\u0107 for Dallas, while the Mavericks drafted point guard [[Trae Young]] for Atlanta. The two teams traded the draft rights to their selections, with the Mavericks packaging in a top-5 protected 2019 first round pick.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.dallasmavericks.com/ Dallas Mavericks official website]\n* [http://www.dallasbasketball.com/ DallasBasketball.com website]\n* [http://nbahoopsonline.com/teams/DallasMavericks/Index.html Dallas Mavericks History] NBA Hoops Online\n\n{{NBA team histories navbox}}\n{{Dallas Mavericks}}\n{{Dallas Mavericks seasons}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Dallas Mavericks}}\n[[Category:Dallas Mavericks]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association history by team|Dallas]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 17-2 \u2192 17\u20132 (14), 20-62 \u2192 20\u201362 (12)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Dallas_Mavericks"}

Of all the ancient commentaries available of the Kural literature, Parimelalhagar\u2019s commentary is considered by scholars as the best both in textual and in literary aspects. Parimelalhagar also remains the most reviewed, in terms of both praise and criticism, of all the medieval Kural commentators.\n\nAlthough the chapter ordering, and the verse ordering within each chapter, of the Tirukkural as set by Parimelalhagar varies greatly from the original work of [[Valluvar]], the scholars and publishers of the modern era primarily follow Parimelalhagar\u2019s ordering. Thus, it is Parimelalhagar\u2019s ordering that is used to number the Kural chapters and couplets today.\n\n==Early life==\nParimelalhagar was born in [[Kancheepuram]] in the erstwhile [[Tondaimandalam|Tondai state]] in a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite Brahmin]] family and is believed to have lived during the late 13th century CE.{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963}} He belonged to the lineage of priests of [[Ulagalantha Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Sri Ulagalandha Perumal temple]] in his home town.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} He is also known by various names as Vanthuvarai Perumal, Parimelalhagiyaar, Parimelalhagiyan, and Parimelalhagaraiyan.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} [[Sivagyana Munivar]] mentions him as Parimelalhagiyaar in his work.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}\n\nParimel's time has been deduced by referring to various historical accounts.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}} In his [[venpa]] verse named \u201cValluvar seer\u201d, [[Umapathi Shivachariyar]], a poet from the late 13th century, mentions Parimel.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}} In the introductory section of his commentary to Book III of the Kural, Parimel mentions [[Bhoja|King Bhoja]] (reigned c. 1010\u20131055 CE) from the [[Paramara dynasty]] and his work ''Shringara-Prakasha'', which has been dated to early 11th century.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}}{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=433}} Also scholars assert that Senavarayar preceeds Parimel in time.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}} Thus, Parimel is believed to have been born in early 13th century.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}}\n\nThere are accounts of Parimel's living in both the cities of Kancheepuram and [[Madurai]].{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} Verse 41 of the Thondaimandala Sadhagam says that \"Parimelalhagar of Kancheepuram served as beacon to the Kural.\"{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} Additionally, an inscription on a plaque dating back to 1271 CE, which was erected in the 22nd year of the rule of the [[Telugu Cholas|Telugu Chola]] King Vijayakanda Gopalan, mentions a land transaction done by Parimelalhagiya Dhadhan.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} According to [[M. Raghava Iyengar]], this Parimelalhagiya Dhadhan was none other than Parimel.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} These serve as evidences to the claim that Parimel lived in Kancheepuram. Verses 1547 and 1548 of the Perunthirattu indicate that he was a political figure in the town of Okkur near Madurai in the [[Pandya Kingdom]].{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=432}} The word usage that he employed in his Kural commentary (as in couplet 650) appears to be the colloquial version of the language spoken in [[Tirunelveli district]] even today.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} Incidentally, there are also several tombs indicating the name \"Parimelalhagar\" found across the district.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} These indicate that he must have lived in the Pandya Kingdom, chiefly Madurai.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}\n\nRight from his young age, Parimel was well versed in [[Sanskrit]] language's [[Tharka]], [[Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a|Vyakarna]], [[Samkhya|Sankya]], and [[Vedanta]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language's [[Tolkappiyam]] and other classic literary works.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} He had a good understanding of [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agama]], [[Siddhanta]] and [[Vedanta]], which are considered vital to unravel the riches of the Tirukkural, which helped him do justice to his commentary.{{sfn|Kolappan, 2015}} When Parimel chose to write a literary criticism, he analysed in depth the works of the previous nine commentators who lived before his time and eliminated the flaws found in those earlier commentaries.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} When he completed his writing and perfected the work, he decided to stage it in the court of the Pandya ruler.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} Legend has it that the King wanted Parimel to stage his work seated on a [[bronze]] horse mounted in his court.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} When Parimel did so, the bronze horse moved, serving as an evidence to his scholarly stature.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} Thus he came to be known as Parimelalhagar (meaning \"the handsome equestrian\").{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} The name is sometime indicated as \"Parimelalhagiyar\" and \"Parimelalhagaraiyyan\". His commentary on the Kural came to be called as \"Parimelalhagiyar Virutthi\".{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} He is believed to have written the commentary around 1271\u20131272 CE as indicated in an inscription at the [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadharaja Perumal Temple]] at [[Kanchipuram]].{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|p=9}} This is indicated in the work ''Sasana Tamil Kavi Saritham'' by Raghava Iyengar.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} Parimel has also written a commentary on [[Paripaadal]], one of the work of the [[Eight Anthologies]] (''Ettuthogai'').{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} However, the Parimelalhagar commentary on the [[Tirumuruk\u0101\u1e5f\u1e5fuppa\u1e6dai]] is believed to have been written by a different poet of his namesake.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}}\n\n==Religion==\nThere are several evidences indicating that Parimelalhagar belonged to the Vaishnavite sect.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=432}} His explanations to Kural couplets 610 and 1103, his reference to the [[Nalayira Divya Prabandham]] in various instances, his employment of verses from the Tiruvai Molhi in couplets 349 and 370, and his citing [[Nammalvar]]'s verses in chapter 39 in the [[Porul (Kural book)|second book]] all indicate that he was a Vaishnavite.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=432}} While a staunch devotee of [[Vishnu]], Parimel practiced religious tolerance and treated other religions of his time with equal respect.{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=433}}\n\n==Commentary to the Kural text==\nParimelalhagar\u2019s commentary is considered by scholars as the best of all ancient commentaries on the Kural text and is esteemed on par with the Kural text itself for its literary quality.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} Its literary quality is so rich that one has to depend on highly learned intellectuals to completely understand the commentary.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=123}} Parimel embellishes his commentary by employing similes (e.g., kurals 100, 144, 343, 360. 422, 425, 448, 571, 693, 741, 797, 900){{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=434}} and adding literary accounts where necessary (e.g., kural 63).{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=121}} He quotes from earlier commentators, points out varied inferences, and debunks any incorrect inferences.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} He also provides Tamil translations of Sanskrit terms.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} At several instances, he extols the best explanations for a particular couplet given by earlier commentators.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} He also includes in his commentaries literary accounts from both Tamil and Sanskrit literatures.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} In several places, he points out the Tamil traditions that are in line with the moral of the couplets.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} All these made his commentary coming to known as \u201cViruddhi Urai\u201d (expandable commentary).{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}}\n\nParimel writes commentaries beginning with an introduction to each book and explains the introductory chapters in each of the Kural books. He analyzes and segregates chapters as subdivisions known as ''iyal''s. He summarizes the contents of each chapter with an abstract at the beginning of each chapter, and also connects the previous chapter with the current one in a logical manner, justifying his own way of chapter arrangement. He writes a verbatim explanation to each couplet and clarifies the meaning of difficult words. He also indicates that every manuscript of the Kural by earlier commentators had only verbatim explanations and that detailed commentaries were made by those who published those manuscripts. Below his verbatim explanations, he provides lucid explanations in contemporary language, which contain several well-researched notes. He also provides ample example wherever necessary, employing several literary phrases before his time in prose.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=121}} Being the last of the medieval commentators, Parimel verily had the opportunity to study the commentaries of all those lived before his time. In most places he agrees with Manakkudavar and cites his work amply. In places where he is in disagreement with Manakkudavar and other early commentators, Parimel debunks their ideas with logical explanations.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|pp=138\u2013139}} Although the original text of Parimel's commentary appears in a summary form describing the meaning and moral of a given couplet, later scholars split it in order to simplify it, providing word-by-word meaning.{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=433}}\n\nParimel is known to be a [[polymath]]. His expertise spanned across fields such as ethics, linguistics, philosophy, poetry, logic, meta-physics, theology, music, and medicine. His musical knowledge is expressed in his commentary for Kural 573. His knowledge on medicine can be seen in his commentary for Kurals 941, 944, and 950.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=121}}\n\n===Changes made by Parimelalhagar in his commentary===\n====Variations in ordering of the Kural verses====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" align=right\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center; width:40%\" rowspan=\"2\"|Kural verse beginning\n!colspan=\"5\"|Couplet ordering\n|-\n![[Manakkudavar]]'s\n![[Pari Perumal]]'s\n![[Paridhi]]'s\n![[Kaalingar]]'s\n!Parimelalhagar's\n|-\n| Kural 1: \u0b85\u0b95\u0bb0 \u0bae\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2 \u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bcd\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n| Kural 2: \u0b95\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b86\u0baf \u0baa\u0baf\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 2\n| 2\n| 2\n| 2\n| 2\n|-\n| Kural 3: \u0bae\u0bb2\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0b8f\u0b95\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0b9f\u0bbf\n| 3\n| 3\n| 3\n| 3\n| 3\n|-\n| Kural 4: \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bc8 \u0b87\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 6\n| 6\n| 5\n| 7\n| 4\n|-\n| Kural 5: \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0bbe\n| 7\n| 7\n| 6\n| 6\n| 5\n|-\n| Kural 6: \u0baa\u0bca\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b90\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 8 \n| 8\n| 7\n| 7 \n| 6 \n|- \n| Kural 7: \u0ba4\u0ba9\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b89\u0bb5\u0bae\u0bc8 \u0b87\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 4\n| 4\n| 6\n| 4\n| 7\n|-\n| Kural 8: \u0b85\u0bb1 \u0b86\u0bb4\u0bbf \u0b85\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba3\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 5\n| 5\n| 10 \n| 9\n| 8\n|-\n| Kural 9: \u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bca\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc1\u0ba3\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bb5\u0bc7\n| 10 \n| 10\n| 8\n| 5 \n| 9\n|-\n| Kural 10: \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bc0\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\n| 9\n| 9\n| 9\n| 10\n| 10\n|}\n\nThe table at the right depicts the variations among the early commentators' ordering of, for example, the first ten verses of the Tirukkural.

Of all the ancient commentaries available of the Kural literature, Parimelalhagar\u2019s commentary is considered by scholars as the best both in textual and in literary aspects. Parimelalhagar also remains the most reviewed, in terms of both praise and criticism, of all the medieval Kural commentators.\n\nAlthough the chapter ordering, and the verse ordering within each chapter, of the Tirukkural as set by Parimelalhagar varies greatly from the original work of [[Valluvar]], the scholars and publishers of the modern era primarily follow Parimelalhagar\u2019s ordering. Thus, it is Parimelalhagar\u2019s ordering that is used to number the Kural chapters and couplets today.\n\n==Early life==\nParimelalhagar was born in [[Kancheepuram]] in the erstwhile [[Tondaimandalam|Tondai state]] in a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite Brahmin]] family and is believed to have lived during the late 13th century CE.{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963}} He belonged to the lineage of priests of [[Ulagalantha Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Sri Ulagalandha Perumal temple]] in his home town.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} He is also known by various names as Vanthuvarai Perumal, Parimelalhagiyaar, Parimelalhagiyan, and Parimelalhagaraiyan.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} [[Sivagyana Munivar]] mentions him as Parimelalhagiyaar in his work.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}\n\nParimel's time has been deduced by referring to various historical accounts.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}} In his [[venpa]] verse named \u201cValluvar seer\u201d, [[Umapathi Shivachariyar]], a poet from the late 13th century, mentions Parimel.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}} In the introductory section of his commentary to Book III of the Kural, Parimel mentions [[Bhoja|King Bhoja]] (reigned c. 1010\u20131055 CE) from the [[Paramara dynasty]] and his work ''Shringara-Prakasha'', which has been dated to early 11th century.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}}{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=433}} Also scholars assert that Senavarayar preceeds Parimel in time.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}} Thus, Parimel is believed to have been born in early 13th century.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=119}}\n\nThere are accounts of Parimel's living in both the cities of Kancheepuram and [[Madurai]].{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} Verse 41 of the Thondaimandala Sadhagam says that \"Parimelalhagar of Kancheepuram served as beacon to the Kural.\"{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} Additionally, an inscription on a plaque dating back to 1271 CE, which was erected in the 22nd year of the rule of the [[Telugu Cholas|Telugu Chola]] King Vijayakanda Gopalan, mentions a land transaction done by Parimelalhagiya Dhadhan.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} According to [[M. Raghava Iyengar]], this Parimelalhagiya Dhadhan was none other than Parimel.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} These serve as evidences to the claim that Parimel lived in Kancheepuram. Verses 1547 and 1548 of the Perunthirattu indicate that he was a political figure in the town of Okkur near Madurai in the [[Pandya Kingdom]].{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=432}} The word usage that he employed in his Kural commentary (as in couplet 650) appears to be the colloquial version of the language spoken in [[Tirunelveli district]] even today.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} Incidentally, there are also several tombs indicating the name \"Parimelalhagar\" found across the district.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}} These indicate that he must have lived in the Pandya Kingdom, chiefly Madurai.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}\n\nRight from his young age, Parimel was well versed in [[Sanskrit]] language's [[Tharka]], [[Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a|Vyakarna]], [[Samkhya|Sankya]], and [[Vedanta]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language's [[Tolkappiyam]] and other classic literary works.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} He had a good understanding of [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agama]], [[Siddhanta]] and [[Vedanta]], which are considered vital to unravel the riches of the Tirukkural, which helped him do justice to his commentary.{{sfn|Kolappan, 2015}} When Parimel chose to write a literary criticism, he analysed in depth the works of the previous nine commentators who lived before his time and eliminated the flaws found in those earlier commentaries.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} When he completed his writing and perfected the work, he decided to stage it in the court of the Pandya ruler.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} Legend has it that the King wanted Parimel to stage his work seated on a [[bronze]] horse mounted in his court.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} When Parimel did so, the bronze horse moved, serving as an evidence to his scholarly stature.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} Thus he came to be known as Parimelalhagar (meaning \"the handsome equestrian\").{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} The name is sometime indicated as \"Parimelalhagiyar\" and \"Parimelalhagaraiyyan\". His commentary on the Kural came to be called as \"Parimelalhagiyar Virutthi\".{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} He is believed to have written the commentary around 1271\u20131272 CE as indicated in an inscription at the [[Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram|Varadharaja Perumal Temple]] at [[Kanchipuram]].{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|p=9}} This is indicated in the work ''Sasana Tamil Kavi Saritham'' by Raghava Iyengar.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} Parimel has also written a commentary on [[Paripaadal]], one of the work of the [[Eight Anthologies]] (''Ettuthogai'').{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}} However, the Parimelalhagar commentary on the [[Tirumuruk\u0101\u1e5f\u1e5fuppa\u1e6dai]] is believed to have been written by a different poet of his namesake.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnamachariyar, 2009|pp=26\u201329}}\n\n==Religion==\nThere are several evidences indicating that Parimelalhagar belonged to the Vaishnavite sect.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=432}} His explanations to Kural couplets 610 and 1103, his reference to the [[Nalayira Divya Prabandham]] in various instances, his employment of verses from the Tiruvai Molhi in couplets 349 and 370, and his citing [[Nammalvar]]'s verses in chapter 39 in the [[Porul (Kural book)|second book]] all indicate that he was a Vaishnavite.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|pp=379\u2013423}}{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=432}} While a staunch devotee of [[Vishnu]], Parimel practiced religious tolerance and treated other religions of his time with equal respect.{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=433}}\n\n==Commentary to the Kural text==\nParimelalhagar\u2019s commentary is considered by scholars as the best of all ancient commentaries on the Kural text and is esteemed on par with the Kural text itself for its literary quality.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} Its literary quality is so rich that one has to depend on highly learned intellectuals to completely understand the commentary.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=123}} Parimel embellishes his commentary by employing similes (e.g., kurals 100, 144, 343, 360. 422, 425, 448, 571, 693, 741, 797, 900){{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=434}} and adding literary accounts where necessary (e.g., kural 63).{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=121}} He quotes from earlier commentators, points out varied inferences, and debunks any incorrect inferences.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} He also provides Tamil translations of Sanskrit terms.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} At several instances, he extols the best explanations for a particular couplet given by earlier commentators.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} He also includes in his commentaries literary accounts from both Tamil and Sanskrit literatures.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} In several places, he points out the Tamil traditions that are in line with the moral of the couplets.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}} All these made his commentary coming to known as \u201cViruddhi Urai\u201d (expandable commentary).{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=122}}\n\nParimel writes commentaries beginning with an introduction to each book and explains the introductory chapters in each of the Kural books. He analyzes and segregates chapters as subdivisions known as ''iyal''s. He summarizes the contents of each chapter with an abstract at the beginning of each chapter, and also connects the previous chapter with the current one in a logical manner, justifying his own way of chapter arrangement. He writes a verbatim explanation to each couplet and clarifies the meaning of difficult words. He also indicates that every manuscript of the Kural by earlier commentators had only verbatim explanations and that detailed commentaries were made by those who published those manuscripts. Below his verbatim explanations, he provides lucid explanations in contemporary language, which contain several well-researched notes. He also provides ample example wherever necessary, employing several literary phrases before his time in prose.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=121}} Being the last of the medieval commentators, Parimel verily had the opportunity to study the commentaries of all those lived before his time. In most places he agrees with Manakkudavar and cites his work amply. In places where he is in disagreement with Manakkudavar and other early commentators, Parimel debunks their ideas with logical explanations.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|pp=138\u2013139}} Although the original text of Parimel's commentary appears in a summary form describing the meaning and moral of a given couplet, later scholars split it in order to simplify it, providing word-by-word meaning.{{sfn|Kovaimani and Nagarajan, 2013|p=433}}\n\nParimel is known to be a [[polymath]]. His expertise spanned across fields such as ethics, linguistics, philosophy, poetry, logic, meta-physics, theology, music, and medicine. His musical knowledge is expressed in his commentary for Kural 573. His knowledge on medicine can be seen in his commentary for Kurals 941, 944, and 950.{{sfn|Chellammal, 2015|p=121}}\n\n===Changes made by Parimelalhagar in his commentary===\n====Variations in ordering of the Kural verses====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" align=right\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center; width:40%\" rowspan=\"2\"|Kural verse beginning\n!colspan=\"5\"|Couplet ordering\n|-\n![[Manakkudavar]]'s\n![[Pari Perumal]]'s\n![[Paridhi]]'s\n![[Kaalingar]]'s\n!Parimelalhagar's\n|-\n| Kural 1: \u0b85\u0b95\u0bb0 \u0bae\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2 \u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bcd\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n| Kural 2: \u0b95\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b86\u0baf \u0baa\u0baf\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 2\n| 2\n| 2\n| 2\n| 2\n|-\n| Kural 3: \u0bae\u0bb2\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0b8f\u0b95\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0b9f\u0bbf\n| 3\n| 3\n| 3\n| 3\n| 3\n|-\n| Kural 4: \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bc8 \u0b87\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 6\n| 6\n| 5\n| 7\n| 4\n|-\n| Kural 5: \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0bbe\n| 7\n| 7\n| 6\n| 6\n| 5\n|-\n| Kural 6: \u0baa\u0bca\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b90\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 8 \n| 8\n| 7\n| 7 \n| 6 \n|- \n| Kural 7: \u0ba4\u0ba9\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b89\u0bb5\u0bae\u0bc8 \u0b87\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 4\n| 4\n| 6\n| 4\n| 7\n|-\n| Kural 8: \u0b85\u0bb1 \u0b86\u0bb4\u0bbf \u0b85\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba3\u0ba9\u0bcd\n| 5\n| 5\n| 10 \n| 9\n| 8\n|-\n| Kural 9: \u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bca\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc1\u0ba3\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bb5\u0bc7\n| 10 \n| 10\n| 8\n| 5 \n| 9\n|-\n| Kural 10: \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bc0\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\n| 9\n| 9\n| 9\n| 10\n| 10\n|}\n\nThe table at the right depicts the variations among the early commentators' ordering of, for example, the first ten verses of the Tirukkural.
