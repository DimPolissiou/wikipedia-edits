Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he brutally betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Democratization}}\nThe [[Roman Republic]] was the first known government in the western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the [[Roman assemblies]].

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The \"rights of man\" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] led to the creation of a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office.

As a consequence, society is built up by people, who are free and have the power to defend themselves with weapons.\n* These free people join or form local communities. These local communities are independent, which includes financial independence, and they are free to determine their own rules.\n* Local communities join together into a higher unit e.g. a canton.\n* There is no hierarchical bureaucracy.\n* There is competition between these local communities e.g. on services delivered or on taxes.\n\nA drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=S\u00f8rensen|first=Eva|year=2015|title=Enhancing policy innovation by redesigning representative democracy|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6a6a6d4b-e1f4-45ab-a1c8-096f37485a35%40sessionmgr120&vid=1&hid=127|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=|pages=|via=ebscohost}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thaa|first=Winfried|year=2016|title=Issues and images \u2013 new sources of inequality in current representative democracy.|url=|journal=Critical Review of International Social & Political Philosophy|volume=19|issue=3|pages=357\u2013375|doi=10.1080/13698230.2016.1144859}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed solutions===\nThe system of [[stochocracy]] has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected.

Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he brutally betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Democratization}}\nThe [[Roman Republic]] was the first known government in the western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the [[Roman assemblies]].

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The \"rights of man\" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] led to the creation of a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office.

As a consequence, society is built up by people, who are free and have the power to defend themselves with weapons.\n* These free people join or form local communities. These local communities are independent, which includes financial independence, and they are free to determine their own rules.\n* Local communities join together into a higher unit e.g. a canton.\n* There is no hierarchical bureaucracy.\n* There is competition between these local communities e.g. on services delivered or on taxes.\n\nA drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=S\u00f8rensen|first=Eva|year=2015|title=Enhancing policy innovation by redesigning representative democracy|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6a6a6d4b-e1f4-45ab-a1c8-096f37485a35%40sessionmgr120&vid=1&hid=127|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=|pages=|via=ebscohost}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thaa|first=Winfried|year=2016|title=Issues and images \u2013 new sources of inequality in current representative democracy.|url=|journal=Critical Review of International Social & Political Philosophy|volume=19|issue=3|pages=357\u2013375|doi=10.1080/13698230.2016.1144859}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed solutions===\nThe system of [[stochocracy]] has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected.

The song describes war as futile and gruesome, while criticising those who seek to glorify it. This is exemplified in the song by the account of a young [[Australia]]n serviceman who is maimed during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The protagonist, who had travelled across rural Australia before the war, is emotionally devastated by the loss of his legs in battle. As the years pass he notes the death of other [[veteran]]s, while the younger generation becomes apathetic to the veterans and their cause. At its conclusion, the song incorporates the melody and a few lines of lyrics of the 1895 song \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\" by Australian poet [[Banjo Paterson]].\n\nMany [[cover version]]s of the song have been performed and recorded, as well as many versions in foreign languages.\n\n== Content ==\n\nThe song is an account of the memories of an old Australian man who, as a youngster had travelled across rural Australia with a [[Swag (bedroll)|swag]] (the so-called Matilda of the title) and tent<!-- {{fact|date=July 2017}} was removed on 15 August 2017.

In 1915 he had joined the Australian armed forces and been sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. For ''ten weary weeks'', he kept himself alive as ''around [him] the corpses piled higher''. Eventually he is wounded by a shellburst and awakens in hospital to find that both his legs have been amputated.\n\nWhen the ship carrying the young soldiers departs from Australia the band plays \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\" while crowds wave flags and cheer. When the crippled narrator returns and ''the legless, the armless, the blind, the insane'' are carried down the gangway to the same popular music, the people watch in silence and turn their faces away.\n\n==Composition and style==\n\nInterviewed by ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in 2002, Bogle said that as a 12-year-old boy in [[Peebles]], [[Scotland]] in 1956, he had purchased a set of bound volumes of ''World War Illustrated'', a weekly \"[[penny dreadful]] propaganda sheet\", which had been published during [[World War I]]. Bogle was inspired by the photography and felt a sense of \"...the enormity of the conflict and its individual toll\". In his teens he was a voracious reader of everything on the war and already knew much about the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzacs']] role at Gallipoli before he emigrated to Australia in 1969.<ref name = SMH2002/>\n\nHe told ''The Sydney Morning Herald'':\n<blockquote>\nA lot of people now think the song is traditional.

They often contain [[typo]]s introduced through human error. Traditionally, a proofreader looks at an increment of text on the copy and then compares it to the corresponding typeset increment, and then marks any errors (sometimes called 'line edits') using [[List of proofreader's marks|standard proofreaders' marks]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/mw/table/proofrea.htm \"Proofreaders' Marks,\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816210104/http://www.merriam-webster.com/mw/table/proofrea.htm |date=2010-08-16 }} Merriam Webster</ref> Unlike [[copy editing]], the defining procedure of a proofreading service is to work directly with two sets of information at the same time. Proofs are then returned to the [[Word processor|typesetter]] for correction. Correction-cycle proofs will typically have one descriptive term, such as 'bounce', 'bump', or 'revise' unique to the department or organization and used for clarity to the strict exclusion of any other. It is a common practice for 'all' such corrections, no matter how slight, to be sent again to a proofreader to be checked and initialed, thus establishing the principle of higher responsibility for proofreaders as compared to their typesetters or artists.\n\n===Alternative methods===\n'Copy holding' or 'copy reading' employs two readers per proof. The first reads the text aloud literally as it appears, usually at a comparatively fast but uniform rate. The second reader follows along and marks any pertinent differences between what is read and what was typeset. This method is appropriate for large quantities of [[boilerplate text]] where it is assumed that there will be comparatively few mistakes.\n\nExperienced copy holders employ various [[codes]] and verbal short-cuts that accompany their reading. The spoken word 'digits', for example, means that the numbers about to be read are not words spelled out; and 'in a hole' can mean that the upcoming segment of text is within [[parenthesis|parentheses]]. 'Bang' means an [[exclamation point]]. A 'thump' or 'screamer' made with a finger on the table represents the [[List of typographic features|initial cap]], [[comma]], [[Full stop|period]], or similar obvious attribute being read simultaneously. Thus the line of text ''(He said the address was 1234 Central Blvd., and to hurry!)'' would be read aloud as \"''in a hole'' [thump] ''he said the address was digits 1 2 3 4'' [thump] ''central'' [thump] ''buluhvuhd'' [thump] ''comma and to hurry bang''\". Mutual understanding is the only guiding principle, so codes evolve as opportunity permits. In the above example, two thumps after 'buluhvuhd' might be acceptable to proofreaders familiar with the text.\n\n'Double reading'. A single proofreader checks a proof in the traditional manner and then another reader repeats the process. Both initial the proof. Note that with both copy holding and double reading, responsibility for a given proof is necessarily shared by two individuals.\n\n'Scanning', used to check a proof without reading it word for word, has become common with computerization of typesetting and the popularization of [[Word processor|word processing]]. Many publishers have their own proprietary typesetting systems,<ref>See 1983, http://www.bowne.com/about/timeline.asp  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429014855/http://www.bowne.com/about/timeline.asp |date=April 29, 2010 }}</ref> while their customers use commercial programs such as [[Microsoft Word|Word]]. Before the data in a Word file can be published, it must be converted into a format used by the publisher. The end product is usually called a ''conversion.'' If a customer has already proofread the contents of a file before submitting it to a publisher, there will be no reason for another proofreader to re-read it from the copy (although this additional service may be requested and paid for). Instead, the publisher is held responsible only for formatting errors, such as typeface, page width, and alignment of [[Column (typography)|columns]] in [[Table (database)|tables]]; and production errors such as text inadvertently deleted. To simplify matters further, a given conversion will usually be assigned a specific [[Template (file format)|template]]. Given typesetters of sufficient skill, experienced proofreaders familiar with their typesetters' work can accurately scan their pages without reading the text for errors that neither they nor their typesetters are responsible for.\n\n===Style guides and checklists===\nProofreaders are expected to be consistently accurate by default because they occupy the last stage of typographic production before [[publication]].\n\nBefore it is typeset, copy is often marked up by an editor or customer with various instructions as to typefaces, art, and layout. Often these individuals will consult a [[style guide]] of varying degrees of complexity and completeness. Such guides are usually produced in-house by the staff or supplied by the customer, and it should be distinguished from professional references such as ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'', ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', and ''[[The Gregg Reference Manual|Gregg Reference Manual]]''. When appropriate, proofreaders may mark errors in accordance with their house guide instead of the copy when the two conflict. Where this is the case, the proofreader may justifiably be considered a ''copy editor''.\n\nChecklists are common in proof-rooms where there is sufficient uniformity of product to distill some or all of its components to a list. They may also act as a training tool for new hires. Checklists are never comprehensive, however: proofreaders still have to find all mistakes that are ''not'' mentioned or described, thus limiting their usefulness.\n\n===Qualifications===\nThe educational level of proofreaders, in general, is on a par with that of their co-workers. Typesetters, graphic artists, and word processors rarely need to have a [[college degree]], and a perusal of online job listings for proofreaders will show that although listings may specify a degree for proofreaders, many do not.{{Original research inline|date=August 2011}} Those same listings will also show a tendency for degree-only positions to be in [[Company|firms]] in [[Commerce|commercial]] fields such as [[retail]], [[medicine]], or [[insurance]], where the data to be read is internal documentation not intended for public consumption per se.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Such listings, specifying a single proofreader to fill a single position, are more likely to require a degree as a method of reducing the candidate pool but also because the degree is perceived{{by whom|date=April 2016}} as a requirement for any potentially promotable [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] applicant. Experience is discounted at the outset in preference to a credential, indicating a relatively low starting [[wage]] appropriate for younger applicants. In these kinds of [[Human multitasking|multitasking]] [[Desktop publishing|desktop-publishing]] environments, [[human resources]] departments may even classify proofreading as a clerical skill generic to literacy itself. Where this occurs, it is not unusual for proofreaders to find themselves guaranteeing the accuracy of higher-paid co-workers.\n\nIn contrast, [[Printing|printers]], [[publishers]], [[advertising agencies]] and [[law firms]] tend not to require a degree specifically. In these professionally demanding single-tasking environments, the educational divide surrounds the production department instead of the company itself. Promotion is rare for these proofreaders because they tend to be valued more for their present skill set than for any potential [[leadership]] ability. They are often supervised by a typesetter also without a degree, or by an administrative manager with little or no production experience who delegates day-to-day responsibilities to a typesetter.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It follows that such listings tend to stress experience, offer commensurately higher pay rates, and mention a proofreading test.\n\n===Proofreader testing===\n'''Applicants'''. Although many commercial and college-level proofreading courses of varying quality can be found online, practical job training for proofreaders has declined along with its status as a [[Craft unions|craft]]. Many books also teach the basics to their readers. Such tools of self-preparation have by and large replaced formal workplace instruction.\n\nProofreader applicants are tested on their [[spelling]], speed, and skill in finding mistakes in a sample text. Toward that end, they may be given a list of ten or twenty classically difficult words and a proofreading test, both tightly timed. The proofreading test will often have a maximum number of errors per quantity of text and a minimum amount of time to find them. The goal of this approach is to identify those with the best skill set.\n\nA contrasting approach is to identify and reward persistence more than an arbitrarily high level of expertise. For the spelling portion of the test, that can be accomplished by providing a dictionary, lengthening the wordlist conspicuously, and making clear that the test is not timed. For the proofreading portion, a suitable language-usage reference book (e.g., ''The Chicago Manual of Style'') can be provided. (Note that knowing where to find needed information in such specialized books is itself an effective component of the test.) Removing the pressure of what is essentially an [[wikt:ASAP|ASAP]] deadline will identify those applicants with slightly greater reservoirs of persistence, stamina, and commitment. At the same time, by mooting the need for applicants to make use of a memorized list of difficult words and a studied knowledge of the more common grammatical traps (''affect, effect, lay, lie''), applicants learn that their success depends on a quality at least theoretically available to anyone at any time without preparation.\n\n'''Formal employee testing''' is usually planned and announced well in advance, and may have titles, such as ''Levels Testing'', ''Skills Evaluation'', etc. They are found in corporate or governmental environments with enough HR staff to prepare and administer a test.\n\n'''Informal employee testing''' takes place whenever a manager feels the need to take a random sampling of a proofreader's work by double-reading selected pages. Usually, this is done without warning, and sometimes it will be done secretly. It can be highly effective, and there will certainly be times when such re-reading is justified, but care must be taken.\n\nThere are two basic approaches. The first is to re-read a proof within its deadline and in the department itself. Thus the manager will read from the same copy that the first reader saw, and be aware of any volume and deadline pressures the first reader was under, and can directly observe the individual in real time. This approach can also be followed as a matter of routine. The goal then is not to confirm a specific suspicion of poor job performance by a particular reader, but rather to confirm a general assumption that the proofreading staff needs ongoing monitoring.\n\nThe second approach to informal testing is to wait for some days or weeks and then, as time allows, randomly select proofs to re-read while outside the department. Such proofs may or may not be accompanied by the copy pages that the proofreader saw. Here the re-reader is examining the proof from the perspective of typographical and formatting accuracy alone, ignoring how many other pages the first reader had read that day, and had yet to read, and how many pages were successfully read and how many deadlines were met under a given day's specific conditions.\n\n===Economics===\nProofreading cannot be fully cost-effective where volume or unpredictable workflow prevents proofreaders from managing their own time. Examples are [[newspapers]], [[Thermographic printing|thermographic]] trade printing of [[business cards]], and network hubs. The problem in each of these environments is that jobs cannot be put aside to be re-read as needed. In the first two cases, volumes and deadlines dictate that all jobs be finished as soon as possible; in the third case, jobs presently on-site at the hub are hurried, regardless of their formal deadline, in favor of possible future work that may arrive unpredictably. Where proofs can programmatically{{clarify|date=May 2013}} be read only once, the quality will randomly but persistently fall below expectations. Even the best and most experienced readers will not be able to be consistently accurate enough to justify premium pay.\n\nProduction technology can also moot the need to pay a premium for proofreading. In the example of thermographic business-card printing, even when there are no reprints, there is considerable wastage of paper and ink in preparing each of the press runs, which are separated by color. When (as often happens) there is unused space available on the [[Printing plate|plate]], there is no increase in production cost for reprints that use that space. Only when reprints are so numerous that they push production staff into significant [[overtime]] would they increase costs. But significant overtime is usually the result of a high volume in new orders using up the [[Eight hour day|eight-hour day]]. In such industries proofreading need only \u2013 and can only \u2013 make a marginal difference to be cost-effective. As for the customers, many will never return even when their jobs are perfect, and enough of those who do need a reprint will find the retailer's cost-saving price to be satisfactory enough to tolerate a late delivery.\n\nOnly where workload volume does not compress all deadlines to ASAP and the workflow is reasonably steady can proofreading be worth a premium [[wage]]. Strict deadlines mandate a delivery time, but in doing so they necessarily do not mandate delivery ''before'' that time. If deadlines are consistently maintained instead of arbitrarily moved up, proofreaders can manage their own time by putting proofs aside at their own discretion for re-reading later. Whether the interval is a few seconds or overnight, it enables proofs to be viewed as both familiar and new. Where this procedure is followed, managers can expect consistently superior performance. However, re-reading concentrates responsibility instead of sharing it (as double-reading and copy holding, both described above, do), and it requires more effort from proofreaders and a measure of freedom from management. Instead of managers controlling deadlines, deadlines control managers, and leeway is passed to the proofreaders as well as commensurate pay.\n\n===Proofreading and copy-editing===\nThe term ''proofreading'' is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to copy-editing, and vice versa. Although there is necessarily some overlap, proofreaders typically lack any real editorial or managerial authority. What they ''can'' do is mark queries for typesetters, editors, or authors. To clarify matters at the outset, some advertised vacancies come with a notice that the job advertised is not a writing or editing position and will not become one. Creativity and critical thinking by their very nature conflict with the strict copy-''following'' discipline that [[Commerce|commercial]] and [[United States Government Printing Office|governmental]] proofreading requires. Thus proofreading and editing are fundamentally separate responsibilities. In contrast, ''copy editors'' focus on a sentence-by-sentence analysis of the text to \"clean it up\" by improving grammar, spelling, punctuation, syntax, and structure. The copy editor is usually the last editor that an author will work with. Copy editing focuses intensely on style, content, punctuation, [[grammar]], and consistency of usage.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.proofreadingcamp.com/types-editing-proofreading/ | title=Copy That: The Categories and Classes of Editing| author=ProofreadingCamp.com | accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Self==\nPrimary examples include job seekers' own [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]s and student term papers. Proofreading such material presents a special challenge, first because the proofreader/editor is usually the author; second because such authors are usually unaware of the inevitability of mistakes and the effort required to find them; and third, as final mistakes are often found when stress levels are highest and time shortest, readers fail to identify them as mistakes. Under these conditions, proofreaders tend to see only what they want to see. all right\n\n==Digital==\nDigital proofreading has taken many forms in recent years, such as assistive software and [[grammar checker|grammar checking tools]] that have made finding and correcting errors convenient for writers of all kinds. These systems are unreliable. As well, new cloud computing developments such as Google doc editing services have allowed for real-time editing and proofreading that can be done for clients while they watch the process, thus helping them to improve their writing.\n\n==In fiction==\nExamples of proofreaders in fiction include ''[[The History of the Siege of Lisbon]]'' (''Historia do Cerco de Lisboa''), a 1989 novel by Nobel laureate [[Jose Saramago]], the short story \"Proofs\" in [[George Steiner]]'s ''Proofs and Three Parables'' (1992), and the short story \"Evermore\" in ''Cross Channel'' (1996) by Julian Barnes, in which the protagonist Miss Moss is a proofreader for a dictionary. Under the headline \"Orthographical\" in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', [[Leopold Bloom]], watching the typesetter foreman Mr. Nannetti read over a \"limp galleypage\", thinks \"Proof fever\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iS04PaSssQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=uLYSSES&hl=en&ei=OYrDTOapM5LSsAPt5sTUBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=proof%20fever&f=false |title=Ulysses \u2013 James Joyce \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>\n\n== Demand for proof-editing ==\n\nFor documents that do not require a formal [[typesetting]] process, such as reports, journal articles and e-publications, the costs involved with making changes at the proofreading stage are no longer as relevant. This, along with the time and cost pressures felt by businesses, self-publishers and academics, has led to a demand for one-stage proofreading and copy-editing services where a professional proofreader/copy-editor \u2013 often a freelancer, sometimes now called an [[Author editing|author editor]] \u2013 will be contracted to provide an agreed level of service to an agreed deadline and cost.\n\nProof-editing tends to exist outside of the traditional publishing realm, and it usually involves a single stage of editing.

They often contain [[typo]]s introduced through human error. Traditionally, a proofreader looks at an increment of text on the copy and then compares it to the corresponding typeset increment, and then marks any errors (sometimes called 'line edits') using [[List of proofreader's marks|standard proofreaders' marks]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/mw/table/proofrea.htm \"Proofreaders' Marks,\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816210104/http://www.merriam-webster.com/mw/table/proofrea.htm |date=2010-08-16 }} Merriam Webster</ref> Unlike [[copy editing]], the defining procedure of a proofreading service is to work directly with two sets of information at the same time. Proofs are then returned to the [[Word processor|typesetter]] for correction. Correction-cycle proofs will typically have one descriptive term, such as 'bounce', 'bump', or 'revise' unique to the department or organization and used for clarity to the strict exclusion of any other. It is a common practice for 'all' such corrections, no matter how slight, to be sent again to a proofreader to be checked and initialed, thus establishing the principle of higher responsibility for proofreaders as compared to their typesetters or artists.\n\n===Alternative methods===\n'Copy holding' or 'copy reading' employs two readers per proof. The first reads the text aloud literally as it appears, usually at a comparatively fast but uniform rate. The second reader follows along and marks any pertinent differences between what is read and what was typeset. This method is appropriate for large quantities of [[boilerplate text]] where it is assumed that there will be comparatively few mistakes.\n\nExperienced copy holders employ various [[codes]] and verbal short-cuts that accompany their reading. The spoken word 'digits', for example, means that the numbers about to be read are not words spelled out; and 'in a hole' can mean that the upcoming segment of text is within [[parenthesis|parentheses]]. 'Bang' means an [[exclamation point]]. A 'thump' or 'screamer' made with a finger on the table represents the [[List of typographic features|initial cap]], [[comma]], [[Full stop|period]], or similar obvious attribute being read simultaneously. Thus the line of text ''(He said the address was 1234 Central Blvd., and to hurry!)'' would be read aloud as \"''in a hole'' [thump] ''he said the address was digits 1 2 3 4'' [thump] ''central'' [thump] ''buluhvuhd'' [thump] ''comma and to hurry bang''\". Mutual understanding is the only guiding principle, so codes evolve as opportunity permits. In the above example, two thumps after 'buluhvuhd' might be acceptable to proofreaders familiar with the text.\n\n'Double reading'. A single proofreader checks a proof in the traditional manner and then another reader repeats the process. Both initial the proof. Note that with both copy holding and double reading, responsibility for a given proof is necessarily shared by two individuals.\n\n'Scanning', used to check a proof without reading it word for word, has become common with computerization of typesetting and the popularization of [[Word processor|word processing]]. Many publishers have their own proprietary typesetting systems,<ref>See 1983, http://www.bowne.com/about/timeline.asp  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429014855/http://www.bowne.com/about/timeline.asp |date=April 29, 2010 }}</ref> while their customers use commercial programs such as [[Microsoft Word|Word]]. Before the data in a Word file can be published, it must be converted into a format used by the publisher. The end product is usually called a ''conversion.'' If a customer has already proofread the contents of a file before submitting it to a publisher, there will be no reason for another proofreader to re-read it from the copy (although this additional service may be requested and paid for). Instead, the publisher is held responsible only for formatting errors, such as typeface, page width, and alignment of [[Column (typography)|columns]] in [[Table (database)|tables]]; and production errors such as text inadvertently deleted. To simplify matters further, a given conversion will usually be assigned a specific [[Template (file format)|template]]. Given typesetters of sufficient skill, experienced proofreaders familiar with their typesetters' work can accurately scan their pages without reading the text for errors that neither they nor their typesetters are responsible for.\n\n===Style guides and checklists===\nProofreaders are expected to be consistently accurate by default because they occupy the last stage of typographic production before [[publication]].\n\nBefore it is typeset, copy is often marked up by an editor or customer with various instructions as to typefaces, art, and layout. Often these individuals will consult a [[style guide]] of varying degrees of complexity and completeness. Such guides are usually produced in-house by the staff or supplied by the customer, and it should be distinguished from professional references such as ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'', ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', and ''[[The Gregg Reference Manual|Gregg Reference Manual]]''. When appropriate, proofreaders may mark errors in accordance with their house guide instead of the copy when the two conflict. Where this is the case, the proofreader may justifiably be considered a ''copy editor''.\n\nChecklists are common in proof-rooms where there is sufficient uniformity of product to distill some or all of its components to a list. They may also act as a training tool for new hires. Checklists are never comprehensive, however: proofreaders still have to find all mistakes that are ''not'' mentioned or described, thus limiting their usefulness.\n\n===Qualifications===\nThe educational level of proofreaders, in general, is on a par with that of their co-workers. Typesetters, graphic artists, and word processors rarely need to have a [[college degree]], and a perusal of online job listings for proofreaders will show that although listings may specify a degree for proofreaders, many do not.{{Original research inline|date=August 2011}} Those same listings will also show a tendency for degree-only positions to be in [[Company|firms]] in [[Commerce|commercial]] fields such as [[retail]], [[medicine]], or [[insurance]], where the data to be read is internal documentation not intended for public consumption per se.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Such listings, specifying a single proofreader to fill a single position, are more likely to require a degree as a method of reducing the candidate pool but also because the degree is perceived{{by whom|date=April 2016}} as a requirement for any potentially promotable [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] applicant. Experience is discounted at the outset in preference to a credential, indicating a relatively low starting [[wage]] appropriate for younger applicants. In these kinds of [[Human multitasking|multitasking]] [[Desktop publishing|desktop-publishing]] environments, [[human resources]] departments may even classify proofreading as a clerical skill generic to literacy itself. Where this occurs, it is not unusual for proofreaders to find themselves guaranteeing the accuracy of higher-paid co-workers.\n\nIn contrast, [[Printing|printers]], [[publishers]], [[advertising agencies]] and [[law firms]] tend not to require a degree specifically. In these professionally demanding single-tasking environments, the educational divide surrounds the production department instead of the company itself. Promotion is rare for these proofreaders because they tend to be valued more for their present skill set than for any potential [[leadership]] ability. They are often supervised by a typesetter also without a degree, or by an administrative manager with little or no production experience who delegates day-to-day responsibilities to a typesetter.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It follows that such listings tend to stress experience, offer commensurately higher pay rates, and mention a proofreading test.\n\n===Proofreader testing===\n'''Applicants'''. Although many commercial and college-level proofreading courses of varying quality can be found online, practical job training for proofreaders has declined along with its status as a [[Craft unions|craft]]. Many books also teach the basics to their readers. Such tools of self-preparation have by and large replaced formal workplace instruction.\n\nProofreader applicants are tested on their [[spelling]], speed, and skill in finding mistakes in a sample text. Toward that end, they may be given a list of ten or twenty classically difficult words and a proofreading test, both tightly timed. The proofreading test will often have a maximum number of errors per quantity of text and a minimum amount of time to find them. The goal of this approach is to identify those with the best skill set.\n\nA contrasting approach is to identify and reward persistence more than an arbitrarily high level of expertise. For the spelling portion of the test, that can be accomplished by providing a dictionary, lengthening the wordlist conspicuously, and making clear that the test is not timed. For the proofreading portion, a suitable language-usage reference book (e.g., ''The Chicago Manual of Style'') can be provided. (Note that knowing where to find needed information in such specialized books is itself an effective component of the test.) Removing the pressure of what is essentially an [[wikt:ASAP|ASAP]] deadline will identify those applicants with slightly greater reservoirs of persistence, stamina, and commitment. At the same time, by mooting the need for applicants to make use of a memorized list of difficult words and a studied knowledge of the more common grammatical traps (''affect, effect, lay, lie''), applicants learn that their success depends on a quality at least theoretically available to anyone at any time without preparation.\n\n'''Formal employee testing''' is usually planned and announced well in advance, and may have titles, such as ''Levels Testing'', ''Skills Evaluation'', etc. They are found in corporate or governmental environments with enough HR staff to prepare and administer a test.\n\n'''Informal employee testing''' takes place whenever a manager feels the need to take a random sampling of a proofreader's work by double-reading selected pages. Usually, this is done without warning, and sometimes it will be done secretly. It can be highly effective, and there will certainly be times when such re-reading is justified, but care must be taken.\n\nThere are two basic approaches. The first is to re-read a proof within its deadline and in the department itself. Thus the manager will read from the same copy that the first reader saw, and be aware of any volume and deadline pressures the first reader was under, and can directly observe the individual in real time. This approach can also be followed as a matter of routine. The goal then is not to confirm a specific suspicion of poor job performance by a particular reader, but rather to confirm a general assumption that the proofreading staff needs ongoing monitoring.\n\nThe second approach to informal testing is to wait for some days or weeks and then, as time allows, randomly select proofs to re-read while outside the department. Such proofs may or may not be accompanied by the copy pages that the proofreader saw. Here the re-reader is examining the proof from the perspective of typographical and formatting accuracy alone, ignoring how many other pages the first reader had read that day, and had yet to read, and how many pages were successfully read and how many deadlines were met under a given day's specific conditions.\n\n===Economics===\nProofreading cannot be fully cost-effective where volume or unpredictable workflow prevents proofreaders from managing their own time. Examples are [[newspapers]], [[Thermographic printing|thermographic]] trade printing of [[business cards]], and network hubs. The problem in each of these environments is that jobs cannot be put aside to be re-read as needed. In the first two cases, volumes and deadlines dictate that all jobs be finished as soon as possible; in the third case, jobs presently on-site at the hub are hurried, regardless of their formal deadline, in favor of possible future work that may arrive unpredictably. Where proofs can programmatically{{clarify|date=May 2013}} be read only once, the quality will randomly but persistently fall below expectations. Even the best and most experienced readers will not be able to be consistently accurate enough to justify premium pay.\n\nProduction technology can also moot the need to pay a premium for proofreading. In the example of thermographic business-card printing, even when there are no reprints, there is considerable wastage of paper and ink in preparing each of the press runs, which are separated by color. When (as often happens) there is unused space available on the [[Printing plate|plate]], there is no increase in production cost for reprints that use that space. Only when reprints are so numerous that they push production staff into significant [[overtime]] would they increase costs. But significant overtime is usually the result of a high volume in new orders using up the [[Eight hour day|eight-hour day]]. In such industries proofreading need only \u2013 and can only \u2013 make a marginal difference to be cost-effective. As for the customers, many will never return even when their jobs are perfect, and enough of those who do need a reprint will find the retailer's cost-saving price to be satisfactory enough to tolerate a late delivery.\n\nOnly where workload volume does not compress all deadlines to ASAP and the workflow is reasonably steady can proofreading be worth a premium [[wage]]. Strict deadlines mandate a delivery time, but in doing so they necessarily do not mandate delivery ''before'' that time. If deadlines are consistently maintained instead of arbitrarily moved up, proofreaders can manage their own time by putting proofs aside at their own discretion for re-reading later. Whether the interval is a few seconds or overnight, it enables proofs to be viewed as both familiar and new. Where this procedure is followed, managers can expect consistently superior performance. However, re-reading concentrates responsibility instead of sharing it (as double-reading and copy holding, both described above, do), and it requires more effort from proofreaders and a measure of freedom from management. Instead of managers controlling deadlines, deadlines control managers, and leeway is passed to the proofreaders as well as commensurate pay.\n\n===Proofreading and copy-editing===\nThe term ''proofreading'' is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to copy-editing, and vice versa. Although there is necessarily some overlap, proofreaders typically lack any real editorial or managerial authority. What they ''can'' do is mark queries for typesetters, editors, or authors. To clarify matters at the outset, some advertised vacancies come with a notice that the job advertised is not a writing or editing position and will not become one. Creativity and critical thinking by their very nature conflict with the strict copy-''following'' discipline that [[Commerce|commercial]] and [[United States Government Printing Office|governmental]] proofreading requires. Thus proofreading and editing are fundamentally separate responsibilities. In contrast, ''copy editors'' focus on a sentence-by-sentence analysis of the text to \"clean it up\" by improving grammar, spelling, punctuation, syntax, and structure. The copy editor is usually the last editor that an author will work with. Copy editing focuses intensely on style, content, punctuation, [[grammar]], and consistency of usage.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.proofreadingcamp.com/types-editing-proofreading/ | title=Copy That: The Categories and Classes of Editing| author=ProofreadingCamp.com | accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Self==\nPrimary examples include job seekers' own [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]s and student term papers. Proofreading such material presents a special challenge, first because the proofreader/editor is usually the author; second because such authors are usually unaware of the inevitability of mistakes and the effort required to find them; and third, as final mistakes are often found when stress levels are highest and time shortest, readers fail to identify them as mistakes. Under these conditions, proofreaders tend to see only what they want to see.\n\n==Digital==\nDigital proofreading has taken many forms in recent years, such as assistive software and [[grammar checker|grammar checking tools]] that have made finding and correcting errors convenient for writers of all kinds. These systems are unreliable. As well, new cloud computing developments such as Google doc editing services have allowed for real-time editing and proofreading that can be done for clients while they watch the process, thus helping them to improve their writing.\n\n==In fiction==\nExamples of proofreaders in fiction include ''[[The History of the Siege of Lisbon]]'' (''Historia do Cerco de Lisboa''), a 1989 novel by Nobel laureate [[Jose Saramago]], the short story \"Proofs\" in [[George Steiner]]'s ''Proofs and Three Parables'' (1992), and the short story \"Evermore\" in ''Cross Channel'' (1996) by Julian Barnes, in which the protagonist Miss Moss is a proofreader for a dictionary. Under the headline \"Orthographical\" in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', [[Leopold Bloom]], watching the typesetter foreman Mr. Nannetti read over a \"limp galleypage\", thinks \"Proof fever\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iS04PaSssQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=uLYSSES&hl=en&ei=OYrDTOapM5LSsAPt5sTUBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=proof%20fever&f=false |title=Ulysses \u2013 James Joyce \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>\n\n== Demand for proof-editing ==\n\nFor documents that do not require a formal [[typesetting]] process, such as reports, journal articles and e-publications, the costs involved with making changes at the proofreading stage are no longer as relevant. This, along with the time and cost pressures felt by businesses, self-publishers and academics, has led to a demand for one-stage proofreading and copy-editing services where a professional proofreader/copy-editor \u2013 often a freelancer, sometimes now called an [[Author editing|author editor]] \u2013 will be contracted to provide an agreed level of service to an agreed deadline and cost.\n\nProof-editing tends to exist outside of the traditional publishing realm, and it usually involves a single stage of editing. It is considered preferable to have separate copy-editing and proofreading stages, so proof-editing is, by definition, a compromise but one that modern professional on-screen proofreaders and copy-editors are increasingly offering in order to meet the demand for flexible proofreading and editing services.\n\n===  An example table of distinctions between different services: editing, copy-editing, proof-editing and proofreading  ===\n\nAs this is such a new term (discussed in a guest blog<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Liz |date=16 July 2015 |title=Different types of editing \u2013 do the labels matter? |url=http://blog.ciep.uk/different-types-of-editing/ |department=CIEP blog|publisher=Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading |access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref> on the [[Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading]] website) and tends to be offered by freelancers to individuals and companies rather than being a formal, industry-defined service, exactly what is included can vary.

Some of these countries had large colonies abroad or had great economic power. [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] had just been through [[Spanish Civil War|its civil war]], which ended on April 1, 1939 (five months prior to the [[Invasion of Poland]])\u2014a war that involved several countries that subsequently [[Participants in World War II|participated in World War II]].\n\nDuring World War II, the neutral powers took no official side, hoping to avoid attack.  However, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland all helped the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] by supplying \"voluntary\" brigades {{citation needed|date=August 2018}} to the [[United Kingdom]], while Spain avoided the Allies in favor of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]], supplying them with its own voluntary brigade, the [[Blue Division]]. Ireland generally favoured the Allied side, as with the United States. The United States remained neutral until 8 December 1941, a day following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|sneak attack by Japan on Pearl Harbor]].\n\nThe [[Lateran Treaty]] between Italy and the Vatican, signed in 1929, required that the Pope maintain \"perpetual neutrality in international relations\"\u2014making the [[Vatican City]] a neutral state.\n\nSeveral countries suffered invasions in spite of their efforts to be neutral. These included [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Occupation of Denmark|invasion of Denmark]] [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|and Norway]] on 9 April 1940\u2014[[Battle of Belgium|then Belgium]], [[History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)|the Netherlands]], [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|and Luxembourg]] on 10 May 1940. On the same day, 10 May 1940, the British, having already invaded the Faroe Islands in April, [[Invasion of Iceland|invaded Iceland]] and established an occupying force ([[Invasion of Iceland#United States occupation force|subsequently replaced]] by the then-neutral United States). In the Baltic states, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of the Baltic states|invaded Lithuania]] on 15 June 1940 and [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Latvia and Estonia]] on 17 June. In the Balkans, the [[Italo-Greek War]] began on 28 October 1940 and [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia was invaded]] in April 1941. Iran was also [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|attacked and occupied]] by Britain and the Soviet Union in August 1941.\n\nSee also the [[History of Afghanistan|histories of Afghanistan]], [[History of Andorra#20th century|Andorra]], [[History of Guatemala#Early 20th century|Guatemala]], [[History of Liechtenstein#Liechtenstein during the World Wars|Liechtenstein]], [[History of Saudi Arabia#Abdul Aziz and the foundation of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and [[History of Yemen#Mutawakkilite kingdom and southern protectorates|Yemen]] during this period.\n\n==Continent== \n===Europe===\n====Ireland====\n{{Main|Irish neutrality during World War II}}\n{{See also|Bombing of Dublin in World War II}}\n\n*{{Flag|Ireland}} \u2013 The policy of [[Irish neutrality]] during [[World War II]] was adopted by the [[Oireachtas]] ([[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] Parliament) at the instigation of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], the [[Taoiseach]] ([[head of government]]) upon the outbreak of hostilities in Europe. It was maintained throughout the conflict, in spite of [[Bombing of Dublin in World War II|several German air raids]] (understood to be by aircraft that missed their intended targets in Britain or Northern Ireland) and [[MV Kerlogue|attacks on Ireland's shipping fleet by Allies and Axis alike]]. De Valera refrained from joining either the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] or [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. creepyyyyyy\n\n====Portugal====\n{{Main|Portugal in World War II}}\n\n*{{Flag|Estado Novo (Portugal)|name=Portugal}} \u2013 Portugal was officially neutral during World War II. However, it maintained a close relationship with the UK, due to the [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance]] it had for the last six hundred years, which is the longest lasting military alliance in history. The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] sought neutrality in order to keep Spain neutral and prevent it from joining the Axis. Portugal allowed the United States to use a secret military base at [[Santa Maria Airport (Azores)|Santa Maria Airport]] in the [[Azores]] through a military agreement signed on November 28, 1944. This violated its neutrality and rendered Portugal non-belligerent on the Allied side.\n\nColonies of Portugal:\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] \n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Colonial Cape Verde|Cape Verde]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Guinea]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese India]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Colonial Macau|Macau]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Colonial S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Timor]] (Occupied by [[Japan]] from 1942 to 1945)\n\n==== Spain ====\n{{Main|Spain in World War II}}{{Further|Meeting at Hendaye|Blue Division}}[[File:Meeting at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|right|[[Meeting at Hendaye|Meeting at Hendaye between Franco and Hitler in October 1940]].]]\n{{Flag|Spanish State|1938|name=Spain}} Initially holding to formal neutrality, once Italy entered the war in June 1940 [[Francisco Franco]] switched Spain to the status of \"[[non-belligerent]]\" and proceeded to occupy [[Tangiers]].

A decreasingly relevant Serrano Su\u00f1er was still able to create the [[Division Azul|Blue Division]],{{Sfn|Egido Le\u00f3n|2005|p=116}} of volunteers to fight for the Axis.  With the conflict decidedly turning towards the Allies, on 1 October 1943 Franco returned the status of Spain to one of \"vigilant neutrality\".{{Sfn|Egido Le\u00f3n|2005|p=122}} \n\nSpain was a key provider of [[Tungsten]] (a strategic metal) to Nazi Germany during the conflict; amid [[Wolfram Crisis|heavy diplomatic pressure from the Allies]], the supplies decreased after the signing of a secret deal between Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom on 2 May 1944 that led to the fixing of a drastic limit on exports of Tungsten to Germany and the ejection of German spies from Spanish soil.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Espa\u00f1a y la segunda guerra mundial, 1939-1945: entre resignaciones neutralistas y tentaciones beligerantes\n | chapter-url=https://publicaciones.unirioja.es/catalogo/online/Historia_nuestro_tiempo_5/pdf/06_Moradiellos.pdf\n | first=Enrique|last=Moradiellos|page=72\u201373|editor=Carlos Navajas Zubeldia & Diego Iturriaga Barco \n | title=Siglo.

When Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union in the [[Winter War]], Sweden changed its position that of a [[non-belligerent]], which was not defined by international treaties, thus freeing Sweden of the restrictions of neutrality.  Among other things, it allowed the Swedish government to support Finland during the [[Winter War]].  It also allowed German soldiers on leave to travel through Sweden, and a combat division was once allowed to travel from Norway to Finland through Sweden.  The later [[transit of German troops through Finland and Sweden]] and [[Swedish iron-ore mining during World War II]] helped the German war effort.  Sweden had disarmed after World War I, and were in no position to resist German threats militarily by 1940.  \n\nIn 1943, the [[Swedish Armed Forces|Armed Forces of Sweden]] were much improved and all such deals with Germany were terminated.  Hitler considered invading Sweden, but when G\u00f6ring protested, Hitler dropped the plan. [[SKF]] supplied the majority of ball-bearings used in Germany, and were important also to Allied aircraft production.  <ref>[https://www.econhist.gu.se/digitalAssets/1341/1341645_golson.pdf Did Swedish Ball Bearings Keep the Second World War Going? Re\u2010evaluating Neutral Sweden\u2019s Role]</ref>\n\nSwedish Intelligence cracked the [[Geheimschreiber]], and shared decrypted information with the Allies.  Stalin was informed well in advance about Hitler's planned invasion of the Soviet Union, but he choose not to believe the information.  \n\nDanish resistance worked with Sweden and effected the 1943 [[Rescue of the Danish Jews]], shipping the Jews to Sweden.  During the [[Liberation of Finnmark]] it sent [[Norwegian police troops in Sweden during World War II|Norwegian \"police\" troops]] over the border to link up with [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces.  At the end of the war it was preparing to invade Norway and Denmark with the Allies should the occupying Wehrmacht forces refuse to accept a general armistice.\n\n====Switzerland====\n{{Main|Switzerland during the World Wars}}{{Further|Aerial Incidents in Switzerland in World War II|Operation Tannenbaum}}\n\n*{{Flag|Switzerland}} \u2013 Switzerland maintained its neutrality so as to protect its own [[Banking in Switzerland|banking interests]] from plunder by the Axis. It also depended on German coal, with 10 million tons imported during the war, making up 41% of Swiss energy supplies. Often, Swiss soldiers opened fire on Axis bombers invading their [[airspace]]. On several occasions, Switzerland also shot down Allied planes.

After the German [[Battle of France|invasion of France]], however, Turkey remained neutral, relying on a clause excusing them if military action might bring conflict with the USSR, which, after the division of Poland, Turkey feared.  In June 1941, after neighbouring Bulgaria joined the Axis and allowed Germany to move troops through to invade [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Greece|Greece]], Turkey signed a [[German\u2013Turkish Treaty of Friendship|treaty of friendship]] with Germany.

On December 29 of that year, President [[Franklin D.

Thus, they maintained the right to become belligerent if attacked while in a state of neutrality. The concept of ''neutrality in [[war]]'' is narrowly defined and puts specific constraints on the neutral party in return for the internationally recognized right to remain neutral. A wider concept is that of [[non-belligerence]]. The basic treaty covering [[Neutral states]] is Convention V of The Hague Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land (1907). It is important to note that a ''neutral country'' takes no side in a war between other parties, and in return hopes to avoid being attacked by either of them. A ''neutralist policy'' aims at neutrality in case of an armed conflict that could involve the party in question. A ''neutralist'' is an advocate of neutrality in [[international relations|international affairs]]. The concept of ''neutrality in conflicts'' is distinct from [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]], i.e., the willful desistance from [[military alliance]]s in order to preserve neutrality in case of war, and perhaps with the hope of preventing a war altogether.\n\nIn a study of Spain, Switzerland, and Sweden during the Second World War, Eric Golson found that they engaged in economic [[realpolitik]], as they traded with both the Axis and the Allied Powers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economic History of Warfare and State Formation|last=Golson|first=Eric|date=2016|publisher=Springer, Singapore|isbn=9789811016042|series=Studies in Economic History|pages=259\u2013278|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-1605-9_11|chapter = Neutrality in War}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Participants in World War II]]\n*[[Allies of World War II]]\n*[[Axis powers]]\n*[[Declarations of war during World War II]]\n*[[Latin America during World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Karsh, E. \"Neutrality and Small States.\" 1989.\n*Gabriel, J.

Some of these countries had large colonies abroad or had great economic power. [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] had just been through [[Spanish Civil War|its civil war]], which ended on April 1, 1939 (five months prior to the [[Invasion of Poland]])\u2014a war that involved several countries that subsequently [[Participants in World War II|participated in World War II]].\n\nDuring World War II, the neutral powers took no official side, hoping to avoid attack.  However, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland all helped the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] by supplying \"voluntary\" brigades {{citation needed|date=August 2018}} to the [[United Kingdom]], while Spain avoided the Allies in favor of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]], supplying them with its own voluntary brigade, the [[Blue Division]]. Ireland generally favoured the Allied side, as with the United States. The United States remained neutral until 8 December 1941, a day following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|sneak attack by Japan on Pearl Harbor]].\n\nThe [[Lateran Treaty]] between Italy and the Vatican, signed in 1929, required that the Pope maintain \"perpetual neutrality in international relations\"\u2014making the [[Vatican City]] a neutral state.\n\nSeveral countries suffered invasions in spite of their efforts to be neutral. These included [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Occupation of Denmark|invasion of Denmark]] [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|and Norway]] on 9 April 1940\u2014[[Battle of Belgium|then Belgium]], [[History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)|the Netherlands]], [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|and Luxembourg]] on 10 May 1940. On the same day, 10 May 1940, the British, having already invaded the Faroe Islands in April, [[Invasion of Iceland|invaded Iceland]] and established an occupying force ([[Invasion of Iceland#United States occupation force|subsequently replaced]] by the then-neutral United States). In the Baltic states, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of the Baltic states|invaded Lithuania]] on 15 June 1940 and [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Latvia and Estonia]] on 17 June. In the Balkans, the [[Italo-Greek War]] began on 28 October 1940 and [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia was invaded]] in April 1941. Iran was also [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|attacked and occupied]] by Britain and the Soviet Union in August 1941.\n\nSee also the [[History of Afghanistan|histories of Afghanistan]], [[History of Andorra#20th century|Andorra]], [[History of Guatemala#Early 20th century|Guatemala]], [[History of Liechtenstein#Liechtenstein during the World Wars|Liechtenstein]], [[History of Saudi Arabia#Abdul Aziz and the foundation of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and [[History of Yemen#Mutawakkilite kingdom and southern protectorates|Yemen]] during this period.\n\n==Continent== \n===Europe===\n====Ireland====\n{{Main|Irish neutrality during World War II}}\n{{See also|Bombing of Dublin in World War II}}\n\n*{{Flag|Ireland}} \u2013 The policy of [[Irish neutrality]] during [[World War II]] was adopted by the [[Oireachtas]] ([[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] Parliament) at the instigation of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], the [[Taoiseach]] ([[head of government]]) upon the outbreak of hostilities in Europe. It was maintained throughout the conflict, in spite of [[Bombing of Dublin in World War II|several German air raids]] (understood to be by aircraft that missed their intended targets in Britain or Northern Ireland) and [[MV Kerlogue|attacks on Ireland's shipping fleet by Allies and Axis alike]]. De Valera refrained from joining either the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] or [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]].\n\n====Portugal====\n{{Main|Portugal in World War II}}\n\n*{{Flag|Estado Novo (Portugal)|name=Portugal}} \u2013 Portugal was officially neutral during World War II. However, it maintained a close relationship with the UK, due to the [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance]] it had for the last six hundred years, which is the longest lasting military alliance in history. The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] sought neutrality in order to keep Spain neutral and prevent it from joining the Axis. Portugal allowed the United States to use a secret military base at [[Santa Maria Airport (Azores)|Santa Maria Airport]] in the [[Azores]] through a military agreement signed on November 28, 1944. This violated its neutrality and rendered Portugal non-belligerent on the Allied side.\n\nColonies of Portugal:\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] \n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Colonial Cape Verde|Cape Verde]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Guinea]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese India]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Colonial Macau|Macau]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Colonial S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]\n::*{{Flagicon|Portugal}} [[Portuguese Timor]] (Occupied by [[Japan]] from 1942 to 1945)\n\n==== Spain ====\n{{Main|Spain in World War II}}{{Further|Meeting at Hendaye|Blue Division}}[[File:Meeting at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|right|[[Meeting at Hendaye|Meeting at Hendaye between Franco and Hitler in October 1940]].]]\n{{Flag|Spanish State|1938|name=Spain}} Initially holding to formal neutrality, once Italy entered the war in June 1940 [[Francisco Franco]] switched Spain to the status of \"[[non-belligerent]]\" and proceeded to occupy [[Tangiers]].

When Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union in the [[Winter War]], Sweden changed its position that of a [[non-belligerent]], which was not defined by international treaties, thus freeing Sweden of the restrictions of neutrality.  Among other things, it allowed the Swedish government to support Finland during the [[Winter War]].  It also allowed German soldiers on leave to travel through Sweden, and a combat division was once allowed to travel from Norway to Finland through Sweden.  The later [[transit of German troops through Finland and Sweden]] and [[Swedish iron-ore mining during World War II]] helped the German war effort.  Sweden had disarmed after World War I, and were in no position to resist German threats militarily by 1940.  \n\nIn 1943, the [[Swedish Armed Forces|Armed Forces of Sweden]] were much improved and all such deals with Germany were terminated.  Hitler considered invading Sweden, but when G\u00f6ring protested, Hitler dropped the plan. [[SKF]] supplied the majority of ball-bearings used in Germany, and were important also to Allied aircraft production.  <ref>[https://www.econhist.gu.se/digitalAssets/1341/1341645_golson.pdf Did Swedish Ball Bearings Keep the Second World War Going?

Stalin was informed well in advance about Hitler's planned invasion of the Soviet Union, but he choose not to believe the information.  \n\nDanish resistance worked with Sweden and effected the 1943 [[Rescue of the Danish Jews]], shipping the Jews to Sweden.  During the [[Liberation of Finnmark]] it sent [[Norwegian police troops in Sweden during World War II|Norwegian \"police\" troops]] over the border to link up with [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces.

It also depended on German coal, with 10 million tons imported during the war, making up 41% of Swiss energy supplies. Often, Swiss soldiers opened fire on Axis bombers invading their [[airspace]]. On several occasions, Switzerland also shot down Allied planes. Throughout the war, cities in Switzerland were [[Bombings of Switzerland in World War II|accidentally bombed by both Axis and Allied airplanes]].
