{"title_page": "List of Warriors characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{for|characters in the American crime-related media franchise|List of The Warriors characters}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Very long|date=May 2015}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=October 2019}}\n}}\nThe ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' novel series is written by [[Erin Hunter]]. Due to the large number of characters present in the novel series, this list is divided by Clan, e.g., all characters in [[#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]] (as of The Silent Thaw) are put together in the allegiances list.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Naming convention==\nIn [[#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]], [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]], [[#WindClan|WindClan]], [[#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]], and [[#SkyClan|SkyClan]], each cat's name has a prefix (Dawn, Bramble, Lion, Crow, and so on).  As a kit they will have \"-kit\" at the end of their name. E.g. Dawnkit, Bramblekit, Lionkit, Crowkit. When they are an apprentice \"-paw\" will be at the end of their name (Dawnpaw, Bramblepaw, Lionpaw, Crowpaw, and so on). When that cat is made a warrior or medicine cat, the suffix to their name will be changed (Dawnpelt, Brambleclaw, Lionblaze, Crowfeather, and so on). If a cat ever becomes a leader, they will be granted the suffix -star at the end of their name. (Dawnstar, Bramblestar, Lionstar, Crowstar, and so on).\n\nIn The Tribe of Rushing Water, cat's names have no set prefixes or suffixes. A cat's mother will name her kitten after the first memorable thing the mother sees after giving birth (for example, \"Brook Where Small Fish Swim\" and \"Night of No Stars\").\n\n==ThunderClan==\nThunderClan is named after its first leader and founder, Thunder, and is the main Clan of the ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' series, as all the series' (except the series Dawn Of The Clans) protagonists are ThunderClan cats. During the original series, ThunderClan resides in the forest, sandwiched between [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] and [[#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]] on each side. They share very little territory borders with [[#WindClan|WindClan]], and as such most of the trouble ThunderClan is forced to deal with originates either from RiverClan or ShadowClan (mostly ShadowClan). ThunderClan cats are accustomed to stalking through the thick underbrush of the forest, and are the sole users of the \"hunter's crouch\", a stalking technique used to hunt most forest-born prey in which a cat crouches down, stores energy in  hind legs, and springs onto the target. Their main diet includes mice, voles, squirrels, rabbits, thrushes, magpies, birds, and shrews. Sometimes a warrior will have to eat a rat or Twoleg food.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nThunderClan, along with the other Clans, undergoes a dramatic shift in territory during the course of the ''New Prophecy'' series. During the time that Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw and the others are on their journey, much of ThunderClan's territory is destroyed as the Twolegs proceed with their deforestation of the area.<ref name=moonrise/>{{rp|320}} Eventually ThunderClan and the other Clans are able to relocate to the lake territory, the ThunderClan camp of which is set in an abandoned quarry. The camp is protected by high walls of stone, but the surrounding territory is similar to the forest in which ThunderClan previously inhabited.<ref name=starlight>{{cite book|title=[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082762-5}}</ref> As such, their sources of prey remain largely unchanged from the original series. Like many of the other Clans, ThunderClan's role is largely undefined in this series, due to the drastic changes all Clans are forced to undergo and adapt to. Some ThunderClan cats include: Firestar, Bramblestar, Leafpool, Sandstorm, Spottedleaf, Graystripe, Dovewing, Ivypool, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf.\n\n===''Bluestar's Prophecy''===\n\n====Pinestar====\nA red-brown tom with green eyes, '''Pinestar''' was the leader of ThunderClan when Bluestar was born. His warrior name was Pineheart. When he only had one life left, he decided to step down as leader and become a [[Housecat|kittypet]], having become increasingly disillusioned with the [[violence]] and contrasting fragility of Clan life. He was Leopardfoot's mate and the father of Tigerstar and grandfather of Tawnypelt, Brambleclaw, Hawkfrost, and Mothwing and great-grandfather of Flametail, Dawnpelt, Tigerheart, Sparkpelt, Alderheart, Juniperkit, and Dandelionkit and the great-great-grandfather of Sleekwhisker, Juniperclaw, Strikestone, Shadowkit, Pouncekit and Lightkit. He was accepted by StarClan when he did die, and gave Bluestar a life, the gift of [[compassion]]. He also gave a life of being aware of what goes on beyond Clan borders to his son, Tigerclaw.\n\n====Sunstar====\n'''Sunstar''', a bright ginger tom with green eyes and yellow tabby stripes, was the leader before Bluestar. He was the deputy of ThunderClan in ''Bluestar's Prophecy'' and his warrior name was '''Sunfall'''. He was Bluepaw's mentor, after her former mentor, Stonepelt, had to move to the elder's den, due to an injury that did not heal properly. Sunfall encouraged Bluefur every time she was downhearted, specifically after the deaths of Moonflower, Snowfur, and the \"disappearance\" of her kits, Mosskit, Stonekit and Mistykit. Sunstar became leader when Pinestar stepped down to become a kittypet. Sunstar's original deputy, Tawnyspots, had to retire early (due to sickness) and Sunstar needed another cat to be deputy, a position which [[#Thistleclaw|Thistleclaw]] wanted badly; however, he chose Bluefur instead because he thought Thistleclaw was too violent and Bluefur lost so much yet was still selfless. Sunstar had a secret: because Pinestar still had one life left when Sunstar had his leader ceremony, StarClan only gave him eight lives, instead of nine. Sunstar later died after being weakened by sickness and unable to outrun a Twoleg dog. At Bluestar's leader ceremony, Sunstar gave to her the gift of courage. In Bluestar's Prophecy, he was implied to be in love with Moonflower. His brother was Featherwhisker, ThunderClan's medicine cat before Spottedleaf.<ref name=bluestar/>\n\n====Moonflower====\n'''Moonflower''' is a silver-grey tabby queen with pale yellow eyes, mother of [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] and [[#Snowfur|Snowfur]], and mate of Stormtail. She is also the littermate of [[#Goosefeather|Goosefeather]]. Moonflower acted hostile towards Goosefeather when he wasn't watching Snowkit and Bluekit while they snuck into the medicine supplies and Snowkit ate two poppy seeds. Goosefeather believes she made a mistake in mating with Stormtail, since he really loved Dappletail instead. Moonflower and many other warriors joined in on an attack on the WindClan camp and she had to attack the medicine cat supplies. [[#Hawkheart|Hawkheart]], the WindClan medicine cat, killed Moonflower. Since her death, Bluestar felt heavy with grief. At Bluestar's leader ceremony, she gave to her the gift of love, to cherish her Clan as she cherished her kits.<ref name=bluestar/> She is also grandmother of Stonefur, Mistyfoot and Mosskit.\n\n====Snowfur====\n'''Snowfur''' is a snowy white queen with blue eyes and black ear tips. She is the sister of [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]]. She and Bluestar had a strong sibling bond which was threatened by the events in when Snowfur falls in love with [[#Thistleclaw|Thistleclaw]] and Bluefur disapproves as shown in'' [[Bluestar's Prophecy (Warriors)|Bluestar's Prophecy]]''. She has one kit with Thistleclaw, [[#Whitestorm|Whitekit]]. Snowfur ends up dying when chasing ShadowClan intruders across the Thunderpath, and is run over by a Twoleg monster, which causes Bluefur to go into another cycle of grief. Snowfur also told her own story about what happened to Mosskit in ''[[Secrets of the Clans]]''.<ref name=\"secrets\" /> She's daughter to Moonflower and Stormtail. Snowfur also gave Rosetail her name (when she was a kit) because of her pinkish-orange tail. At Bluestar's leader ceremony, she gave her the gift of pride, so that she knows her own worth and the worth of her Clan. She gave Bluestar's ninth life to her.<ref name=bluestar/> Snowfur, while alive, teased Bluefur about liking Oakheart, a RiverClan warrior.\n\n====Thistleclaw====\n'''Thistleclaw''' is a large, grey-and-white tabby tom with amber eyes. Bluestar suggests his name due to his spiky fur when they are both kits in the nursery. He is hot-headed and aggressive, making his relationship with the more reserved [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] quite difficult. He was also mate of Bluestar's sister, [[#Snowfur|Snowfur]], and father of [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]], Bluestar's nephew. He was also the mentor of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerpaw]] and one of the causes of Tigerstar's evil and ambitious motives. Thistleclaw at first seemed only arrogant and not interested in the long run of things, but later on, it was shown that he was paranoid and bloodthirsty, and wanted to keep other Clans out of ThunderClan territory by \"marking the borders with blood\".  In ''Crookedstar's Promise'' Crookedjaw witnessed him training in the Dark Forest. He was characterized as highly violent, which was shown when he pushed Tigerstar so hard, the cat adopted his mentor's goals, arrogance, ambition, and thirst for blood. Another example of Thistleclaw's violent nature is when he ordered his apprentice, Tigerpaw, to attack Tiny (later Scourge) when he just walked onto the borders of ThunderClan, not knowing about the Clans at the time, as described in the manga ''The Rise of Scourge'' and the super edition ''Bluestar's Prophecy''.<ref name=\"Rise of Scourge\">{{cite book|title=[[The Rise of Scourge]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-147867-3}}</ref> Goosefeather, when he was described as insane, had a vision with Bluefur, and saw Thistleclaw's pelt dripping in blood, symbolizing the trail of death that he would leave if he ever ascended to leader. Goosefeather says that he could lead ThunderClan down a path of blood if he became a leader instead of Bluefur. \n\nWhen Thistleclaw died, he was found with claws unsheathed, lips in a snarl, and lying in a pool of his own blood, just as Bluestar and Goosefeather saw in their shared vision. In ''Night Whispers'', he is shown as managing the training session in the Dark Forest. In ''Sign of the Moon'', he kills Antpelt in training.\n\n====Goosefeather====\n'''Goosefeather''' is a speckled grey tom with pale blue eyes and brother of [[#Moonflower|Moonflower]]. He was the medicine cat of ThunderClan when Bluestar was born and interprets a piece of prey (a vole with its fur bent over like a forest being blown down by wind) as a warning from StarClan that WindClan will destroy ThunderClan. He suggests that the only way to stop this was to destroy WindClan's medicine supplies; in the ensuing battle, his sister is murdered and many cats are injured, with Stonepelt's injuries forcing him to retire early. Several cats, including his niece Bluestar, blame him for the results of the battle. He was the mentor of Featherwhisker, the medicine cat before Spottedleaf. He interprets a burning branch as an omen that Bluestar is fire and will burn through the ranks of ThunderClan, but will be destroyed by water. After that, Goosefeather seems to go insane. He sees Tigerkit as a dangerous monster (ironically, though no cat believed him, this proves to be true), and that Thistleclaw will lead ThunderClan to a path of blood if he becomes leader. Although many cats think Goosefeather is insane, some of his omens and prophecies are true. He even tells Bluefur that she has to give up her kits to save ThunderClan, which she reluctantly does so. At Bluestar's leader ceremony, he gave to her the gift of patience.\n\n====Featherwhisker====\n'''Featherwhisker''' is a pale silvery tom with amber eyes, long whiskers, and a sweeping, plumy tail. He was Goosefeather's apprentice when Bluekit was born and became Spottedleaf's mentor. He showed the elders' den to Bluestar and Snowfur when they were kits. He was more trusted in ThunderClan than Goosefeather, his mentor, and was often asked to help with things that Goosefeather should have been helping with. He worked tirelessly to save his Clanmates during the green-cough epidemic, which ultimately killed him. After he died, Spottedleaf became the medicine cat. Featherwhisker is Sunstar's brother.<ref name=\"secrets\" />\n\n====Leopardfoot====\n'''Leopardfoot''' is a sleek black queen with green eyes. She is sister of Patchpelt, Redtail, Willowpelt, and Spottedleaf,  mate of [[#Pinestar|Pinestar]], and mother of Mistkit and Nightkit (both died soon after birth), and Tigerkit, later known as [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]]. She was introduced in ''Bluestar's Prophecy'' as a five-month-old kit. She later on had her kits early and was weakened. She gave Tigerkit his tough name because he was the weakest of the litter. Her parents were Adderfang and Swiftbreeze.<ref name=bluestar/> Her mate was Pinestar, who left the Clan to be a [[Kittypet]] shortly before Mistkit and Nightkit's deaths.\n\n====Swiftbreeze====\n'''Swiftbreeze''' is a tabby and white queen with yellow eyes. She is mother of Leopardfoot, Patchpelt, and in a later litter Willowpelt, Spottedleaf and Redtail. Swiftbreeze is mate to Adderfang, a brown tabby warrior. She was introduced in ''Bluestar's Prophecy'' as a queen who liked to show off about her kits. She is grandmother to Tigerstar and great-grandmother to Bramblestar, Hawkfrost, Mothwing, and Tawnypelt.\n\n====Thrushpelt====\n'''Thrushpelt''' is a sandy-grey tom with a white flash on his chest and green eyes. He was a newly appointed warrior when [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] was a kit. He had a crush on Bluestar and everyone took notice, leading the Clan to believe he was the father of [[#Stonefur|Stonefur]], [[#Mistystar|Mistystar]], and [[#Mosskit|Mosskit]]. Thrushpelt knew that the kits were not his, but kept Bluestar's secret until his death even though he never knew who their real father was. Bluestar told him that she knew she would have been happy with him.<ref name=bluestar/>\n\n====Mosskit====\n'''Mosskit''' is a gray she-cat with white patches and blue eyes. She is the sister of [[#Mistystar|Mistystar]] and [[#Stonefur|Stonefur]], and the kit of [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] and [[#Oakheart|Oakheart]]. In ''Bluestar's Prophecy'' Mosskit [[Hypothermia|freezes to death]] on the way to RiverClan. Bluefur buries her in the dirt below the snow so Mosskit is not eaten by [[foxes]] when the winter thaws. In ''Bluestar's Prophecy'', she gives her mother a life as she becomes ThunderClan's leader after Sunstar. She also appears in ''Secrets of the Clans'' and ''The Last Hope''. Mosskit also once ate a maggot but did not die.\n\n===Original Series===\nThe original series covers events in the story from ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' to ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. Many characters mentioned here were introduced in the original series, but many of them play minor or significant roles in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series as well. Characters listed in the other series may have been introduced in the original series, but play larger roles in the series they are listed in.\n\n====Firestar====\n'''Firestar''', a handsome flame-colored tom with green eyes,<ref>http://www.warriorcats.com/meet-the-warriors/cats/into-the-wild/fireheart</ref> is the protagonist of the original series. Initially a kittypet named '''Rusty''', he often dreamed of hunting for his own prey in the forest beyond his owner's house (thus making him venture into the forest beyond his fence and garden). Rusty joins ThunderClan after encountering Graypaw, when he was caught actually trying to hunt prey in ThunderClan territory, and is initially established as an apprentice, being renamed '''Firepaw''' for his flame-colored pelt. Throughout the series, Firepaw gains respect within the Clan and eventually receives his warrior name of '''Fireheart''' at the end of ''Into the Wild'', along with his best friend, Graypaw, renamed Graystripe.\n\nAt the end of ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'', he becomes deputy, and finally, becomes ThunderClan's leader, '''Firestar''' at the beginning of ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', when Bluestar died from saving her Clan and Fireheart at the end of ''A Dangerous Path'' from the dog pack that Tigerstar used to try to destroy ThunderClan. Before Bluestar dies, she finally tells Fireheart that she was right about him, and that he was the \"fire\" in the prophecy, ''Fire alone can save the Clan'', which she heard before he even joined ThunderClan. Firestar was mentored by Bluestar (and, for a short time, Lionheart and Tigerclaw), and has mentored three apprentices himself: [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]], who later becomes a medicine cat apprentice to Yellowfang due to her accident on the Thunderpath (which in fact, was set up by Tigerstar as a trap that was actually meant for Bluestar) that permanently injures her leg; [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]]; and [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]](star). Cloudtail is the first-born son of his kittypet sister, [[#Princess|Princess]].\n\nFireheart met Princess when she was heavily pregnant in ''Fire and Ice''. When her kittens were born, she let Firestar have her firstborn kit to be raised as a warrior with him to ThunderClan, where Bluestar named him Cloudkit. Firestar does not possess any significant character flaws and is fully committed to the warrior code. Only sometimes will he bend the rules to help his Clan. Firestar is fiercely loyal not only to his Clan, but also to his many friends and allies that he meets along the way, regardless of their affiliation. He respects the rules of his superiors, but also has the insight to look beyond them in order to properly judge a questionable situation. As a result, he often breaks the traditional rules of the Clan (a trend started by his very inclusion into the Clan, being of house cat, or kittypet origins) in order to help his friends or rectify a situation he believes to be right. He is primarily responsible, along with his friend Graystripe, for several feats that have ensured the well-being of all the Clans, such as retrieving WindClan after they were driven out of their camp in ''Fire and Ice'',<ref name=\"fire and ice\">{{cite book|title=[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052559-0}}</ref> and hunting prey for [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] when they were damaged and forced to move out of their territory in a flood. In ''A Dangerous Path'', he professes his long-time love for Sandstorm, who is revealed to love him back.<ref name=\"dangerous path\">{{cite book|title=[[A Dangerous Path]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-000006-6}}</ref> He struggled with feelings for Spottedleaf, who died in ''Into the Wild''. As a warrior, Fireheart earned Bluestar's disapproval for frequently helping the other Clans.\n\nHe led all four Clans against the ranks of [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] as LionClan in ''[[The Darkest Hour (novel)|The Darkest Hour]]''. He kills their leader, [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]].<ref name=\"darkest hour\">{{cite book|title=[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052585-9}}</ref> Erin Hunter also disclosed that Firestar is Scourge's half-brother through their father, Jake.\n\nHe appointed Graystripe as deputy after the battle against BloodClan in ''The Darkest Hour'' after Whitestorm, the former deputy, was killed by [[List of Warriors characters#Bone|Bone]], the BloodClan deputy. Firestar maintains a significant and often highly important presence in subsequent series, ''The New Prophecy'', ''Power of Three'', and ''Omen of the Stars'' as the ever-present leader of ThunderClan. Additionally, in between the original series and ''The New Prophecy'', he travels north with his mate, [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], in order to reunite the lost and scattered descendants of [[#SkyClan|SkyClan]] in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar>{{cite book|title=[[Firestar's Quest]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-113164-6}}</ref> Also, he starred in the story for the Ultimate Leader competition, when he once more briefly unites the Clans, with heavy support from his mate, Sandstorm. Sandstorm dislikes him when he first joins ThunderClan and grows jealous when he receives his warrior name before her. Firestar also saves Sandstorm from falling over the gorge during a border fight with RiverClan in ''Fire and Ice''.\n\nHe has two daughters with his beloved and long-time mate, Sandstorm: [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]]. Both have leading roles in ''The New Prophecy'' series and side parts in the ''Power of Three'' and ''Omen of the Stars'' series. Firestar's father is a plump ginger tom called Jake, who is also the father of Princess, Luna, Tommy, Filou, Ruby,Socks,and Scourge. Jake's other mate, Quince, was the mother of Scourge, Ruby, and Socks. Firestar's mother is a tabby and white she-cat named Nutmeg. It is said on the ''Warriors'' app on iPhone and iPod that just before her kits were born, Nutmeg dreamed that one of them, a ginger tom, was standing on a huge rock out of her reach. She called for him to come down, but he did not seem to hear. Princess is Firestar's sister, and her son, Cloudtail is Firestar's nephew. Whitewing (Cloudtail's daughter). and Dovewing and Ivypool (Whitewing's daughters) his grandchildren. Whitewing, Cloudtail's daughter, has two kits: Ivypool and Dovewing. [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] is one of the Three, and completing that trio.  Ivypool trains with the [[#Dark forest|Dark Forest]], even though she doesn't want to anymore. She serves as a spy for the Three.  He is grandfather to [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] (Leafpool and Crowfeather's forbidden kits) and Alderheart, Sparkpelt, Juniperkit, and Dandelionkit (Squirrelflight and Bramblestar's kits). He is also great grandfather to Lionblaze's kits, Hollytuft, Sorrelstripe, and Fernsong.\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'', [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]] tells [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] that the fourth cat in the prophecy \"The end of the stars draws near. Three must become four to defeat the darkness that lasts forever\" is Firestar. Later in the book, Firestar loses his last life after defeating the spirit of Tigerstar, getting burned to death after standing next to a tree that catches on fire from a bolt of lightning.\n\n====Bluestar====\n'''Bluestar''' is a large, lithe, pale blue-gray she-cat with luminous, ice-blue eyes. She has thick, long, soft, fur and a broad face, head, and shoulders, with a scar that parts the fur across them, and a torn ear. She has a silver-tinted muzzle and a long, sleek tail  She was the leader of ThunderClan when Firestar (then known as Firepaw) first came to the forest which was during most of the original series. She is responsible for bringing [[#Firestar|Firestar]] into ThunderClan, a decision prompted by the alarmingly low number of apprentices in her Clan, and the prophecy \"Fire alone can save our Clan\". Bluestar serves as Firestar's mentor during his apprenticeship following a short time when Firestar is mentored by the senior warriors,<ref name=\"Into the Wild\">{{cite book|title=[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|year=2003|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-000002-8}}</ref> and eventually appoints him as her deputy after [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]]'s exile. She is known as a strong, wise and calm leader.\n\nBluestar fell in love with Oakheart, a [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] warrior and brother to Crookedstar, during her days as a warrior (when she was named '''Bluefur''', as seen in ''[[The Rise of Scourge]]'' and ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy]]''). During this time another warrior of ThunderClan (Thrushpelt, as seen in ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy]]'') began to show interest in her. She bore three of Oakheart's kits, but let the Clan believe Thrushpelt was the father, and Thrushpelt was kind enough to pretend for her. Out of her concern to the Clan, she decided to become Clan deputy instead of the violent Thistleclaw, but since she knew the Clan would never accept a queen nursing kits for a deputy, she secretly gave her kits to Oakheart to be raised in RiverClan. Only Mistykit and Stonekit made it to RiverClan; Mosskit did not survive the journey because of the cold.\n\nAfter she gave them up and returned to the camp, she scratched a hole on the back of the nursery wall, went back to her nest, and then screamed \"My kits are gone!\", so that the rest of the Clan would think that her kits were stolen by a starving fox or badger. Bluestar is able to suppress her feelings regarding her decision until Firestar, seeking to uncover the truth about Tigerclaw's deception, causes the issue to be reopened. Her feelings of regret, combined with the shock of discovering her trusted deputy's plan to kill her, cause Bluestar to sink into a manic depression. She remains in this condition throughout the events of ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'' and ''[[A Dangerous Path]]'', which worsens when the forest fire destroys the ThunderClan camp. She refuses to trust any of her warriors except Fireheart and [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]], and declares war on StarClan for dooming her Clan, saying that StarClan had said fire would save the Clan, and instead fire had destroyed it. Her faith is restored in the final moments of ''A Dangerous Path'', when in a dramatic scene she crashes into the leader of a pack of dogs, causing them to fall over the edge of the gorge and into the river. She dies shortly afterward after confiding in Fireheart that he truly was the \"fire\" that saved the Clan. Before she dies, her kits forgive her for giving them up to RiverClan.\n\nBluestar retains an authoritative role in StarClan during the events of ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series. She chose the chosen one from ThunderClan (Brambleclaw). She also reluctantly told Firestar about SkyClan in ''Firestar's Quest''.\n\nBluestar has two kits, [[#Mistystar|Mistystar]] and [[#Stonefur|Stonefur]], in RiverClan, and is mentioned in ''Secrets of the Clans'' as having a third, Mosskit, who died young during the journey to RiverClan with her littermates due to the extreme cold. Currently Mistystar is the leader of RiverClan, while Stonefur, the previous deputy, was killed in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' by Blackfoot and on Tigerstar's orders, because he was \"half-clan\". She also has a sister named Snowfur. Whitestorm is Snowfur's son, thus making him Bluestar's nephew. Her maternal uncle was Goosefeather, the medicine cat before Featherwhisker. Goosefeather gave to Bluestar her own prophecy, \"Like fire you will blaze through the forest, but beware even the strongest of flames can be destroyed by water\". The prophecy meant that Bluestar's life would be destroyed by the pain of giving up her half-RiverClan kits and it can also mean that she'd die from being drowned in the river. Although Bluestar initially thought Goosefeather's prophecy her being fire and being defeated by water to be nonsense, Bluestar was killed by water.\n\nBluestar was first mentored by Stonepelt, but after Stonepelt was forced to retire due to an injury he got from battle against WindClan, Sunfall took over her training. After Yellowfang's capture, she mentors Firestar. She has also mentored Runningwind and Frostfur. Her sister was named Snowfur, her mother was named Moonflower, and her father was named Stormtail.\n\n====Graystripe====\n'''Graystripe''' is a long-haired gray tom with a dark gray stripe along his back, and yellow eyes. He has also been mentioned with eyes the color amber, and green. He is [[#Firestar|Firestar's]] first and best friend in ThunderClan. He meets Rusty in the forest close to Rusty's kittypet home and proceeds to attack him as if he were any other intruder. When Rusty joins ThunderClan as Firepaw, the two become great friends and often train and eat together. Graypaw's mentor was Lionheart, who was killed in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''. He becomes a warrior soon after the battle with ShadowClan to rescue ThunderClan kits with Firepaw at the end of ''Into the Wild''.\n\nShortly after being promoted to a full warrior (he was named \"Graystripe\" because there is a gray stripe running down his back that is darker than the rest of his gray fur), Graystripe falls in love with a [[List of Warriors characters#RiverClan|RiverClan]] she-cat, [[#Silverstream|Silverstream]], after she saves him from drowning, and starts to sneak out of camp to meet her. His friendship with Fireheart is strained due to Fireheart's need to cover for him while he is away, which included mentoring Graystripe's apprentice Brackenpaw in his place, and for a short time the two quarrel with each other. Eventually Graystripe is able to settle his issues with Fireheart, and their friendship continues. Graystripe eventually leaves ThunderClan to live in RiverClan after Silverstream dies, but returns when Bluestar leads dogs that Tigerstar set on the clan off the gorge.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\">{{cite book|title=[[Forest of Secrets]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|year=2003|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052561-3}}</ref> In the end of the original series, he becomes ThunderClan's deputy, due to Whitestorm's death,<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> but is replaced by Brambleclaw when he was captured in Dawn.<ref name=sunset>{{cite book|title=[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082771-7}}</ref>\n\nGraystripe is a friendly, hearty character, serving as a comic relief character to some degree. He often makes quips or jokes in order to provide relief to a tense situation, but is able to focus himself during battles and concentrate on the objective at hand. He does not have any qualms about killing hated enemies of the Clan, and is responsible for the deaths of [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] and also the accidental death of Whiteclaw, who fell off a gorge, Graystripe being unable to save him.\n\nGraystripe has lived in more locations than any other cat in the series. When Silverstream died bearing his kits, Feathertail and Stormfur, Graystripe went to live with them in [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] for a while.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> He returned to ThunderClan in ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' when Leopardstar tried to kill Firestar and Graystripe attacked her and saved him, upon which Leopardstar exiled him from RiverClan.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> In ''Dawn'' of ''The New Prophecy'' series, Graystripe was captured by humans, or \"Twolegs\" and lived as a kittypet for a time, which is described in further detail in ''[[The Lost Warrior (Warriors)|The Lost Warrior]]'' manga series. While living as a kittypet, Graystripe met [[#Millie|Millie]], another kittypet, who helped him escape. After a long journey, the two finally returned to the Clans living at the lake.  He returned to ThunderClan in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' of the ''Power of Three'' series, along with Millie as his new mate. He is currently a regular warrior, for Firestar lets Brambleclaw retain his position as deputy. Graystripe sometimes becomes a \"substitute\" deputy when Brambleclaw is out traveling.\n\nHe had two kits with Silverstream, [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]] and [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]] who go on to live in RiverClan. They fled to ThunderClan temporarily, along with Feathertail's (then Featherpaw and Stormpaw) mentor, Mistystar (then Mistyfoot), to escape Tigerstar's rule in RiverClan. His father is Patchpelt and his mother is Willowpelt. Feathertail was killed in ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]''. Graystripe's mate, Millie, gave birth to three kits of her own, [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]], [[#Bumblestripe|Bumblestripe]], and [[#Blossomfall|Blossomfall]] in  ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]''. Graystripe has two grandkits, Pine that Clings to Rock and Lark that Sings at Dawn from Stormfur and his mate, [[#Brook Where Small Fish Swim|Brook Where Small Fish Swim]]. Graystripe is currently an elder.\n\n====Sandstorm====\n'''Sandstorm''' is a pale ginger she-cat with green eyes. '''Sandpaw''' was an apprentice when Firestar first joins the Clan, and disliked Firepaw for formerly being a kittypet.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> Eventually, she warms up to Fireheart, a process initiated by Fireheart preventing her from falling over a cliff during a battle in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'', thereby saving her life.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> When Fireheart is forced to take Sandpaw on a patrol mission, she begins to warm up to him, and is unexpectedly friendly and cheerful toward him. Over the course of the series, it becomes obvious that Sandstorm has fallen in love with Fireheart (revealed in ''Rising Storm'' by her cousin Cinderpelt),<ref name=risingstorm>{{cite book|title=[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052563-7}}</ref> and by ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' the two have become mates.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> Sandstorm is known for having a fierce personality and getting easily annoyed, but is also capable of being gentle, however, as seen by her interactions with Firestar, her children, Squirrelflight and Leafpool, and her grandchildren, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather.\n\nShe is noted as being the best hunter and one of the fastest runners in ThunderClan, and is an excellent fighter as well, resulting in her being present in many major battles. She was also one of the cats who volunteered to be bait for the dog pack thanks to her speed. The specifics regarding her knowledge of Firestar's ongoing relationship with her aunt [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]], his first love, are shown in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' in which she once again plays a major role, and in which Firestar confirms that he loves Sandstorm above all, and will 'for all the moons to come'. Also, in ''Cats of The Clans'', Rock states that Sandstorm knows Firestar better than he realises, and better even than Spottedleaf, for all the dreams they have shared. She has two daughters, [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], as well as three grandchildren, [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]]. She is great-grandmother to Lionblaze and Cinderheart's kits, Hollytuft, Sorrelstripe, and Fernsong. They are the kits of Leafpool and Crowfeather as confirmed in The Power of Three. She was mentored by Whitestorm and mentored Sorreltail and Honeyfern.  At the end of ''Bramblestar's Storm'', she retires to become an elder. She dies of an infected wound in The Apprentice's Quest.\n\nRedtail is her father and Brindleface is her mother. Ashfur and Ferncloud are her half brother and sister. She's granddaughter to Adderfang and Swiftbreeze (Redtail's parents) and Fuzzypelt and Robinwing (Brindleface's parents). She is niece to Frostfur, Dustpelt, and Ravenpaw (Brindleface's siblings) and Leopardfoot, Spottedleaf, Willowpelt, and Patchpelt (Redtail's siblings). She is cousin to Tigerstar, Mistkit, and Nightkit (Leopardfoot's kits), Greystripe and Longtail (Patchpelt's sons), Sorreltail, Sootfur, Rainwhisker (Willowpelt's kits) and Cinderpelt, Brackenfur, Thornclaw, and Brightheart (Frostfur's kits).\n\n====Tigerstar====\n{{anchor|Tigerclaw}}\n'''Tigerstar''', a  huge, muscular dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes and unusually long front claws, is the main antagonist of the original series and haunts many cats' dreams in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series. He also plays a major role in the ''Omen of the Stars'' series, leading the Dark Forest to train Clan cats and leading them into a fight against StarClan and the four Clans, and he threatens them to do so, if they back down.\n\nInitially, he is '''Tigerclaw''', a senior warrior among the ranks of ThunderClan when Firepaw is brought into the forest. The two never quite get along, and Tigerclaw's hostility towards Fireheart is even higher when Fireheart discovers his plan to take over the Clan. Tigerclaw is a master of deception and manipulation, and is able to go through with the death of his uncle, Redtail, (an act he himself committed) as appearing to be the work of Oakheart from [[List of Warriors characters#RiverClan|RiverClan]]. By doing so, he plans to become deputy, but Bluestar appoints Lionheart, who is older and more experienced, as her deputy instead. However, when Lionheart later dies from wounds he sustained in a ShadowClan attack in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'', Tigerclaw becomes deputy, ensuring his eventual place as leader. When he finally becomes deputy, he secretly plots with [[#Brokenstar|Brokentail]] and his gang of rogue outlaws in order to kill [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]], while making the entire scene look like an attack that he was unable to defend against and a rogue killed Bluestar. The plan nearly succeeds, but Fireheart stops him at the last moment, and as a result, Tigerclaw is exiled from the Clan.\n\nAs a rogue, Tigerclaw gathers a band of allies (including ShadowClan warriors Nightwhisper and Blackfoot) and kills Mousefur's brother, Runningwind. Tigerclaw then persuades [[List of Warriors characters#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]] into accepting him as their leader and becomes Tigerstar, the rank he worked so hard to achieve.<ref name=risingstorm/> From his new position of authority, he is able to conceal his true nature from the other Clans, and secretly lures a pack of wild dogs into ThunderClan's territory in order to get revenge on his former Clanmates while saving only his kits, Bramblekit and Tawnykit. He plans only to save his kits, but not his mate, Goldenflower. To set the final step of his plan in place, he kills Brindleface, who happens to be the mate of Redtail, who he killed as well, to give the dogs a taste for cat blood when they enter the Thunderclan camp.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> When this plan, too, is foiled by Firestar and the others, Tigerstar hatches a plan to rule the entire forest while employing the services of the ruthless [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] in order to intimidate the other Clans into submission. Just as he has betrayed all his other former allies, he intends to betray BloodClan once he has united all the Clans under his rule. However, Tigerstar underestimates the power of [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]], the undersized black tom who leads BloodClan. When Scourge refuses to obey Tigerstar's order to fight the Clans, Tigerstar furiously attacks him, but Scourge slays him easily by slicing him open from chin to tail with his dog-teeth-reinforced claws. This devastating blow drains all of Tigerstar's nine lives at once, causing him to die nine times over, one life after the other.\n\nIn ''The New Prophecy'' series, Tigerstar visits his sons Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost in their dreams, preparing them to take over the Clans for him. It is revealed that because of his evil actions he was denied access to StarClan, and was banished with [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] to a dark, shadowy forest known as the '''Dark Forest''' (also called the '''Place of No Stars''').<ref name=\"Chat3part1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/881|title=Erin Hunter Chat #3 Transcript&nbsp;\u2013 part 1|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=2008-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228062552/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/881|archivedate=2007-12-28|df=}}</ref> He visits his two sons, [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] and [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], in their dreams and teaches them battle skills and leadership tactics. While Brambleclaw is hesitant to be influenced by his father, Hawkfrost welcomes his advice and plots to take control of the Clans much in the same way as his father did. Brambleclaw killed Hawkfrost in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nTigerstar also plays a role in the ''Power of Three'' series as a battle \"mentor\" to [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], along with his dead son Hawkfrost. The consequences of his actions do not appear to be causing any harm to the Clans; Lionblaze becomes a masterful fighter under Tigerstar's influence and excels in battle skills far beyond any other apprentice. Whether or not Lionblaze is part of yet another plan hatched by Tigerstar from the shadows remains to be seen, though it appears unlikely. He is able to communicate with living cats; however, StarClan has said that he should not be able to.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Lionblaze revolts against Tigerstar in ''Sunrise'' after learning that Tigerstar has always known that Squirrelflight wasn't Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze's mother. Lionblaze is able to defeat him, but refuses to kill him and Tigerstar remains in the Dark Forest.\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'', Tigerstar leads the other Dark Forest cats in an attack against the Clans, and when Hawkfrost, Darkstripe, and Brokenstar are killed for the second time, he steps forward, stating that the battle has only begun.<ref name=lasthope/> After a long duel, Tigerstar is killed by his long-time rival Firestar, fading away permanently.\n\nTigerclaw was mentored by Thistleclaw, an ambitious and aggressive cat (this only magnified Tigerstar's own aggressive personality).<ref name=bluestar/> Tigerclaw takes [[#Ravenpaw|Ravenpaw]] as an apprentice for a short time before Firepaw and Greypaw send him to live with Barley.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> He has taken two mates, [[#Goldenflower|Goldenflower]] and [[#Sasha|Sasha]]. He has five direct kits: [[#Tawnypelt|Tawnypelt]] and Brambleclaw from Goldenflower, and [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], Hawkfrost, and Tadpole from Sasha. Tadpole is not shown in the story because he drowned as a kit.<ref name=\"Return to the clans\">{{cite book|title=[[Return to the Clans]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-154794-2}}</ref> It is revealed in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' that Tigerstar is a direct descendant of the kits of Birdflight, a [[List of Warriors characters#SkyClan|SkyClan]] she-cat who was the mate of Cloudstar, the SkyClan leader, and she sheltered in ThunderClan during SkyClan's exile, with her two kits, Spottedpelt and Gorseclaw, who were at the time, to young to make the journey. This makes him part-SkyClan, along with his aunt [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]].<ref name=firestar/>\n\nIt is also revealed in ''[[Code of the Clans]]'' and then ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy]]'' that Tigerstar was the son of Pinestar, the old ThunderClan leader who left his Clan to be a kittypet while on his last life. His mother was Leopardfoot, who was Patchpelt's, Willowpelt's, Spottedleaf's and Redtail's sister, and his siblings were Nightkit and Mistkit, both she-kits, who died shortly after birth. He was the last born, and weakest of his litter.<ref name=bluestar/> He's also a cousin to Sorreltail, Sootfur and Rainwhisker (Willowpelt's kits), Longtail and Greystripe (Patchpelt's kits) and Sandstorm (Redtail's kit). Grandcousin to Poppyfrost, Cinderheart, Molepaw, Honeyfern, Seedkit, and Lilykit (Sorreltail's kits), Stormfur, Feathertail, Briarlight, Bumblestripe, and Blossomfall (Greystripe's kits) and Squirrelflight and Leafpool (Sandstorm's kits). Great grandcousin to Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze (Leafpool's kits) Cherrykit and Molekit (Poppyfrost's kits) and Lark That Sings At Dawn (Lark) and Pine That Clings To Rock (Pine) (Stormfur's kits). His grandsons are Flametail and Tigerheart, and his granddaughter is Dawnpelt(Tawnypelt's kits).\n\n====Cinderpelt====\n'''Cinderpelt''', a dark grey she-cat with blue eyes, is ThunderClan's medicine cat beginning in the original series, and continuing for a large part of ''The New Prophecy'' series. Originally she trains to be a warrior as an apprentice under Fireheart's mentoring, but she is critically injured and therefore crippled by a monster when she stumbles into a trap laid by [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]] for Bluestar, she permanently injures  her leg and cannot become a warrior.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> Soon after she begins training as a medicine cat apprentice under [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]], she receives the title of a full medicine cat in ''[[Forest of Secrets]]'' (though she is still called Cinderpaw until the beginning of ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'').<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> Cinderpelt is one of Firestar's closest friends throughout the series, and remains his trusted advisor whenever he needs spiritual guidance. Initially overexcited and bouncy, she often overwhelms Firestar as an apprentice and frequently dashes off on her own. After she begins training as a medicine cat, her personality greatly matures and she appears to possess the wisdom of a much older cat. She was in love with Firestar and she never stopped loving him, though Firestar himself never realizes this and Cinderpelt never tells him. Though she always wanted to be a warrior, she accepts her new destiny and dedicates her life to becoming a legendary medicine cat. Cinderpelt tried to save Silverstream while she was giving birth to Greystripe's kits. She loses Silverstream, but if not for her, the kits (Stormkit and Featherkit, later Stormfur and Feathertail) would have died. However, Cinderpelt blames herself for Silverstream's death.\n\nCinderpelt is killed in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'' of ''The New Prophecy'' series while defending Sorreltail and her newborn kits in the nursery from a marauding badger. StarClan had originally destined Cinderpelt to be a warrior, and they did not plan on her being caught in Tigerstar's trap on the Thunderpath. As a test of her loyalty, StarClan told Cinderpelt of her impending death in ''Twilight'' before it happened, a secret which Cinderpelt kept hidden even when her apprentice, [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]], pledged to leave the Clan.\n\nAs a reward, Cinderpelt was reincarnated after her death into one of the kits she defended, '''[[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]]''' in the ''Power of Three'' series. Cinderheart herself is not aware of this consciously, however she occasionally exhibits knowledge that she cannot explain from her previous life, and knows of her reincarnation in dreams. The implications of this \"second life\", as well as Cinderpelt's true destiny, have become realized when Jayfeather reveals it to her in a dream. Just before the battle in ''The Last Hope'', Cinderheart chooses to be a warrior and Lionblaze's mate, and Cinderpelt leaves Cinderheart's body, whispering, \"Thank you\". Cinderpelt was mentored by Yellowfang, and mentored her cousin Sandstorm's daughter [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] as her successor. Her mother is Frostfur, which makes [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]] and [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]] her siblings. Her brother, [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]], is the father of Cinderheart, a situation which is slightly confusing given Cinderpelt's reincarnation. This would imply, then, that Cinderpelt's brother is now her father, though the new Cinderheart is still very much an individual cat in her own right. As Cinderpelt has a reincarnation, [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]] is related to Bluestar since Sorreltail's father was Whitestorm, who was Bluestar's nephew.\n\n====Spottedleaf====\n'''Spottedleaf''' is a beautiful, dark tortoiseshell she-cat, with amber eyes, a white muzzle, white paws, a white chest, a black-tipped tail, and a black, brown, and amber dappled pelt. Her eyes have circles of dark fur around them, and one is darker than the other. She also has a gold-and-black striped tail. She has played some minor and slightly major roles in series to date despite her early death in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'', after which she appeared in Firestar's dreams. Originally Spottedleaf was ThunderClan's medicine cat at the start of ''Into the Wild'' and foretold the original series prophecy \"Fire alone can save our Clan\". [[#Firestar|Firestar]], when first introduced into the camp, immediately takes a liking to her and it is said that she begins to return his feelings. Unfortunately, she is killed by ShadowClan in an effort to protect the kits in an unfair fight with Clawface and Brokenstar during a raid by [[List of Warriors characters#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]] near the end of ''Into the Wild''.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nSpottedleaf is perhaps the most prominent member of StarClan, often serving as a spiritual guide to the main characters of each series, most notably Firestar, whom she falls in love with over the course of his adventures in the original series. She is often seen as a source of comfort, and presents cryptic warnings and messages to cats notifying them of future events. Being dead, she cannot serve any more prominent roles in the lives of the cats she watches over, a fact that is frequently a source of frustration to her regarding Firestar's budding relationship with her niece [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]]. It is revealed that she does indeed wish things were different between them, and continues to love Firestar despite their differences of existence. She accepts her position, however, and acknowledges Sandstorm in a dream of her own in order to reassure the living cat of Firestar's loyalty.<ref name=firestar/> Having not found an apprentice by the time of her death, [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]] is the new medicine cat when she joins ThunderClan.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> It is revealed in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' that Spottedleaf is a direct descendant of the kits of Birdflight, a [[List of Warriors characters#SkyClan|SkyClan]] she-cat who stayed with ThunderClan during SkyClan's exile. Therefore, she is part-SkyClan and permitted to walk in the skies of SkyClan's warrior ancestors as well as StarClan. The same she-cat that stayed with ThunderClan after SkyClan left also had the ancestor of Tigerstar's line, making Spottedleaf related to Tigerstar, Brambleclaw, Mothwing, Hawkfrost, Tadpole, Tawnypelt, and Tawnypelt's kits Flametail, Dawnpelt, and Tigerheart.<ref name=firestar/>\n\nSpottedleaf was mentored by Featherwhisker, the medicine cat before her.<ref name=bluestar/> She walks in the dreams of Firestar, Leafpool, and Jayfeather. After Spottedleaf died, Yellowfang became the medicine cat, taking Cinderpelt as an apprentice following her accident. Her parents were Adderfang and Swiftbreeze, making her sister to Patchpelt, Leopardfoot, Willowpelt, and Redtail. She's also aunt to Mistkit, Nightkit and Tigerstar (Leopardfoot's kits), Sorreltail, Rainwhisker and Sootfur (Willowpelt's kits), and Sandstorm (Redtail's daughter), and great aunt to Brambleclaw, Tawnypelt, Hawkfrost, Mothwing and Tadpole (Tigerstar's kits), Poppyfrost, Cinderheart, Honeyfern, and Molepaw (Sorreltail's kits), and Leafpool and Squirrelflight (Sandstorm's kits). She is great-great aunt to Tigerheart, Flametail, and Dawnpelt (Tawnypelt's kits), Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather (Leafpool's kits), and Cherryfall and Molewhisker (Poppyfrost's kits).\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'' she and the other StarClan cats help fight the Dark Forest cats. During the battle, she attempts to beat Mapleshade. However, Mapleshade kills Spottedleaf, causing her to fade away forever.\n\n====Cloudtail====\n'''Cloudtail''', a long-furred snowy white tom with round blue eyes, is a ThunderClan warrior first introduced as a kit, Cloudkit, in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]''. He is the son of [[#Princess|Princess]], [[#Firestar|Firestar]]'s kittypet sister, and Oliver and thus is Firestar's nephew. He has four littermates, Zack, Taylor, Nami, and Livy. Upon learning that her kits are to be given away by her Twoleg owners, Princess gives her eldest kit to Firestar, because she wanted him to be a hero, like Firestar is. Initially, Cloudkit is rejected by many members of ThunderClan, including [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] herself, because of the Clan's reluctance to admit yet another kittypet into its ranks.\n\nCloudtail grew up as a disrespectful, annoying, loud-mouthed apprentice who often refuses to listen to his mentor, Firestar. He is quite slow to understand the warrior code and often takes selfish actions that benefit himself and not the Clan. His loyalty to the Clan is finally established when, after sneaking off to solicit food from Twolegs, he is captured and taken to a suburb on the other side of [[List of Warriors characters#WindClan|WindClan]] territory near [[#Barley|Barley]]'s farm. Firestar and [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]] rescue him with [[#Ravenpaw|Ravenpaw]]'s help. Upon his return to ThunderClan, he is pelted with questions and he refers to his time with the Twolegs as 'capture' and greatly exaggerates his tale. This event serves to firmly cement Cloudtail's place in the Clan, and he behaves in a much more mature manner towards his Clan thereafter.\n\nDespite becoming a loyal warrior, Cloudtail has retained much of his attitude and is one of the most aggressive cats in the Clan; he is known for his sharp tongue and is often one of the first cats to jump at the prospect of a fight. Cloudtail does not believe in StarClan in the first series, making him one of two Clan cats in the series to do so (the other being [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], the RiverClan medicine cat). He does show a significantly softer side when dealing with his mate, [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], however. Cloudtail is primarily responsible for training Brightheart to be able to fight effectively despite her injuries. His personality taken aside, Cloudtail is friendly to most cats (provided they are not from another Clan). He is one of the best climbers and has the best tracking ability in the Clan.<ref name=firestar />\n\nCloudtail has two daughters, and two sons. He first has one daughter with Brightheart, Whitewing. Later in ''The Last Hope'', he and Brightheart have another daughter, Amberkit, and two sons, Dewkit and Snowkit (Now Ambermoon, Dewnose, and Snowbush). He is grandfather to Lilyheart and Snowbush's kits, Honeypaw, Leafpaw, and Larkpaw. Being Firestar's nephew, he also shares kinship with all of Firestar's direct line, including [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]], [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]]. During the second half of ''The New Prophecy'' series, he shows interest in [[#Daisy|Daisy]], a horseplace cat. He is unaware of the fact that Daisy is in love with him, but once he realizes that he is hurting his mate Brightheart, he resolves to stay with Brightheart, and rekindles his relationship with her.<ref name=sunset/> Cloudtail has mentored [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], [[#Rainwhisker|Rainwhisker]], and [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]] as well as temporarily training [[#Flametail|Flamepaw]] of ShadowClan when Tawnypelt and her kits briefly left ShadowClan for ThunderClan in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''. He's grandfather to Dovewing and Ivypool.\n\n====Brightheart====\n'''Brightheart''', a white she-cat with ginger patches along her back, a ginger tail, one missing eye and a disfigured ear, is a ThunderClan warrior introduced in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]''. Brightheart was an apprentice, Brightpaw, for an unusually long period, along with her fellow apprentices [[#Cloudtail|Cloudpaw]], [[#Thornclaw|Thornpaw]], and [[#Swiftpaw|Swiftpaw]] due to [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]]'s paranoia and refusal to trust her warriors following [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]]'s betrayal.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> Brightpaw develops a strong friendship with Cloudpaw, and is the first apprentice to congratulate him after his promotion to warrior status (received just for being [[#Firestar|Fireheart's]] apprentice) despite the other apprentices feeling jealous and angry. She would join an expedition led by Swiftpaw into the lair of the dog pack during ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' in an attempt to prove herself worthy of being a warrior, which results in her being seriously injured as well as Swiftpaw's death.\n\nHalf of Brightheart's face is disfigured due to her injuries, including a missing eye and a scarred ear from the dog attack in [[A Dangerous Path]]. These features cause Bluestar to give her the warrior name of '''Lostface''', which [[#Firestar|Firestar]] soon changes when he becomes leader. Though initially discouraged by her injuries, Brightheart is soon able to develop, with the help of Cloudtail, a system of fighting that makes use of her one-sided vision, making her as effective at fighting as any other warrior.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> She recoils from the sight of her own face and sometimes flinches when other cats are frightened by her scarred face. However, Brightheart is warm and kind-hearted to many warriors in the Clan. She adopts the duties of an unofficial medicine cat during the latter half of ''The New Prophecy'' series, becoming an object of [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]]'s jealousy, but quickly returns to being a warrior after Leafpool becomes ThunderClan's main medicine cat. In ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', Brightheart holds a grudge for [[#Daisy|Daisy]], who often flirts and spends time with her mate, [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]].<ref name=twilight/> However, after Leafpool points out to Cloudtail that he is hurting Brightheart, Daisy tells Brightheart that Cloudtail loves Brightheart.\n\nBrightheart was mentored by [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]], who also mentored her cousin Sandstorm, and had since taken Sandstorm's grandson [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] as an apprentice, although this was only temporary due to Jayfeather later taking the role of medicine cat. She appears to have been hurt by this, likely due to her being desperate to prove to herself and the Clan that she can still function as well as a normal warrior. Despite Jaypaw's prickly attitude towards her during his apprenticeship, he is able to sense her feelings and is sympathetically warmer towards her upon becoming a medicine cat.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> Her mother is [[#Frostfur|Frostfur]], which makes her the littermate of Thornclaw, Cinderpelt, and Brackenfur. She and her mate, Cloudtail, currently have two daughters and two sons. Whitewing is their oldest daughter, born much earlier than her littermates. Later, Brightheart and Cloudtail have another daughter, Amberkit, and two sons, Snowkit and Dewkit, sometime during the course of ''The Last Hope''. She is also aunt to Poppyfrost, Honeyfern, Cinderheart, and Molepaw (Brackenfur's kits) grandaunt to Cherrykit and Molekit (Poppyfrost's kits), and grandmother to Dovewing, Ivypool (Whitewing's kits)Leafpaw, Larkpaw, and Honeypaw (Snowbush and Lilyheart's kits).\n\n====Brackenfur====\n'''Brackenfur''', a muscular golden brown tabby tom, is a ThunderClan warrior first introduced in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'' as an apprentice, Brackenpaw. He is the son of [[#Frostfur|Frostfur]] and the littermate of [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]], [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], and [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]], and he trained as an apprentice under [[#Firestar|Firestar]] and [[#Graystripe|Graystripe]].<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> Firestar, he was [[#Fireheart|Fireheart]] then, often took over his training when Graystripe left the camp to meet with [[#Silverstream|Silverstream]] even though meeting with cats outside one's own Clan is against the warrior code, upon becoming a warrior in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]''.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/>\n\nHe was considered by Firestar to become ThunderClan's deputy in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', but was not chosen due to a sign from StarClan interpreted by Leafpool, making Brambleclaw deputy instead.<ref name=sunset/> He is greatly respected and liked throughout the Clan, and additionally is an excellent fighter, which allows him to be present in most battles.\n\nIn the ''New Prophecy'' series, Brackenfur takes [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] as a mate, and has six kits with her: Molepaw (who dies of disease between ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series),<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]] (who later dies in Sunrise by being bitten by a snake),<ref name=sunrise>{{cite book|title=[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-089218-0}}</ref> [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], later revealed to be the reincarnation of Cinderpelt, his sister, as well as Lilykit and Seedkit, who are born in the ''Omen of the Stars'' series.<ref name=\"newbook7\">Hunter, Erin.

Brackenfur has no apprentice currently but has mentored [[#Tawnypelt|Tawnypelt]] (before she left ThunderClan to go to ShadowClan), [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]], and [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]]. He also trained [[#Tigerheart|Tigerpaw]] of ShadowClan for a while when Tawnypelt and her kits left ShadowClan for ThunderClan in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows1>{{cite book|title=[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows and he is still alive in the current books]] and is still alive up to the last book.|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-089214-2}}</ref>\n\n====Ravenpaw====\n'''Ravenpaw''', a sleek, almost all black (except for the tip of his tail and a little dash on his chest, which is white) tom with amber eyes, is a current loner, first introduced as a ThunderClan apprentice in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''. After [[#Firestar|Firepaw]] is accepted into the forest, he trains along with [[#Greystripe|Greypaw]] and Firepaw and the three become good friends. Ravenpaw is nervous and shy around his Clanmates, mostly due to the fact that his mentor, [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]], treats him harshly and often belittles him in front of the other warriors. Part of this is because Ravenpaw saw Tigerclaw murder [[#Redtail|Redtail]], the ThunderClan deputy. Eventually Tigerclaw decides that Ravenpaw's storytelling abilities are too dangerous, and plots to kill him to keep his secret safe. Firepaw discovers this, and along with Greypaw shows Ravenpaw across the [[List of Warriors characters#WindClan|WindClan]] border to shelter in [[#Barley|Barley]]'s barn, while telling the rest of the Clan that he is dead.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nFirepaw takes Ravenpaw to the barn, and he seems to enjoy his life with Barley. He loses his old nervousness and becomes much more confident and outgoing, while retaining a loyal debt of gratitude towards his former Clanmates. His situation is present throughout the series: while some outsiders such as kittypets appear to have been born to live in a Clan, there are also Clan-born cats whose destinies lie elsewhere. Ravenpaw returns at various times throughout the series to lend assistance or shelter to cats traveling across his territory, most notably helping to feed and shelter all of the forest Clans during the beginning of their relocation in ''[[Dawn (Warriors)|Dawn]]''.<ref name=dawn>{{cite book|title=[[Dawn (Warriors)|Dawn]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-074455-7}}</ref> Ravenpaw also assists Firestar and Greystripe in retrieving Greystripe's kits from [[List of Warriors characters#RiverClan|RiverClan]] during Tigerstar's cruel leadership of the Clan in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. He then returns to the Clan along with Barley to fight alongside ThunderClan and WindClan in the battle with [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]].<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> While sheltering the forest cats in ''Dawn'', Firestar asks Ravenpaw to rejoin ThunderClan and travel with them to the lake. Ravenpaw says no, stating that he is happier being a loner than he ever would be in a Clan.<ref name=dawn/> His parents were Robinwing and Fuzzypelt, making him brother to Frostfur, Brindleface, and Dustpelt, uncle to Brackenfur, Brightheart, Cinderpelt and Thornclaw (Frostfur's kits), Sandstorm, Ashfur and Ferncloud (Brindleface's kits), Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Birchfall, Hollykit, Larchkit, Icecloud and Foxleap (Dustpelt's kits), great-uncle to Squirrelflight and Leafpool (Sandstorm's daughters), Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Birchfall, Hollykit, Larchkit, Icecloud and Foxleap (Ferncloud's kits), Whitewing, Dewnose, Snowbush, and Ambermoon (Brightheart's kits), Honeyfern, Poppyfrost, Cinderheart and Molepaw (Brackenfur's kits), Rosepetal and Toadstep (Spiderleg's kits), and Dovewing and Ivypool (Birchfall's daughters).\n\nRavenpaw currently has a manga series about him and his encounter with some old BloodClan cats.<ref name=\"sixthchat\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-chat |title=Erin Hunter Chat #6 Transcript \u2013 the chat |work=Wands And Worlds |accessdate=2009-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919140759/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-chat |archivedate=2009-09-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''the Ultimate Guide'' Ravenpaw is one of the members of Starclan to give Bramblestar his nine lives.\n\n====Dustpelt====\n'''Dustpelt''', a dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes, is a ThunderClan warrior introduced in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' as an apprentice. He had recently been made an apprentice, Dustpaw, when [[#Firestar|Firepaw]] initially joined the Clan. He was mentored by Redtail, and then by Darkstripe following Redtail's death. He was one of the cats that disliked Firepaw, like Sandpaw; however, this becomes less important as the story goes on.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> He becomes a warrior, Dustpelt, in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]''.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> Originally an ally and strong supporter of [[#Tigerclaw|Tigerclaw]], Dustpelt was horrified to discover that Tigerclaw murdered his mentor, [[#Redtail|Redtail]], and rejected him in front of the Clan when Tigerclaw was exiled.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/>\n\nThough usually depicted as a grudging ally of Firestar throughout all three series, Dustpelt's loyalty to his Clan (and its \"kittypet\" leader) is of importance to him and he is a valued warrior as a result. Dustpelt is a skilled fighter, and is present in most attack parties. He is also a warm and dedicated father, having experienced the deaths of three of his kits, and makes sure to maintain a strong presence in both his kits' lives and that of his mate, Ferncloud.\n\nDustpelt's kits, both living and dead, include Hollykit, Larchkit, [[#Shrewpaw|Shrewpaw]], [[#Foxleap|Foxleap]], [[#Icecloud|Icecloud]], [[#Birchfall|Birchfall]], and [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]], of which four are surviving. His grandchildren, [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]] and [[#Rosepetal|Rosepetal]], are the kits of Spiderleg and his mate [[#Daisy|Daisy]], and [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] and [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]] who are the kits of Birchfall and Whitewing. Throughout the course of the series Dustpelt has mentored [[#Ashfur|Ashfur]], [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]], as well as briefly mentoring [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] for a time.\n\n====Darkstripe====\n'''Darkstripe''', a sleek black and grey tabby tom, is an [[antagonist]] and a warrior in ThunderClan during most of the original series. He is a rude, nasty, and unpleasant individual who maintains a highly negative opinion of [[#Firestar|Firestar]] throughout the series. He is the closest friend and biggest supporter of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]], and as such is fiercely loyal to Tigerstar's ambitions despite their implications. Darkstripe routinely voices his negative opinions at Clan meetings, refusing to trust Firestar due to his kittypet origins and openly mocking any cat who thinks otherwise.\n\nWhen Tigerclaw is exiled from ThunderClan in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'', Darkstripe voices his disappointment that Tigerstar did not include him in his plan to kill [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] (he did not appear to have a problem with Tigerstar's plan itself, but rather that he was not allowed to be a part of it).<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> Darkstripe's lonely path of a devoted follower continues to reduce his popularity in the Clan, and in ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' he begins secretly plotting with Tigerstar across the border in order to bring the dogs upon the camp and save only Tigerstar's children, [[#Bramblestar|Bramblekit]] and [[#Tawnypelt|Tawnykit]], from the ensuing chaos, but not Tigerstar's mate, Goldenflower.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> After this fails, he attempts to murder his half-sister, Sorrelkit (later Sorreltail), with deathberries when she discovers his meetings with [[#Blackstar|Blackfoot]], Tigerstar's deputy, and he is exiled from the Clan. Darkstripe immediately runs to Tigerstar's side and kills one of Bluestar's children, Stonefur, but when Tigerstar is killed by [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]], Darkstripe is left completely alone. His resulting madness culminates in the battle with [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] during ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''; he forsakes all loyalty to his Clan and tries to murder Firestar in \"revenge\" for Tigerstar's death. He is stopped and killed by his half-brother, [[#Graystripe|Graystripe]] during the battle.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nDarkstripe has mentored Longtail, Dustpelt, and Ferncloud, although his mentorship of Ferncloud was revoked when he was exiled from the Clan. He was mentored by Tigerclaw. His mother was [[#Willowpelt|Willowpelt]] and his father was [[#Tawnyspots|Tawnyspots]], and it can be implied from his personality that hardly any cat liked him very much. He is shown during the prologue of ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' to be walking the Dark Forest/Place of No Stars like Tigerstar, Brokentail, and eventually [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], and all of the other Clan cats that are considered traitors and evil.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nIn ''Code of the Clans'', he is hunting with Longtail. When Longtail catches a plump squirrel, Darkstripe encourages them to eat it since prey is scarce. After eating it and returning to camp with a smaller catch, Poppydawn, who needs food, dies of a case of greencough. While Longtail feels guilty, Darkstripe does not care.\n\n====Longtail====\n'''Longtail''', a pale yellow tabby tom with black stripes and a very long tail, is a recurring ThunderClan warrior introduced in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''. He is the first to challenge [[#Firestar|Firestar]] due to his kittypet origins, and fights him when he first arrives in the Clan. This results in Firestar's collar being ripped off, which is then taken as a sign that he will be accepted into the Clan. Longtail's ear is torn, resulting in a scar. Longtail maintains a grudge against Firestar for much of the series, not only because an apprentice defeated him and gave him his scar, but also because he, Longtail, was a strong supporter of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]], Firestar's chief rival.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nLongtail's attitude slowly matures over the course of the series, and he develops an eventual respect for Firestar as a result of his repeatedly demonstrated courage, something Longtail lacks. He revokes his allegiance with Tigerclaw after the latter is exiled for treason, and sets himself toward becoming a respected warrior within the Clan. His loyalty is further proven when he volunteers to be bait for Tigerstar's vicious dog pack. While he still resents Firestar to some degree, he realizes his Clan's safety is far more important and warns him of his cousin Tigerstar's dark schemes from across the border as well as his cousin [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]]'s [[misplaced loyalty]] during ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'' and ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]''.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/><ref name=risingstorm/> Longtail eventually fights alongside Firestar against [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] during the events of ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', having finally found his true place within the Clan as well as Firestar's respect.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nAlmost ironically, Longtail is blinded shortly thereafter by a rabbit's claws in ''Firestar's Quest''.<ref name=firestar/> He remains in the Clan as an elder throughout ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series, despite being only slightly older than Firestar. He was mentored by [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] and he has mentored Swiftpaw, his niece Ferncloud and his cousin Sootfur (before he was blinded). He also taught his great-great-nephew Jayfeather how to utilize his other senses without sight.<ref name=pwrbook1/> He was killed by a falling tree in [[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]] while trying to retrieve a piece of fresh-kill for Mousefur.<ref name=fadingechoes>{{cite book|title=[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-155512-1}}</ref> Longtail was the oldest tom and second oldest cat in ThunderClan. His parents were Patchpelt and Robinwing. Longtail is also half-brother to Greystripe.\n\nIn ''Code of the Clans'', he is hunting with Darkstripe. When he catches a plump squirrel, Darkstripe encourages them to eat it since prey is scarce. After eating it and returning to camp, Poppydawn, who needs food, dies of a case of greencough. Longtail feels guilty, while Darkstripe does not.\n\n====Mousefur====\n'''Mousefur''', a small dusky brown she-cat, is a ThunderClan warrior introduced in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> She is a respected warrior in the Clan and is known for having a fierce personality, similar to [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]] and Speckletail. Mousefur was one of the cats who volunteered to be bait for the dog pack.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> Mousefur is usually friendly to [[#Firestar|Firestar]], but has been known to change her attitude towards him depending on the situation. Mousefur is often among any group of cats voicing a counter-opinion to a major decision, forcing the Clan to look at an issue from an opposite perspective. Despite her many arguments and aggressive pride, however, she usually ends up agreeing with the correct choice in a given situation.\n\nMousefur's age causes her to join the elders in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'' in ''The New Prophecy'' series, where she currently remains.<ref name=starlight/> Since then she has fallen ill a number of times, more recently catching greencough and causing [[#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]] to experience his first medical epidemic as a medicine cat in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> Mousefur and [[#Longtail|Longtail]] have become unlikely friends due to their sharing of the elders' den, and often playfully bicker back and forth similar to Yellowfang and Cinderpelt. Although, due to her stubbornness (or thoughtfulness) she sometimes refuses to take herbs or prey, insisting the younger cats need it more. She even volunteers to help take care of the sick cats in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'' as she thinks that being an elder, her life is less valuable than the younger cats. She asked Brambleclaw this even though Firestar had already turned down her request, only to be turned down by Brambleclaw as well.<ref name=longshadows/> Mousefur was killed in ''The Last Hope'' by a Dark Forest warrior.\n\nMousefur has been a mentor to [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]] and [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]]. Mousefur's parents are Halftail and One-eye, and her brother is Runningwind.\n\n====Thornclaw====\n'''Thornclaw''', a golden brown tabby tom, first appears in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'' as a young ThunderClan apprentice, Thornpaw.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> He is an apprentice for a large part of the original series, along with [[#Brightheart|Brightpaw]], [[#Cloudtail|Cloudpaw]] and Swiftpaw, mainly due to [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]]'s descent into paranoia during the last half of the original series and her refusing to trust any of her warriors. When she died, the newly appointed [[#Firestar|Firestar]] conducted his first naming ceremony on Thornclaw, finally making the young tom into a warrior.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nThornclaw's personality begins to show during ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'', where he is shown to be a warrior very similar to [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] in manner and attitude. He is an excellent fighter and is often chosen to assist in battle parties and long-range patrols. Thornclaw, like Brackenfur, becomes slightly worried about the increasing numbers of non-Clan cats present in ThunderClan during the ''Power of Three'' series, as well as at Firestar for being too accepting of them. This is primarily due to increasing hostility from the other three Clans, who begin to make claims that ThunderClan is becoming diluted and weak. Despite these feelings, Thornclaw is always portrayed as a kind, caring, and patient cat and has never been shown to be disloyal. When [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] returns in ''The Forgotten Warrior'' he is among the cats who distrust her.\n\nThornclaw's mother is [[#Frostfur|Frostfur]], and his siblings are  [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]].  As a result, Thornclaw is uncle to both Brightheart's and Brackenfur's kits, including [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]], [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]], [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], Lilyheart, Seedpaw, Cherrypaw and Molepaw, and great uncle to Dovewing and Ivypool (Whitewing's kits) and Cherrykit and Molekit (Poppyfrost's kits). He was mentored by [[#Mousefur|Mousefur]] and has mentored [[#Sootfur|Sootfur]], Shrewpaw, [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]] and [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]]. Thornclaw's also nephew to Brindleface (Frostfur's sister), grandson to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Frostfur's parents), cousin to Sandstorm, Ashfur and Ferncloud (Brindleface's kits), second cousin to Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Birchfall, Hollykit, Larchkit, Foxleap and Icecloud (Ferncloud's kits) and third cousin to Toadstep and Rosepetal (Spiderleg's kits) and Dovewing and Ivypool.\n\n====Whitestorm====\n'''Whitestorm''', a large white tom with yellow eyes, was a senior ThunderClan warrior in the original series. He was one of the few cats who always treated [[#Firestar|Firestar]] with kindness when he is first brought into ThunderClan, and often gave him advice when he sensed that Firestar is troubled.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> Whitestorm was a gallant fighter, but was always more reserved rather than bloodthirsty and carries a thoughtful demeanor.\n\nThough he was one of the most experienced senior warriors in the Clan, Whitestorm does not harbor any ambition toward becoming Clan leader and as such offers his wisdom to younger cats entirely out of good will. He assisted Firestar with the burdens of being Clan deputy during [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]]'s depression, and takes over for him occasionally when Firestar's duties call him elsewhere. Being Bluestar's nephew, as her sister Snowfur was his mother, Whitestorm was one of the warriors who were closest to her, and often stayed by her side in order to comfort her and maintain her sanity when she succumbed into paranoia through the later books. Eventually Firestar appointed Whitestorm as his deputy in appreciation for all his advice, a promotion he was unexpectedly pleased about (a trait that Firestar admires, given the ambitions of previous cats he had encountered). Whitestorm was killed by [[List of Warriors characters#Bone|Bone]] during the battle with [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', his last wish being that Firestar appoint [[#Graystripe|Graystripe]] as his new deputy, which is granted.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nWhitestorm's mate was [[#Minor ThunderClan characters|Willowpelt]]. With Willowpelt he fathered Sorreltail, Sootfur and Rainwhisker. As such he was the grandfather of Sorreltail's kits, [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], Molekit, [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]], [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], [[#Seedpaw|Seedpaw]],and  [[#Lilyheart|Lilyheart]]. And is the great-grandfather of Molepaw and Cherrypaw (Poppyfrost's kits). Snowfur's parents were Stormtail and Moonflower making them his other set of grandparents. His aunts were Bluestar (Snowfur's sister), Sweetpaw and Rosetail, because their brother, Thistleclaw, was his father, making Poppydawn and Windflight, their parents, his paternal grandparents.<ref name=bluestar/>\nHe was mentored by Patchpelt, and later mentored Patchpelt's niece, Sandstorm, and later, Sandstorm's cousin Brightheart. He is great-nephew to Pinestar (Poppydawn's brother), and great-great-grandson to Sweetbriar (Pinestar's mother).\n\n====Yellowfang====\n'''Yellowfang''', a dark grey she-cat with bright orange eyes and a flat, broad face with two scars on her muzzle. She is ThunderClan's medicine cat for much of the duration of the original series. She was originally the medicine cat of [[List of Warriors characters#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]], and formed a forbidden relationship with ShadowClan's leader, Raggedstar (as medicine cats are not supposed to have mates), which resulted in her giving birth to three kits. Two of these kits died, and the third, [[#Brokenstar|Brokentail]], lived and eventually forced his way into becoming ShadowClan's leader by killing his father, Raggedstar. Yellowfang believed that the consequences of her actions weren't that her other two kits died, but that Brokenstar survived to take over ShadowClan. Yellowfang was exiled from the camp when Brokenstar, who had never known who his true mother was, blamed her for the death of two kits he had forced into training too early. Yellowfang was found by [[#Firestar|Firepaw]], who took her back to camp as a prisoner. After [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]]'s death, Yellowfang succeeded her as ThunderClan's new medicine cat. Later Yellowfang feeds deathberries to Brokenstar, after his capture by ThunderClan, killing him.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nYellowfang displays a rough and irritable personality to most cats who encounter her, especially Cinderpelt and Fireheart. She speaks the blunt truth rather often, refusing to soften her words, as she feels this would dilute the truth of the matter. Yellowfang has a close friendship with Firepaw beyond their initial meeting, during which the two attack each other. She is struck by Firepaw's potential and acts as a surrogate mother to him throughout his training. When [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]] is injured and her chances of becoming a warrior forfeited, Yellowfang trains her as a medicine cat.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> Her [[personality clashes]] with that of Cinderpelt's, and the two often bicker playfully back and forth; Yellowfang greatly respects Cinderpelt as a result due to her courage to fire her words right back at her.\n\nYellowfang dies from smoke inhalation in the great fire that destroys much of ThunderClan's camp during the events of ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]''. Her last words are to Fireheart, telling him that he was the son she always wished she had.<ref name=risingstorm/> Yellowfang mentored [[#Runningnose|Runningnose]] as a medicine cat in ShadowClan, who retained a great deal of respect for her despite her exile. She then mentored Cinderpelt in ThunderClan.\n\nIn the ''Power of Three'' series, Yellowfang is one of the first StarClan cats to realize [[#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]]'s ability to transcend dreams. She attempts to stop him from abusing his power, but Jaypaw stubbornly refuses. She also argues with Bluestar and other members of StarClan regarding the prophecy concerning Jaypaw and his siblings, saying that the cats of StarClan are intentionally deceiving the three for an as yet undisclosed reason, however most likely referring to the fact that Leafpool is their mother. She also gave the crow's feather to Jayfeather in ''Sunrise'' to figure out who his father was.<ref name=sunrise/> She appears in \"The Forgotten Warrior\" to tell Jayfeather that Cinderheart needs to know who she really is.\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'', Yellowfang kills Brokenstar a second time.\n\n===''The New Prophecy Series''===\n''The New Prophecy'' series covers events in the story from ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' to ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''. Many characters here were first mentioned in the original series, but had minor or insignificant roles. In addition, as with the original series, most characters listed here play minor or significant roles in the following series, ''Power of Three'', as well. The series circles around Tigerstar's and Firestar's children as the Clans have to find a new home, thanks to the twolegs who are destroying it.\n\n====Ashfur====\n\n'''Ashfur''', a pale gray tom with darker flecks and dark blue eyes, was a ThunderClan warrior who was introduced in the original series as Ashkit and later Ashpaw along with his sister, Fernpaw. During the original series, he and Fernpaw willingly served as bait for the pack of dogs threatening ThunderClan's camp and ran ahead of them in order to lead them off course, because they lost their mother, Brindleface, to Tigerstar.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> In ''Into the Wild'', there is a ShadowClan elder named Ashfur.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> He died in ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'', but since ThunderClan's Ashfur was still Ashpaw at the time, there was no colliding of names.<ref name=risingstorm/> Ashfur is shown to be deeply committed to the warrior code, and, like other warriors such as his brother-in-law Dustpelt and his cousin [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]], has concerns about the increasing amount of half-Clan and rogue cats that have been allowed to join ThunderClan.\n\nDuring the events of ''The New Prophecy'', he falls in love with [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], and attempts to get closer to her while she struggles with [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]]. He is dismayed when Squirrelflight eventually tells him she was in love with Brambleclaw instead of him.<ref name=sunset/> Ashfur's resentment of Brambleclaw is also subconsciously motivated; he has never been able to forgive Brambleclaw for his father [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]]'s actions, mainly his killing of Brindleface, Ashfur's mother.\n\nIn the ''Power of Three'' series, Ashfur starts showing his resentment towards Squirrelflight's decision to raise a family with Brambleclaw. For example, during a sparring match between him and his apprentice, Lionpaw, Brambleclaw's son, he turns ferociously hostile. However, it is revealed in ''Long Shadows'' that he has never been angry with Brambleclaw, just Squirrelflight. It was he who helped Hawkfrost try to kill Firestar in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' since he wanted Squirrelflight to suffer the pain of losing her father in retaliation for her choosing Brambleclaw over him. He tries to do this again by attempting to kill Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Hollyleaf in the forest fire in ''Long Shadows'', but he releases them when Squirrelflight reveals they aren't her kits. He vows to tell all of the cats at the upcoming Gathering, which he claims will destroy Squirrelflight, in that she will lose Lionblaze, Jayfeather and Hollyleaf, Brambleclaw will want nothing to do with her, and no cat in any Clan would respect her. At the end of ''Long Shadows'', before he gets the chance, he is mysteriously killed and his body was found floating in the stream of WindClan territory. Most of the cats of ThunderClan suspect it was a WindClan patrol, but it seemed to be implied that Squirrelflight killed him.<ref name=\"longshadows\"/> The fact that Firestar did not mention the death of Ashfur at the Gathering might have been significant. Many people felt that Squirrelflight did not kill Ashfur, and the authors were instead trying to surprise the readers. Another suspected killer among fans was [[#Sol|Sol]] (though he seemed not to have a motive). In ''Sunrise'', his killer was revealed to be Hollyleaf, rather than Squirrelflight.<ref name=sunrise/>\n\nAshfur's mentor was Dustpelt. He has mentored Lionblaze as well as his nephew Birchfall. His mother is Brindleface. Brindleface was killed by Tigerstar in ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]''.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> He had a sister, Ferncloud, and as such is the uncle of Ferncloud's kits including Larchkit, Hollykit, Icecloud, Foxleap, Shrewpaw, Spiderleg, and Birchfall. He is also the foster brother of [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]], due to his mother Brindleface's serving as Cloudtail's surrogate mother in the Clan. His aunt was Frostfur, making him cousin to Brackenfur, Brightheart, Cinderpelt and Thornclaw. In ''Omen of the Stars'', it is revealed that he was allowed to join StarClan instead of being sent to the Dark Forest because his only fault was loving Squirrelflight too much. He is believed to have forgiven Hollyleaf for killing him when she enters the ranks of StarClan. Ashfur presumably fought in the battle against the Dark Forest, although this has not been confirmed.\n\n====Bramblestar====\n{{anchor|Bramblestar}}\n'''Bramblestar''', first introduced as Bramblekit, and later known as Brambleclaw, is a large, muscular dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes.  In ''[[A Dangerous Path]]'', he becomes Firestar's apprentice and is known as Bramblepaw for the remainder of the original series.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/>  He receives his warrior name, Brambleclaw, in the beginning of ''[[Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar/>\n\nBramblestar is the current ThunderClan leader, but he is often questioned about his loyalties because of his murderous dead father, Tigerstar. He receives a message from the dead Bluestar, where she tells him that he must travel with cats from each Clan to go to the sun-drown place. That leads him to be traveling with his sister Tawnypelt, Crowfeather, Feathertail,  and her brother Stormfur, and Firestar's daughter Squirrelflight. The cats journey to the sun-drown-place to find the badger, Midnight, who tells them that the Clans must find a new home. Brambleclaw seems to take a leadership role on their journey.<ref name=midnight>{{cite book|title=[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-074449-6}}</ref>\n\nBrambleclaw and the others help to find the Clans a new home around the lake. Once the four Clans had settled in their new homes, Tigerstar began to walk in the dreams of Brambleclaw and Brambleclaw's half-brother, Hawkfrost, both Tigerstar's kin. Tigerstar's goal was to make his two sons ambitious for power, like he was when he was alive. However, he believes that Brambleclaw is too weak to take power by himself, so he plots with his evil son, Hawkfrost, to create a trap for Firestar. Hawkfrost shares his plot with [[#Ashfur|Ashfur]], who agrees to help, wanting to cause terrible pain for Squirrelflight because she chose Brambleclaw instead of him. Under the false assumption that [[#Blackstar|Blackstar]] was waiting at the border, Firestar falls victim to a fox trap. Hawkfrost reveals that he was the one who led Firestar there, hoping Bramblestar would kill Firestar, and planning to kill Brambleclaw if he refused. However, Brambleclaw kills Hawkfrost and frees Firestar. Brambleclaw is later named deputy of ThunderClan after Leafpool has a vision of thorn-sharp brambles encircling the camp.\n\nIn ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight, who had been quarreling before, realize how important they truly are to each other and become mates, angering Ashfur.<ref name=sunset/> They apparently have three kits, [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]]&nbsp;\u2013 however, in ''Long Shadows'', Squirrelflight admits that Brambleclaw is not the father of her kits, and she never even had kits in the first place.<ref name=longshadows/> Brambleclaw himself is unaware of this, according to Squirrelflight, until the end of ''Sunrise''. He becomes furious at Squirrelflight for lying to him.<ref name=sunrise/>  In'' The Fourth Apprentice'', it's revealed that they are not mates anymore due to this.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\">{{cite book|title=[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-155509-1}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'', Brambleclaw succeeds Firestar as leader of ThunderClan, and appoints Squirrelflight his deputy, having finally forgiven her for her deception.<ref name=lasthope>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Warriors: Omen of the Stars: The Last Hope|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2012|isbn=978-0-06-155527-5}}</ref>\n\nBrambleclaw has mentored [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]]. Brambleclaw's siblings include Tawnypelt and four half siblings: Hawkfrost, [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], Tadpole and Swiftpaw. He is uncle to Tawnypelt's kits, including [[#Tigerheart|Tigerheart]], [[#Dawnpelt|Dawnpelt]], and [[#Flametail|Flametail]].\n\nBrambleclaw's parents are Goldenflower and Tigerstar, and it is revealed in ''Code of the Clans'' that Brambleclaw's grandparents are Pinestar and Leopardfoot.<ref name=codeoftheclans>{{cite book|title=[[Code of the Clans]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-166009-2}}</ref> He is great-grandson to Sweetbriar (Pinestar's mother), Adderfang and Swiftbreeze (Leopardfoot's parents); his both great-grandmothers being SkyClan's direct descendants (Cloudstar, Birdflight, Gorseclaw and Spottedpelt), Brambleclaw is himself part-SkyClan. He is also nephew to Mistkit and Nightkit (Tigerstar's sisters), Lionheart and Snowkit (Goldenflower's brothers), and great-nephew to Patchpelt, Willowpelt, Redtail and Spottedleaf (Leopardfoot's siblings).\n\n====Squirrelflight====\n<!-- Attention editors: Squirrelflight is not officially documented to be related to Ashfur so please do not add this to the article -->\n\n'''Squirrelflight''', a dark ginger she-cat with green eyes, is the daughter of [[#Firestar|Firestar]] and [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], as well as the littermate of [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]]. She and Leafpool share a special telepathic connection, in which one can always know what the other is thinking or feeling.<ref name=midnight/> She and Leafpool are first introduced as kits, Squirrelkit and Leafkit, in the epilogue of ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar/> In ''The New Prophecy'', Squirrelflight joins the prophesied cats to find Midnight at the sun-drown place, the prophesied cats being [[#Crowfeather|Crowpaw]], [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]], [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] and his sister [[#Tawnypelt|Tawnypelt]]. [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]] tags along as well so he can be with Feathertail, his sister.<ref name=midnight/> Squirrelflight is shown to be arrogant with a temper as an apprentice, but gradually matures during ''The New Prophecy'' series.\n\nAt first, she taunted and resented Brambleclaw, but later fell in love with him during their journey, similar to what happened with her parents, Firestar and Sandstorm. However, when Brambleclaw warms up to his half-brother and RiverClan warrior, [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], Squirrelflight begins to lose her trust in him, believing that Hawkfrost is as murderously ambitious as his father, Tigerstar, and that Brambleclaw will follow in his footsteps. During this time, Squirrelflight began to get closer to Ashfur.<ref name=twilight/> During the badger attack in ThunderClan camp that kills [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]], Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw realize how much they really mean to each other, and Squirrelflight leaves Ashfur to be with Brambleclaw. She tries to remain friends with Ashfur, but he rejects her friendship, feeling betrayed.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nAt the end of ''The New Prophecy'' series, Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw apparently have three kits; [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]]. Ashfur seems to have gotten over Squirrelflight, however he behaves rather strangely. In ''Long Shadows'', Ashfur admits that he was the one who helped Hawkfrost try to kill Firestar in ''Sunset'', in an attempt to hurt Squirrelflight emotionally. He then tries to kill her three kits in a forest fire, but Squirrelflight reveals that they aren't hers, so it would not hurt her that way. At the end of ''Long Shadows'', Ashfur is found mysteriously murdered by WindClan territory, Squirrelflight being a major suspect, but it is revealed in [[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]] that actually [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] killed Ashfur, trying to keep him quiet, as he was planning to tell the secret that Squirrelflight and [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] weren't her parents at a Gathering.<ref name=sunrise/><ref name=longshadows/>\nBrambleclaw is furious that Squirrelflight lied to him about Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather, and in Omen of the Stars, they are not mates anymore. At the end of ''The Last Hope'', he finally forgives her.\n\nWhen her father dies and Brambleclaw becomes leader, she becomes his deputy. In the manga at the end of ''Bramblestar's Storm'', it is revealed that she is not barren, as indicated earlier by Yellowfang, as she is expecting Bramblestar's kits. In ''The Apprentice's Quest'', she has kits Alderpaw and Sparkpaw. Alderpaw looks like his father Bramblestar and Sparkpaw looks like her grandfather Firestar.\n\nSquirrelflight was mentored by Dustpelt and has mentored Foxleap and Rosepetal.\n\n====Leafpool====\n'''Leafpool''', a slender light brown tabby she-cat with white paws and amber eyes, is the medicine cat of ThunderClan. She is the daughter of [[#Firestar|Firestar]] and [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], and the sister of [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], with whom she shares a unique telepathic connection, in which each can always know what the other is feeling.<ref name=midnight/> She is mentioned as a kit, Leafkit, named for [[#Leafstar|Leafstar]] and [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]], in the epilogue of ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'',<ref name=firestar/> and later as a medicine cat apprentice, Leafpaw, in ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'', mentored by her mother's (Sandstorm) cousin [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]].<ref name=midnight/>\nShe makes the Great Journey along with the four Clans in ''Dawn''<ref name=dawn/> and discovers the Moonpool in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'', the Moonstone equivalent in their new territory. Because of this, Cinderpelt gives Leafpaw her full medicine cat name, Leafpool. Leafpool also receives a frightening prophecy from StarClan: ''Before there is peace, blood will spill blood, and the lake will run red.''<ref name=starlight/>\n\nThis prophecy meant Brambleclaw killing Hawkfrost to save Firestar, Leafpool's father. When Leafpool arrives a little after Hawkfrost dies, not going to StarClan but to the Dark Forest seeing that he is just as evil as Tigerstar, she believes that Brambleclaw is a traitor, but when she sees that the blood on his pads weren't her father's but Hawkfrost's, she understood the prophecy at last.\n''Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost were kin; Blood had indeed spilled blood. Brambleclaw had killed his half brother to save Firestar. She had been right about Hawkfrost&nbsp;\u2013 he was too ambitious, too much like his father, Tigerstar-but she has never imagined that Brambleclaw would be the cat to stop him''.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nLeafpool starts to develop feelings for [[#Crowfeather|Crowfeather]], though they are from different Clans and Leafpool is not allowed to take a mate, being a medicine cat. After Cinderpelt finds out that she has been meeting Crowfeather, they attempt to run away to be able to be together in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''. However, when [[#Midnight|Midnight]] the badger arrives to warn the Clans of a badger attack, Crowfeather and Leafpool realize how much their Clans mean to them, and they decide to return. Unfortunately, Leafpool arrives too late to save Cinderpelt when the horde of badgers attack the ThunderClan camp, and continually expresses guilt because of her mentor's death throughout the rest of the series.<ref name=twilight/> She and Crowfeather agree never to see each other again, though for the rest of the books they are both oddly tense whenever they meet on occasion. Leafpool becomes the new ThunderClan medicine cat in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', and discovers that [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] is to be the new deputy in [[#Greystripe|Greystripe's]] absence and that he and Squirrelflight are destined to be mates, as well as the fact that her mentor, Cinderpelt, has been reincarnated as one of [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail's]] kits, [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]].<ref name=sunset/> Spottedleaf also reveals to her that [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], the RiverClan medicine cat and Leafpool's friend, does not believe in StarClan, a result of [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], her brother, tricking Mudfur into taking her as his apprentice and then openly sharing with her what truly happened. Leafpool is also featured in a play written by [[Victoria Holmes]], titled ''After Sunset: We Need to Talk'', in which she appears to have something to tell Crowfeather, but then denies it after Crowfeather confesses that he has taken a new mate, [[#Nightcloud|Nightcloud]], in WindClan.<ref name=\"firstplay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorcats.com/data/downloads/we_need_to_talk.pdf|title=After Sunset: We Need to Talk|last=Hunter|first=Erin|accessdate=June 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206040610/http://warriorcats.com/data/downloads/we_need_to_talk.pdf|archivedate=February 6, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n\nLater, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', she takes [[#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]] as her apprentice, who later decides to quit and become a warrior instead, confessing that she only wanted to be a medicine cat because of the position it would give her. Then, [[#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]], Hollypaw's brother, receives a message from StarClan telling him that he must become a medicine cat, and becomes Leafpool's new apprentice.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> Leafpool gives him his full medicine cat name Jayfeather, in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows/>\n\nIn \"Sunrise\" it is revealed that Leafpool is Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze's mother. Crowfeather is their father. Hollyleaf tells the truth at the Gathering and Crowfeather says that Leafpool, Jayfeather, Lionblaze and Hollyleaf mean nothing to him. Leafpool apologizes to the Clan for her deception and wilingly steps down as a medicine cat. Afterwards, Hollyleaf tries to kill her by forcing her to eat deathberries in the ThunderClan camp. Leafpool asks Hollyleaf what would be worse: if she stayed alive, disowned by Crowfeather, living without the love of her own kits, and no longer a medicine cat, or died; Hollyleaf stops forcing her and Leafpool walks out of the medicine cat's den.<ref name=sunrise/>\n\nIn ''Omen of the Stars'', she has become a warrior because she broke the Warrior Code by having kits. However, Jayfeather and Hollyleaf seem to view her as being incompetent as a warrior and are still furious about her deception. Lionblaze, however, seems to have forgiven her and respects and loves her as his mother. After the events of ''The Last Hope'', she becomes a medicine cat again, sharing the role with Jayfeather.\n\nShe is also niece to Princess (Firestar's sister), half-niece to Scourge, Ruby and Socks (Firestar's half-siblings), Ashfur and Ferncloud (Sandstorm's half-brother and half-sister), cousin to Cloudtail (Princess' son), granddaughter to Redtail and Brindleface (Sandstorm's parents), Jake and Nutmeg (Firestar's parents), great-niece to Willowpelt, Spottedleaf, Patchpelt and Leopardfoot (Redtail's brother and sisters), Dustpelt, Longtail, Ravenpaw and Frostfur (Brindleface's brothers and sister), and great-granddaughter to Adderfang and Swiftbreeze (Redtail's parents), and Fuzzypelt and Robinwing (Brindleface's parents).\n\n====Daisy====\n'''Daisy''' is a beautiful cream-colored long-furred she-cat with dazzling ice blue eyes who lived at the horseplace with two other cats named '''Smoky''' and '''Floss'''. She was afraid that the twolegs  (or 'Nofurs', as she initially referred to them as) at horseplace were going to take away her kits fathered by Smoky (originally named Berry, Mouse, and Hazel) because they had taken away Floss's litter, so she brought them to ThunderClan to keep them safe. Cloudtail volunteers to help teach her battle moves, and she develops feelings for him  over time. She does not enjoy training and complains frequently about the safety of her kits.<ref name=starlight/> She decides to go back to the horseplace following the badger attack in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', worried that Clan life is too dangerous for her kits, but is persuaded to return to ThunderClan by her kits, Berrykit, Mousekit and Hazelkit along with Brambleclaw and Cloudtail. It is also revealed that another reason that she left is because she realizes that Cloudtail will never return her feelings for him after she sees the way he loves [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], his mate.<ref name=sunset/> Her kits trained as ThunderClan warriors and received their warrior names, Berrynose, Mousewhisker, and Hazeltail, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> Daisy's first litter was fathered by Smoky, but her recent mate is Spiderleg, with whom she has two kits; [[#Rosepetal|Rosekit]] and [[#Toadstep|Toadkit]]. In ''Long Shadows'', it is revealed that Spiderleg and Daisy are no longer mates, and that Spiderleg \"never really wanted kits in the first place.\"<ref name=longshadows/> Daisy is a permanent member of ThunderClan, but she is not a warrior; she remains in the nursery throughout the series to help the queens. In ''Fading Echoes'', she becomes grandmother to Cherrykit and Molekit (Berrynose and Poppyfrost's kits).\n\n====Ferncloud====\n'''Ferncloud''' is a pale gray she-cat with darker flecks and pale green eyes. She is mentored by [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] (and [[#Longtail|Longtail]], after Darkstripe is exiled from ThunderClan) as an apprentice, '''Fernpaw''', during the original series. In ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' she helps to lure the dog pack away from the ThunderClan camp along with her brother, [[#Ashfur|Ashpaw]], to avenge the death of their mother, [[#Minor ThunderClan characters|Brindleface]].<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> She is the mate of [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]], and mother of three litters: first litter: [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]] and [[#Minor ThunderClan characters|Shrewpaw]]; second litter: Hollykit, Larchkit, and [[#Birchfall|Birchfall]]; third litter: [[#Foxleap|Foxleap]] and [[#Icecloud|Icecloud]]. Unfortunately, Hollykit and Larchkit die from starvation, while Shrewpaw dies when he is run over by a monster while hunting a pheasant in ''Dawn''.<ref name=dawn/> Ferncloud is depicted as a gentle, motherly cat who remains in the nursery, where she is suited best. She helps to look after new kits with Daisy.

He is the brother of [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] and [[#Sootfur|Sootfur]] and the son of Willowpelt and [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]].<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> He is later an apprentice, Rainpaw, mentored by [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]], in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.  As an apprentice, he was often sent to assist Cinderpelt.<ref name=firestar/> He becomes a warrior sometime between ''Firestar's Quest'' and ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]''.

In ''Long Shadows'', it is revealed that Spiderleg no longer loves Daisy and that he \"never really wanted kits.\"<ref name=longshadows/> Spiderleg is overall a loyal warrior, but shares his sharp tongue with his father, Dustpelt, and is often one of the key characters to protest against something unusual. He shares the belief with Dustpelt, Thornclaw, and Ashfur that there are too many non-Clanborn cats in ThunderClan. He is one of the few completely \"forest-blooded\" cats left in ThunderClan. He is not one of the main characters, and often flits in and out of scenes in the books since his first real introduction as an apprentice, Spiderpaw, in ''Midnight''.\nSpiderleg's also nephew to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), grandson to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-grandson to Fuzzypelt and Robinwing (Brindleface's parents), great-nephew to Frostfur (Brindleface's sister), Longtail, Dustpelt and Ravenpaw (Brindleface's brothers), uncle to Dovewing and Ivypool (Birchfall's daughters) and kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brightheart, Brackenfur (Frostfur's kits), Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter), Poppyfrost, Honeyfern, Cinderheart and Molepaw (Brackenfur's kits)\n\n====Sootfur====\n'''Sootfur''', a light grey tom with amber eyes, is a ThunderClan warrior first introduced in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', the brother of [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] and [[#Rainwhisker|Rainwhisker]] and the son of Willowpelt and [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]].<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> He was seen as an apprentice, Sootpaw, in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.

Sootfur appears to be hotheaded and sometimes says somewhat rude things such as when he remarks that Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw may have made the right decision getting out of the forest when they did and when he remarks that Daisy would be too fat and lazy to run fast enough to catch mice.  In the fifth book of ''The New Prophecy'' series, ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', Sootfur is killed during the attack of the badgers invading ThunderClan camp.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nSootfur's mentor was originally [[#Longtail|Longtail]], but after Longtail was blinded by a rabbit in ''Firestar's Quest'', his mentor was changed to [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]].<ref name=firestar/> He is uncle of Sorreltail's kits, including [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]],(deceased) [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], and Molepaw (deceased).

Introduced in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' as Sorrelkit, an adventurous young kit, she followed her half-brother [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] and caught him speaking to Blackfoot, the ShadowClan deputy, on ThunderClan territory during the events of the book.

In the end, she gives birth to four kits, Molepaw (dead), Poppyfrost, Honeyfern (dead), and [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], named in honor of Cinderpelt, which is ironic because Cinderheart is the reincarnated form of Cinderpelt - even though Cinderheart doesn't know it herself.<ref name=sunset/> Later in ''The Forgotten Warrior'', Sorreltail and Brackenfur announce that she is carrying kits again, and in the ending chapter of the book, Sorreltail gives birth to two kits, which she names Seedkit and Lilykit.

After a ThunderClan patrol finds them, they join ThunderClan and Berry is given the Clan name of Berrykit.<ref name=twilight/> He is the most adventurous of his littermates, and he accidentally ventures into a fox trap while sneaking out of camp exploring in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' and loses half of his tail.<ref name=sunset/> This event causes him to be paranoid about his warrior name, afraid Firestar would give him a ridiculous name, such as 'Berrystumpytail'.

She is nearly bitten by a snake in ''Sunrise'', but is saved by her cousin Honeyfern, who died.<ref name=sunrise/> In [[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]] she is mentored by [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]].<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> She becomes a warrior in [[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]] after being injured by a tree falling on her hind legs, permanently paralyzing them.<ref name=fadingechoes/>\n\nShe feels very guilty, for not being able to hunt, or patrol for her Clan (due to her broken backbone). As a result, she won't eat anything Millie brings her. Jayfeather's solution is for Briarlight to help him in his den (cleaning up herbs, making moss balls, and checking moss for bits of wood,dirt, and thorns). She also finds a small scrap of Hollyleaf's fur in ''The Forgotten Warrior''.\n\n====Bumblestripe====\n{{anchor|Bumbleflight}}\nA pale grey tom with dark black stripes, '''Bumblestripe''' is the son of [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] and [[#Millie|Millie]] and the littermate of [[#Blossomfall|Blossomfall]] and [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]], as well as the half-brother of [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]] and [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]]. He is said to be the biggest kit in his litter and was named for the stripes on his back, making him look like a bumblebee. He was first introduced in ''Eclipse'', along with his littermates.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> In ''[[The Fourth Apprentice]]'' he is mentored by [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]].<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> It is hinted by Blossomfall that Bumblestripe is in love with Dovewing in ''Sign of the Moon''.<ref name=signofthemoon>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Sign of the Moon|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-155518-3}}</ref>\nIn ''The Forgotten Warrior'', he is seen spending a lot of time with Dovewing and by the end of the book, he confesses to Dovewing that he wants to be more than friends. Following ''The Last Hope'', Dovewing begins a relationship with Bumblestripe, but in ''Bramblestar's Storm'', their relationship ends.\n\n====Cinderheart====\n'''Cinderheart''', a grey tabby she-cat with blue eyes, is a ThunderClan warrior first mentioned at the end of ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''<ref name=twilight/> and formally introduced in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She is initially revealed to be the reincarnation of [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]], the former ThunderClan medicine cat. This fact becomes clear to Leafpool in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' when Spottedleaf tells her where to find Cinderpelt and shows her Cinderkit. Cinderheart is not consciously aware of her situation and is very much her own character, though her personality is similar to Cinderpelt's before she was injured;<ref name=sunset/> [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather's]] attempts to walk in her dreams result in the personality of the original Cinderpelt revealing herself in the former ThunderClan camp in the forest, implying that Cinderpelt's spirit does indeed reside within Cinderheart's subconsciousness. [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] are the only cats that are aware of Cinderheart's true identity; while Leafpool wants to keep it a secret from Cinderheart indefinitely, Jayfeather wants to reveal the truth to her, thus adding heat to the already obvious indifferences of these two cats (as of ''Night Whispers'', Jayfeather has not revealed the truth to Cinderheart or anybody else).\n\nShe and Lionblaze seemed to become mates between Fading Echoes, and Night Whispers. She and Lionblaze seemed to be deeply in love, but Cinderheart breaks the relationship when Lionblaze tells her that he is part of the prophecy. She tells him that they can't be mates, and as a result, she breaks Lionblaze's heart. In ''The Forgotten Warrior'', Jayfeather convinces her that she and Lionblaze can become mates.\n\nCinderheart is StarClan's answer to Cinderpelt's dreams of becoming a warrior. She becomes an apprentice under [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]] along with Jayfeather, [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] and [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], her best friend, and others. In an ironic twist of fate, however, she falls from a tree branch in ''Dark River'' and injures her leg, in fact the same leg that Cinderpelt injured.<ref name=\"pwrbook2\"/> She is able to recover partially, but reinjures it during her assessment in ''Eclipse'' and is thrown into a state of depression (Cinderpaw's desire to become a warrior is as strong as Cinderpelt's, although it is unknown whether Cinderpelt herself influenced this personality). Jayfeather teaches her to swim in order to stretch and build the muscles without straining them, and by the end of ''Eclipse'', Cinderpaw is able to walk and run normally and receives her warrior name.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> Cinderpelt's original destiny having been fulfilled, it is unknown whether or not Cinderheart's reincarnation will contribute to future events.\n\nAt the end of ''Eclipse'', when she is given her warrior name, Firestar names her Cinderheart \"...in honor of those warriors who have gone before.\"<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> It is unclear whether Firestar is referencing Cinderpelt or not. Though Cinderheart is a reincarnation of Cinderpelt, in this new life she is the daughter of [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] and [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and the sister of Molepaw, who died from a sickness that didn't react to Leafpool's herbs.  [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]] and [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]] are also her siblings. Brackenfur and Cinderpelt are siblings so Cinderpelt and her reincarnation are actually related, Cinderheart being her niece. During ''Sunrise'', Honeyfern dies, and Cinderheart is grief-stricken. She tells Hollyleaf she shouldn't have said anything at the Gathering.  In \"Omen of the Stars\", Cinderheart is Ivypaw's mentor.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Cinderheart and Cinderpelt both fell in love with similar tom cats, since Lionblaze is Firestar's kin, that might also be part of Cinderheart's destiny.\n\nIn '' The Last Hope'', she still cannot decide whether to stay a warrior or be a medicine cat as in her past life. Lionblaze confronts her and tells her that she has a destiny, but she can choose. When she chooses to be a warrior and chooses to be Lionblaze's mate, Cinderpelt's spirit comes out of her body and mouths \"Thank you\" to Lionblaze before she goes to StarClan.\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', she has three kits with Lionblaze: Hollykit, Fernkit, and Sorrelkit, later Hollytuft, Fernsong, and Sorrelstripe.\n\n====Foxleap====\nA reddish tabby tom, '''Foxleap''' was first introduced as a kit, Foxkit, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> He is the son of [[#Ferncloud|Ferncloud]] and [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]] and the littermate of Icecloud as well as the brother of Shrewpaw, Hollykit, Larchkit, [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]], and Birchfall. He becomes an apprentice, Foxpaw, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', and is mentored by his cousin [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], but due to Squirrelflight's temporary departure to the Tribe of Rushing Water during the book, he is mentored by his aunt Sandstorm's cousin [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] for a while.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> His aunt [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]] also takes over as his mentor for Squirrelflight when she becomes ill in ''[[#Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows/> It is said that he wishes his warrior name to be '''Foxcatcher'''. Foxleap is nephew to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother) grandson to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brackenfur, Brightheart (Frostfur's kits), Honeyfern, Poppyfrost, Molepaw, Cinderheart (Brackenfur's kits) and Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter). He's also uncle to Dovewing, Ivypool (Birchfall's daughters), Rosepetal and Toadstep (Spiderleg's kits).\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', Foxleap is said to have died of his wounds shortly after the great battle. This is confirmed in ''Dovewing's Silence''.\n\n====Hazeltail====\n'''Hazeltail''' is a small grey-and-white she-cat, the daughter of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Smoky|Smoky]], the littermate of [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]] and [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]], and the half-sister of [[#Rosepetal|Rosepetal]] and [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]]. She is first introduced as a kit named '''Hazel''' in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', when her mother Daisy took her and her littermates away from the horseplace where they were born so the Twolegs there would not take them away. After a ThunderClan patrol found them, they joined ThunderClan and Hazel was given the Clan name of Hazelkit.<ref name=twilight/> In ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]] visits the nursery and shows her and Mousewhisker (then Mousekit) a butterfly, which she says they can catch, leading [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] to discover the truth about the RiverClan medicine cat, [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]].<ref name=sunset/> She was introduced as an apprentice, Hazelpaw, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', mentored by [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]],<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> and continues this apprenticeship until she becomes a warrior, Hazeltail, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', along with her littermates.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\nIn Sunrise, she meets her father, Smoky, and Floss for the first time.  Smoky appears proud of her and Floss is concerned when she mentions that Berrynose lost half his tail in a fox trap.<ref name=sunrise/>\nShe was the mentor of Blossomfall.\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', she is said to be killed by greencough.\n\n====Hollyleaf====\n'''Hollyleaf''', a slender black she-cat with green eyes, is a ThunderClan kit, apprentice and warrior introduced in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She is one of the protagonists of the ''Power of Three'' series with her ThunderClan brothers [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], and is on the cover of ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]''. Initially, Hollyleaf chooses to become a medicine cat as a result of the respect she sees other cats giving [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]], the current medicine cat, and wants to be considered extremely important to her Clan. She abandons this choice after a short time, as she cannot remember herbs very well and gets easily disgusted when dealing with wounds and injuries. She develops an affinity for battle training and realizes that she would best serve her Clan as a warrior, and begins training under [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]]. Hollyleaf learned under her mentor to be incredibly loyal and devoted to follow the warrior code.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> As a result, Hollyleaf highly disapproved of her brother Lionblaze's affinity for Heathertail, a WindClan she-cat.\n\nHollyleaf is considered the most cunning and bound to the warrior code of the three siblings, prone to thinking out strategies carefully rather than rushing in blindly. She is not one of the Three in the prophecy, even though both of her brothers are. As a result, she has no power. She is devoted to the warrior code and considers it to be the foundation of Clan life, and is terrified to think of a Clan operating without it. She has aspirations about becoming Clan leader, a function that she feels would best serve her Clan. Her ideologies differ from her brothers in this respect, in that she is always trying to think of what would benefit all cats and not just herself. Hollyleaf seems deeply burdened by responsibility upon learning of the prophecy concerning herself and her siblings. It was revealed in ''Long Shadows'' that Squirrelflight is not her mother. Her real parents are Leafpool and Crowfeather. In ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'', Hollyleaf becomes so obsessed with the code, she scares Jayfeather at one point. At the end of the book, she kills Ashfur to stop him from telling the clans that Squirrelflight is not her mother.<ref name=longshadows/> In ''Sunrise'', she goes mad having been the daughter of a medicine cat and a WindClan warrior thus breaking the warrior code. Eventually, in a Gathering, she reveals to every cat that Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw weren't the parents of her and Lionblaze and Jayfeather, but it was Leafpool and Crowfeather. Then, she runs into a tunnel which collapses onto her, leading most cats to believe she is dead.\n\nShe also tries to kill Leafpool by forcing her eat deathberries, but lets her go when Leafpool points out that it would be more painful for her to live on than die. Hollyleaf's extreme devotion to the warrior code eventually led to her downfall. While most thought that Hollyleaf was part of the Three, she truly was not. Rather, the three relates to Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Dovewing. She is proven alive in  ''The Forgotten Warrior'' and she returns to ThunderClan.\n\nShe is killed by Dark Forest warrior Hawkfrost while helping defeat Hawkfrost with  Ivypool, who brought Hollyleaf back to ThunderClan in '' The Last Hope '' and is seen walking out with the rest of the spirits of StarClan when they retrieve Firestar to go to StarClan.\n\nShe is great-granddaughter to Jake and Nutmeg (Firestar's parents), and Redtail and Brindleface (Sandstorm's parents), she is half-sister to Breezepelt (Nightcloud's and Crowfeather's son), granddaughter to Firestar and Sandstorm (Leafpool's parents) and Ashfoot, the WindClan deputy (and Crowfeather's mother), niece to Eaglekit (Crowfeather's brother) and Squirrelflight (Leafpool's sister), grandniece to Princess (Firestar's sister), half-grand-niece to Scourge, Ruby and Socks (Firestar's half-siblings) and kin to Cloudtail (Firestar's nephew), Whitewing (Cloudtail's daughter), Dovepaw and Ivypaw (Whitewing's daughters). As her father, Crowfeather, is a direct descendant to Windstar and Gorsestar (WindClan's first and second leaders), Hollyleaf is their descendant too. She's half-WindClan, 25% ThunderClan, 25% kittypet, and part SkyClan, because Spottedleaf is Sandstorm's aunt. As Spottedleaf is related directly to Birdflight's (Cloudstar's mate) kits, and Sandstorm is Hollyleaf's grandmother.\n\n====Honeyfern====\n'''Honeyfern''' is a light brown tabby she-cat with blue eyes and the daughter of [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]]. She is sister to [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], and Molepaw. She was first introduced as a kit, Honeykit, near the end of ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', and as an apprentice,<ref name=sunset/> Honeypaw, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''. She was mentored by [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], who also mentored her mother, Sorreltail.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She continues her apprenticeship for the rest of the series until she receives her warrior name, Honeyfern, in ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> It is revealed that she has a crush on [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]]. In ''Sunrise'' Berrynose starts to return the affection. Soon after, she dies of a snake bite while saving Briarkit, however.<ref name=sunrise/> In ''The Fourth Apprentice'', Honeyfern saves Jayfeather from Breezepelt when Breezepelt attacks the ThunderClan medicine cat at the Moonpool.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/>\n\n====Icecloud====\n'''Icecloud''' is a white she-cat with bright blue eyes, first introduced as a kit, Icekit, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She is the daughter of [[#Ferncloud|Ferncloud]] and [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]] and the littermate of Foxleap, as well as the younger sister of Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Birchfall, Hollykit (who died before the Great Journey) and Larchkit. Icepaw and Foxpaw shared dens with Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Hollyleaf before the three later became apprentices. She became an apprentice in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', mentored by Whitewing.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> It is said that she wishes her warrior name to be '''Icestorm'''. Icecloud is a niece to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), granddaughter to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-granddaughter to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Brindleface's parents), grandniece to Frostfur (Brindleface's sister), kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brackenfur, Brightheart (Frostfur's kits), Honeyfern, Poppyfrost, Molepaw, Cinderheart (Brackenfur's kits) and Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter). She's also aunt to Dovepaw, Ivypaw (Birchfall's daughters), Rosepetal and Toadstep (Spiderleg's kits).\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', she is said to be killed by greencough.\n\n====Jayfeather====\n'''Jayfeather''' is a grey tabby tom with blue eyes, and he is [[Blindness|blind]].<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> He is the brother of [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] as well as the half-brother of [[#Breezepelt|Breezepelt]], and one of the protagonists of the ''Power of Three'' series with his siblings. Jayfeather is currently a full medicine cat in\nThunderClan. Initially, Jayfeather wanted to become a warrior, because he desired to be just as important as his littermates to the Clan and felt that the duties of a medicine cat were insignificant compared to the glories a warrior could experience. He began warrior training under his grandmother's cousin [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], but soon tired of it. He did not receive much training and barely explored ThunderClan's territory. In a rebellious act, Jayfeather decides to explore himself. This led to him walking over a cliff in the middle of WindClan's territory and falling into the lake. Luckily, a WindClan patrol consisting of Crowfeather, Heatherpaw, Breezepaw, and Whitetail was nearby, but because of this, Jayfeather is afraid of water after his father, Crowfeather, pulls him out. Later, Spottedleaf persuaded him to become a medicine cat. Jayfeather is very conscious of his condition and adamantly refuses to be treated differently because of it, as he hates the thought of being pitied.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/>\n\nDespite his inability to see, Jayfeather's other senses are greatly magnified and he is often able to navigate just as well as any other cat. His superior sense of smell enables him to diagnose medicinal ailments instantly and from a great distance away, a trait that is obviously ideal for a medicine cat. Jayfeather is able to hear and smell cats approaching from a great distance, well before any other cat nearby. In addition to his heightened senses, Jayfeather was born with a form of [[Extrasensory Perception|extrasensory perception]] which enables him to read other cats' minds, as well as enter the dreams of other cats and listen in on their conversations with members of StarClan. It is shown in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' that this ability extends to cats who do not fall under the jurisdiction of StarClan, such as cats of the [[List of characters in the Warriors novel series#The Tribe of Rushing Water|Tribe of Rushing Water]].<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> Jayfeather's mind-reading abilities can be blocked, however, if the intended target is aware of his intention; Leafpool is aware of her son's ability and consciously damps her thoughts whenever she does not want him in her head. Jayfeather is also unable to read the mind of [[#Sol|Sol]] because his thoughts are so rapid and many that he can't focus on him.<ref name=longshadows/>\n\nJayfeather's personality is somewhat on par with [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]] in that he is typically grumpy and easily angered. Jayfeather is the first to learn of the prophecy concerning himself and his siblings, and takes its meaning to imply that they are more important than any of the other cats and as such do not have to follow their rules. He has stumbled upon a seemingly insignificant stick which inexplicably emanates the thoughts and feelings of past members of the [[List of Warriors characters#Ancient Cats|Ancient Clans]], who used to live by the lake long ago.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> Many fans have claimed that he had a \"relationship\" with it<ref>forums</ref> until he broke it deliberately in The Fourth Apprentice, after finding out that Rock had been lying to him.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Jayfeather feels he is on the verge of a great discovery, the implications of which have greater importance than StarClan. He is also aware of [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]]'s reincarnation. Despite these pieces of knowledge, Jayfeather seems to care about his Clanmates and performs quite well as a medicine cat. Jayfeather has abilities that other medicine cats don't, such as walking in other cat's dreams. One of the first times he did this was when he followed Leafpool to the Moonpool and overheard her dream. Over the course of the series he has become more tolerant of his Clanmates and less irritable, mainly due to his liberal use of mind-reading and being able to sympathize with their thoughts.  It was revealed in ''Long Shadows'' that Squirrelflight is not his mother.<ref name=longshadows/> Prior to the release of ''Sunrise'', it was rumoured Leafpool and Crowfeather are his parents because of the attitude and coloring. This is found true which leads to Hollyleaf's so-called \"death\" and during his naming ceremony, Leafpool felt a feeling of love to him, and, in ''The New Prophecy'' series, Leafpool and Crowfeather were alone together at one point when they ran off. He saves Firestar after he is attacked by a fox in \"The Fourth Apprentice,\" although it was too late and he lost another life. He follows Poppyfrost (heavily pregnant with Berrynose's kits, Cherrypaw and Molepaw) to the Moonpool when she wants to see Honeyfern again, and gets attacked by Breezepelt, but Honeyfern drives him and another cat from the Dark Forest (Brokenstar) away. He is the first of the Three to learn about the battle between StarClan and the Dark Forest.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Jayfeather is a reincarnation of Jay's Wing, who was an [[#Ancient Cats|ancient cat]].<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> In \"Long Shadows\", he meets the cat he loves, Half Moon, who later becomes the first Teller of the Pointed Stones. Half Moon reappears in \"The Forgotten Warrior\" and says that she waits for him forever.\n\nHe is great-grandson to Jake and Nutmeg, Firestar's parents. He is also related to the leader of BloodClan, Scourge, because Firestar and Scourge are half brothers\n\n====Lionblaze====\n'''Lionblaze''', a muscular golden brown tabby tom with amber eyes and thick fur around his neck, is a protagonist of the ''Power of Three'' series with his siblings Jayfeather and Hollyleaf and is the half brother of Breezepelt, a WindClan warrior. He is secretly taught by the spirits of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]] and [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]] about different battle moves in ''Dark River''. A pretty young WindClan apprentice named [[#Heathertail|Heatherpaw]] convinces him to form a play Clan called '''DarkClan''' inside the underground tunnels, with the leader being Heatherpaw and the deputy being Lionblaze, under the assumed names '''Heatherstar''' and '''Lionclaw''', respectively. Lionblaze unknowingly falls in love with her, and she falls in love with him. [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] and [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]] find out about the meetings, and Hollyleaf threatens to tell. Lionblaze hates her nosiness. He enjoys the secret night meetings immensely, but falls behind in his training. One night, Lionblaze teaches Heatherpaw some of Tigerstar's moves and Hawkfrost gets angry, later rebuking him for teaching battle techniques to the enemy. He tells Lionblaze that Heatherpaw will probably use them against him in battle.  Lionblaze is devastated, and tells Heatherpaw that he won't see her anymore. She is deeply hurt, but Lionblaze stays true to his word.<ref name=\"pwrbook2\"/> Soon his battle and hunting skills improve again and his mentor, [[#Ashfur|Ashfur]], is pleased. No one is aware of his haunted visits with his apparent grandfather and uncle, and Hollyleaf notices that his fighting skills exceed the level for normal apprentices, and Brambleclaw recognizes his father's fighting moves. She and the other apprentices are horrified as Ashfur and Lionblaze begin a dangerous sort of play-fight, where they act as if the other is an enemy. Hollyleaf notes that Ashfur looked as if he hated Lionblaze with all his heart during the fight, but afterward praised him and acted proud.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\">Hunter, Erin. (2007) ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''. <!-- Lionblaze: 363pp.--></ref><ref name=\"pwrbook3\">Hunter, Erin.

(2007) ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]''. <!-- For Lionblaze:322pp --></ref> His power is the ability to remain unharmed during fighting.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> At the end of ''Eclipse'', Lionblaze has an argument with Tigerstar and Hawkfrost.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> This could be because of Tigerstar's teaching method and his constant bullying if Lionblaze doesn't train the way Tigerstar wants him to or if Lionblaze tries to talk to Tigerstar and Hawkfrost about the prophecy. He is chosen to mentor [[#Dovewing|Dovepaw]], the last of the Three in ''The Fourth Apprentice''. He is chosen to go find out what is causing the water not to flow along with Dovepaw, [[#Tigerheart|Tigerheart]] and Toadfoot of ShadowClan, Petalfur and Rippletail of RiverClan, and Sedgewhisker and Whitetail of WindClan.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/>\n\nSince the beginning of the ''Omen of the Stars'' series, Lionblaze has been growing closer to Cinderheart. In ''Night Whispers'', he asks Cinderheart if they are becoming more than friends and she agrees that they are. However, she later learns that Lionblaze is a part of the prophecy and claims that, since StarClan has chosen him to be someone with a greater destiny, she can not become his mate. She grows even more distant when her life as Cinderpelt's reincarnation is revealed. However, in ''The Last Hope'', he confronts Cinderheart about their destinies and they become mates, while Cinderpelt's spirit finally joins StarClan.<ref name=nightwhispers>{{cite book|title=[[Night Whispers (Warriors)|Night Whispers]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-155515-2}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the release of ''Sunrise'', it was speculated that Leafpool and Crowfeather were his parents. Also, in the latest \"Warriors New\" E-Mail, it mentioned \"the parentage of a certain trio of ThunderClan cats\" as well as \"the shocking rumors about who might really be their mother,\" hinting that the rumor may be true. It was revealed in ''Long Shadows'' that Squirrelflight is not his mother, and in ''Sunrise'' that Leafpool and Crowfeather are his true parents. Lionblaze's also half-brother to Breezepelt (Crowfeather's other son), grandson to Firestar and Sandstorm (Leafpool's parents) and Ashfoot, the ex-WindClan deputy (and Crowfeather's mother), nephew to Eaglekit (Crowfeather's brother) and Squirrelflight (Leafpool's sister), grandnephew to Princess (Firestar's sister),great-grandson to Jake and Nutmeg (Firestar's parents), half-grandnephew to Scourge, Ruby, and Socks (Firestar's half-siblings) and Ashfur and Ferncloud (Sandstorm's half-siblings) and kin to Cloudtail (Firestar's nephew), Whitewing (Cloudtail's daughter), Dovewing and Ivypool (Whitewing's daughters). He is also kin to Tigerstar, Nightkit and Mistkit (Sandstorm's cousin). He is father to Hollytuft, Sorrelstripe, and Fernsong (Cinderheart's kits). As his father, Crowfeather, is a direct descendant to Wind and Gorsestar (WindClan's first and second leaders), Lionblaze is their descendant too. He's half WindClan, a quarter ThunderClan, a quarter kittypet and a part SkyClan, because Sandstorm's aunt is Spottedleaf. He is the reincarnation of Lion's Roar, an ancient Tribe cat.\n\n====Mousewhisker====\n'''Mousewhisker''' is a grey-and-white tom, the son of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Smoky|Smoky]], the brother of [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]] and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]], and the half-brother of [[#Rosepetal|Rosepetal]] and [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]]. He was first introduced as a kit named '''Mouse''' in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', when his mother Daisy took him and his littermates away from the horseplace where they were born so the Twolegs there would not take them away. After a ThunderClan patrol found them, they joined ThunderClan and Mouse was given the Clan name of '''Mousekit'''.<ref name=twilight/> In ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]] visits the nursery and shows him and Hazelkit a butterfly, which she says they can hunt, leading [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] to discover the truth about the RiverClan medicine cat, [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]].<ref name=sunset/> He is later an apprentice, '''Mousepaw''', in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', mentored by [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]],<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> and becomes a warrior, Mousewhisker, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> In the battle in ''Eclipse'' he wounds his eye so [[#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]] guides him out of battle.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> He was the mentor of [[#Bumblestripe|Bumblestripe]]. He also trains in the Dark Forest.\n\n====Millie====\n'''Millie''' is a silver tabby she-cat, a former kittypet. She is first formally introduced in [[The Sight (Warriors)|''The Sight'']] (first book in the ''Power of Three'' series), when she and her mate [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] show up on the island that the Clan cats use for Gatherings. Though all the cats in every Clan were glad to see Greystripe alive, they were worried about his kittypet mate.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She later has three kits: [[#Bumblestripe|Bumblestripe]], [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]] and [[#Blossomfall|Blossomfall]]. In ''Long Shadows'', Millie is infected with greencough. [[#Silverstream|Silverstream]] watches over her, because \"Greystripe doesn't deserve to have his heart broken again\" due to Greystripe going into a cycle of grief after [[#Silverstream|Silverstream]] died having his kits.<ref name=longshadows/> In ''Sunrise'', [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]] died saving Briarkit from being bitten by a venomous snake.<ref name=sunrise/> In ''The Fourth Apprentice'', her kits are seen as apprentices.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> In ''Fading Echoes'' her kits receive their warrior names, Briarlight, Blossomfall, and Bumblestripe.<ref name=fadingechoes/> In Apprentice's Quest, she is an elder.\n\n====Poppyfrost====\n'''Poppyfrost''' is a tortoiseshell and white she-cat and the daughter of [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]].

She is first introduced as a kit, Whitekit, in the epilogue of ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' though she is almost an apprentice already,<ref name=firestar/> and as an apprentice, Whitepaw, throughout the ''New Prophecy'' series. She is one of two daughters of [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]] and [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]]. In between ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' and ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', she becomes a warrior, Whitewing. She was appointed much later than she could have been because she herself had wanted to remain behind so Birchpaw would not be the only apprentice. This is later confirmed when Birchfall complains about her getting an apprentice, with Sandstorm reminding him that Whitewing requested to stay an apprentice.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She was mentored by her uncle [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and received her first apprentice, [[#Icecloud|Icepaw]], in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> It is confirmed by the end of ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'' that she is carrying [[#Birchfall|Birchfall's]] kits, so therefore her status is now a queen.<ref name=longshadows/> In ''Sunrise'' she gave birth to two kits, [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] and [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]], of which Dovewing will become the last cat in the prophecy of the Power of Three, but as revealed in ''[[The Last Hope (Warriors)|The Last Hope]]'', Dovewing is, in fact, the third cat, with Firestar being the last and the fourth.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Whitewing's also granddaughter to Princess (Cloudtail's mother) and Frostfur (Brightheart's mother), great-niece to Firestar (Princess' brother), Brindleface, Longtail, Dustpelt and Ravenpaw (Frostfur's siblings), great-granddaughter to Fuzzypelt and Robinwing (Frostfur's parents), half-great-niece to Scourge, Ruby and Socks (Princess' half-siblings), niece to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw and Brackenfur (Brightheart's siblings), cousin to Honeyfern, Molepaw, Poppyfrost and Cinderheart (Brackenfur's kits) and kin to Leafpool, Squirrelflight (Firestar's daughters), Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf (Leafpool's kits), Sandstorm, Ferncloud and Ashfur (Brindleface's kits), Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Hollykit, Larchkit, Birchfall, Icecloud and Foxleap (Ferncloud's kits) and Toadstep and Rosepetal (Spiderleg's kits).\n\n====Rosepetal====\n'''Rosepetal''' is a dark cream she-cat first introduced in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> It is  revealed she has a crush on a ThunderClan tom, Foxleap. She is the daughter of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]], the littermate of Toadstep, and the half-sister of [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]], [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]], and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]]. She and Toadstep are made warriors in [[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]. Her warrior name is Rosepetal, her mentor was Squirrelflight. Rosepetal's also niece to Shrewpaw, Larchkit, Hollykit, Birchfall, Icecloud and Foxleap (Spiderleg's siblings), cousin to Ivypool and Dovewing (Birchfall's daughters), granddaughter to Ferncloud and Dustpelt (Spiderleg's parents), grandniece to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), great-granddaughter to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-great-granddaughter to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Brindleface's parents), great-grandniece to Frostfur (Brindleface's sister) and kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brightheart, Brackenfur (Frostfur's kits), Honeyfern, Molepaw, Poppyfrost, Cinderheart, Lilyheart, and Seedpaw (Brackenfur's kits), Cherrypaw and Molepaw (Poppyfrost's kits), Dewnose, Ambermoon, Whitewing, and Snowbush (Brightheart's kits). Also related to Firestar, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf.\n\n====Toadstep====\n'''Toadstep''' is a black-and-white tom, first introduced in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', along with his sister Rosepetal.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> He is the son of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]], and the half-brother of [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]], [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]], and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]]. In The Fourth Apprentice, Toadstep was given his warrior name.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> He was mentored by Cloudtail.\nToadstep's also nephew to Shrewpaw, Larchkit, Hollykit, Birchfall, Icecloud and Foxleap (Spiderleg's siblings), cousin to Ivypool and Dovewing (Birchfall's daughters), grandson to Ferncloud and Dustpelt (Spiderleg's parents), grandnephew to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), great-grandson to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-great-grandson to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Brindleface's parents), great-grandnephew to Frostfur (Brindleface's sister) and kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brightheart, Brackenfur (Frostfur's kits), Honeyfern, Molepaw, Poppyfrost, Cinderheart, Lilykit, Seedkit (Brackenfur's kits), Cherrypaw and Molepaw (Poppyfrost's kits) and Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter).\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', he is said to be killed by greencough.\n\n===''Omen of the Stars Series''===\n''Omen of the Stars'' is the fourth series in ''Warriors''.  The titles of all six books have been revealed: ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'' and ''[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]''. The third book's title is ''Night Whispers''. A fourth book has also come out, called  ''Sign of the Moon'', which came out in April 2011. The fifth book is called ''The Forgotten Warrior''. The final book in the series is titled ''The Last Hope''. The fourth series is centered on two sisters, [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] and [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]], and which one of them is the third cat in the prophecy, as well as around [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], the other two cats in the prophecy. In  ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy (Warriors)|Bluestar's Prophecy]]'', it is revealed that both of the kits' grandmothers are Frostfur and Brindleface, who in the book are said to be sisters (Frostfur&nbsp;\u2013 Brightheart&nbsp;\u2013 Whitewing; Brindleface&nbsp;\u2013 Ferncloud&nbsp;\u2013 Birchfall). This either means that the book is incorrect or Dovepaw and Ivypaw's mother and father are related. This is not significant, as most of the Clan cats are related anyway.\n\n====Dovewing====\n{{anchor|Dovepaw}}\n'''Dovewing''', a fluffy pale grey she-cat whose eye color has been described as green, blue, and golden. No one actually knows what her true eye color is, although she has been described with green the most. She is the daughter of [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]] and [[#Birchfall|Birchfall]], and sister of [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]]. She was born at the end of ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]'' and it is mentioned that either she or her sister is the third cat of the prophecy, as [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] wasn't really part of the prophecy.<ref name=sunrise/> Her mentor is Lionblaze.\nIn ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'', it is revealed that her power is the ability to hear and see things that are very far away. Dovepaw is later found to be the third cat of the prophecy. Even though Dovepaw is excited about being the third cat in the prophecy, she hates to hide the secret from her clanmates.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> In ''Night Whispers'', Dovepaw ends up telling Ivypaw why she has such good senses; Ivypaw forgives her.  When she asks Jayfeather why she has to keep the secret from every cat, he asks her if she even wants to be special. She says yes, even if she doesn't. During her warrior assessment, when she decides to turn off her powers because other cats can hunt without special powers, she admits in her thoughts that Ivypool deserves to be a warrior more than she does.\n\nIt is also rumored that Dovepaw may have a crush on Tigerheart of ShadowClan. This is confirmed in ''[[Night Whispers (Warriors)|Night Whispers]]'', when the two of them admitted their feelings for each other. They began meeting on the ShadowClan-ThunderClan border by night,  and at one point Dovepaw mentioned to Tigerheart that ThunderClan had some catmint, a herb which could cure ShadowClan's sick medicine cat Littlecloud, but which was supposed to be a secret. Tigerheart told ShadowClan this information, and Ivypaw was captured and traded for the catmint.<ref name=nightwhispers/> In the books afterwards, Tigerheart seems to want to stay away from Dovewing to avoid speaking to her, though he does not believe that Jayfeather killed Flametail, unlike Dawnpelt. In the Sign of the Moon, Dovepaw earns her warrior name Dovewing. In ''The Forgotten Warrior'', she falls in love with Bumblestripe.\n\nDovewing is also granddaughter to Cloudtail and Brightheart (Whitewing's parents) and Dustpelt and Ferncloud (Birchfall's parents), great-granddaughter to Princess (Cloudtail's mother), Frostfur (Brightheart's mother), Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother) and kin to Leafpool, Squirrelflight (Firestar's daughters), Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Sorreltail, Honeyfern, Molepaw, Cinderheart and Poppyfrost. During her warrior assessment, Icecloud falls through the tunnels that supposedly buried Hollyleaf. Dovewing then rescues her, leading Jayfeather and Lionblaze\nto the fact that Hollyleaf might not be dead. Dovewing is the reincarnation of Dove's Wing, an ancient cat.\n\n====Ivypool====\n{{anchor|Ivypaw}}\n'''Ivypool''', a silver tabby-and-white she-cat with dark blue eyes, is the daughter of [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]] and [[#Birchfall|Birchfall]], and sister of [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]]. She was born at the end of ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]'' and it is mentioned that either she or her sister is the third cat of the prophecy, as [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] wasn't really part of the prophecy.<ref name=sunrise/> When revealed by Vicky Holmes that [[#Dovepaw|Dovepaw]] will be the Fourth Apprentice, she also stated that Ivypaw will not be happy about her sister's new found powers. Ivypaw's mentor is Cinderheart. In ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'', Ivypaw becomes jealous of Dovepaw because she gets to go on the journey upriver to find the source of the problem of the drying up lake (which is later revealed to be beavers). At the end of the book when Lionblaze and Dovepaw return, she seems to get over her jealousy.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> But in ''[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]'', Ivypaw becomes jealous of her sister again (this is after Firestar discovers that Jayfeather, Lionblaze and Dovepaw are the Three). Later on she begins to be trained in her dreams by Hawkfrost, thinking he's a StarClan warrior. Ivypaw then begins to feel special because \"Dovepaw has never been visited by a StarClan warrior, she would have told me\". At first Ivypaw seems happy to inform her sister that she was visited by a StarClan cat in her dreams, but decides against it later out of jealousy. She also does this because she \"wants to have a secret too\".<ref name=fadingechoes/> In Night Whispers, she is kidnapped by ShadowClan and traded for catmint because Littlecloud is ill with greencough. \nShe continues to visit the Dark Forest in ''[[Night Whispers (Warriors)|Night Whispers]]'', but realizes their evil intentions towards the end of the book and decides to keep going to the Dark Forest to spy on them for Dovepaw, Jayfeather, and Lionblaze. While there, Brokenstar tells her to kill the already dead Flametail, to keep him from helping ShadowClan. She agrees in order to gain Brokenstar's trust, but is stopped by Tigerheart.<ref name=nightwhispers/> In the Sign of the Moon, she earns her warrior name Ivypool.\n\nIvypaw's also niece to Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Icecloud, Foxleap, Hollykit, and Larchkit (Birchfall's siblings), cousin to Rosepetal and Toadstep (Spiderleg's kits), granddaughter to Cloudtail and Brightheart (Whitewing's parents) and Dustpelt and Ferncloud (Birchfall's parents), greatniece to Thornclaw, Cinderpelt, and Brackenfur (Brightheart's siblings), Frostfur, Brindleface, and Ravenpaw (Dustpelt's siblings) and Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), half-greatniece to Sandstorm (Ferncloud's half-sister) and Longtail (Dustpelt's half-brother), great-granddaughter to Princess (Cloudtail's mother), Frostfur (Brightheart's mother) and Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-greatniece to Firestar (Princess's brother), and kin to Leafpool, Squirrelflight, Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Honeyfern, Molepaw, Cinderheart and Poppyfrost.\n\n====Mapleshade====\n'''Mapleshade''' is a large, primarily ginger, tortoiseshell-and-white she-cat with amber eyes and a long, thick, fluffy, white tail. She is a warrior of the Dark Forest who was originally a ThunderClan warrior. However, she ended up falling in love with RiverClan tom called Appledusk and they had kits together. When ThunderClan discovered this, Mapleshade and her kits were exiled as traitors. While fleeing from ThunderClan to RiverClan along with her three kits to be with her mate, Mapleshade's kits were swept away and drowned in the raging river. Appledusk blamed Mapleshade for the kits' deaths, and she found herself unwelcome in RiverClan as well. \n\nHeartbroken and enraged, Mapleshade swore eternal vengeance on the Clans. She murdered Ravinwing, the ThunderClan medicine cat who had revealed her secret and then Frecklewish, the ThunderClan leader's daughter who had watched her kits drown and made no move to help. Finally, when Appledusk took another she-cat as his mate, after having promised to love Mapleshade forever, she murdered Appledusk. However, by then, Appledusk's new mate was already expecting kits. Mapleshade knew Appledusk would live on in these kits and so swore revenge on her former mate's descendants. Because of the murders she committed, Mapleshade's spirit was denied entry into StarClan and instead sent to the Dark Forest.\n\nMapleshade visits Crookedkit (later Crookedstar) of RiverClan in dreams and visions starting before his apprenticeship, training him in exchange for his promise that he would place loyalty to his Clan above all other concerns. At first Crookedkit believes Mapleshade is one of StarClan. Her anger at his attachment to individual Clanmates confuses him. He obeys her when a dog attacks the RiverClan camp, chasing the dog and protecting the Clan instead of tending to the fatal injury delivered to his mother, Rainflower. Crookedstar suspects Mapleshade is responsible for sending the crooked-jawed squirrel sign that convinces Hailstar to make Crookedjaw his deputy after Shellheart retires to the elders' den. When Hailstar is injured on his last life, she headbutts Crookedjaw away while he attempts to save Hailstar's life.\n\nEventually, Mapleshade acknowledges to Crookedstar that she is not of StarClan but from the Dark Forest, and explains her evil actions and deception before explaing her tragic past. Lastly Mapleshade reveals that Shellheart, Crookedstar's father, was the grandson of her former mate, and that she feels her own descendants should have attained the greatness that is Crookedstar's destiny. Crookedstar blames Mapleshade for the illness and death of his mate Willowbreeze and two of their newborn kits, Willowkit and Minnowkit, in addition to the earlier deaths of Rainflower and Hailstar. She is responsible for killing Spottedleaf a second time.\n\n====Cherryfall====\n{{anchor|Cherrypaw}}\n'''Cherryfall''' is the daughter of [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]] and [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], sister of [[#Molewhisker|Molewhisker]].

As such, WindClan cats are known for their speed and endurance, a skill that is imperative for hunting their main source of prey, rabbits.<ref name=\"secrets\">{{cite book|title=Warriors Field Guide: Secrets of the Clans|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-123903-8|title-link=Secrets of the Clans|date=2007-05-29}}</ref>{{rp|176}} WindClan have been driven off their territory by [[#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]] by the time Firepaw enters the forest, but are soon brought back with the aid of Fireheart and Graystripe.<ref name=\"fire and ice\" /> WindClan are forced to deal with attacks from both ShadowClan and [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] throughout the series, since they are seen as being the weakest Clan. As a result, WindClan often allies itself with [[#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]], a recurring relationship that has further repercussions in later series.\n\nWindClan, along with the other Clans, undergoes a dramatic shift in territory during the course of ''The New Prophecy'' series. During the time that Crowpaw and the others are on their journey, much of WindClan territory is destroyed as the Two Legs proceed with their deforestation of the area.<ref name=moonrise>{{cite book|title=Moonrise|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-074452-6|title-link=Moonrise (Warriors)|date=2005-08-02}}</ref> Eventually, WindClan and the other Clans are able to relocate to the lake territory, the WindClan camp of which is an area much resembling their old territory: wide-open hills and moors. Their territory is between ThunderClan's and RiverClan. A Twoleg horse place (horse ranch) is located nearby, and occasionally dogs living there are set loose and chase the WindClan cats. The open hills give the greatest view of the surrounding area, and a WindClan cat is typically positioned on top of one of them as a lookout, able to detect threats much more quickly than in the forests. WindClan undergo a rather stressful period in leadership when Tallstar, their wise leader, dies of old age and changes his successor from Mudclaw to Onewhisker at the last minute.<ref name=starlight>{{cite book|title=Starlight|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082762-5|title-link=Starlight (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the ''Power of Three'' series, WindClan have resolved to become more hostile towards ThunderClan as a result of their being viewed as ThunderClan's \"puppets\" in the past. Onestar, once a warm and thoughtful friend of Firestar, has completely withdrawn his previous relationship with the ThunderClan leader. WindClan cats often hunt prey near and over ThunderClan's borders, the reasoning being that ThunderClan is stretched too thin to defend itself. This attitude climaxes in ''Eclipse'', when the entirety of WindClan sneak into ThunderClan's camp to start the largest battle ever conceived in the history of the series.<ref name=eclipse>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Eclipse|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-089208-1|title-link=Eclipse (Warriors)|date=2008-04-22}}</ref>{{rp|336}}\n\n====Heatherstar====\n'''Heatherstar''' is a pinkish-gray she-cat with blue eyes.

He was once a fierce WindClan warrior who had little patience for kits, but StarClan later chose him to become a medicine cat. He murdered [[List of ThunderClan cats#Moonflower|Moonflower]], Bluestar's mother, when Moonflower tried to destroy WindClan herbs and threatened Bluepaw when she was in the camp.<ref name=bluestar/>{{rp|544}}\n\n===''Warriors'' (Original Series)===\nThe original series covers events in the story from ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' to ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. Many characters mentioned here were introduced in the original series, but play minor or significant roles in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series as well.\n\n====Onestar====\n'''Onestar''', a small, mottled-brown tabby tom with amber eyes, is the leader of WindClan for the last two books of the second series, the entirety of the third and fourth series, and the first three books of the fifth series.\nWhen [[#Firestar|Fireheart]] and [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] brought WindClan home in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'', '''Onewhisker''' became close friends with Fireheart and still retained this friendship even when WindClan were angry with ThunderClan for sheltering Brokentail.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/>  In ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', in the battle with BloodClan, Onewhisker was nearly killed by the BloodClan leader, Scourge, if not for Firestar saving him.<ref name=\"darkest hour\">{{cite book|title=The Darkest Hour|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052585-9|title-link=The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|date=2005-10-04}}</ref>\nLater, in ''Starlight'', Tallstar appoints Onewhisker deputy on the brink of death, which meant that Onestar was now the leader of WindClan, though Tallstar didn't use the right words for appointing a deputy.<ref name=starlight /> At first Onestar is very timid about his new position, but after he receives his nine lives and name from StarClan, he becomes more confident and concludes that there can be no more friendship between WindClan and ThunderClan, and WindClan must prove itself capable of taking care of itself without help from others. He then assumes a more leader-like attitude and abandons his friendship with Firestar. Rock states in ''[[Cats of the Clans (Warriors)|Cats of the Clans]]'' that Onestar knows more than any other cat thui \nin the Clans about the loneliness that power brings and that he truly misses Firestar.<ref name=catsotc>{{cite book|title=Cats of the Clans|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|year=2008|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-145856-9|title-link=Cats of the Clans (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the story arc ''Power of the Three'', Onestar becomes increasingly hostile towards Firestar and ThunderClan, occasionally ordering his warriors hunt both near and over their borders. He claims ThunderClan thinks it's better than the other Clans and ignores the warrior code by taking in non-Clan born cats. In the book ''Eclipse'', he decides to teach Firestar a lesson and launches an attack with the whole of WindClan on ThunderClan through the tunnels. This leads to all four Clans fighting, with ShadowClan siding with ThunderClan and RiverClan siding with WindClan. The battle is only stopped by an eclipse.\n\nThroughout the next story arc ''Omen of the Stars'', Onestar remains largely hostile towards ThunderClan, even accusing them of plotting an invasion against WindClan in ''The Forgotten Warrior'', even though, as it turns out, he has no evidence for his false accusation. However, in the final book, ''The Last Hope'', he unites with the other Clans to defeat the Dark Forest cats. In the super edition ''Bramblestar's Storm'', however, Onestar resumes his hostile attitude towards ThunderClan, now led by Bramblestar. During the flood, he orders his warriors to shift the border between WindClan and ThunderClan without talking to them so that WindClan can have the water in the stream all to themselves, as it's their only source. However, Bramblestar and his warriors later revert the border back to its original setting after chasing out the trespassing WindClan warriors and dislodging the fallen tree trunk which they have been using to cross the stream. At the end of the super edition, Onestar agrees to Bramblestar's proposal of adding a new law to the warrior code only reluctantly.\n\nBy the time of fourth series, ''A Vision of Shaduows'', Onestar is now very old and has a graying muzzle. In the second book ''Thunder and Shadow'', Onestar loses a life to the rogue cat Darktail. This incident causes him to go rather mad, punishing his Clanmates for breaking the warrior code the slightest. He holds ShadowClan responsible for the rogues because they didn't drive them out sooner and refuses to give them a special herb which can cure the sickness that's spreading through their Clan. After several failed attempts to reason with Onestar, ShadowClan holds Twigpaw, a ThunderClan apprentice, hostage in return for ThunderClan giving them the herb. However, Onestar realizes what Jayfeather and Alderpaw are trying to do, and refuses to give ThunderClan the herb. Kestrelflight and Harespring are forced to go behind his back to bring the herb to ShadowClan, outraging Onestar. However, many cats, including some from his own Clan, look at him accusingly when Rowanstar blames Onestar. Nevertheless, Onestar refuses to accept his mistake, calling ShadowClan a bunch of rogues.\n\nIn the next book, ''Shattered Sky'', it is revealed that Darktail is actually Onestar's biological son. Onestar reveals that when he was still known as Onewhisker, he fell in love with a kittypet called Smoke. He refused to let her join WindClan when she revealed she was expecting his kits, partly because it wasn't the life for her and partly because he was afraid of what would happen to him if his Clan found out he'd mated with a kittypet. The only one of their litter to survive was Darktail, whom Onewhisker turned away for the same reason as his mother. This rejection caused Smoke to raise Darktail to hate his father, the Clans and their way of life.\n\nBecause he has made many mistakes which led to terrible consequences, Onestar is afraid that he will be sent to the Dark Forest when he dies. Kestrelflight points out that the Dark Forest is for cats who are pure evil and assures Onestar that he was never evil. Onestar admits that his fears where selfish and apologizes for his actions (according to the authors, this includes his hostility toward Firestar, which he secretly always felt bad about). Onestar rights his wrongs when he confronts Darktail, and engages him in a fight that results in both cats drowning each other.\n\n====Tallstar====\n'''Tallstar''', a black and white tom with amber eyes and a very long tail, was the leader of WindClan before [[#Onestar|Onestar]]. Tallstar and his Clan were chased off from their territory by ShadowClan under [[#Brokentail|Brokenstar]]'s rule until [[#Firestar|Fireheart]] and [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] brought them back. WindClan began a friendship with ThunderClan afterward as a result of this, although it faltered when Tallstar became furious with ThunderClan for sheltering Brokentail, the cat who drove them out of their territory. When Bluestar suspects WindClan of allegedly stealing prey, Fireheart seeks Tallstar to talk with Bluestar in peace. In ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', when Tigerstar announces joining all four Clans and territories into a single alliance, Tallstar and Firestar both reject his offer. After BloodClan attacks, Tallstar and Firestar agree to fight them with the other Clans in a temporary alliance, called LionClan.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nTallstar loses his last life in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'' with Onewhisker and Firestar at his side, making him the only cat to have served as a Clan leader throughout the entire original series. He switched the deputy from Mudclaw to Onewhisker on his deathbed, fearing that Mudclaw was not the right cat to lead WindClan after his death because, in the end, he wanted to keep the friendship with ThunderClan. He feared that Mudclaw would do harm to ThunderClan because he had shown signs of bloodthirstiness.<ref name=starlight />  He mentors Morningflower and Deadfoot. His warrior name was '''Talltail'''. He is born Tallkit, but another kit, a tom named Shrewkit, calls him Wormkit because of his expected destiny of digging tunnels. Both his mother and father (Palebird and Sandgorse) want him to be a tunneler, but Tallkit wishes to be a moor-runner, free to run and catch prey out on the open moors. Heatherstar, the leader of WindClan in Tallkit's days, recognizes his eagerness to run and apprentices him to be a moor-runner. Sandgorse is especially displeased, and he despises Tallkit as he reveals his true wishes.  When Sandgorse dies in a tunnel collapse apparently due to the actions of a loner named Sparrow, Palebird mates with another tunneler named Woolytail and gives birth to his half-siblings. Tallpaw takes offense that his own mother is not grieving for Sandgorse and instead mated with another cat and says that her kits are another excuse to stay in the nursery as Palebird had been in the nursery ever since he was born and when his littermate, Finchkit died right after being born. Tallpaw swears vengeance upon Sparrow. After completing his training, he leaves the clan to pursue Sparrow, and, after days of traveling, he finds where Sparrow and his traveling friends are making camp. Talltail plans to attack Sparrow at night, but after Talltail has a talk with Sparrow, the night he was supposed to kill Sparrow, the loner reveals that Sandgorse actually sacrificed himself so he could escape. Talltail has mixed emotions that night, and the next day, he decides to go back to WindClan in peace. When Talltail comes back, Heatherstar reveals that she knew this was going to happen and when she got her 9 lives, StarClan warned her that a cat would have to travel far to realize where his true destiny lied and that warrior leader cat was him not a kittypet.\n\n====Deadfoot====\n'''Deadfoot''', a black cat with a crooked front paw, was the former deputy of WindClan under [[#Tallstar|Tallstar]], and was deputy when ShadowClan chased them out of their territory. Like [[#Onestar|Onewhisker]], Deadfoot became friends with [[#Firestar|Fireheart]] when he and [[#Graystripe|Graystripe]] brought WindClan home. Deadfoot wasn't seen alive after ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. He appears in StarClan as the cat who chooses Crowpaw (his son) (later Crowfeather) to go on the journey to the sun-drown place. Victoria Holmes confirmed that he died in the battle with BloodClan. He was the mate of Ashfoot and was the father of Crowfeather and Eaglekit. He was originally a kit of Meadowslip named Hopkit, but he twisted his paw and when he was apprenticed, Heatherstar named him Deadpaw. Meadowslip is horrified, and states that Heatherstar can't change Hopkit's name because of the way he looks, but \nDeadpaw says it's fine.\n\n===''The New Prophecy Series''===\n''The New Prophecy'' series covers events in the story from ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' to ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''.

He revealed his affections in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'', when he saves Leafpaw from falling to her death.<ref name=starlight /> It has been revealed that his relationship with Feathertail was more like \"highschool romance\", and his relationship with Leafpaw was the real thing. She returned his feelings and the two decided to meet on the border between their Clans, where a stream runs through. Eventually Leafpool's mentor, Cinderpelt, finds out, and the two leave their Clans in order to be together. However, they weren't away for long before they returned and broke off their connections, as [[#Midnight|Midnight]] had told them about a plot her kin had made to destroy the Clans. Crowfeather moves on to mate with a she-cat named [[#Nightcloud|Nightcloud]] and has a son, [[#Breezepelt|Breezepelt]]. He is the father of [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], and [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], with Leafpool being the mother. Crowfeather shows little affection to Nightcloud and even less paternal love for his son, due to the fear he'd lose him.

In Secrets of the Clans, it is revealed that Crowfeather is kin of WindClan first two leaders, Wind and Gorsestar.<ref name=secrets />\n\n====Mudclaw====\n'''Mudclaw''', a mottled dark brown tom, is a WindClan warrior introduced in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'' of the original series,<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/>  and is the WindClan deputy from ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''<ref name=firestar>{{cite book|title=Firestar's Quest|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-113164-6|title-link=Firestar's Quest}}</ref> to ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]''.<ref name=starlight />  Typically, he is hostile and easy to anger. He routinely attacks cats he finds on WindClan territory without asking for explanations first. Mudclaw is the leader of the patrol that prevents [[List of ThunderClan cats#Bluestar|Bluestar]] from reaching Highstones in ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'',<ref name=\"rising storm\">{{cite book|title=Rising Storm|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052563-7|title-link=Rising Storm (Warriors)|date=2005-02-15}}</ref> causing her to renounce faith in and declare war on StarClan. Fiercely loyal to WindClan and highly aggressive to all other cats, Mudclaw was appointed deputy of WindClan after the death of Deadfoot. As ''The New Prophecy'' series continues, [[#Tallstar|Tallstar]] continues to grow more ill and Mudclaw takes over many of his duties, often acting as a secondary leader. It also implied that he even occasionally steals prey from the other Clans without his leader's knowledge.\n\nWhen Tallstar is about to die, he abruptly replaces Mudclaw with [[#Onestar|Onewhisker]] as deputy, thus effectively revoking Mudclaw right to become leader. His reasons for doing so involve Mudclaw hostile demeanour, which he fears would lead WindClan into a state of chaos. Mudclaw is outraged by this and conspires with [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]] of [[List of Warriors characters#RiverClan|RiverClan]] in order to overthrow Onewhisker and take back the position he believes is rightfully his. Before his plan can succeed, however, [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] and a number of [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]] cats interfere, resulting in Mudclaw being crushed by a falling tree. The tree now serves as a bridge to an island where the Clans now have Gatherings. Mudclaw does not reside in the Dark Forest/Place of No Stars with Tigerstar, Darkstripe, and Hawkfrost as a result of his revolt, as he truly felt he was doing the right thing.\n\n===''Power of Three Series''===\nThe ''Power of Three'' series covers events in the story from ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' to ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]''.\n\n====Heathertail====\nA pretty, well-mannered light brown tabby WindClan she-cat with stunning heather-colored eyes, '''Heathertail''' develops a close friendship with [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] during ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' and ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]''.<ref name=darkriver>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Dark River|isbn=9780060892050|publisher=HarperCollins|url=https://archive.org/details/warriorspoweroft00erin_3|date=2007-12-26}}</ref><ref name=thesight />   Heathertail discovers a series of secret tunnels connecting WindClan and [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]]'s territories and shares this knowledge with Lionblaze. The two then begin to meet each other during the night in the tunnels, pretending to be members of the fictional DarkClan, of which Heathertail is the leader. These meetings eventually take a toll on both cats' daily lives, and Heathertail is hurt when Lionblaze decides that they must put their respective Clans first and that their relationship can no longer continue. Heathertail's relationship with Lionblaze is further strained in ''Eclipse'' when Lionblaze, in a bloodlust caused from the Clan-wide battle started by WindClan, where he accuses her of betraying the secret of the tunnels to her Clanmates.<ref name=eclipse />  Heathertail denies this, but Lionblaze does not believe her and vows to forever be her enemy, thus shattering their friendship. Lionblaze might have realized what he has done, but when he attempted to speak with Heathertail and possibly say he was sorry, she acted as if she didn't want to be near him. In a Wands and World chat it is revealed that she feels no affection toward Breezepelt, and still loves Lionblaze.\n\nIn ''Long Shadows'' of the ''Power of Three'' series, Lionblaze takes catmint from WindClan territory to treat a large breakout of greencough. Heathertail confronts him, reminding him to not become a bully like his kin Tigerstar.\n\n====Breezepelt====\nA black tom with amber eyes, '''Breezepelt''', the son of [[#Crowfeather|Crowfeather]] and [[#Nightcloud|Nightcloud]], is a headstrong WindClan warrior first introduced as an apprentice, Breezepaw, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=thesight />  He often makes tactless remarks and is not afraid to voice his negative opinions. He has been shown to panic during times of crisis, and is quick to argue. Despite his grumpy demeanor, Breezepelt has been known to cooperate on a few occasions, losing his hostile attitude almost completely in favor of the task at hand. In ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', he joins his father and the other Clan cats on the journey to the Tribe of Rushing Water to aid them in defeating a group of intruders.<ref name=\"powerbook3\"/>  It has been revealed that much of Breezepelt errant behavior stems from a lack of support from his father, Crowfeather, who shows little regard for his well-being. Crowfeather's reasons for rejecting his son are most likely due to his past (and still ongoing) love interest in Leafpool. He is also half-brother to Hollyleaf, Jayfeather and Lionblaze, because they all have the same father: Crowfeather. Mentored by Whitetail.  When it is revealed, he takes the fact his father has three kits in another Clan very badly. In ''The Fourth Apprentice'', he follows Poppyfrost to the Moonpool.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\">{{cite book|title=The Fourth Apprentice|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-155509-1|title-link=The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)}}</ref> He threatens to kill her when Jayfeather shows up, stating that he hates his half-siblings and would never forgive them for what their mother did. Ignoring Jayfeather's pleas, he attacks the two ThunderClan cats. Poppyfrost, who is pregnant, is unable to fight him off, so Jayfeather is forced to fight his half-brother himself, along with Honeyfern, who helps Jayfeather, and Brokenstar, who helps Breezepelt. It is revealed that he is being trained by Dark Forest, and is part of the battle between StarClan and the Dark Forest. During the Great Battle, his father, Crowfeather stops him from killing Lionblaze. In Crowfeather's Trail, Breezepelt reconciles with his [[wikt:estranged|estranged]] Father and Lionblaze.\n\n====Nightcloud====\nA black she-cat, '''Nightcloud''' is introduced in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' as the mate of [[#Crowfeather|Crowfeather]] and the mother of their son, [[#Breezepelt|Breezepelt]].<ref name=thesight />  Her relationship with Crowfeather is depicted as somewhat distant, as Crowfeather does not seem to have any genuine affection for her. Nightcloud is clearly aware of Crowfeather's past relationship with [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and resents Leafpool for Crowfeather's ongoing affection for her, even though Leafpool is a medicine cat from another Clan and she can never love him.  This implies that Crowfeather took Nightcloud as a mate only out of necessity in an attempt to either \"move on\", or, as Rock states in ''[[Cats of the Clans (Warriors)|Cats of the Clans]]'', to prove his loyalty to WindClan.<ref name=catsotc />  Nightcloud cherishes her son, Breezepelt, and is shown to be angered by Crowfeather's lack of affection for him. Later on in Sunrise, she gets furious when Hollyleaf says Crowfeather is also mates with Leafpool. Crowfeather's inability to love Nightcloud causes them to [[Breakup|break up]]. However they reconcile in Crowfeather's Trail even though they never become mates again.\n\n===Minor WindClan characters===\nThe following are WindClan characters introduced or appearing in the ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' novel series, having small, less significant, and/or single instances in the story.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|+Minor Characters in '''WindClan'''\n!style=\"background:#D4AF37; color:white\"|Name || style=\"background:#D4AF37; color:white\"|Pelt Color || style=\"background:#D4AF37; color:white\"|Description\n|-\n|style=\"background:#D4AF37; color:white\"| '''Acorntail''' ||?|| Mentioned in ''Code of the Clans''.

Goes to Greywing in a dream as '''Wolfheart''' (her warrior name if she is saved) telling her that kits are precious to all Clans and that she should have let Brindleclaw save them. The situation leads to the creation of the twelfth code.\n|}\n\n==ShadowClan==\n'''ShadowClan''' territory is mainly in a giant collection of [[swamp]]s and [[bog]]s and thick wet grass covered in thick pine trees, giving the area a dark and gloomy feel.<ref name=secrets /> ShadowClan cats are skilled at hunting and navigating in near-complete darkness, because the night is when their main sources of prey are active.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> Along with lizards, frogs, and small forest animals, such as voles, ShadowClan also occasionally catch rats who reside in the nearby '''Carrionplace''' (garbage dump); however, they must be careful when eating these rats as they occasionally carry harmful diseases. ShadowClan are often depicted as the primary antagonists of the series, and as such many of their individual members are rude and hostile. However, many ShadowClan cats are completely devoted to their leader; since a number of ShadowClan's leaders have been truly villainous, the actions of their followers have expectedly followed suit. Some cats say that ShadowClan cats are so mean because the cold wind in their territory supposedly chills their hearts.\n\nShadowClan, along with the other Clans, undergoes a dramatic shift in territory during the course of ''The New Prophecy'' series. During the time that Tawnypelt and the others are on their journey, much of ShadowClan's territory is destroyed as the Twolegs proceed with their deforestation of the area.<ref name=moonrise /> Eventually ShadowClan and the other Clans are able to relocate to the lake territory, the ShadowClan camp of which is located in a dense pine forest. Though not quite the same as the marshes they used to inhabit, the thickness of the forest often shrouds the territory in gloom and darkness, perfectly suited for ShadowClan's stealth prowess. The area is not very suitable for prey, however, resulting in ShadowClan inhabiting the least desirable territory once again. Despite their bad luck, they manage to feed themselves decently enough (a testament to the tenacity of ShadowClan warriors). The forest's primary hazard is a Twoleg house on the northern fringes of ShadowClan's territory, home to two violent kittypets who often attack Clan cats who stray too close and call their Twolegs to fend off patrols. ThunderClan assists in telling these two cats to leave the Clan cats alone in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''.<ref name=twilight/>{{rp|352}}\n\n===''Warriors'' (original series)===\nThe original series covers events in the story from ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' to ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. Many characters mentioned here were introduced in the original series, but may play minor or significant roles in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series as well.\n\n====Boulder====\n'''Boulder''', a skinny silver tabby tom with a ragged ear and bright watchful eyes, is a former member of [[BloodClan]] and a member of ShadowClan. In the book ''Cats of the Clans'', he was actually invited to join ShadowClan, inspired by the hunting patrols and battles, he decided to leave BloodClan and join ShadowClan.<ref name=clans />  He was one of the few cats who were chased out of ThunderClan territory by [[#Firestar|Firepaw]] and [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]]. When [[#Tigerclaw|Tigerclaw]] became leader, Boulder and [[#Blackstar|Blackfoot]] came back to ShadowClan. In ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', Boulder brought Tigerstar to BloodClan to meet its leader Scourge.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> Boulder revealed to [[#Firestar|Firestar]] that after [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]] was killed, BloodClan attacked their Clan and some ShadowClan warriors had joined them. In the end, Boulder fought alongside LionClan to defeat BloodClan. After the battle, Boulder lived in ShadowClan as an elder throughout the second series and died of greencough sometime between ''Sunset'' and ''The Sight''.<ref name=thesight/>\n\n====Blackstar====\n'''Blackstar''', a large white tom with black paws and ears and amber eyes, was ShadowClan's deputy, '''Blackfoot''', when [[#Brokenstar|Brokenstar]] was leader and was succeeded by Rowanstar. He was first introduced in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\">{{cite book|title=Into the Wild|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|year=2003|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-000002-8|title-link=Into the Wild (Warriors)}}</ref> He was one of Brokenstar's followers and killed one of ThunderClan's elders, Rosetail, in an attempt to steal their kits, but was fought off by [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]]. Blackfoot, along with Brokenstar, Clawface and Boulder, were chased out of their territory. Blackfoot lived as a rogue with Brokenstar and attacked the ThunderClan camp under his command. When [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]] became leader of ShadowClan, Blackfoot was appointed deputy again. In TigerClan, Blackfoot helped [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] kill [[#Stonefur|Stonefur]] because he was a half-Clan cat, causing [[#Firestar|Firestar]] to view him as untrustworthy, even when he agreed to fight on their side with LionClan. After the battle with BloodClan, he announced that he would prepare for his journey to Highstones to receive his nine lives and his new name, as he was now leader of ShadowClan due to Tigerstar's death. He is introduced as a leader in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar/> In ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', Blackstar seems to lose some hostility towards ThunderClan, as he reminisces with Firestar about the old forest after two ThunderClan warriors were found in ShadowClan territory.<ref name=outcast>Hunter, Erin.

Blackstar has mentored Tallpoppy. During the battle in ''The Last Hope'', Blackstar kills Redwillow for training in the Dark Forest and later loses a life due to an attack on the ShadowClan camp, but quickly recovers and thanks Firestar for his help in back-up warriors.\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', he dies as a result of a flood, making Rowanclaw leader.\n\n====Clawface====\nClawface is a cruel and evil warrior. In ''Into the Wild'' he steals Thunderclan kits and kills Spottedleaf. In ''Fire and Ice'' Clawface is severely injured by Fireheart and killed by Graystripe.\n\nClawface is implied to be in the Dark Forest.\n\n====Brokenstar====\n'''Brokenstar''' is a huge long-furred, dark brown tabby tom with bright amber eyes, torn ears, a broad, flat face, a battle-scarred muzzle, and a tail that is bent in the middle like a broken branch. He was the former leader of ShadowClan before Nightstar and is depicted somewhat as the primary antagonist of ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>  He was a cruel cat who turned kits into apprentices three moons too soon, which in turn led to their deaths. He was the son of Raggedstar and [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]], but didn't know that the latter was his mother, who bore him and two she-kits (who died) in secret. He was given to an ambitious queen named Lizardstripe to be fostered instead. Lizardstripe would not accept Brokentail in her den when he was a kit, purely because he had a crooked tail.<ref name=\"clans\">{{cite news|title=Cats of the Clans|last=Hunter|first=Erin|date=24 June 2008|publisher=[[Avon (publishers)|Avon]]|pages=91}}</ref> Brokentail grew into a great warrior and eventually became deputy, but he [[Parricide|murdered his own father]], Raggedstar, so that he could become leader and exiled Yellowfang from ShadowClan, falsely accusing her of murdering two apprentices that he himself killed by forcing them into warrior training too soon. This banishment led to Yellowfang's acceptance into ThunderClan. In ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into The Wild]]'', when Brokenstar is first introduced, Yellowfang and [[#Firestar|Firepaw]] drove Brokenstar and his supporters out of ShadowClan in a revolt.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>  Brokentail lived as a rogue in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'', and attacked the ThunderClan camp in an attempt to kill Fireheart but was blinded by Yellowfang.<ref name=\"fire and ice\">{{cite book|title=Fire and Ice|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052559-0|title-link=Fire and Ice (Warriors)|date=June 2004}}</ref> He was then taken prisoner and stripped of his leadership status, renamed to his old warrior name of '''Brokentail'''. He plotted with [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]] in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'' to attack ThunderClan along with his rogue allies, though the attack failed.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> When the rogues were chased out and Tigerclaw was exiled, Yellowfang decided to end Brokentail's life by feeding him deathberries, also revealing to him that she was really his mother. Later, in ''Sunset'', he is implied to be in the Dark Forest/Place of No Stars with Tigerstar, Hawkfrost, and Darkstripe after the latter scents him.<ref name=sunset>{{cite book|title=Sunset|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082771-7|title-link=Sunset (Warriors)|date=2009-10-13}}</ref>\n\nBrokenstar mentored Mosspaw and Volepaw (who both died before becoming warriors) despite their being only three moons old.\n\nBrokentail may have made an appearance in ''[[The Rise of Scourge]]'', when Scourge scents a forest cat, believing that he's Tigerstar.<ref name=\"Rise of Scourge\">{{cite book|title=The Rise of Scourge|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-147867-3|title-link=The Rise of Scourge|date=2008-06-24}}</ref> Instead, a tom with a bent tail and two rogue friends are found, with the latter calling him \"boss\". After one is killed, the tom with the bent tail states, \"I've had my fill of this place. It's time to return to the forest... where we belong.\"\n\nHe has also made an appearance in ''The Fourth Apprentice'' where he attacks Jayfeather along with Breezepelt as a \"ghost cat\".<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> They were both driven off by Honeyfern before they could kill him or Poppyfrost. He, along with Tigerstar and Hawkfrost, watch over Poppyfrost's kits greedily at the end of the book. He also makes Ivypool attempt to kill Flametail, before Tigerheart stops her and Tigerstar agrees with Tigerheart.\n\nHe appears again in ''The Last Hope'' where he and the other Dark Forest cats invade the ThunderClan camp. During the battle he kills Ferncloud who was guarding the nursery before being killed by Yellowfang a second time causing him to die and fade away forever.\n\n====Nightstar====\n'''Nightstar''', a lean, but frail, black tom with amber eyes and a long tail, was the leader of ShadowClan before [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]]. After [[#Brokenstar|Brokenstar]] was driven out of ShadowClan in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'', '''Nightpelt''', one of the Clan's senior warriors, offered to take leadership of ShadowClan and appointed Cinderfur as his deputy.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>  However, in ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'', he became violently ill due to the sickness from Carrionplace raging through the ShadowClan camp at the time and died, though he apparently had nine lives to spare.<ref name=\"rising storm\" /> [[#Runningnose|Runningnose]], ShadowClan's medicine cat at the time, later told [[#Firestar|Fireheart]] that Nightstar had never actually received his nine lives when he first journeyed to the Moonstone, perhaps due to the fact that Brokentail, ex-leader of ShadowClan, was still alive and remained ShadowClan's leader in the eyes of StarClan. Following Brokentail's death, Nightstar was too weak to travel back to the Moonstone and died sometime in ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'', thus allowing Tigerclaw to take control of ShadowClan. Nightpelt has mentored Dawncloud.<ref name=\"rising storm\" />\n\n====Tigerstar====\nTigerstar (born Tigerkit) is a huge dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes and unusually long front claws. He is born in ThunderClan, son of Pinestar and Leopardfoot, but is [[exile]]d for attempting to [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|murder]] Bluestar, the former leader of ThunderClan. He is mentored by Thistleclaw, and because his father, Pinestar, left the Clan to become a kittypet, and he tries to prove he will not leave ThunderClan as his father did, but Tigerclaw was enraged by the fact that his own Clan didn't trust him. Before he is exiled, he accuses his apprentice, Ravenpaw, of [[treason]], and mates with Goldenflower, a ThunderClan she-cat. They have two kits, Tawnykit (later Tawnypelt) and Bramblekit (later Bramblestar). He then retreats with a sworn vengeance on ThunderClan. He reappears in ShadowClan as Tigerstar. At the time, Shadowclan is in need of a strong leader; they are in chaos because of the sudden death of Nightstar, the leader who never receives the traditional nine lives from StarClan. Tigerstar is more than willing to lead them. He brings rogues to the Clan, and when his cats question his leadership, Tigerstar meets it with violence and ferocity. He spends the rest of his life plotting against Fireheart, and one of his plans includes leading wild dogs directly into the ThunderClan camp. Bluestar is killed while saving Firestar. Since he is deputy before she dies, he becomes Firestar, leader of ThunderClan. Before Tigerstar dies at the claws of Scourge, a vicious cat and the leader of BloodClan, he becomes mates with a loner named Sasha. They have three kits, Tadpole, Hawk (later Hawkkit, then Hawkfrost), and Moth (later Mothkit, then Mothwing). Tadpole dies, drowning in a basement flood. Instead of going to StarClan, Tigerstar is sent to the Place of No Stars, or the Dark Forest. There he still plans his \"revenge\" on Firestar. In the end, in ''The Last Hope'', his spirit is finally and permanently destroyed by Firestar.\n\n====Tall Shadow====\nAppearing in the ''Dawn of the Clans'' series, Tall Shadow is a night black she-cat with dark green eyes. Her only known family is her brother, Moon Shadow, and [[nephew]], Sun Shadow. Born in the mountains, she leaves with a fraction of the Tribe to find a new home. After the leader of the group, Shaded Moss, dies, she takes up the leadership position.

Many characters here were first mentioned in the original series, but had minor or insignificant roles. In addition, as with the original series, most characters listed here play minor or significant roles in the following series, ''Power of Three'', as well.\n\n==== Tawnypelt ====\nA slender, mottled, calico she-cat with green eyes and well-muscled shoulders (though as a kit she was listed as a golden tabby), '''Tawnypelt''' is the daughter of Goldenflower and [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]], as well as the littermate of [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] and half-sister of [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], Tadpole and Swiftpaw. When she lived in ThunderClan as an apprentice, Tawnypaw, most of her Clanmates did not trust her because her father was Tigerstar, so instead of putting up with their suspicions, she left ThunderClan to join ShadowClan, then part of an alliance under Tigerstar's rule called TigerClan, in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>  She became a loyal ShadowClan warrior, though some of her Clanmates still doubt her allegiances because she was born in ThunderClan. Her full warrior name is revealed in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar />  In ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'', she is chosen as the ShadowClan representative on the quest to find a new home for the Clans.<ref name=newbook1 />  Coincidentally, her brother, Brambleclaw, is also chosen, as the ThunderClan representative.\n\nTigerstar offered her the same plan of power he offered to her brothers, Hawkfrost and Brambleclaw, to make her leader of ShadowClan, but she rejected him, saying that if she were ever to become leader, it would be through honesty and loyalty. In the ''Power of Three'' series, she mates with Rowanclaw to have three kits: [[#Dawnpelt|Dawnkit]], [[#Tigerheart|Tigerkit]] and [[#Flametail|Flamekit]].\n\nShe goes with her brother, Brambleclaw, [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]], [[#Brook Where Small Fish Swim|Brook]], [[#Crowfeather|Crowfeather]] and his son [[#Breezepelt|Breezepaw]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]], [[#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]], and [[#Lionblaze|Lionpaw]] in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' to help the Tribe of Rushing Water deal with a group of rogues that have invaded their territory.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  In ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'', Tawnypelt and her kits leave ShadowClan temporarily and go to ThunderClan after Blackstar loses faith and denounces StarClan.<ref name=longshadows />  Tawnypelt is tough and stands for nothing from no one, but has an affectionate side that comes through when her friends need her.<ref name=starlight/><ref name=\"newbook3\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Dawn|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=27 December 2005|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dawnwarriorsnewp00erin/page/368 368]|isbn=978-0-06-074457-1|title-link=Dawn (Warriors)}}</ref><ref name=\"newbook2\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Moonrise|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=1 August 2005|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/moonrisewarriors00erin/page/320 320]|isbn=978-0-06-074454-0|title-link=Moonrise (Warriors)}}</ref><ref name=\"newbook1\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Midnight|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=10 May 2005|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/midnight00hunt/page/336 336]|isbn=978-0-06-074451-9|oclc=66296992|title-link=Midnight (Warriors)}}</ref><ref name=\"newbook5\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Twilight|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=22 August 2006|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/starlightwarrior00erin/page/352 352]|isbn=978-0-06-082762-5|oclc=86112121|title-link=Twilight (Warriors)}}</ref><ref name=\"newbook6\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Sunset|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=26 December 2006|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=6|pages=320|isbn=978-0-06-082769-4|oclc=70673118|title-link=Sunset (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\n=== '' Power of Three '' ===\nThe ''Power of Three'' series covers events in the story from ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' to Sunrise.\n\n==== Tigerheart ====\nThe son of Tawnypelt and Rowanclaw and the brother of Dawnpelt and Flametail, '''Tigerheart''' is a handsome, sleek dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes and straight, thick whiskers. He is the grandson of Tigerstar, whom he is named after. While resembling the latter, he is very cheerful and kind.\n\nHe is first introduced as a kit, Tigerkit, in ''Dark River'' and later as an apprentice in ''Long Shadows''. He is the best hunter out of his siblings.  In ''Long Shadows'', Tigerheart, along with his siblings and Tawnypelt, leave ShadowClan temporarily for ThunderClan after ShadowClan loses its faith in StarClan. He also helps Lionblaze, Hollyleaf and Jayfeather to convince Blackstar to believe that StarClan still watch over them by creating a fake StarClan sign. Tigerheart had the same mentors that his mother Tawnypelt did, both when she was in ThunderClan and ShadowClan. He was temporarily mentored by Brackenfur, while staying in ThunderClan and was mentored by Oakfur when he returned to ShadowClan. In The Fourth Apprentice, there are hints about him having a crush on Dovepaw, Lionblaze's apprentice. This is confirmed in ''Night Whispers'', when the two of them admitted their feelings for each other. In ''Sign of the Moon'' and ''The Forgotten Warrior'', Tigerheart's relationship with Dovewing is damaged after Dovewing's sister, Ivypaw, is captured and traded for catmint, a result of Tigerheart telling his Clan about the herb.\n\n==== Flametail ====\nThe second son of Tawnypelt and Rowanclaw, and the brother of Dawnpelt and Tigerheart, '''Flametail''' has a bright ginger pelt like his father and faded light green eyes, thick fur, a bushy tail, and short, pudgy legs. He dreams of becoming a medicine cat under Littlecloud instead of a warrior, probably based on his bond with [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] and curiosity. He was first introduced as a kit, Flamekit, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'',<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  and as an apprentice in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows />  In ''Long Shadows'' he leaves ShadowClan for ThunderClan with his siblings and Tawnypelt after ShadowClan loses faith in StarClan, and also helps create the fake StarClan sign.<ref name=longshadows />  He was temporarily mentored by [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]] while staying in ThunderClan, and is being trained to be a medicine cat in Sunrise by Littlecloud. Flametail died when he drowned in the frozen lake in ''Night Whispers''.<ref name=nightwhispers>{{cite book|title=Night Whispers|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-155515-2|title-link=Night Whispers (Warriors)}}</ref> His sister Dawnpelt thinks that Jayfeather is the one who drowns him, but it is because of Rock, an ancient cat, that Jayfeather is not able to save Flametail.\n\n==== Dawnpelt ====\nThe only daughter of Tawnypelt and Rowanclaw and the sister of Flametail and Tigerheart, '''Dawnpelt''' has a creamy pelt and a fiery personality much like her mother, and seems to be closer to [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] than her other apparent cousins, [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], and is the best fighter out of her siblings. She was first introduced as a kit, Dawnkit, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'',<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  and as an apprentice in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows />  She left ShadowClan for ThunderClan with her mother and littermates after it lost faith in StarClan, and helped to create the fake StarClan sign. She was temporarily mentored by [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]] when she stayed in ThunderClan. Her mentor was revealed in ''Sunrise'' as Ivytail. In ''The Forgotten Warrior'', she blames Jayfeather for Flametail's death.<ref name=sunrise/>\n\nIn ''Thunder and Shadow'', the second book of ''A Vision of Shadows'', Dawnpelt is one of the many ShadowClan cats who choose to desert Rowanstar and join Darktail's rogues. She does this mainly because her rebellious kits have joined the rogues and she doesn't want to leave them or her home. In the next book, ''Shattered Sky'', Dawnpelt, along with most of the deserters, grows to regret her decision after seeing how cruel and dishonourable Darktail and his rogues truly are. She decides to leave along with her sons Strikestone and Juniperclaw, but not her daughter Sleekwhisker, who is implied to have a crush on Darktail. However, just as Dawnpelt is leaving, she is caught by Darktail and disappears after an argument with him. It is unknown exactly what happens to her, but is heavily implied that Darktail took her to the lake and drowned her, along with several other former ShadowClan cats who tried to leave. Dawnpelt is confirmed to be deceased in ''Darkest Night'', when she appears among the spirit of the cats who died during Darktail's reign. She is shown to deeply regret her decision to abandon the Clans and the fact that she gave up her life trying to make it right. She later gives her brother Tigerstar, one of his nine lives.\n\n=== '' A Vision of Shadows '' ===\n\n====Needletail====\nA silver-grey she-cat with a white chest and bold green eyes, '''Needletail''' is the daughter of Berryheart and Sparrowtail.\n\nIn ''The Apprentice's Quest'' and ''Thunder and Shadow'', she is a rebellious and disrespectful apprentice, who, along with many others feels that ShadowClan needs to be feared again. She is angry when Rowanstar turned away Darktail's rogues. Needlepaw openly [[Criticism|criticized]] Rowanstar, and she was punished for speaking out against her leader. Her words later spark controversy within ShadowClan. When Darktail asks again to join ShadowClan, Rowanstar denies them, and Needlepaw leads an apprentice rebellion against Rowanstar, claiming she, along with the other apprentices do not want to live like Clan cats and leave to join the rogues. Needlepaw, Juniperpaw, and Sleekpaw leave, and Needlepaw taking the young Violetkit with her. Although their fellow apprentices Yarrowpaw, Beepaw, and Strikepaw decide to stay in ShadowClan, Beepaw, Cloverfoot, and Berryheart follow in suit. Upon joining the rogues, Needlepaw grants herself her warrior name, Needletail, along with Sleekpaw and Juniperpaw, who become Sleekwhisker and Juniperclaw.\n\nIn the ''Thunder and Shadow'' Barnes & Noble exclusive chapter, Needletail, then Needlepaw, is shown training with Tawnypelt. An [[owl]] takes her and no patrols are sent out to search for her. She meets a rogue named Tree, and he takes her back to ShadowClan. Needlepaw is deeply hurt and disappointed to learn that her Clanmates assumed she was dead, sending her on the path of rebelliousness.\n\nIn ''Shattered Sky'', Needletail is shown to have become one of Darktail's most loyal followers, and is perfectly content when Darktail makes them into the Kin and leaves the weaker cats to fend for themselves. Needletail becomes Violetpaw's only friend during the reign and believes Darktail to be the true leader ShadowClan needs. However, along with the majority of the former ShadowClan cats, she grows to regret her [[Treason|betrayal]] after realizing that Darktail is a brutal [[tyrant]] who wishes nothing more than to inflict harm onto other cats. She becomes part of the plot to get rid him, but this backfires when Sleekwhisker notices Violetpaw putting [[poppy seed]]s in Darktail's prey. Darktail decides to punish Violetpaw by killing the one thing she has left, Needletail. Needletail [[Suicide attack|sacrifices]] herself to allow Violetpaw to escape to ThunderClan, and as a result is drowned by Darktail, Sleekwhisker, and Roach.\nNeedletail's actions are remembered by Violetpaw, and Needletail's parents, Berryheart and Sparrowtail, greatly miss their daughter and are distraught to know that she, at the time, was one of Darktail's most devoted followers.\n\nIn ''Darkest Night'', it is revealed that along with all the other cats who were drowned by Darktail, Needletail was not granted entry into StarClan, nor the Place of No Stars. Instead, she has been sent to an unnamed residence where she connects with Tree, to who she admits she was wrong to trust Darktail, and later her childhood friend, Alderheart, giving him a prophecy to not dispel the incoming shadows. Upon doing so, Needletail and the other cats are allowed into StarClan. In ''River of Fire'', Needletail, despite having previously acknowledged her mistakes, continues to blame Rowanstar for ShadowClan's downfall for being a \"weak leader\".

Their camp was located where the Twolegplace where Barley's farm currently sits and they have the unique ability to jump very high, a technique that has been passed on to some kittypets and rogues in the rocky canyon. SkyClan's camp also spread over to where Firestar's friend, Smudge, lives. They were driven out when their part of the forest was excavated to create Twolegplace. Homeless and starving, SkyClan appealed to the other Clans for help, but none of them wanted to redivide their territory and as such SkyClan was forced to leave the forest. They traveled north along the river before finally settling in a rocky canyon. Before long, however, an intelligent and malicious horde of rats attacked and killed most of the Clan, forcing the remnants to scatter across the nearby forest and Twolegplaces.<ref name=firestarsquest>Hunter, Erin. (2007) ''[[Firestar's Quest]]''. 610pp.</ref>\n\nModern SkyClan was reformed when Firestar, with the help of Sandstorm, set out to reunite the lost descendants of the Clan throughout the nearby area. Later, after rebuilding the lost Clan, SkyClan was able to defeat the rat pack and live in peace for moons to come under leadership of Leafstar. SkyClan is still trying to make their clan larger since at the moment it is very small. SkyClan have warriors that are at the gorge in the morning but sleep with their human owners at night. These cats are called \"Daylight warriors\", but the warriors in the clan sometimes call them \"Kitty warriors\".\n\nThey are eventually driven out by The Kin who claim the Gorge as their own. During their exile, SkyClan is discovered by a ThunderClan apprentice named Twigpaw (later Twigbranch) who is revealed to be Hawkwing's daughter shortly afterwards. Twigpaw brings her kin back to the Lake Territories where she Introduces Hawkwing to her sister Violetpaw (later Violetshine). With all of the five clans together, Darktail and his rouges are defeated.\n\n===Current SkyClan===\n\n====Leafstar====\n'''Leafstar''', a brown and cream tabby she-cat with amber eyes, was a rogue named '''Leaf''' before she came to SkyClan. After she joined, Firestar gave her the warrior name of '''Leafdapple''', and she mentored Sparrowpelt. StarClan later chose Leafdapple to be leader because of her thoughtful personality and understanding of the warrior code. Firestar at first doesn't feel comfortable with her being the leader, but he realizes how perceptive she is when she tells him that she knows his first loyalty is to his own Clan at home.  During her leader ceremony, the ancient leaders of the four Clans come together to give her four of her nine lives as an apology to SkyClan for driving them out. Leafstar is also in love with Billystorm, a daylight-warrior, and they became mates. They have Firekit (named after Firestar), Stormkit (named after Sandstorm), and Harrykit (named after Sol's house cat name, Harry).\n\n====Sharpclaw====\nA dark ginger tabby tom with broad shoulders and green eyes, '''Sharpclaw''' was first a rogue named Scratch.

In the SkyClan manga, it is revealed that he has a crush on Cherrytail. He was killed by the rouge leader Darktail. Hawkwing, his son, succeeds him as deputy.\n\n====Echosong====\nA silver-grey tabby she-cat with dark grey paws and green eyes and a white chest and a fluffy tail, '''Echosong''' was a former kittypet named '''Echo''', but was given the role of SkyClan's medicine cat after she began to have dreams of the ancient SkyClan and StarClan. At first she was unsure of interpreting dreams from her warrior ancestors, but later grew into her role as a medicine cat. Later, Fawnstep, the medicine cat of SkyClan at the time of its exile, said she would be sharing dreams with her, implying that Fawnstep would be Echosong's mentor, in the way that Leafpool was Willowshine's mentor when Mothwing could not teach her about StarClan.<ref name=firestar /> She receives the vision that makes Leafstar leader.\n\n====Skywatcher====\nA scarred, very old, dark grey tom with matted fur and pale blue eyes, '''Skywatcher''' was also known as '''Moony'''. Skywatcher was an old cat who was the last true warrior of SkyClan, named '''Sky''', until Firestar and Sandstorm rebuilt SkyClan. He was the one to show them around SkyClan territory. He died in his sleep, but Firestar believes that he wanted to live to see SkyClan rebuilt. He returns to give Leafstar one of her nine lives and he is also the cat to inform Firestar of the ''Power of Three'' prophecy: \"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws.\"<ref name=firestar/><ref name=sight>Hunter, Erin.

BloodClan does not have a warrior code, do not believe in StarClan, and do not have the organization structure found in the other Clans. As a result, BloodClan is run in the style of a [[dictatorship]], and cats who either break the rules or desire to leave are maimed or killed.<ref name=darkesthour>Hunter, Erin. (2004) ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. 336pp.</ref>\n\n=== Bone===\nBoney is a huge, muscular, battle-scarred, black-and-white tom with green eyes. He serves as the unofficial \"deputy\" of [[#BloodClan|BloodClan]], and is [[#Scourge|Scourge]]'s main enforcer, performing his dirty work. He also wears a collar around his neck similar to Scourge's. Said collar has similar dog and cat teeth. He kills Whitestorm during the final battle in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' before being swarmed and killed by a group of apprentices: Bramblepaw, Tawnypaw, Ashpaw, Featherpaw, and Stormpaw.\n\n=== Scourge ===\nScourge (Tiny at birth), a small black tom with icy blue eyes and single white paw, rules BloodClan through fear and a survival-of-the-fittest mentality, and refuses to provide for any cat who cannot support him- or herself. He permits the mates of she-cats nursing kits to hunt for their mates purely out of pragmatism, so that the Clan does not cease to exist when all the elder cats die and there are no younger cats to replace them. Despite his small size, he is a very capable and dangerous fighter, and neither any sort of warrior's ethical code or merciful impulses restrain him in battle; he is brutal and ruthless (Rock says in ''Cats of the Clans'' that he lacks \"any sense of right or wrong\").<ref name=catsotc/>{{rp|91}}<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> To show his capability to kill, he wears a collar studded with teeth and claws from dogs and cats he has killed, and his claws have been reinforced with dogs' teeth. The color of his collar has not been mentioned in the books, but was colored purple in ''[[The Rise of Scourge]].'' His weakness is revealed to be his skepticism towards StarClan, which means he does not have nine lives.\n\nIt has been confirmed by the authors that Firestar is Scourge's [[Half sibling|half-brother]] (Scourge and Firestar share the same father),<ref name=\"authorchat5\"/> as implied in ''[[The Rise of Scourge]]'' when Quince wonders about why the litter did not share its father's ginger color, making Firestar also the half-brother of Socks and Ruby, Scourge's littermates. Scourge is then related to Cloudtail, Leafpool, Princess, Squirrelflight, Whitewing, Whitewing's kits Dovewing and Ivypool, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather.\n\nScourge's evil nature is explained in ''The Rise of Scourge''. It is revealed that he was originally known as Tiny and from a young age, his brother Socks and sister Ruby treat him very badly, bullying him about his size and mocking him. His mother tells them not to pick on him, but never really defends him the way he wants her to. When Ruby taunts him that he will be drowned in the river because no humans want to adopt him, Tiny runs away by himself. He wanders into forest territory and is attacked by Tigerpaw who is patrolling the border of ThunderClan territory with Bluefur and his mentor, Thistleclaw. Tigerpaw wants to kill him, but is stopped at the last moment by Bluefur. Tiny develops a lifelong grudge against Tigerpaw for this unfair fight. Afraid to go home and terrified to go into the forest and face more abuse from cats like Tigerpaw, Tiny soon moves to the [[alley]]s of a city, where he finds an old dog. One of its teeth falls out and he tries to use it to cut off his collar, but ends up getting it stuck. He finds a group of thin cats who are eating a small piece of chicken from human garbage. In order to convince them to share their food he makes up a story about killing a dog and ripping the teeth from its skull as a sort of trophy. Though skeptical, the cats let him have a bite.\n\nThe next day, however, a group of cats, led by two cats called Bone and Brick, have heard his story. They ask him to kill a dog behind a deli who is stealing their food. Afraid of the dog, but realizing that he will be revealed to be a liar and driven out if he refuses to fight the dog, Tiny approaches the dog. By sheer luck, the dog is frightened by Tiny's shadow, which appears about three times as large as Tiny really is, and flees; Tiny is clever enough to convince the other cats he frightened the dog away. The other stray cats are amazed and treat him almost like a god. This is the point where he decides to change his name; the other cats have never asked for his name before, so instead of telling them his name is Tiny, he makes up the new, more intimidating name Scourge. He becomes the leader by default, and cats begin to seek his advice and aid. A group of rogues from the forest wander in and begin bullying and abusing the local cats, who turn to their leader, Scourge, for protection. Scourge cannot bluff these cats as he tricked the dog, and the forest rogues openly mock and threaten him. Unwilling to back away from his position of power, Scourge kills one of them in cold blood, frightening the other forest rogues away and solidifying his hold over the alley cats.\n\nLater, Socks and Ruby wander into his territory; they were adopted as house cats, but later become lost and forgotten when their owners move; as dependent pets, they never learned to hunt for their own food. They ask Scourge for help, but he snarls at them, asking why he should help them after everything they did to him. Ruby then asks if blood means anything to him, to which Scourge replies that it is everything to him and how the blood of his enemies soaks into his fur. He then says that he is the leader of BloodClan, which shocks his siblings. Scourge finally lets them eat some of his food until they are full, but after they are finished, Scourge permanently [[Exile|banishes]] them from his territory, completing his transformation into a cold-blooded villain.\n\nScourge forms the allycats into BloodClan. They copy his ways, even making collars for themselves out of the teeth of the dogs they have slain and cats they have murdered. Scourge appoints Bone, a terrifying black and white cat, as his second-in-command.\nTigerstar is led by Boulder, a former follower of Scourge, into Scourge's territory within the maze-like alleys. Tigerstar, who is at this point leader of ShadowClan, is slightly amused by the tiny leader, but after seeing the numbers of his followers and their collars, decides to ask Scourge to join him in battle against Thunderclan and WindClan, promising him a share of their land. He never intends to keep his word, thinking that once he has all the forest clans united under his rule, he will easily be able to get rid of Scourge, whom he severely underestimates because of Scourge's small size and Tigerstar's own arrogance. Tigerstar clearly does not remember the time when he almost murdered the small black cat as a kitten, though Scourge certainly remembers and despises him, though he very deliberately says nothing about their past confrontation. When WindClan and ThunderClan still refuse to submit to Tigerstar, he shouts at BloodClan to attack, but Scourge's followers refuse to fight without Scourge's orders, enraging Tigerstar. When Scourge refuses to order BloodClan to attack, Tigerstar attacks Scourge, who proves more formidable than Tigerstar ever expected. Scourge takes his revenge by killing Tigerstar, cutting him open from chin to tail, and watches him gleefully as all his nine lives are stripped from him. Later, during the battle with LionClan (all the warrior clans allied together), Scourge takes one of Firestar's lives, but is slain later by the ThunderClan leader.<ref name=rise>Hunter, Erin. (2008)''[[The Rise of Scourge]]''. 112pp.</ref> It is unknown where Scourge's spirit went after his death.\n\n===Ice===\nIce (born Jumper) is one of Barley's brothers who joins BloodClan and becomes one of Scourge's followers, like Snake. He nearly kills his own sister, Violet.\n\n===Snake===\nSnake (born Hoot) is the other one of Barley's brothers who joined BloodClan. He, too, was responsible for almost killing Violet, and is the first to tell Barley of their major change.\n\n===Brick===\nBrick is a russet colored cat, a friend of Bone and Scourge, but also a supporter of Tiny/Scourge even before BloodClan is formed. Brick asks Tiny/Scourge to fight one of the dogs in the town that is keeping them from a dumpster full of food.\n\n== StarClan ==\nAfter death, most of the spirits of Clan cats join to StarClan. StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt (the [[Milky Way]]), and each individual star represents a single dead warrior. Once a cat dies, he or she joins StarClan in a form in which he or she was most comfortable in. For example, blindness and deafness would be cured, unless the cat had been happier being deaf or blind. StarClan's territory is a forest that is perpetually in warm, comfortable, summer-like conditions. There are neither conflicts (usually) nor disease present. StarClan cats do not remain in StarClan eternally. Instead, they are eventually forgotten by the living and their spirits in StarClan fade slowly away, as mentioned in ''Fading Echoes''.<ref name=\"fadingechoesbook\">{{cite book|title=Fading Echoes|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-155512-1|title-link=Fading Echoes (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\nStarClan warriors keep watch over the Clans, usually watching their own Clan. They provide guidance to the Clans, often in dreams and other signs and omens. StarClan usually visits leaders and medicine cats.  Often, this occurs with medicine cats at either the Moonstone revealed in ''Into the Wild'' or later at the Moonpool revealed in ''Starlight''. StarClan cannot or do not choose to influence events in the real world. However, in ''Firestar's Quest'', Spottedleaf visited both Firestar and Sandstorm, and treated an injured warrior, showing that StarClan indeed has some level of effect on the real world.<ref name=firestarsquest/> The fact that Cinderpelt was reincarnated as Cinderheart is contradictory to that StarClan cannot influence the real world, although they may have chosen to do so.\n\n== The Place of No Stars/The Dark Forest ==\n\nThe Place of No Stars, also known as the Dark Forest, is where the spirits of cats who have caused great pain and suffering in the lives of others go or are banished to. In this place, although there is no sun, moon, nor any stars, the entire forest is bathed in a sickly glow. There is no prey and cats feel no hunger either. Cats known to walk the Dark Forest include Thistleclaw, Tigerstar, Hawkfrost, Brokentail, Darkstripe, Clawface, Mapleshade, Shredtail, and Snowtuft.<ref name=\"fadingechoesbook\"/> Victoria Holmes revealed on the website concerning fantasy authors ''Wands and Worlds'' that StarClan and The Dark Forest exist on different planes; however, there is a clear border between the territories, marked by a wall of mist. Many Clan cats in the ''Omen of the Stars'' series visit there for training for a battle against the Clans. However, many of them are oblivious to the fact that the warriors of the Dark Forest are actually training them to destroy the Clans, including StarClan, in their upcoming battle. Instead, they tell the Clan cats that they are doing this to become better warriors. In The Place of No Stars, cats who wish to leave are killed. The cats in training are ordered to fight with their claws unsheathed, which causes wounds in the waking world. Some of the Dark Forest warriors demonstrate what they will be training by using other Dark Forest warriors as dummies. During many of the demonstrations the 'dummies' are maimed or killed. In ''Omen of the Stars'', Ivypool trains there, but when she realizes that it is not right, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Dovewing ask her to spy on the Dark Forest, because there is a battle between them, StarClan, and the Clans yet to come. In the Great Battle, the Dark Forest spirits attack the Clans.Some cats have escaped, like maple shade.\n\n== The Tribe of Rushing Water ==\n\nThe Tribe of Rushing Water is a group of smaller cats living in the northern caves of the mountain range that divides much of the land between the old forest territories and the lake territories. Tribe cats do not believe in StarClan; instead, they have their own spiritual equivalent, the Tribe of Endless Hunting. In the Tribe, there is no medicine cat or deputy: the leader, always known as Teller of the Pointed Stones, or Healer, serves both duties in addition to leader.<ref name=moonrise /> Upon birth, Tribe cats are named by their mother for the first thing they see (which, incidentally, is usually not Floor/Roof/Wall of Cave or somesuch, as described by Rock in \"Cats of the Clans\"). Eventually, a Tribe cat trains as a to-be (apprentice). They can be either a cave-guard or a prey-hunter, based on their physical appearance, and this future role is determined at birth. Strong, sturdy cats are chosen to be cave-guards, whose job is to defend the Tribe's camp against intruders as well as provide cover for the prey-hunters while hunting. Prey-hunters, chosen for their slender, agile bodies, are adept at hunting in the rocky mountain terrain and can leap high enough to catch large birds. Kit-mothers take care of kits.<ref name=catsotc /> Tribe cats often cover themselves in mud in order to better blend in with their surroundings, allowing them to catch larger, more exotic prey such as hawks and eagles. It also protects them from the cold mountain wind.<ref name=outcast/>{{rp|317}}\n\nThe Tribe typically have no enemies, which leaves them unprepared for attacks by other large predators, an example being Sharptooth. Another example is the other groups of cats attempting to take their territory.<ref name=moonrise /><ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> They have a firmly rooted tradition, and as such do not welcome the beliefs of other cats, a theme which incorporates the use of people from different cultural and traditional ways of thinking working together to solve a common goal. It is revealed in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' of the ''Power of Three'' series that the Tribe is among the descendants of the [[#Ancient Cats|ancient clan]] of cats who originally lived in the lake territories, of which [[#Rock|Rock]] and [[#Fallen Leaves|Fallen Leaves]] are members.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\n\nThroughout the series, the Clan cats commonly call the Tribe cats by the first word in their name, rather than the whole name (e.g., Lark, Pine, and Brook).\n\n=== ''The New Prophecy'' Series ===\nThe Tribe of Rushing Water is primarily introduced in ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]''<ref name=moonrise />  and visited again briefly in ''[[Dawn (Warriors)|Dawn]]''.<ref name=dawn/> In ''Twilight'', Stormfur and Brook visit ThunderClan, staying until ''Outcast''. Following ''The New Prophecy'' series, the Tribe is featured again in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' of the ''Power of Three'' series.  All characters listed here also appear in ''Outcast''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> In Moonrise, they thought Stormfur was the silver cat who was supposed to kill Sharptooth, the mountain lion, but Feathertail (Stormfur's sister) was actually the silver cat and died for the Tribe.<ref name=moonrise />  When the Clans traveled in Dawn to their new lake home, they were sheltered in the Tribe's caves.<ref name=dawn/> In Outcast, they used the Clan's help to drive out intruders.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\n\n====Stormfur====\nA dark gray tom with amber eyes, Stormfur was formerly a RiverClan cat and has lived in ThunderClan, but currently lives in the Tribe of Rushing Water. He was first introduced as a kit, Stormkit, in Forest of Secrets, when his mother, Silverstream, a RiverClan cat, bore him and his sister, Featherkit, on Sunningrocks in ThunderClan territory, ultimately bleeding out her life for it. Their father was Graystripe, a ThunderClan cat, and in order to avoid shedding blood because of a war between RiverClan and ThunderClan over the kits, he brought them himself to RiverClan and stayed with them. Stormkit became an apprentice, Stormpaw, along with his sister Featherpaw, in A Dangerous Path, mentored by Stonefur.\n\nHe and his mate, Brook, met in her Tribe home, and fell in love. He and Brook returned to the forest and helped ThunderClan rebuild from the badger attack and head on to RiverClan. Then, he stayed in ThunderClan when he was banished from RiverClan. He is Graystripe and Silverstream's son, Feathertail's brother, and the half-brother of Bumblestripe, Briarlight, and Blossomfall. Stormfur was very close to Feathertail, but as protective as he was of his sister, he wasn't very happy with her relationship with Crowpaw and openly rejected the tom. He has since decided to return to the Tribe with Brook. He forged his strongest relationships from the journey with Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight. In Moonrise, he felt a brief attraction to Squirrelflight, but flung his affections aside for the good of their Clans. He was unable to ignore his love for Brook so easily. He gets over his mild crush on Squirrelflight and proves it by playfully teasing Bramblestar and Squirrelflight, along with Tawnypelt, about their care for each other. In Outcast, he shows a close relationship with Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight's apparent son Lionblaze. He confides in Lionblaze his past feelings for his supposed mother, making Lionblaze wonder what it would have been like to have Stormfur as a father instead. When Stormfur, Brook, Brambleclaw, Tawnypelt, Crowfeather, Breezepelt, Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, and Jayfeather go with Night and Talon to help the Tribe with the intruders, Stormfur and Brook decide that they want to stay in the Tribe, so they say good-bye to the others in Eclipse.\n\nHe is father of Lark That Sings At Dawn (Lark) and Pine That Clings To Rock (Pine). Stormfur's also grandson to Crookedstar (Silverstream's father), grand-nephew to Oakheart, great-grandson to Rainflower and Shellheart, cousin to Stonefur (who also was his mentor), Mistystar, and Mosskit (Oakheart's kits), grand-cousin to Primrosepaw, Pikepaw, and Perchkit, Greymist, and Reedwhisker, Mallowpaw and Sneezepaw (Graymist's kits).\n\n====Brook Where Small Fish Swim====\n'''Brook''' is a slender, brown tabby she-cat with gray eyes<ref name=thesight/>{{rp|215}} and is a prey-hunter within the Tribe. She is first introduced in ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]'', when the journeying group of Clan cats accidentally stumbles upon the Tribe, and instantly takes a liking to [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]].<ref name=moonrise />\n\nStormfur decides to stay with Brook in the mountains when the exodus of the four Clans passes through. However, they are exiled from the Tribe following a disastrous attempt by Stormfur to rally the Tribe cats in order to force a group of intruding cats out, after which they travel to the new lake territory of ThunderClan. Brook is sorrowful for [[#Teller of the Pointed Stones|Stoneteller's]] decision to banish Stormfur, but remains by his side. She would learn to hunt and live in the forest and is accepted as a full ThunderClan cat, often providing advice to the younger cats based on her experiences in the mountains. During the events of ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' she and Stormfur return to the Tribe along with a collection of Clan warriors in order to deal with the intruders threatening the mountains.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\n\nBrook has two brothers, Crag Where Eagles Nest (Crag), and Talon of Swooping Eagle (Talon). She is Stormfur's mate. She is the mother of Lark That Sings At Dawn (Lark) and Pine That Clings To Rock (Pine).\n\n====Talon of Swooping Eagle====\n'''Talon''' is a massive, broad-shouldered dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes and a scar across the side of his face who serves as a cave-guard in the Tribe. He was first introduced in ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]'' as a Tribe exile, banished by Stoneteller along with other cats for failing to successfully kill the mountain lion Sharptooth.<ref name=moonrise /> He is also revealed to be Brook's brother, along with Crag. After the group of Clan cats chosen by StarClan on the journey to the sun-drown-place pass through the mountains and attempt to solve the Tribe's problem, Talon, Bird, and Rock return to the Tribe in order to help with the plan to kill Sharptooth. He becomes a member of the Tribe once again after Sharptooth is killed. Talon returns in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' and, along with '''Night of No Stars (Night)''', journeys to the Clans for help when the Tribe is having problems with trespassing cats stealing prey.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  In Sign of the Moon he becomes an elder.<ref name=signofthemoon/>\n\n====Teller of the Pointed Stones====\n'''Stoneteller''', as he is more commonly known, serves as the Healer of the Tribe. He is an old, long-bodied dark brown tabby tom with a white muzzle and amber eyes. The Healer performs the duties of both a leader and medicine cat, essentially granting him both traditional and spiritual authority over his Tribemates. The name given to the Tribe's healer is always the same, and as such there have been several Stonetellers over the course of the Tribe's history. This particular Stoneteller is well-suited to leading his Tribe, but is forced to deal with a number of crises (Sharptooth, the unnamed group of trespassing cats, etc.) that threaten their survival and unnerve his faith in the Tribe of Endless Hunting, the Tribe's spiritual equivalent of StarClan. As there are no other cats in a position of power to advise him, Stoneteller often feels overwhelmed by his responsibilities and can be prone to making rash decisions. Later in ''Sign of the Moon'', he dies of old age.\n\n====Crag Where Eagles Nest====\nA dark grey tom with amber eyes, '''Crag''' was one of the cats that found the Clans when they were lost on the mountains on the Great Journey. In ''Sign of the Moon'' he becomes the new Teller of the Pointed Stones after his predecessor dies.<ref name=signofthemoon />  He is a brother of Brook and Talon.\n\n== Ancient cats ==\n\nThese are characters first mentioned in ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'' of the ''Power of Three'' series.<ref name=darkriver/>{{rp|322}} They are as yet unknown to all cats except Jayfeather, whose [[extrasensory perception]] allows him to discover clues hidden in an ancient stick located near the lake. It is hinted in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' that these cats have ties to the [[#The Tribe of Rushing Water|Tribe of Rushing Water]]. In [[Long Shadows (Warriors)|''Long Shadows'']] (5th book in the third series ''Power of Three''), Jayfeather convinces the group to journey to the mountains to live there, hinting they are the direct ancestors of the Tribe.<ref name=longshadows/>{{rp|364}} Although, the stick is broken by Jayfeather, he still is able to connect with Rock since his first birth is as Jay's Wing in the time of the ancient cats, where he realised that his brother, Lionblaze, and Dovewing  are also first born in the time of the ancient cats as Lion's Roar and Dove's Wing, except Dove's Wing is Jay's Wing's(Jayfeather's) sister and Lion's Roar is not his brother at that time.\n\n===Ancient Clan conventions===\n\nThere are several differences between the modern Clans and the Ancient ones. These will be listed below.\n\n*Ancient Clan cats are more like a group of cats living together than a Clan, in that leaders can retire whenever they like, and that there are no definite territory boundaries.\n*The cats in the Clan make major decisions by, 'casting stones', where a line is drawn in the dirt, and each cat pushes a stone to the side\\decision they choose.\n*In the modern Clans, Clan deputies, when they became leaders, had to stay leaders until they died, even if they grew old. With the Ancient Clans, leaders could choose their successors and step down from the post whenever they wanted.\n\n===''Power of Three Series''===\nThe Ancient Clan was primarily introduced in ''Dark River''<ref name=darkriver />  and has played a minor role in all subsequent novels.\n\n====Fallen Leaves====\n'''Fallen Leaves''', a muscular shouldered ginger and white tom with green eyes and the son of Broken Shadow and Stone Song, is one of the Ancient Cats who went into the tunnels to become sharpclaws (the equivalent of warriors). These tunnels run underneath ThunderClan and WindClan territory, in which [[List of Warriors characters#Lionblaze|Lionpaw]] and [[List of Warriors characters#Heathertail|Heatherpaw]] played in at night. Three WindClan kits strayed into them when the floods were rising, and Lionpaw, [[List of Warriors characters#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]], [[List of Warriors characters#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]], Heatherpaw, and [[List of Warriors characters#Breezepelt|Breezepaw]] had to rescue them. It was then that Fallen Leaves guided Jaypaw through, finding the kits and averting a battle. Later, in ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'', the three kits reveal the tunnels to WindClan, and WindClan use them as an opportunity to ambush ThunderClan.<ref name=eclipse/>\n\nFallen Leaves had entered the tunnels to prove he was a sharpclaw. However, he neglected to mention to Rock that rain might fall. This proved his downfall, as when it rained, the tunnels flooded, and he drowned. Jayfeather dreamed about his journey in the tunnels, and before he died, Fallen Leaves suddenly realized Jayfeather was walking with him.\n\nThe Erins said that Fallen Leaves still hasn't accepted the fact that he is dead, and this is why Fallen Leaves' spirit still walks through the tunnels. In ''Long Shadows'', he was dismayed to hear that Jayfeather was not staying with him, and his death is a catalyst for the Ancient Clans moving from the lake to the mountains.<ref name=longshadows />\n\n==== Rock ====\n'''Rock''' is a very old cat. He is described in ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'' as his pelt like moleskin, the fur gone except for tufts along his spine, and his sightless eyes bulging like eggs, thus depicting him as ancient to the Ancient Clans.<ref name=darkriver />  He watches over all of the Clans (including SkyClan, BloodClan, and the Tribe of Rushing Water, in addition to the rogues, loners, and kittypets known to the four Clans, as well as having an acquaintance with Midnight and Sol), and as he says in ''[[Cats of the Clans (Warriors)|Cats of the Clans]]'' he knows the destiny and innermost thoughts of each cat.<ref name=catsotc />  In his introduction in the prologue of ''Dark River'', he is in a cave and greets [[#Fallen Leaves|Fallen Leaves]] before the young cat goes into the tunnels.<ref name=darkriver />  He later meets with Jayfeather and tells him he must go to the mountains in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>   He is the narrator of ''Cats of the Clans'', and talks with three kits from StarClan: Mosskit, a half-ThunderClan, half-RiverClan kit who died on the way to RiverClan with Stonefur and Mistyfoot, '''Adderkit''', a WindClan kit ironically killed by a snake, and '''Blossomkit''', a ShadowClan kit who was forced into battle when she was too young on Brokenstar's demand, and was killed in the battle.  He seems to know all about the Clans (although some of his knowledge is a little off in ''[[Cats of the Clans (Warriors)|Cats of the Clans]]''), and is very keen in particular to Jayfeather, supporting the prophecy.<ref name=catsotc /> It is revealed in The Fourth Apprentice that he knew of Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze's heritage.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> In Sign of the Moon he tells Jayfeather that he was once the Teller of Pointed Stones for the Tribe of Rushing Water.<ref name=signofthemoon/>\n\n==== Furled Bracken ====\nA dark ginger tabby tom with muscular shoulders and amber eyes, '''Furled Bracken''' is the leader of the ancient Clan that lived at the lake before the four Clans. When Stone Song requests for the stones to be cast, he accepts. When Jayfeather, or who the Clan thinks he is, Jay's Wing, tries to go forward to make his decision, he holds him back, telling him that he must choose last because he is the newest sharpclaw. When the decision is made to leave, Furled Bracken appoints Stone Song as leader, much to Jayfeather's surprise.\n\n==== Stone Song ====\nA hefty dark grey tabby tom with piercing ice blue eyes, '''Stone Song''' is known to be a sharpclaw of the ancient Clan that lived at the lake before the four Clans. He is intrigued by Jay's Wing's, or rather Jaypaw's dream about the mountains. He seems quite confident and is the cat who asks Furled Bracken for the stones to be cast. After the decision is made to leave, Furled Bracken appoints him as leader. Stone Song later asks Jay's Wing to help him lead the tribe to their new home. He is the father of Fallen Leaves and mate of Broken Shadow.\n\n==== Broken Shadow ====\nA slender orange tabby she-cat with white paws and amber eyes, '''Broken Shadow''' is also known to be a sharpclaw of the ancient Clan that lived at the lake before the four Clans. In ''Dark River'', Broken Shadow is not mentioned directly by name.<ref name=darkriver />  She is seen sadly watching her son, Fallen Leaves, enter the tunnels for his assessment with Rock to become a sharpclaw. Broken Shadow protests his leaving, saying that the skies look like they might rain. Fallen Leaves continues on stubbornly though, not wanting to put off his becoming a full sharpclaw any longer, though that same impatience was ultimately his fate.\n\nIn ''Long Shadows'' when everyone is congrating Jaypaw for making it out of the tunnels and all throughout the times we see Broken Shadow, she is still grieving for Fallen Leaves.\n\n==== Half Moon ====\nA white she-cat with green eyes, '''Half Moon''' is another one of the Ancient Cats known to be the ancestors of the Tribe of Rushing Water. She is a calm and kind she-cat, and she was in love with Jay's Wing. Half Moon helped Jaypaw (Jay's Wing) when he was confused about where he was, and she shows obvious affection towards Jay's Wing, willing to leave if he was. At the end of ''Sign of the Moon'', she says: \"I will wait for you forever, Jay's Wing!\". She defended him when '''Fish Leap''' bullied him, and during the casting of the stones, Half Moon went to the 'leave' side. She also made a brief appearance during Jaypaw's naming ceremony, and it could be noted that she loves both Jayfeather and Jay's Wing since they are both to be the same cat. She is apparently a very good hunter, helping Jay's Wing to catch prey when he found it difficult. In ''Sign of the Moon'', Half Moon is made the first Teller of the Pointed Stones by Jayfeather, because she was the one who saw the \"sign of the moon\"<ref name=signofthemoon /> She is also mentioned in the prologue in \"The Sun Trail\".\n\n==== Jay's Wing ====\nA grey tabby tom with blue eyes, '''Jay's Wing''' is a cat training to be a sharpclaw (warrior) of the ancients that lived at the lake before the four Clans. In ''Long Shadows'', Jayfeather is taken back in time by Fallen Leaves, and walks in Jay's Wing's pawsteps.<ref name=longshadows />  Jay's Wing/Jayfeather asks questions that confuse most of the Ancients. He helps Fallen Leaves's tribe decide to leave the lake by telling the leader, Furled Bracken, about a dream he had, one about the mountains the Tribe of Rushing Water lives in. He never truly had that dream, but rather had visited the mountains himself. After the beginning of the journey, Rock calls Jayfeather back and tells him it is time to return to ThunderClan. He reincarnated as Jayfeather, which is why when Jayfeather went back in time, he becomes Jay's Wing.\n\n==== Dove's Wing ====\n<!-- In an autochat, Erin Hunter has said dovepaw is not dove's wing's reincarnation; however, it is claimed that she is in Sign of the moon. I will check as soon as i get the book -->\nA pretty pale grey she-cat with blue eyes, '''Dove's Wing''' is known to be a cat training to be a sharpclaw (warrior). Dove's Wing is sister to Jay's Wing, who, unknown to her, is Jayfeather thrust into the past. When Jay's Wing asks a strange question in front of a group of softpaws (apprentices), she says he must have hit his head on the rocky floor of the tunnel. When Jayfeather goes back in time and comes out as Jay's Wing, he suspects that Dove's Wing might be Dovewing's counterpart.\n\n==== Lion's Roar ====\nA small, compact, strong golden tabby tom, '''Lion's Roar''' is born to Shy Fawn and Dark Whiskers in Sign of the Moon.<ref name=signofthemoon />  When he first enters the world, he is motionless and so all the other cats think he is dead. Jayfeather (Jay's Wing) licks him, and he lets out a loud wail, which some other cat says sounds like a lion's roar, which is what Shy Fawn named him. Jayfeather thinks he reincarnated as Lionblaze, which gives him the idea that Dove's Wing might be Dovewing, as it would make sense for the Three to have had a past life since he did, too.\n\n===''Dawn of the Clans''===\n\n====Gray Wing====\nGray Wing is a sleek, dark grey tom with golden eyes. When Stoneteller (also known as Half Moon) receives the vision of some of her cats leaving to follow the sun to a better home, he cast his rock with the ones that want to stay. He watches with a sad heart as the majority of his tribe leaves, though his mother still remains. His brother and sister (still kits) are too young to go, so they stay as well. When Jagged Peak, Grey Wing's brother, leaves to follow the group going to a better place, he bravely goes out to find him. At this point, Jagged Peak is being attacked by an eagle. Grey Wing arrived just in time to save Jagged Peak, and they rush to catch up with the rest of the group. One of Grey Wing's best friends, Turtle Tail, is there, and she secretly likes Grey Wing. At the time, he just regards her as a friend. Clear Sky, his brother, really wants to get to their new home, and upon arrival, he moves into the forest instead of staying in the moor. He establishes boundaries and challenges any trespassing cat, much to Grey Wing's dismay. Turtle Tail moves to live as a housecat, hurt when she figures out that Grey Wing is in love with a cat named Storm, though the latter ultimately mates with Clear Sky. Lonely now, he continues his roles as a moor cat. When Tall Shadow, the leader of the group, begins to make choices that most cats in the group disagree with, a cat named Shattered Ice challenge her leadership. He requests Grey Wing take over, but Grey Wing refuses and explains that every cat should give Tall Shadow the respect she deserves. Turtle Tail returns, and Shattered Ice is furious that she dares to come back. Tall Shadow accepts her, which angers Shattered Ice further. Later on, Grey Wing discovers that Turtle Tail is bearing the kits of a kittypet named Tom. Turtle Tail reveals to him that she left the humans because one of her friends, a she-cat named Bumble, told her that once she gave birth, the humans would take her kits away. She asked if Grey Wing would be their father and at first he is hesitant. Later, he accepts and Turtle Tail gives birth to three healthy kits: Pebble Heart, Sparrow Fur, and Owl Eyes. After a fire, Tall Shadow steps down from leadership and gives it to Grey Wing. Grey Wing unwillingly takes the role, but is permanently weakened from too much smoke inhalation. He leads for a while, but eventually steps down and never becomes a true Clan leader. However, his actions and wise decisions cause many future generations to know him as Grey Wing the Wise.\n\n====Clear Sky====\nClear Sky is a light gray tom with ice blue eyes, the founder of SkyClan, comes from the Tribe of Rushing Water. Kit of Quiet Rain, brother of Gray Wing, Jagged Peak and Fluttering Bird. Mate of Bright Stream, Storm and Star Flower, father of Thunder(star), Dew Petal, Flower Foot and. He chose to follow the Sun Trail when cats were casting stones. He brought several cats to follow his group, choosing the forest as their place to set camp. He's also the creator of borders, the first cat to establish it. After the deaths of Fluttering Bird, Bright Stream and Storm, he went so depressed, and thought about never let his cats went dying like they do, so he set borders, and drove the cats who crossed the borders away. However, he decided to move his borders for a bigger territory for hunting and more prey to fill their bellies. Near the end of \"The Sun Trail\", he asked Gray Wing to take Thunder away, because he thought that he couldn't hold the responsibilities that a father should do. After he told this, he and Gray Wing declared the end of their brotherhood. He also kicked Jagged Peak out of his group because he broke his leg. Soon a fire broke out in his group, so he moved to the moor. Thunder joined his group, but later left because he thought his father's methods were too extreme. Soon, the hostility between Gray Wing and him went too far, and a fierce battle broke out. During the battle, Clear Sky killed his old friend Rainswept Flower because she shouted at him for being greedy. He responded with, \"I'm not greedy, I'm just strong.\" He also fought Gray Wing, shouting at him to give in. Gray Wing rejected, and challenged him to kill him. Clear Sky finally realised that he had gone too far, and announced that the battle was over. He met the spirit cats, and Storm asked him to stop bossing other cats around. He agreed, and rebuilt the brotherhood with Gray Wing. He then returned to his territory.\n\n== The Sisters ==\n'''The Sisters''' are a small group of nomadic she-cats who are descended from a single kittypet family. As such, they retain much of the physical appearances as their ancestors; notably having long, thick, and sleek fur, as well as being large and well-muscled. They are much larger and stronger than the average Clan cat, even more so than Bramblestar, who has long been regarded as one of the largest and strongest cats in the Clans.\n\nAs their name implies, the Sisters are a primarily all-female group; they exile their male kits once they are barely old enough to hunt for themselves, because they believe the toms have a deep connection to the land and must wander and protect it, not tied to the Sisters. However, it is also very heavily implied that the Sisters have a personal dislike for toms (more specifically ones not related to them), as Moonlight states that they prefer to live without toms, and Snow is openly prejudiced against toms. Aside from this questionable and sexist custom, the Sisters are generally peaceful and kind, as they dislike violence (though they are perfectly willing to be aggressive and forceful if they need to be), honour nature, sing to honour the dead, and work together to raise kits. All members of the Sisters and cats descended from them, can communicate with ghost cats.\n\n====Moonlight====\nA huge, broad-shouldered, long-furred, bushy-tailed grey she-cat, '''Moonlight''' was the leader of the Sisters, serving as a major character in ''Squirrelflight's Hope''. Moonlight is a complicated character; on the one hand, she can be peaceful, loyal and kind in the sense that she dislikes violence and prefers to avoid whenever possible, that she is willing to help others and is fiercely devoted to the Sisters and their customs. On the other hand, however, she can be stubborn and wilfull in the sense that she is a little ''too'' set in her ways, allows her pride to influence her decisions, and sometimes disregards what unintended consequences her actions might have.\n\nAt some point in the past, Moonlight had a son named Earth and a currently unnamed daughter. Immediately after Earth succeeded in killing his first mouse, Moonlight abandoned him per the Sisters' custom, taking her daughter with her to parts unknown. Earth subsequently became a loner and renamed himself Tree, but harbored a powerful grudge against his mother for leaving him as soon as he could hunt and for not letting have his own say in choosing his fate.\n\nMany moons later, Moonlight mates with a tom called Jack and becomes pregnant with his kits. She and the Sisters make a camp just beyond the Clans' territories. When Moonlight is about a moon from giving birth, Leafstar and Squirrelflight come in looking for new territory. Distrustful of the Clans, Moonlight and the Sisters take the two captive, intending to let them go only when her kits are born and weaned. However, ThunderClan and SkyClan soon arrive and the Sisters let them go. During the encounter, Moonlight briefly reunites with Tree, but her excitement at seeing her son again turns to surprise and then indifference when he angrily condemns her for abandoning him as a kit.\n\nThe Sisters later get into a fight with a ShadowClan patrol, during which Sunrise nearly dies and Strikestone's hearing is permanently damaged. This causes the majority of the Clans to regard the Sisters as their latest enemy. Despite the rising tension, Moonlight refuses to move her group until her kits are born and weaned. Later, Tree, now the Clans' mediator, reluctantly agrees to attempt to convince Moonlight to leave for the sake of peace. However, the attempt fails due to Moonlight's stubbornness and Tree's grudge against her, resulting in the two parting on bad terms.\n\nEventually, tensions between the Clans grow to a point where they are willing to force out the Sisters, but Moonlight, long overdue for her kits, goes into labor, giving birth to two she-cats and a tom. However, as soon as they are born, she leaves her kits and goes to fight in the battle instigated by the Clans, but is badly injured and later dies, despite the efforts of the medicine cats to save her.\n\n====Snow====\nA large, broad-shouldered, sleek-furred, snowy-white she-cat with blue eyes, '''Snow''' appears to be the most aggressive of the Sisters, as she is especially mistrustful of strangers and is the most openly prejudiced against toms, notably disliking Bramblestar, Thornclaw and Tree simply for being toms.\n\nWhen Leafstar and Squirrelflight are taken captive by the Sisters, Snow is the most hostile to them, and even deliberately wounds Leafstar when she tries to escape. However, she eventually warms up to the two. Later, Snow, Hawk, Tempest and Sunrise track and corner Strikestone and Stonewing to find out why they were on their land. The two toms try to fight them off, and in the ensuing scuffle, Strikestone loses one of his ears and Sunrise is badly injured. Desperate, the Sisters seek help from ThunderClan, which is torn between helping an innocent cat and fueling more fights against the other Clans. Bramblestar eventually and reluctantly agrees to let the medicine cats treat Sunrise. During their stay, Snow voices her dislike of Bramblestar for being a tom, believing he shouldn't be in a position of authority, to which Leafpool and Squirrelflight explain that Bramblestar is their leader and all ThunderClan cats need to follow and respect him.\n\nLater, when Leafstar, Squirrelflight and Tree come to negotiate with Moonlight, Snow again shows her disdain for toms by initially refusing to let Tree into the Sisters' camp, glaring at him and wrinkling her nose in disgust. However, she eventually relents when they assert it is in everyone's best interest.\n\nWhen the Clans attack the Sisters' camp, Snow and the other Sisters stubbornly refuse to leave, and lose the battle. Afterwards, Snow and Tempest thank Squirrelflight for helping them and express doubt that the Clans will find peace, with Snow again showing her bias towards toms by saying they \"never want peace\". Once Moonlight's orphaned kits are weaned, Snow and the other Sisters leave the lake.\n\n====Other members====\n*Sunrise: a long-furred, broad-shouldered yellow she-cat.\n*Tempest: a muscular, broad-shouldered and long-furred tabby she-cat.\n*Furze: a long-furred, ginger she-cat.\n*Flurry: a huge, long-furred ginger-and-white she-cat.\n*Sparrow: a long-furred ginger-and-white she-cat.\n*Hawk: a tortoiseshell she-cat.\n\n==Characters not in other groups==\n\n===''Original Series''===\nThe ''Original'' series covers events in the story from ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' to ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. Many characters mentioned here were introduced in the ''Original'' series, but play minor or significant roles in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series as well.\n\n====Barley====\n\n'''Barley''' is a black-and-white tom that lives in a barn beyond WindClan territory. He is met by [[#Firestar|Firepaw]] while he is on his first journey to the Highstones, a remote region of caves which house the Moonstone, the source of the Clans' connection to StarClan. Barley is a friendly cat and always willing to help cats in need of shelter. He openly accepts [[#Ravenpaw|Ravenpaw]] when he makes his escape from [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]], and the two live a comfortable existence afterward.\n\nBarley comes with Ravenpaw to ThunderClan in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' in order to assist Firestar as he deals with the impending invasion of [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]], when he reveals that he was, in fact, a former member of BloodClan.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> Barley and his littermates were automatically placed under [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge's]] rule at birth, and his two brothers, Ice and Snake, formerly called Jumper and Hoot, soon became fierce enforcers of Scourge's orders. When Barley defied one of the Clan's principal rules in caring for and living with his sister, Violet, Ice and Snake attacked them and left Violet heavily injured. Barley narrowly escaped with Violet and left her in the care of a generous Twoleg, while he left the territory altogether and eventually happened upon the abandoned barn (which revealed by \"Secrets of the Clans\",<ref name=secrets/> he crossed clan territory to get there). He reveals the secret of Scourge's weakness to Firestar: that since Scourge does not believe in StarClan, he only has one life. Barley then fights alongside Firestar and Ravenpaw. The remaining cats of all four Clans against BloodClan.\n\nBarley and Ravenpaw finally assisted the Clans in their exodus by allowing them shelter in ''The New Prophecy'' series. They are presumed to be continuing their peaceful existence, though they are now effectively separated from the Clans due to the immense distance between them.\n\nHowever, in ''Ravenpaw's Farewell'' Ravenpaw dies of [[liver cancer]] in Barley's paws. In ''The Ultimate Guide'' Ravenpaw, now with StarClan, says that Barley will be in Starclan soon. Vicky Hunter has confirmed that Barley is dead.\n\n====Hattie====\n'''Hattie''' is a pretty brown tabby she-cat with amber eyes who now lives in [[#Firestar|Firestar]]'s former Twoleg home. She was shown in Firestar's old Twolegs' garden in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'',<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>  but it was in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' when she was properly introduced as the new kittypet of Firestar's former Twoleg owners when she asked him if he wanted to use her scratching tree. She is a neighbor and friend of [[#Smudge|Smudge]], and has not been mentioned after ''Firestar's Quest''.<ref name=firestar/>\n\n====Princess====\n'''Princess''', a light brown tabby with a distinctive white chest and paws, is [[#Firestar|Firestar]]'s kittypet sister. He initially discovers her garden in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'',<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> and returns regularly to talk with her throughout the ''Original'' series. Princess is enthralled by Firestar's stories of living in the forest, but also worries about him due to his often ragged appearance. Upon learning that her kits are to be given away, she gives one of them to Firestar to take back to [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]]. This kit eventually becomes [[#Mistytail|Cloudtail]], a well-known ThunderClan warrior.\n\n==== Jake ====\n<!-- Jake is not muscular, so please do not say that he is; see Bluestar's Prophecy, pg. 196 -->\nJake is a plump ginger tom. He is [[List of Warriors characters#Firestar|Firestar]]'s father.\nHe is also the father of [[List of Warriors characters#Princess|Princess]] and the grandfather of Cloudtail, [[List of Warriors characters#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and [[List of Warriors characters#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]]. He is the father of [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]], [[List of Warriors characters#Socks|Socks]], and [[List of Warriors characters#Ruby|Ruby]], but they have a different mother, [[List of Warriors characters#Quince|Quince]].\nIn ''Bluestar's Prophecy'', Bluepaw talked to Jake when a squirrel she was chasing went over a twoleg fence.<ref name=bluestar>{{cite book|title=Bluestar's Prophecy|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-158247-9|title-link=Bluestar's Prophecy|date=2009-07-28}}</ref> His mate is Nutmeg. In ''Tallstar's Revenge'', Tallpaw leaves WindClan to find a cat that he thinks killed his father. During this journey, he meets Jake, and Jake helps Tallpaw on his journey.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is a cat who lives in the Twolegplace that Firestar originally came from.  He apparently went to the vet and was never the same since.  Henry is only mentioned in the first book and does not have any real significance in the story.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\nHe was brought to the cutter (vet) and apparently got 'fixed', losing his ability to be a 'real tom'.\n\n====Ravenpaw====\n'''Ravenpaw''' is a sleek, skinny black loner with a tiny white dash on his chest, and a white-tipped tail who lives at the barn with Barley. Ravenpaw has lost his clumsiness, and become more confident while living with Barley. Ravenpaw was originally a ThunderClan apprentice but was forced to leave the clan when he saw Tigerclaw, his mentor, murder the ThunderClan deputy, Redtail. This knowledge put his life in danger. He is happy at Barley's barn; the loner lifestyle suits him better than Clan life.  In Ravenpaw's Farewell, he dies in Barley's paws due to Liver cancer.\n\nRavenpaw has his own manga series, ''[[Warriors (novel series)#Ravenpaw's Path|Ravenpaw's Path]]'', which was released on November 24, 2009.\n\n====Smudge====\n'''Smudge''' is a friendly, contented, plump black and white tom with a narrow face, round amber eyes, black shoulders, a white tail-tip, and a black nose who was [[#Firestar|Firestar]]'s best friend during his kithood. Smudge was upset when Firestar decided to leave Twolegplace and live in the forest, but he accepted his friend's decision. Smudge is very comfortable with his life, and cannot imagine why Firestar wants to live in the forest with a bunch of \"violent ruffians\". Though he misses his friend, he manages to get along well with Firestar's replacement, a she-cat named Hattie.\n\nSmudge's garden sits on the exact location of the ancient camp of [[List of Warriors characters#SkyClan|SkyClan]], and as a result he is fraught with dreams involving the lost Clan's exodus in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar/>  He mistakenly interprets these dreams as a sign that he must live in the forest, as Firestar had done, and goes into the forest to find his friend. He is attacked by a border patrol, but Firestar arrives in time and calls the patrol off. Firestar then spends the night in Smudge's garden to better ascertain the will of SkyClan's elusive leader. Smudge is very relieved to learn that he does not have to live in the forest after all, and wishes his friend luck on his journey.\n\n=== ''The New Prophecy Series'' ===\n''The New Prophecy'' series covers events in the story from ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' to ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''. Many characters here were first mentioned in the ''Original'' series, but had minor or insignificant roles. In addition, as with the ''Original'' series, most characters listed here play minor or significant roles in the following series, ''Power of Three'', as well.\n\n====Midnight====\n'''Midnight''' is an elderly female badger first introduced in ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' of ''The New Prophecy'' series.<ref name=midnight/> The journeying cats are initially quite surprised to discover that Midnight is actually a badger, as most badgers are hostile towards cats and several cats have been killed by them. Midnight reveals the true purpose of their journey by telling them that the forest is going to be destroyed. She later instructs the cats to return home through the mountains, resulting in the death of [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]]. She later returns in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'' to warn [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]] of an impending badger attack.<ref name=twilight>{{cite book|title=Twilight|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082764-9|title-link=Twilight (Warriors)|date=2006-08-22}}</ref>\n\nMidnight is shown to have connections with numerous spiritual entities, including StarClan and the Tribe of Endless Hunting. She is also known to be acquainted with Rock and Sol. Her knowledge of events occurring in the future and distant past is comparable to Rock, who also has near-omniscient knowledge of the cats' universe. She hints that there are many more communities of cats living in Clans and Tribes other than the forest cats, foreshadowing the introduction of the [[List of Warriors characters#The Tribe of Rushing Water|Tribe of Rushing Water]]. Midnight was aware of the Tribe's prophecy regarding Feathertail before she sent the cats to the mountains, effectively sending Feathertail to her death. She appeared in the prologue of Starlight.<ref name=starlight/> She is also capable of speaking and understanding the languages of many other animals, including cat, dog, fox, and rabbit, in addition to her own species' language. Her last appearance is in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''.<ref name=sunset/> She did, however, made two appearances in ''Long Shadows'', one in the prologue, where she is seen talking to the original leaders of the four Clans and then to Rock, and one while talking to Jayfeather in a dream.<ref name=longshadows/>\nWhen Brambleclaw goes to find Midnight in ''Sunrise'', they don't find her.<ref name=sunrise/> Midnight does however, appear to Jayfeather in another dream.\n\n====Cody====\nA sweet, plucky, sleek, heavily furred, and plump brown tabby kittypet and bright blue eyes, '''Cody''' was captured in ''The New Prophecy'' by Twolegs because her collar had been ripped off when she ran away from her housefolk (Twoleg owners), intending only to have a bit of fun before returning home, so the Twolegs mistook her for a wild cat. She became friends with Leafpool while they were held captive and woke her up from her depression. After being rescued by ThunderClan, she stayed for a while to look after Ferncloud's kit, Birchkit. Before the Clans left the forest, Cody is forced to say goodbye to Leafpool, as although she was willing to help the clan in their hour of need, the life of a warrior cat was not for her, since she couldn't stand the blood and dying, and goes home to her owners.\n\n====Sasha====\nA tawny she-cat with bright blue eyes, darker brown-tipped ears, paws, muzzle, and tail with brown brindle stripes on her legs, '''Sasha''' (also called '''Brownie''' by a Twoleg) used to be a kittypet in her early days. But when her housefolk moved due to the death of the wife, Sasha was left on her own, venturing into ShadowClan territory. Her collar was taken off by Pine, another rogue. She caught sight of a patrol of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]], Jaggedtooth and Rowanclaw, calling Tigerstar \"the big handsome tabby.\" He sees her in a tree, but does not tell his Clanmates. The next day, she leaps from her tree to give the frog that slipped out of Rowanclaw's claws to them. Tigerstar and Sasha begin speaking, and they soon meet every night. They have a bump in their relationship when Tigerstar discovers that Sasha is a kittypet, and he despises kittypets because of Firestar and his father, Pinestar, who had left him and his Clan to become a kittypet, so he does not come. But when he saves her from foxes, their relationship grows stronger, and he invites her to join ShadowClan. However, after she learns of his evil plan to rule the forest and kill all cats with \"half-Clan\" blood, she realizes he lied to her all along and rejects his offer.\n\nShe is the mother of [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]] and [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], and another kit, named '''Tadpole'''. She left Hawkfrost and Mothwing in RiverClan because she knew that Clan life wasn't for her, yet she wanted her kits to grow into warriors. Earlier, Tadpole, Hawk (Hawkfrost) and Moth (Mothwing) traveled away from their nest in order to find Ken. They got lost in the Twolegplace and were trapped. Tadpole sacrificed his life in order to save his littermates. The place where they were trapped flooded and Tadpole drowned. She asked them to stay with her in the forest when the Clans were leaving, but they refused. It was revealed in a chat that Sasha is alive, still looking for her housefolk.\n\n====Smoky====\nA muscular grey and white tom, '''Smoky''' lives at the horseplace with Floss and formerly [[#Daisy|Daisy]]. He was first introduced in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]''.<ref name=starlight />  He is the father of Daisy's kits, [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]], [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]], and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]], and (along with the other horseplace cats) refers to humans as 'Nofurs' instead of 'Twolegs'.\nAlthough he is the mate of both Daisy and Floss, Daisy knows that they care more for each other than they do for her. But in ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]'' when he meets Hazeltail, she tells him that Daisy has moved on; Smoky is saddened by this.<ref name=sunrise />\n\n====Floss====\nA small grey-and-white she-cat, '''Floss''' lives at the horseplace with Smoky, her mate. Her kits were all taken by the Twolegs; or as the horseplace cats call them, the Nofurs. Sister to Daisy, and aunt to Berrynose, Mousewhisker, Hazeltail, Toadstep and Rosepetal and great-aunt to Poppyfrost and Berrynose's kits, born at the end of \"The Fourth Apprentice.\"<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Dies between ''The Last Hope'' and ''Bramblestar's storm.''\n\n====Sharptooth====\n'''Sharptooth''' is a huge tawny mountain lion that terrorized the Tribe of Rushing Water when the journeying cats met them. He was introduced in Moonrise, and has not appeared in any other books.<ref name=moonrise/> Feathertail met her end driving a spike of rock into him, successfully killing him and fulfilling the prophecy that said: \"A silver cat, not from this Tribe, will rid us of Sharptooth once and for all\".\n\n===''Power of Three Series''===\nThe ''Power of Three'' series covers events in the story from ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' to ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]''.\n\n==== Brightspirit ====\nBrightspirit is a deceased, very young, beautiful silver tabby she-cat with dazzling green eyes mentioned in ''Long Shadows''.<ref name=longshadows />  She was created in memory of 10-year-old ''Warriors'' fan Emmy Grace Cherry, who died when a tornado struck her house in Russellville, Arkansas.\n\nWhen ThunderClan was low on catmint she appeared in Jayfeather's dream and told him that catmint was where \"wind was\". After thinking about it, Jayfeather realized that it was in WindClan.\n\n====Flick====\nA skinny light brown tom with large pointed ears, '''Flick''' is one of the intruders invading the territory of the Tribe of Rushing Water in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\">Hunter, Erin. (2008) ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''. 352pp.</ref>\n\n====Flora====\nA dark brown-and-white she-cat with green eyes, '''Flora''' is one of the intruders invading the territory of the Tribe of Rushing Water in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\n\n====Sol====\n'''Sol''' is a tall, stocky, long-furred dark brown and bright tortoiseshell loner with pale yellow eyes, a face that tapers at the muzzle, a curving tail bushed at the tip, and large wide-spaced ears. He is a mysterious character introduced in ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]''.<ref name=eclipse/> He has knowledge of all four Clans (given to him by Midnight), despite none of them ever having seen him before. Sol predicts the forthcoming [[Solar eclipse|eclipse of the sun]], an act that appears to be the beginnings of his attempt to convince the Clans that StarClan are not all-powerful. He later convinces [[#Blackstar|Blackstar]], who has already begun to lose faith in StarClan, to renounce his faith altogether and not allow his Clan to attend Gatherings.\n\nSol's character is, for the moment, ambiguous. He is polite, but not friendly. An attempt by [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] to scan his mind results in a whirlwind of thoughts ranging locations far beyond any of the Clan territories, implying that this cat knows far more about the Clans' universe than he cares to reveal. He is also aware of the prophecy concerning Jayfeather, [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] and [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]]. Sol plays a large part in ''Long Shadows''; his face is on the cover and in the excerpt he is seen attempting to convince the Clans to renounce faith in StarClan. It is mentioned in ''Long Shadows'' that [[#Midnight|Midnight]] told Sol all about StarClan and the four Clans, for a reason she will not disclose.<ref name=longshadows />  Also, Hollyleaf has a nightmare in which she sees Sol blotting out the moon and her Clanmates crying out in fear. It is perhaps a sign that Sol will destroy all the Clans. In ''Long Shadows'', when Hollyleaf runs into Sol on the lakeshore, he heads towards WindClan's territory where Ashfur's body is later found.<ref name=longshadows />  Some people suspected him to be Ashfur's murderer rather than [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], but Sol does not appear to have a motive. Additionally, when Jayfeather read Squirrelflight's mind following Ashfur's murder, she was afraid, seeming to confirm that she killed Ashfur, not Sol. But in the prologue of ''Sunrise'', as Leafpool is examining Ashfur's body, she finds a tuft of black fur carrying Hollyleaf's scent, identifying Hollyleaf as the real killer.<ref name=sunrise />  However, the rest of the Clan does not know this, so Ashfoot, the WindClan deputy, reveals to Brambleclaw that she saw Sol near where Ashfur's body was found. Upon hearing this, [[#Firestar|Firestar]] sent a patrol consisting of Brambleclaw, Brackenfur, Birchfall, Hazeltail, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. They search a large Twolegplace near the sun-drown-place and find a group of cats that Sol convinced to fight a pack of wild dogs that were threatening their home. After hearing the horrific story of their defeat, the new leader, Jingo, leads them to Purdy as Sol is staying with him. They find him and take him to the ThunderClan camp to be questioned by Firestar, with Purdy tagging along, becoming a ThunderClan elder. After being interrogated by Firestar, Sol is kept as a prisoner, but escapes when he lures Lionblaze to help him out by telling him he knows who his real father is. When the rest of the Clan finds out, it is rather a relief, because the other Clans were threatening Firestar, as they were nervous at the fact that someone like Sol was among them. Therefore, Firestar just told the other Clans that he banished Sol.\n\nIn ''The Forgotten Warrior'', Lionblaze finds Sol in the tunnels while trying to discover if Hollyleaf is dead or not. Sol goes to the ThunderClan camp and lies to the Clan, telling them that he saves Cherrypaw and Molepaw from a fox (Hollyleaf is the one that saves them). Berrynose, Poppyfrost, and the younger cats accept him. The older cats do not trust him but, Firestar allows Sol to stay with them. Dovewing and Ivypool do not trust him and while in the tunnels, hear him plotting with some WindClan cats, planning to attack ThunderClan through the tunnels. Dovewing and Ivypool are almost caught by WindClan, but a cat saves them and reveals herself to be Hollyleaf. Lionblaze brings Hollyleaf to camp and she reveals that she is the one who saved Cherrypaw and Molepaw from the fox. Many cats, including Berrynose and Poppyfrost, grow furious with Sol and discover he has not returned to camp for a few days. Hollyleaf trains the cats in underground fighting, and with the training they defeat WindClan. Hollyleaf pins down Sol and tells him to never return and that if he does, she will kill him herself.\n\nSol is also a main character in the ''SkyClan and the Stranger'' manga series, which takes place long before his first appearance. He joins [[#Skyclan|SkyClan]], revealing that Sol does not know the Clans just because Midnight told him about them. Although he is desperate to become a warrior and tries to fit in with his new Clanmates, Sol quickly proves himself to be self-centred, lazy when it comes to duties and completely unconcerned about the potential consequences of his actions. This is shown when he steals food from some [[fox]]es that live nearby, inadvertently leading them to the Clan's camp, which makes [[#Leafstar|Leafstar]], the leader of SkyClan, angry with him. In an attempt to impress her, Sol steals Leafstar's three very young kits and hides them far away from the gorge so that he can play a heroic role in finding them. However, his plot is discovered and, in a rage, Leafstar exiles Sol from SkyClan, telling him that he can never be a true warrior because he is selfish and has no understanding of the Warrior Code at all. Sol leaves, cursing the Clans for their \"foolishness\".\n\n====Stripes====\nA large silver tabby tom with dark stripes and amber eyes, '''Stripes''' is the leader of the intruders invading the territory of the Tribe of Rushing Water in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  He is shown as a mocking, cruel and amoral cat, leading the intruders by no code of honor other than a life-or-death policy similar to BloodClan. At the end of the book, he and the other intruders are defeated in battle by the Clan cats and the Tribe, and surrenders, promising to leave the Tribe alone and to respect their borders.\n\n====Twist====\nA young tortoiseshell she-cat with white stripes on her face, '''Twist''' is one of the intruders invading the territory of the Tribe of Rushing Water in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  It is noted by [[#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]] that she is of apprentice age, and if she had been a Clan cat, they might have been friends.\nOn a side note, during a Wands and Worlds chat, one fan asked if Twist would make another appearance.<ref name=authorchat5 />  This was followed by Erin Hunter asking who Twist was. Therefore, it is assumed that Twist will not appear again.\n\n====Jingo====\nA dark brown tabby she-cat with the tip of her tail missing, '''Jingo''' is the leader that is trying to keep the band of Twolegplace cats together after Sol's dark leadership, introduced in ''Sunrise''.<ref name=sunrise />  When the wild dogs were chasing the ThunderClan cats, she found them and led them to safety in her abandoned Twoleg nest, and she led them back to were [[#Purdy|Purdy]] lives. Sol convinced Jingo to leave her housefolk and join his new Twolegplace \"Clan\", and she decided that it sounded exciting, and she told her neighbor, [[#Flower|Flower]], about this, too. Unfortunately, Flower was killed by the wild dogs while on a hunting mission.\n\nWhen Sol was leader of the Twolegplace cats, he acted like their king, always asking them to bring him food, but never hunting himself. After Flower was killed, he devised a plan to show the dogs whose territory the nest was. He made it sound as if there was no other choice, and [[#Pepper & Jet|Pepper]], [[#Jester & Frosty|Jester]], and [[#Jester & Frosty|Frosty]] were killed as a result of his bad judgment, and all the cats had wounds, except for Sol, because he didn't raise a paw to help his own cats. After the battle, Sol refused to take responsibility for his mistake and Jingo asked him to leave.\n\nJingo is obviously a very emotionally strong character, as she had to deal with guilt from inviting Flower to join Sol, only for her to be killed. She also has to keep the shattered group together, and Lionblaze and Brambleclaw are impressed by this personality trait. Brambleclaw, as she is going back to the abandoned Twoleg nest, says, too softly for her to hear, \"Goodbye, Jingostar. May StarClan light your path.\" This shows that he thinks she is as noble as a Clan leader.\n\n====Hussar====\nA broad-shouldered grey tom, '''Hussar''' has a long scar on his side from the fight with the wild dogs. He joined the Twolegplace \"Clan\" with [[#Jingo|Jingo]], so they may be very good friends. Hussar is probably the strongest of the group, and therefore he acts as deputy to Jingo. He is rather calm, despite his size and strength, but shows an uncharacteristic hatred for [[#Sol|Sol]].\n\n====Speckle====\nA flecked brown she-cat, '''Speckle''' is nursing four kits, one of which is named '''Frisk'''. Her mate left when the wild dogs started to terrorize the lone cats in the abandoned Twoleg nest, but she is now in love with Sol, as she said she \"wanted them [the kits] to be Sol's\" and she would be \"very glad to see him.\" She also defends Sol's reputation when they are discussing him with the Clan cats. She seems very protective of her kits and extremely suspicious of the Clan cats, perhaps because she knows they are looking for Sol, and when they find him it won't be for a friendly visit.\n\n====Fritz====\n'''Fritz''' is a small black and white tom with a torn ear from the dog fight. He is a very jumpy, soft-spoken cat. He is evidently friends with [[#Jingo|Jingo]], or possibly mates, because he was comforting her when the subject of [[#Flower|Flower]] came up, and vice versa when Fritz was scared. He was the first to meet the ThunderClan cats, near the edges of the Twolegplace, and tipped them off that [[#Sol|Sol]] was nearby when he said, obviously scared to death of the Clan cats, \"That's what ''he'' said! And look what happened!\" They assumed that he was talking about Sol. In the battle with so-called \"BloodClan,\" Fritz was '''kidnapped''' by BloodClan and ThunderClan attacks BloodClan to stop BloodClan from launching raids and stealing fresh-kill from ThunderClan after Mitzi, Fritz's mother requests them.\n\n====Pod====\nA scrawny brown tom with a scarred, grey muzzle, '''Pod''' is rather skittish, but he is very talkative and is not afraid to speak his mind, as opposed to [[#Fritz|Fritz]]. He complains quite a lot, and often insults things he hates, such as the dogs or Sol. It seems he has a grudge against Sol for acting as a leader among the Twolegplace cats, while he and his \"Clanmates\" went hungry and had to train nonstop for the fight against the dogs. Pod was one of the first to come to Sol's abandoned Twoleg nest, along with Fritz and [[#Speckle|Speckle]].\n\n====Merry & Chirp====\n'''Merry''' is a ginger and white she-cat with green eyes, while '''Chirp''' is a pale grey tabby tom. They are the last of the Twolegplace cats to meet the ThunderClan patrol. Their appearance triggered all of the Twolegplace cats into hiding, thinking they were the dogs. When they arrive, Merry leaves soon after, muttering, \"These cats are just like Sol.\" This signals she probably dislikes strangers, like everybody else in the abandoned Twoleg nest after [[#Sol|Sol]]'s leadership. But Chirp stays near the door. As he listens to the discussion, he gives the Clan cats very valuable information: there are rumors that Sol is back, and he is living with [[#Purdy|Purdy]].\n\n====Flower====\n'''Flower''' was a beautiful young she-cat killed by the wild dogs. She was a former kittypet, and was [[#Jingo|Jingo]]'s neighbor. Jingo convinced her to come with her to the abandoned Twoleg nest. Her death caused [[#Sol|Sol]] to create a plan to fight the wild dogs, resulting in more deaths. Jingo misses Flower and feels guilty about bringing her here to her death.\n\n====Pepper & Jet====\n'''Jet''' is a long-furred black tom, and '''Pepper''' is his littermate. Pepper was chosen by [[#Sol|Sol]] to lead the dogs to the unused monster's den. But he never made it; the dogs outran him and killed him, then played with his body. After the battle, Sol walked in and asked Jet to bring him some food, and Jet would have killed Sol if [[#Hussar|Hussar]] had not held him back. Jet walked in while the Clan cats and the Twolegplace cats were discussing Sol, and he showed extreme anger towards Sol, saying to [[#Jingo|Jingo]], \"It's not okay. It'll never be okay. I don't want to ''think'' about that cat ever again!\"\n\n====Jester & Frosty====\n'''Jester''' and '''Frosty''' were the two cats that died as a result of [[#Sol|Sol]]'s plan to fight the dogs. Jester was a tom that was so seriously wounded, he died from his injuries in the abandoned Twoleg nest. Frosty was a she-cat that was ripped to pieces by the dogs.\n\n====Oscar====\nOscar is a kittypet that Firestar meets while searching for cats who would be willing to join the new SkyClan. He is very grouchy and thinks that everything Firestar tells him is complete nonsense, and refuses to join. He is described as a muscular black tom with green eyes.\n\n====Stick, Cora, Coal, Snowy, and Shorty====\nThese five cats meet Firestar when he is traveling to rebuild SkyClan, and is separated from Sandstorm.  Stick is a brown tom with yellow eyes and a torn ear, Cora is a black she cat with a ripped ear, Coal is a black tom with amber eyes and a long coat, Snowy is a pretty white she cat with bright blue eyes, and Shorty is a brown tabby tom with a stub for a tail and amber eyes.  Shorty saves Sandstorm from some Twoleg kits, and then shows Firestar which way she went. In ''Dawn'', there is a cat whose name is Coal in a twoleg nest,<ref name=dawn/> who may be the same Coal that was mentioned in ''Firestar's Quest''. They are also seen in ''SkyClan's Destiny'' where they join SkyClan for a while.<ref name=skyclan>{{cite book|title=SkyClan's Destiny|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-169994-8|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780061699962}}</ref> They leave after SkyClan helps them in the battle with Dodge, Stick's greatest enemy. During this battle, Stick's daughter Red was killed. Red's mother was Velvet, Stick's former mate.\n\n===''A Vision of Shadows Series''===\n====Darktail====\n'''Darktail''', a large, muscular, glossy white tom with blue eyes, black spots, and a long black tail, hence his name, is the main antagonist of the first three books of the story arc ''A Vision of Shadows'', as well as the super edition ''Hawkwing's Journey''.\n\nDarktail is later to be the biological son of Onestar, the leader of WindClan. According to Onestar, Darktail was born as the result of his forbidden relationship with Smoke, a beautiful, pampered kittypet while he was still known as Onewhisker back in the Clans' old forest territories. While still heavily pregnant, Smoke wanted to join WindClan so that her kittens could be brought up as warriors (Onewhisker having never told her the harsher side of the Warrior life). Onewhisker refused, partly because it wasn't the life for her and partly because he knew the fact that he'd mated with a kittypet would ruin his reputation. The only one of her litter to survive was Darktail, and Onewhisker refused to let his son join WindClan for the same reason as his mother. Enraged at this double rejection, Smoke vowed to Onewhisker that she would raise their son to hate his father, the Clans and their way of life.\n\nWhat happened to Darktail afterwards is unknown, as a very long period of time (several years at least) passed between his father's rejection and when he reappeared next. However, apparently his father's rejection and his mother's teachings had a dramatically negative effect on his personality; he grew into a cold and bitter cat with cruelty and vengeance. By the time Darktail resurfaces, he has become the leader of a large group of rogue cats that attempt to copy the Clans' way of life, but are without honor, mercy or compassion. He seeks to hunt down the Warrior Clans and destroy them for rejecting him all those years ago. He and his group join SkyClan, the long-lost fifth Clan, but later betray them and drive them away.\n\nNot long afterwards, Alderpaw and his friends come searching for SkyClan, but come across Darktail and his group instead. They are fooled into believing Darktail and his rogue ''are'' SkyClan, but they eventually find out the truth and escape. Darktail and his group secretly follow them to the Clans' territories.\n\nDarktail and his group eventually manage to take over ShadowClan's territory, with many of its cats choosing to join their group, as they are fed up with Roawnstar for being a \"weak leader\". Darktail dubs his group 'The Kin\", although the title has no real meaning to it. He drowns any cat who tries to leave the group. At one point, Onewhisker, now Onestar and leader of WindClan and with the other Clans launches a full-scale attack on Darktail and his rogues. During the battle, Onestar personally fights Darktail and comes very close to killing him, but before he can do so, Darktail whispers in his ear that \"surely a cat who rejected and then killed his own son would end up in the Dark Forest\". Frightened by this, Onestar orders his Clan to retreat. This costs the Clans the battle and leads to the deaths of several cats, and many others being severely wounded. Shortly afterwards, Darktail takes over RiverClan's territory. When the battle ends, Darktail dishonourably refuses to allow RiverClan to take their wounded Clanmates for treatment or to take their dead for burial, instead taking the wounded as prisoners and leaving the dead in the sun like \"carrion.\" Darktail sadistically tortures the RiverClan prisoners by starving them and leaving their wounds to fester, and humiliates them by forcing them to swear an oath of loyalty to the Kin.\n\nHowever, the captured cats eventually break free and many of the former ShadowClan warriors rebel, forcing the Kin to flee the RiverClan camp. Later, SkyClan reappears and all five Clans take on Darktail's group. Most of Darktail's rogues flee and a now fully determined Onestar takes on his evil son. Onestar eventually drives Darktail into the lake, where their battle takes them further and further out until both of them sink under and neither resurface.\n\n====Nettle====\nA brown tabby tom with long, spiky fur, '''Nettle''' is an exceptionally cruel and sadistic member of Darktail's group. He is the closest the rogues have to a medicine cat, but only knows a few herbs. He tried them all on sick cats, but nothing made them any better. He is also a vicious fighter.\n\nSometime after Darktail's death, Nettle steals the two kits given birth to by his former mate Yarrowleaf, who was born in ShadowClan, as part of Sleekwhisker's plot to kill Rowanclaw. He is stopped and killed by Rowanclaw, though the later dies in the process.\n\n====Raven====\n'''Raven''' is a long-furred, black she-cat and a senior member of Darktail's group. She believes strongly in Darktail's brutal ways.\n\n====Rain====\nA big, long-furred gray tom with a single green eye and a bushy tail, '''Rain''' is originally a temporary member of SkyClan, but later betrays them and joins Darktail's group. He acts as a second-in-command of sorts to Darktail, but later grows frustrated with his leader and tries to murder him, but Darktail kills him.\n\n====Sleekwhisker====\nA sleek, golden-yellow she-cat with green eyes, '''Sleekwhisker''' is the daughter of Dawnpelt and Crowfrost of ShadowClan, and the sister to Juniperclaw and Strikestone, also making her the granddaughter of Rowanclaw and Tawnypelt. She is mentored by her uncle, Tigerheart, and it is apparent that she does not believe in StarClan when she was observed by Alderheart, then Alderpaw, at a Gathering when he first met her and Needlepaw.\n\nSleekwhisker follows Needlepaw, Juniperpaw, and Violetkit to join Darktail and his rogues, leaving her parents and other brother Strikepaw in ShadowClan.\nShe has given herself a warrior name, Sleekwhisker. She taunts Needletail for training Violetpaw and says they are rogues now, not Clan cats, and that she can learn to hunt and fight on her own like rogues do. It becomes apparent she does not like or favor Violetpaw. This shows more as Darktail favors Violetpaw more. Once Darktail and his rogues go to ShadowClan and force out Rowanstar out of leadership, she follows suite as does Needletail, Juniperclaw, and some other ShadowClan cats such as Spikefur and Mistcloud. She asks Dawnpelt, her mother, if she is glad to see her and Juniperclaw as herself, Juniperclaw, and Strikestone since Crowfrost, her father, had died of Yellowcough. Dawnpelt reluctantly agrees with her, saying that she can't leave every one of her kits, and ShadowClan is the only home she ever knew and can't leave it. Sleekwhisker, satisfied with her answer, stays in the newly formed Kin.\n\nSleekwhisker is noted to be one of Darktail's most loyal followers after he takes over ShadowClan and merge the remaining ShadowClan cats and his rogues and form what he has called the Kin. She supports every decision he has made and is deeply suspicious of Violetpaw. She begins to become suspicious of Needletail as well, after Rain had died in the claws of Darktail for betraying him. When Dawnpelt realizes that it was a mistake to stay with the Kin, she tells Violetpaw that she is going to leave and already has sent Juniperclaw and Strikestone to seek for ThunderClan. Dawnpelt tells Violetpaw that Sleekwhisker would never want to leave the Kin and hasn't even asked her about leaving. When Dawnpelt mysteriously disappears, Sleekwhisker shows no emotions about her mother's absence and doesn't seem to care about it either, unlike her brothers who show extreme concern over their missing mother.\n\nWhile the former ShadowClan cats soon realize that Darktail is a cruel and dishonorable cat, Sleekwhisker still remains by his side and agrees with practically every word he says. She tells Darktail that she is Kin now, through and through, and hasn't considered herself a ShadowClan cat in a long time. She shows no remorse when Violetpaw's plan to feed Darktail and his followers poppy seeds has failed, and Violetpaw is to be punished. The punishment is for Darktail to drown Needletail, to show Violetpaw what it's like for the only cat she cared about gone. Once a weak and starved Needletail turns on Darktail, herself, Roach, and Raven, she attacks Needletail along with Roach and Darktail. Sleekwhisker helps drown Needletail in the end by the lake and shows no remorse in murdering her childhood friend, showing her complete devotion to Darktail.\n\nOnce the Kin has been driven out by the other Clans, she runs away with what is left of the Kin; Yarrowleaf and Spikefur follow suit. It is noted by Rowanstar that Sleekwhisker ran off with the Kin, and he declares her and the others traitors. She is missed by Juniperclaw and Strikestone, who wonder where she has gone. The spirits of the cats who drowned in the lake reveal that Sleekwhisker, along with the ShadowClan cats who had not returned, are likely still alive.\n\nSleekwhisker and a heavily pregnant Yarrowleaf later stay in ShadowClan's former camp. Violetshine, Tree, and Sandynose find them, and are surprised and angry to see them. Violetshine notes that Sleekwhisker helped murder Needletail, and that Yarrowleaf showed no remorse in attacking her former Clanmates. Sleekwhisker tells them that Spikefur had died of the sickness as they couldn't find the right herbs to treat him with, and no one else helped. Upon arriving, Strikestone and Juniperclaw greet her warmly, and Sleekwhisker and Yarrowleaf beg Leafstar for them to join SkyClan and appear sad once they find out that ShadowClan is no more. They get turned away, however, on account of their past crimes, but are hidden by Whorlpaw, Juniperclaw, Strikestone, Snowbird, and Scorchfur. Once Tree has found a solution to let them stay, Leafstar finally agrees, albeit reluctantly. Tawnypelt also shows hatred for them, calling them traitors; on the other hand, Rowanstar, now Rowanclaw, forgives them. Juniperclaw supports his sister, claiming that many former ShadowClan cats followed Darktail, himself being one, and asks if Leafstar doesn't believe a cat can change.\n\nNow an apprentice once again in SkyClan, Sleekwhisker is later revealed to have betrayed her brothers, who went behind Leafstar's back to get her a place to stay, as well as Yarrowleaf, who relied on Sleekwhisker during her pregnancy and had thought the two she-cats were friends. She has secretly teamed up with two troublesome kittypets, Susan and Jacques, to help with a plan to get \"revenge\" on Rowanclaw, blaming him for everything that went wrong in her life. Sleekwhisker drugs Yarrowleaf with poppy seeds and steals her kits, Hopkit and Flaxkit, to use as hostages. She also teams up with Nettle and Raven to capture Tawnypelt, intending to murder her right in front of Rowanclaw, as she is the cat he loves most and the one thing he has left. However, Rowanclaw, Macgyver, Yarrowleaf, and Violetshine manage to rescue Tawnypelt, retrieve the stolen kits and defeat Sleekwhisker and the others. She and Nettle take down Rowanclaw by fatally wounding him, though Rowanclaw manages to kill Nettle in the process. Violetshine and the others help drive Sleekwhisker and the other rogues and kittypets away, telling them to never return, as they have betrayed the Clans too many times.\n\n====Smoke====\n'''Smoke''' is a kittypet who never appears, but rather is mentioned and described. She is the former lover and mate of Onestar, and mother of the Darktail. She is described by Onestar as a beautiful she-cat with soft grey fur, and brilliant blue eyes like \"pools of pure water\".\n\nAccording to Onestar, he and Smoke met and fell in love in a Twolegplace when he was known as Onewhisker back in the Clans' old territories. Onewhisker won Smoke's affection by telling her exaggerated stories of Clan life (leaving out the harsher aspects), while Smoke's unique beauty won her Onewhisker's affection. Eventually, Smoke becomes pregnant with Onewhisker's kits, and went to find him on WindClan territory, luckily coming across him while he was out hunting alone. She asked to join WindClan, so that her kits could become warriors. Onewhisker denied Smoke's request, partly because life in the wild wasn't for her (as she was \"soft and delicate\") and partly because he knew he'd be in terrible trouble for mating with a kittypet, as mating with non-Clan cats was forbidden by the Warrior Code. Smoke argued with Onewhisker for a while, but eventually left. However, while she was still on her way home, she went into labor, and because she had no help, only one of her kits survived. That kit was Darktail. Smoke and her son then went back to Smoke's owners, but only for a short while. As soon as Darktail was old enough to leave her, Smoke brought him to his father, begging for him to let his son join WindClan, while he was still young enough to learn about the Warrior Code. Onewhisker, however, rejected his son for the same reason he'd rejected Smoke; partly because he knew the fact that he'd sired a kit with a kittypet would ruin his reputation and partly because he feared Darktail would not be able to survive being a Clan cat. Smoke was infuriated by this double rejection and turned on Onewhisker, raging that she would raise their son alone and teach him to hate the Clans who rejected him. Smoke evidently went through with this, as Darktail grew into a cold and brutal cat with a single purpose: to destroy the Warrior Clans.\n\n===''The Rise of Scourge''===\n\n====Socks====\nThe brother of [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]] and Ruby and the son of Quince, '''Socks''' is a black tom with a white muzzle, tail tip, and paws. He, along with Ruby, tormented their younger brother Tiny into running away from home in ''The Rise of Scourge''.<ref name=\"Rise of Scourge\"/> However, he seems to have a less vicious personality than his sister.\nLater in the book, Socks and Ruby appear before Tiny, now Scourge, abandoned by their Twolegs and desperate for food and shelter.\nAfter a vengeful speech in which Scourge states that he no longer thinks of them as family, and indeed, doesn't think of family at all, he allows them to eat, but afterwards, he exiles them both. It was revealed in a Wands and Worlds chat with Erin Hunter on August 16, 2008,<ref name=authorchat5>{{cite web |url=http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784 |title=Erin Hunter chat #5 transcript - August 16, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203132110/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784 |archivedate=2009-02-03 }}</ref> that Socks and Ruby are still alive.\n\n====Ruby====\nScourge's sister, '''Ruby''', along with her brother Socks, taunted and scared their brother Tiny enough so that he ran away from his Twoleg nest, by saying that Tiny was going to be thrown in the river because he \"wasn't wanted.\" She and Socks were later adopted by housefolk, but were abandoned when they moved away. They came to Tiny (now Scourge), begging for assistance, but were soon turned away. It was revealed in a Wands and Worlds chat with Erin Hunter that they are still alive.<ref name=authorchat5 />  She is described as a light grey she-cat.\n\n====Quince====\nScourge's mother, '''Quince''' had one litter: Ruby, Socks, and Tiny (later Scourge). It is revealed in a Wands and Worlds chat with Erin Hunter that she is still alive, but is quite old.<ref name=authorchat5 />  She mated with [[ThunderClan#Firestar|Firestar]]'s father, although she is not his mother. She is described as a dark grey she-cat with a red collar and amber eyes.\n\n===''Graystripe's Adventure Trilogy''===\n\n====Diesel====\nA light brown tabby tom with black zig-zag stripes and a white chest, paws, and muzzle, '''Diesel''' befriended Graystripe and Millie at a truck stop in ''[[Warrior's Return]]''.<ref name=warrior's>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Warrior's Return|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-06-147867-3|title-link=Warrior's Return}}</ref> When he met the duo, he offered them food and shelter. Millie accepted, while Greystripe was reluctant but was forced to accept the offer when shortly afterwards, Greystripe was hit by a car. Diesel suggested they get to the sun-drown-place by hitching a ride on a truck. Diesel is a very wise cat, but he wasn't always like tat\n\n====Duke====\nA huge, black-and-white tom with a spiked collar and nicks in his ears, '''Duke''' was first introduced in ''[[The Lost Warrior (Warriors)|The Lost Warrior]]''.<ref name=lostwarrior>{{cite book|title=The Lost Warrior|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-1-4352-0944-2|title-link=The Lost Warrior (Warriors)|date=September 2007}}</ref> One of the house cats in the surrounding Twolegplace where Greystripe lives for a while with the Twoleg family, he is leader of a small gang of hostile kittypets. It is said that \"no one defeats Duke\", as he is a vicious fighter. Graystripe, weakened from his stay with the Twolegs, is defeated by him once, but later Duke and his two cronies are defeated through the combined efforts of a strengthened Graystripe and newly trained Millie. Ironically, as Duke leaves in shame, he hypocritically calls Graystripe 'savage', but Graystripe, remembering what it means to be a warrior, does not listen to him, and walks proudly away with his 'apprentice', Millie.\n\n====Husker====\nA long-haired dark grey tom with a lighter grey muzzle and a tuft of lighter grey fur on the top of his head, '''Husker''' is a patriarch of sorts of the family of barn cats Graystripe and Millie discovers in ''[[Warrior's Refuge (Warriors)|Warrior's Refuge]]''.<ref name=warrior's /> He is the mate of Moss and the father of Birdy, Pad, Raindrop, and Little Mew. He offers shelter to Millie and Graystripe after Millie's eyes are injured in the cornfield close to the barn where he and his family live. He explains that he and his family used to live with a family of kind, elderly Twolegs, but when they died, a new Twoleg family moved in and chased the cats away. He is seen playing with the Twolegs after Graystripe and Millie earn the Twolegs' gratitude for saving one of the Twoleg kits and lead them to the barn to meet the barn cats. It is assumed Husker becomes one of the Twolegs' kittypets afterward, as well as the rest of the family.\n\n====Moss====\nA slender black she-cat, '''Moss''' is the mate of Husker and the sister of Splash, as well as the mother of Birdy, Raindrop, Pad, and Little Mew. She is first introduced, along with the other barn cats, in ''[[Warrior's Refuge (Warriors)|Warrior's Refuge]]'', and convinces Husker to let Graystripe and Millie shelter in the barn after Millie's eyes are injured from the cornfield.<ref name=warrior's/>  Due to Graystripe and Millie's saving one of the Twoleg kits, Moss and the rest of her family are accepted by the Two Legs in the end of the novel, and it is assumed that they have become their new kittypets.\n\n====Splash====\nA young black-and-white tom, '''Splash''' is the brother of Moss and is one of the barn cats in ''[[Warrior's Refuge (Warriors)|Warrior's Refuge]]''.<ref name=warrior's/>  He maintains a minor role throughout the novel, and in the end is accepted by the Two Legs who were previously hostile to them. It is assumed that he and the rest of the barn cats have become their new kittypets.\n\n===''Tigerstar and Sasha's Trilogy''===\n\n====Patch====\n'''Patch''' is a black-and-white kitten who was first introduced in ''Escape From the Forest''.<ref name=\"escape from forest\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Escape from the Forest|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-06-154793-5|title-link=Escape from the Forest}}</ref> He would have drowned in the river if it hadn't been for Sasha alerting the captain of the boat in the river at that time. Over time, the captain started to grow fond of Patch. As the river froze, the captain was loading up a truck, but Sasha wouldn't get in, saying that she had to stay and told Patch to \"take care of the captain.\" The captain said his goodbyes to Sasha, understanding she \"was a wanderer,\" and left with Patch.\n\n====Pine====\nA battle-scarred, pale tom with dark markings running across his back, '''Pine''' is a loner outside the forest and befriended Sasha in her early days as a loner. He was first introduced in ''Into the Woods'', the first novel in the ''Tigerstar and Sasha'' trilogy.<ref name=\"into the woods\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Into the Woods (Warriors)|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-06-154792-8|title-link=Into the Woods (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\n====Tadpole====\nTadpole is a black tomkit, a son  of Tigerstar and Sasha. He drowns in a Twoleg den.\n\n===''Ravenpaw's Path''===\n\n====Violet====\n'''Violet''' is Barley's sister, a cat originally mentioned in ''[[Secrets of the Clans]]''. In the field guide, Violet is almost killed by Barley's (and therefore also her own) brothers Ice and Snake (born Jumper and Hoot), but Barley takes her to live with Fuzz, a kittypet. Violet is described as being a \"tiny cat, pale orange with thin darker orange stripes\" as well as with white paws.<ref name=secrets/>{{rp|138}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Warriors (Erin Hunter)}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Warriors'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Warriors characters}}\n[[Category:Warriors (novel series)|Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in children's literature]]\n[[Category:Lists of fictional animals by work]]\n[[Category:Lists of fictional animals in literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{for|characters in the American crime-related media franchise|List of The Warriors characters}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Very long|date=May 2015}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=October 2019}}\n}}\nThe ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' novel series is written by [[Erin Hunter]]. Due to the large number of characters present in the novel series, this list is divided by Clan, e.g., all characters in [[#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]] (as of The Silent Thaw) are put together in the allegiances list.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Naming convention==\nIn [[#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]], [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]], [[#WindClan|WindClan]], [[#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]], and [[#SkyClan|SkyClan]], each cat's name has a prefix (Dawn, Bramble, Lion, Crow, and so on).  As a kit they will have \"-kit\" at the end of their name. E.g. Dawnkit, Bramblekit, Lionkit, Crowkit. When they are an apprentice \"-paw\" will be at the end of their name (Dawnpaw, Bramblepaw, Lionpaw, Crowpaw, and so on). When that cat is made a warrior or medicine cat, the suffix to their name will be changed (Dawnpelt, Brambleclaw, Lionblaze, Crowfeather, and so on). If a cat ever becomes a leader, they will be granted the suffix -star at the end of their name. (Dawnstar, Bramblestar, Lionstar, Crowstar, and so on).\n\nIn The Tribe of Rushing Water, cat's names have no set prefixes or suffixes. A cat's mother will name her kitten after the first memorable thing the mother sees after giving birth (for example, \"Brook Where Small Fish Swim\" and \"Night of No Stars\").\n\n==ThunderClan==\n==ThunderClan==\nThunderClan is named after its first leader and founder, Thunder, and is the main Clan of the ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' series, as all the series' (except the series Dawn Of The Clans) protagonists are ThunderClan cats. During the original series, ThunderClan resides in the forest, sandwiched between [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] and [[#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]] on each side. They share very little territory borders with [[#WindClan|WindClan]], and as such most of the trouble ThunderClan is forced to deal with originates either from RiverClan or ShadowClan (mostly ShadowClan). ThunderClan cats are accustomed to stalking through the thick underbrush of the forest, and are the sole users of the \"hunter's crouch\", a stalking technique used to hunt most forest-born prey in which a cat crouches down, stores energy in  hind legs, and springs onto the target. Their main diet includes mice, voles, squirrels, rabbits, thrushes, magpies, birds, and shrews. Sometimes a warrior will have to eat a rat or Twoleg food.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nThunderClan, along with the other Clans, undergoes a dramatic shift in territory during the course of the ''New Prophecy'' series. During the time that Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw and the others are on their journey, much of ThunderClan's territory is destroyed as the Twolegs proceed with their deforestation of the area.<ref name=moonrise/>{{rp|320}} Eventually ThunderClan and the other Clans are able to relocate to the lake territory, the ThunderClan camp of which is set in an abandoned quarry. The camp is protected by high walls of stone, but the surrounding territory is similar to the forest in which ThunderClan previously inhabited.<ref name=starlight>{{cite book|title=[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082762-5}}</ref> As such, their sources of prey remain largely unchanged from the original series. Like many of the other Clans, ThunderClan's role is largely undefined in this series, due to the drastic changes all Clans are forced to undergo and adapt to. Some ThunderClan cats include: Firestar, Bramblestar, Leafpool, Sandstorm, Spottedleaf, Graystripe, Dovewing, Ivypool, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf.\n\n===''Bluestar's Prophecy''===\n\n====Pinestar====\nA red-brown tom with green eyes, '''Pinestar''' was the leader of ThunderClan when Bluestar was born. His warrior name was Pineheart. When he only had one life left, he decided to step down as leader and become a [[Housecat|kittypet]], having become increasingly disillusioned with the [[violence]] and contrasting fragility of Clan life. He was Leopardfoot's mate and the father of Tigerstar and grandfather of Tawnypelt, Brambleclaw, Hawkfrost, and Mothwing and great-grandfather of Flametail, Dawnpelt, Tigerheart, Sparkpelt, Alderheart, Juniperkit, and Dandelionkit and the great-great-grandfather of Sleekwhisker, Juniperclaw, Strikestone, Shadowkit, Pouncekit and Lightkit. He was accepted by StarClan when he did die, and gave Bluestar a life, the gift of [[compassion]]. He also gave a life of being aware of what goes on beyond Clan borders to his son, Tigerclaw.\n\n====Sunstar====\n'''Sunstar''', a bright ginger tom with green eyes and yellow tabby stripes, was the leader before Bluestar. He was the deputy of ThunderClan in ''Bluestar's Prophecy'' and his warrior name was '''Sunfall'''. He was Bluepaw's mentor, after her former mentor, Stonepelt, had to move to the elder's den, due to an injury that did not heal properly. Sunfall encouraged Bluefur every time she was downhearted, specifically after the deaths of Moonflower, Snowfur, and the \"disappearance\" of her kits, Mosskit, Stonekit and Mistykit. Sunstar became leader when Pinestar stepped down to become a kittypet. Sunstar's original deputy, Tawnyspots, had to retire early (due to sickness) and Sunstar needed another cat to be deputy, a position which [[#Thistleclaw|Thistleclaw]] wanted badly; however, he chose Bluefur instead because he thought Thistleclaw was too violent and Bluefur lost so much yet was still selfless. Sunstar had a secret: because Pinestar still had one life left when Sunstar had his leader ceremony, StarClan only gave him eight lives, instead of nine. Sunstar later died after being weakened by sickness and unable to outrun a Twoleg dog. At Bluestar's leader ceremony, Sunstar gave to her the gift of courage. In Bluestar's Prophecy, he was implied to be in love with Moonflower. His brother was Featherwhisker, ThunderClan's medicine cat before Spottedleaf.<ref name=bluestar/>\n\n====Moonflower====\n'''Moonflower''' is a silver-grey tabby queen with pale yellow eyes, mother of [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] and [[#Snowfur|Snowfur]], and mate of Stormtail. She is also the littermate of [[#Goosefeather|Goosefeather]]. Moonflower acted hostile towards Goosefeather when he wasn't watching Snowkit and Bluekit while they snuck into the medicine supplies and Snowkit ate two poppy seeds. Goosefeather believes she made a mistake in mating with Stormtail, since he really loved Dappletail instead. Moonflower and many other warriors joined in on an attack on the WindClan camp and she had to attack the medicine cat supplies. [[#Hawkheart|Hawkheart]], the WindClan medicine cat, killed Moonflower. Since her death, Bluestar felt heavy with grief. At Bluestar's leader ceremony, she gave to her the gift of love, to cherish her Clan as she cherished her kits.<ref name=bluestar/> She is also grandmother of Stonefur, Mistyfoot and Mosskit.\n\n====Snowfur====\n'''Snowfur''' is a snowy white queen with blue eyes and black ear tips. She is the sister of [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]]. She and Bluestar had a strong sibling bond which was threatened by the events in when Snowfur falls in love with [[#Thistleclaw|Thistleclaw]] and Bluefur disapproves as shown in'' [[Bluestar's Prophecy (Warriors)|Bluestar's Prophecy]]''. She has one kit with Thistleclaw, [[#Whitestorm|Whitekit]]. Snowfur ends up dying when chasing ShadowClan intruders across the Thunderpath, and is run over by a Twoleg monster, which causes Bluefur to go into another cycle of grief. Snowfur also told her own story about what happened to Mosskit in ''[[Secrets of the Clans]]''.<ref name=\"secrets\" /> She's daughter to Moonflower and Stormtail. Snowfur also gave Rosetail her name (when she was a kit) because of her pinkish-orange tail. At Bluestar's leader ceremony, she gave her the gift of pride, so that she knows her own worth and the worth of her Clan. She gave Bluestar's ninth life to her.<ref name=bluestar/> Snowfur, while alive, teased Bluefur about liking Oakheart, a RiverClan warrior.\n\n====Thistleclaw====\n'''Thistleclaw''' is a large, grey-and-white tabby tom with amber eyes. Bluestar suggests his name due to his spiky fur when they are both kits in the nursery. He is hot-headed and aggressive, making his relationship with the more reserved [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] quite difficult. He was also mate of Bluestar's sister, [[#Snowfur|Snowfur]], and father of [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]], Bluestar's nephew. He was also the mentor of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerpaw]] and one of the causes of Tigerstar's evil and ambitious motives. Thistleclaw at first seemed only arrogant and not interested in the long run of things, but later on, it was shown that he was paranoid and bloodthirsty, and wanted to keep other Clans out of ThunderClan territory by \"marking the borders with blood\".  In ''Crookedstar's Promise'' Crookedjaw witnessed him training in the Dark Forest. He was characterized as highly violent, which was shown when he pushed Tigerstar so hard, the cat adopted his mentor's goals, arrogance, ambition, and thirst for blood. Another example of Thistleclaw's violent nature is when he ordered his apprentice, Tigerpaw, to attack Tiny (later Scourge) when he just walked onto the borders of ThunderClan, not knowing about the Clans at the time, as described in the manga ''The Rise of Scourge'' and the super edition ''Bluestar's Prophecy''.<ref name=\"Rise of Scourge\">{{cite book|title=[[The Rise of Scourge]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-147867-3}}</ref> Goosefeather, when he was described as insane, had a vision with Bluefur, and saw Thistleclaw's pelt dripping in blood, symbolizing the trail of death that he would leave if he ever ascended to leader. Goosefeather says that he could lead ThunderClan down a path of blood if he became a leader instead of Bluefur. \n\nWhen Thistleclaw died, he was found with claws unsheathed, lips in a snarl, and lying in a pool of his own blood, just as Bluestar and Goosefeather saw in their shared vision. In ''Night Whispers'', he is shown as managing the training session in the Dark Forest. In ''Sign of the Moon'', he kills Antpelt in training.\n\n====Goosefeather====\n'''Goosefeather''' is a speckled grey tom with pale blue eyes and brother of [[#Moonflower|Moonflower]]. He was the medicine cat of ThunderClan when Bluestar was born and interprets a piece of prey (a vole with its fur bent over like a forest being blown down by wind) as a warning from StarClan that WindClan will destroy ThunderClan. He suggests that the only way to stop this was to destroy WindClan's medicine supplies; in the ensuing battle, his sister is murdered and many cats are injured, with Stonepelt's injuries forcing him to retire early. Several cats, including his niece Bluestar, blame him for the results of the battle. He was the mentor of Featherwhisker, the medicine cat before Spottedleaf. He interprets a burning branch as an omen that Bluestar is fire and will burn through the ranks of ThunderClan, but will be destroyed by water. After that, Goosefeather seems to go insane. He sees Tigerkit as a dangerous monster (ironically, though no cat believed him, this proves to be true), and that Thistleclaw will lead ThunderClan to a path of blood if he becomes leader. Although many cats think Goosefeather is insane, some of his omens and prophecies are true. He even tells Bluefur that she has to give up her kits to save ThunderClan, which she reluctantly does so. At Bluestar's leader ceremony, he gave to her the gift of patience.\n\n====Featherwhisker====\n'''Featherwhisker''' is a pale silvery tom with amber eyes, long whiskers, and a sweeping, plumy tail. He was Goosefeather's apprentice when Bluekit was born and became Spottedleaf's mentor. He showed the elders' den to Bluestar and Snowfur when they were kits. He was more trusted in ThunderClan than Goosefeather, his mentor, and was often asked to help with things that Goosefeather should have been helping with. He worked tirelessly to save his Clanmates during the green-cough epidemic, which ultimately killed him. After he died, Spottedleaf became the medicine cat. Featherwhisker is Sunstar's brother.<ref name=\"secrets\" />\n\n====Leopardfoot====\n'''Leopardfoot''' is a sleek black queen with green eyes. She is sister of Patchpelt, Redtail, Willowpelt, and Spottedleaf,  mate of [[#Pinestar|Pinestar]], and mother of Mistkit and Nightkit (both died soon after birth), and Tigerkit, later known as [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]]. She was introduced in ''Bluestar's Prophecy'' as a five-month-old kit. She later on had her kits early and was weakened. She gave Tigerkit his tough name because he was the weakest of the litter. Her parents were Adderfang and Swiftbreeze.<ref name=bluestar/> Her mate was Pinestar, who left the Clan to be a [[Kittypet]] shortly before Mistkit and Nightkit's deaths.\n\n====Swiftbreeze====\n'''Swiftbreeze''' is a tabby and white queen with yellow eyes. She is mother of Leopardfoot, Patchpelt, and in a later litter Willowpelt, Spottedleaf and Redtail. Swiftbreeze is mate to Adderfang, a brown tabby warrior. She was introduced in ''Bluestar's Prophecy'' as a queen who liked to show off about her kits. She is grandmother to Tigerstar and great-grandmother to Bramblestar, Hawkfrost, Mothwing, and Tawnypelt.\n\n====Thrushpelt====\n'''Thrushpelt''' is a sandy-grey tom with a white flash on his chest and green eyes. He was a newly appointed warrior when [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] was a kit. He had a crush on Bluestar and everyone took notice, leading the Clan to believe he was the father of [[#Stonefur|Stonefur]], [[#Mistystar|Mistystar]], and [[#Mosskit|Mosskit]]. Thrushpelt knew that the kits were not his, but kept Bluestar's secret until his death even though he never knew who their real father was. Bluestar told him that she knew she would have been happy with him.<ref name=bluestar/>\n\n====Mosskit====\n'''Mosskit''' is a gray she-cat with white patches and blue eyes. She is the sister of [[#Mistystar|Mistystar]] and [[#Stonefur|Stonefur]], and the kit of [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] and [[#Oakheart|Oakheart]]. In ''Bluestar's Prophecy'' Mosskit [[Hypothermia|freezes to death]] on the way to RiverClan. Bluefur buries her in the dirt below the snow so Mosskit is not eaten by [[foxes]] when the winter thaws. In ''Bluestar's Prophecy'', she gives her mother a life as she becomes ThunderClan's leader after Sunstar. She also appears in ''Secrets of the Clans'' and ''The Last Hope''. Mosskit also once ate a maggot but did not die.\n\n===Original Series===\nThe original series covers events in the story from ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' to ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. Many characters mentioned here were introduced in the original series, but many of them play minor or significant roles in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series as well. Characters listed in the other series may have been introduced in the original series, but play larger roles in the series they are listed in.\n\n====Firestar====\n'''Firestar''', a handsome flame-colored tom with green eyes,<ref>http://www.warriorcats.com/meet-the-warriors/cats/into-the-wild/fireheart</ref> is the protagonist of the original series. Initially a kittypet named '''Rusty''', he often dreamed of hunting for his own prey in the forest beyond his owner's house (thus making him venture into the forest beyond his fence and garden). Rusty joins ThunderClan after encountering Graypaw, when he was caught actually trying to hunt prey in ThunderClan territory, and is initially established as an apprentice, being renamed '''Firepaw''' for his flame-colored pelt. Throughout the series, Firepaw gains respect within the Clan and eventually receives his warrior name of '''Fireheart''' at the end of ''Into the Wild'', along with his best friend, Graypaw, renamed Graystripe.\n\nAt the end of ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'', he becomes deputy, and finally, becomes ThunderClan's leader, '''Firestar''' at the beginning of ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', when Bluestar died from saving her Clan and Fireheart at the end of ''A Dangerous Path'' from the dog pack that Tigerstar used to try to destroy ThunderClan. Before Bluestar dies, she finally tells Fireheart that she was right about him, and that he was the \"fire\" in the prophecy, ''Fire alone can save the Clan'', which she heard before he even joined ThunderClan. Firestar was mentored by Bluestar (and, for a short time, Lionheart and Tigerclaw), and has mentored three apprentices himself: [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]], who later becomes a medicine cat apprentice to Yellowfang due to her accident on the Thunderpath (which in fact, was set up by Tigerstar as a trap that was actually meant for Bluestar) that permanently injures her leg; [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]]; and [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]](star). Cloudtail is the first-born son of his kittypet sister, [[#Princess|Princess]].\n\nFireheart met Princess when she was heavily pregnant in ''Fire and Ice''. When her kittens were born, she let Firestar have her firstborn kit to be raised as a warrior with him to ThunderClan, where Bluestar named him Cloudkit. Firestar does not possess any significant character flaws and is fully committed to the warrior code. Only sometimes will he bend the rules to help his Clan. Firestar is fiercely loyal not only to his Clan, but also to his many friends and allies that he meets along the way, regardless of their affiliation. He respects the rules of his superiors, but also has the insight to look beyond them in order to properly judge a questionable situation. As a result, he often breaks the traditional rules of the Clan (a trend started by his very inclusion into the Clan, being of house cat, or kittypet origins) in order to help his friends or rectify a situation he believes to be right. He is primarily responsible, along with his friend Graystripe, for several feats that have ensured the well-being of all the Clans, such as retrieving WindClan after they were driven out of their camp in ''Fire and Ice'',<ref name=\"fire and ice\">{{cite book|title=[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052559-0}}</ref> and hunting prey for [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] when they were damaged and forced to move out of their territory in a flood. In ''A Dangerous Path'', he professes his long-time love for Sandstorm, who is revealed to love him back.<ref name=\"dangerous path\">{{cite book|title=[[A Dangerous Path]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-000006-6}}</ref> He struggled with feelings for Spottedleaf, who died in ''Into the Wild''. As a warrior, Fireheart earned Bluestar's disapproval for frequently helping the other Clans.\n\nHe led all four Clans against the ranks of [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] as LionClan in ''[[The Darkest Hour (novel)|The Darkest Hour]]''. He kills their leader, [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]].<ref name=\"darkest hour\">{{cite book|title=[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052585-9}}</ref> Erin Hunter also disclosed that Firestar is Scourge's half-brother through their father, Jake.\n\nHe appointed Graystripe as deputy after the battle against BloodClan in ''The Darkest Hour'' after Whitestorm, the former deputy, was killed by [[List of Warriors characters#Bone|Bone]], the BloodClan deputy. Firestar maintains a significant and often highly important presence in subsequent series, ''The New Prophecy'', ''Power of Three'', and ''Omen of the Stars'' as the ever-present leader of ThunderClan. Additionally, in between the original series and ''The New Prophecy'', he travels north with his mate, [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], in order to reunite the lost and scattered descendants of [[#SkyClan|SkyClan]] in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar>{{cite book|title=[[Firestar's Quest]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-113164-6}}</ref> Also, he starred in the story for the Ultimate Leader competition, when he once more briefly unites the Clans, with heavy support from his mate, Sandstorm. Sandstorm dislikes him when he first joins ThunderClan and grows jealous when he receives his warrior name before her. Firestar also saves Sandstorm from falling over the gorge during a border fight with RiverClan in ''Fire and Ice''.\n\nHe has two daughters with his beloved and long-time mate, Sandstorm: [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]]. Both have leading roles in ''The New Prophecy'' series and side parts in the ''Power of Three'' and ''Omen of the Stars'' series. Firestar's father is a plump ginger tom called Jake, who is also the father of Princess, Luna, Tommy, Filou, Ruby,Socks,and Scourge. Jake's other mate, Quince, was the mother of Scourge, Ruby, and Socks. Firestar's mother is a tabby and white she-cat named Nutmeg. It is said on the ''Warriors'' app on iPhone and iPod that just before her kits were born, Nutmeg dreamed that one of them, a ginger tom, was standing on a huge rock out of her reach. She called for him to come down, but he did not seem to hear. Princess is Firestar's sister, and her son, Cloudtail is Firestar's nephew. Whitewing (Cloudtail's daughter). and Dovewing and Ivypool (Whitewing's daughters) his grandchildren. Whitewing, Cloudtail's daughter, has two kits: Ivypool and Dovewing. [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] is one of the Three, and completing that trio.  Ivypool trains with the [[#Dark forest|Dark Forest]], even though she doesn't want to anymore. She serves as a spy for the Three.  He is grandfather to [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] (Leafpool and Crowfeather's forbidden kits) and Alderheart, Sparkpelt, Juniperkit, and Dandelionkit (Squirrelflight and Bramblestar's kits). He is also great grandfather to Lionblaze's kits, Hollytuft, Sorrelstripe, and Fernsong.\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'', [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]] tells [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] that the fourth cat in the prophecy \"The end of the stars draws near. Three must become four to defeat the darkness that lasts forever\" is Firestar. Later in the book, Firestar loses his last life after defeating the spirit of Tigerstar, getting burned to death after standing next to a tree that catches on fire from a bolt of lightning.\n\n====Bluestar====\n'''Bluestar''' is a large, lithe, pale blue-gray she-cat with luminous, ice-blue eyes. She has thick, long, soft, fur and a broad face, head, and shoulders, with a scar that parts the fur across them, and a torn ear. She has a silver-tinted muzzle and a long, sleek tail  She was the leader of ThunderClan when Firestar (then known as Firepaw) first came to the forest which was during most of the original series. She is responsible for bringing [[#Firestar|Firestar]] into ThunderClan, a decision prompted by the alarmingly low number of apprentices in her Clan, and the prophecy \"Fire alone can save our Clan\". Bluestar serves as Firestar's mentor during his apprenticeship following a short time when Firestar is mentored by the senior warriors,<ref name=\"Into the Wild\">{{cite book|title=[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|year=2003|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-000002-8}}</ref> and eventually appoints him as her deputy after [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]]'s exile. She is known as a strong, wise and calm leader.\n\nBluestar fell in love with Oakheart, a [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] warrior and brother to Crookedstar, during her days as a warrior (when she was named '''Bluefur''', as seen in ''[[The Rise of Scourge]]'' and ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy]]''). During this time another warrior of ThunderClan (Thrushpelt, as seen in ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy]]'') began to show interest in her. She bore three of Oakheart's kits, but let the Clan believe Thrushpelt was the father, and Thrushpelt was kind enough to pretend for her. Out of her concern to the Clan, she decided to become Clan deputy instead of the violent Thistleclaw, but since she knew the Clan would never accept a queen nursing kits for a deputy, she secretly gave her kits to Oakheart to be raised in RiverClan. Only Mistykit and Stonekit made it to RiverClan; Mosskit did not survive the journey because of the cold.\n\nAfter she gave them up and returned to the camp, she scratched a hole on the back of the nursery wall, went back to her nest, and then screamed \"My kits are gone!\", so that the rest of the Clan would think that her kits were stolen by a starving fox or badger. Bluestar is able to suppress her feelings regarding her decision until Firestar, seeking to uncover the truth about Tigerclaw's deception, causes the issue to be reopened. Her feelings of regret, combined with the shock of discovering her trusted deputy's plan to kill her, cause Bluestar to sink into a manic depression. She remains in this condition throughout the events of ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'' and ''[[A Dangerous Path]]'', which worsens when the forest fire destroys the ThunderClan camp. She refuses to trust any of her warriors except Fireheart and [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]], and declares war on StarClan for dooming her Clan, saying that StarClan had said fire would save the Clan, and instead fire had destroyed it. Her faith is restored in the final moments of ''A Dangerous Path'', when in a dramatic scene she crashes into the leader of a pack of dogs, causing them to fall over the edge of the gorge and into the river. She dies shortly afterward after confiding in Fireheart that he truly was the \"fire\" that saved the Clan. Before she dies, her kits forgive her for giving them up to RiverClan.\n\nBluestar retains an authoritative role in StarClan during the events of ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series. She chose the chosen one from ThunderClan (Brambleclaw). She also reluctantly told Firestar about SkyClan in ''Firestar's Quest''.\n\nBluestar has two kits, [[#Mistystar|Mistystar]] and [[#Stonefur|Stonefur]], in RiverClan, and is mentioned in ''Secrets of the Clans'' as having a third, Mosskit, who died young during the journey to RiverClan with her littermates due to the extreme cold. Currently Mistystar is the leader of RiverClan, while Stonefur, the previous deputy, was killed in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' by Blackfoot and on Tigerstar's orders, because he was \"half-clan\". She also has a sister named Snowfur. Whitestorm is Snowfur's son, thus making him Bluestar's nephew. Her maternal uncle was Goosefeather, the medicine cat before Featherwhisker. Goosefeather gave to Bluestar her own prophecy, \"Like fire you will blaze through the forest, but beware even the strongest of flames can be destroyed by water\". The prophecy meant that Bluestar's life would be destroyed by the pain of giving up her half-RiverClan kits and it can also mean that she'd die from being drowned in the river. Although Bluestar initially thought Goosefeather's prophecy her being fire and being defeated by water to be nonsense, Bluestar was killed by water.\n\nBluestar was first mentored by Stonepelt, but after Stonepelt was forced to retire due to an injury he got from battle against WindClan, Sunfall took over her training. After Yellowfang's capture, she mentors Firestar. She has also mentored Runningwind and Frostfur. Her sister was named Snowfur, her mother was named Moonflower, and her father was named Stormtail.\n\n====Graystripe====\n'''Graystripe''' is a long-haired gray tom with a dark gray stripe along his back, and yellow eyes. He has also been mentioned with eyes the color amber, and green. He is [[#Firestar|Firestar's]] first and best friend in ThunderClan. He meets Rusty in the forest close to Rusty's kittypet home and proceeds to attack him as if he were any other intruder. When Rusty joins ThunderClan as Firepaw, the two become great friends and often train and eat together. Graypaw's mentor was Lionheart, who was killed in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''. He becomes a warrior soon after the battle with ShadowClan to rescue ThunderClan kits with Firepaw at the end of ''Into the Wild''.\n\nShortly after being promoted to a full warrior (he was named \"Graystripe\" because there is a gray stripe running down his back that is darker than the rest of his gray fur), Graystripe falls in love with a [[List of Warriors characters#RiverClan|RiverClan]] she-cat, [[#Silverstream|Silverstream]], after she saves him from drowning, and starts to sneak out of camp to meet her. His friendship with Fireheart is strained due to Fireheart's need to cover for him while he is away, which included mentoring Graystripe's apprentice Brackenpaw in his place, and for a short time the two quarrel with each other. Eventually Graystripe is able to settle his issues with Fireheart, and their friendship continues. Graystripe eventually leaves ThunderClan to live in RiverClan after Silverstream dies, but returns when Bluestar leads dogs that Tigerstar set on the clan off the gorge.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\">{{cite book|title=[[Forest of Secrets]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|year=2003|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052561-3}}</ref> In the end of the original series, he becomes ThunderClan's deputy, due to Whitestorm's death,<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> but is replaced by Brambleclaw when he was captured in Dawn.<ref name=sunset>{{cite book|title=[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082771-7}}</ref>\n\nGraystripe is a friendly, hearty character, serving as a comic relief character to some degree. He often makes quips or jokes in order to provide relief to a tense situation, but is able to focus himself during battles and concentrate on the objective at hand. He does not have any qualms about killing hated enemies of the Clan, and is responsible for the deaths of [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] and also the accidental death of Whiteclaw, who fell off a gorge, Graystripe being unable to save him.\n\nGraystripe has lived in more locations than any other cat in the series. When Silverstream died bearing his kits, Feathertail and Stormfur, Graystripe went to live with them in [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] for a while.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> He returned to ThunderClan in ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' when Leopardstar tried to kill Firestar and Graystripe attacked her and saved him, upon which Leopardstar exiled him from RiverClan.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> In ''Dawn'' of ''The New Prophecy'' series, Graystripe was captured by humans, or \"Twolegs\" and lived as a kittypet for a time, which is described in further detail in ''[[The Lost Warrior (Warriors)|The Lost Warrior]]'' manga series. While living as a kittypet, Graystripe met [[#Millie|Millie]], another kittypet, who helped him escape. After a long journey, the two finally returned to the Clans living at the lake.  He returned to ThunderClan in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' of the ''Power of Three'' series, along with Millie as his new mate. He is currently a regular warrior, for Firestar lets Brambleclaw retain his position as deputy. Graystripe sometimes becomes a \"substitute\" deputy when Brambleclaw is out traveling.\n\nHe had two kits with Silverstream, [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]] and [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]] who go on to live in RiverClan. They fled to ThunderClan temporarily, along with Feathertail's (then Featherpaw and Stormpaw) mentor, Mistystar (then Mistyfoot), to escape Tigerstar's rule in RiverClan. His father is Patchpelt and his mother is Willowpelt. Feathertail was killed in ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]''. Graystripe's mate, Millie, gave birth to three kits of her own, [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]], [[#Bumblestripe|Bumblestripe]], and [[#Blossomfall|Blossomfall]] in  ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]''. Graystripe has two grandkits, Pine that Clings to Rock and Lark that Sings at Dawn from Stormfur and his mate, [[#Brook Where Small Fish Swim|Brook Where Small Fish Swim]]. Graystripe is currently an elder.\n\n====Sandstorm====\n'''Sandstorm''' is a pale ginger she-cat with green eyes. '''Sandpaw''' was an apprentice when Firestar first joins the Clan, and disliked Firepaw for formerly being a kittypet.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> Eventually, she warms up to Fireheart, a process initiated by Fireheart preventing her from falling over a cliff during a battle in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'', thereby saving her life.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> When Fireheart is forced to take Sandpaw on a patrol mission, she begins to warm up to him, and is unexpectedly friendly and cheerful toward him. Over the course of the series, it becomes obvious that Sandstorm has fallen in love with Fireheart (revealed in ''Rising Storm'' by her cousin Cinderpelt),<ref name=risingstorm>{{cite book|title=[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052563-7}}</ref> and by ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' the two have become mates.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> Sandstorm is known for having a fierce personality and getting easily annoyed, but is also capable of being gentle, however, as seen by her interactions with Firestar, her children, Squirrelflight and Leafpool, and her grandchildren, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather.\n\nShe is noted as being the best hunter and one of the fastest runners in ThunderClan, and is an excellent fighter as well, resulting in her being present in many major battles. She was also one of the cats who volunteered to be bait for the dog pack thanks to her speed. The specifics regarding her knowledge of Firestar's ongoing relationship with her aunt [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]], his first love, are shown in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' in which she once again plays a major role, and in which Firestar confirms that he loves Sandstorm above all, and will 'for all the moons to come'. Also, in ''Cats of The Clans'', Rock states that Sandstorm knows Firestar better than he realises, and better even than Spottedleaf, for all the dreams they have shared. She has two daughters, [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], as well as three grandchildren, [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]]. She is great-grandmother to Lionblaze and Cinderheart's kits, Hollytuft, Sorrelstripe, and Fernsong. They are the kits of Leafpool and Crowfeather as confirmed in The Power of Three. She was mentored by Whitestorm and mentored Sorreltail and Honeyfern.  At the end of ''Bramblestar's Storm'', she retires to become an elder. She dies of an infected wound in The Apprentice's Quest.\n\nRedtail is her father and Brindleface is her mother. Ashfur and Ferncloud are her half brother and sister. She's granddaughter to Adderfang and Swiftbreeze (Redtail's parents) and Fuzzypelt and Robinwing (Brindleface's parents). She is niece to Frostfur, Dustpelt, and Ravenpaw (Brindleface's siblings) and Leopardfoot, Spottedleaf, Willowpelt, and Patchpelt (Redtail's siblings). She is cousin to Tigerstar, Mistkit, and Nightkit (Leopardfoot's kits), Greystripe and Longtail (Patchpelt's sons), Sorreltail, Sootfur, Rainwhisker (Willowpelt's kits) and Cinderpelt, Brackenfur, Thornclaw, and Brightheart (Frostfur's kits).\n\n====Tigerstar====\n{{anchor|Tigerclaw}}\n'''Tigerstar''', a  huge, muscular dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes and unusually long front claws, is the main antagonist of the original series and haunts many cats' dreams in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series. He also plays a major role in the ''Omen of the Stars'' series, leading the Dark Forest to train Clan cats and leading them into a fight against StarClan and the four Clans, and he threatens them to do so, if they back down.\n\nInitially, he is '''Tigerclaw''', a senior warrior among the ranks of ThunderClan when Firepaw is brought into the forest. The two never quite get along, and Tigerclaw's hostility towards Fireheart is even higher when Fireheart discovers his plan to take over the Clan. Tigerclaw is a master of deception and manipulation, and is able to go through with the death of his uncle, Redtail, (an act he himself committed) as appearing to be the work of Oakheart from [[List of Warriors characters#RiverClan|RiverClan]]. By doing so, he plans to become deputy, but Bluestar appoints Lionheart, who is older and more experienced, as her deputy instead. However, when Lionheart later dies from wounds he sustained in a ShadowClan attack in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'', Tigerclaw becomes deputy, ensuring his eventual place as leader. When he finally becomes deputy, he secretly plots with [[#Brokenstar|Brokentail]] and his gang of rogue outlaws in order to kill [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]], while making the entire scene look like an attack that he was unable to defend against and a rogue killed Bluestar. The plan nearly succeeds, but Fireheart stops him at the last moment, and as a result, Tigerclaw is exiled from the Clan.\n\nAs a rogue, Tigerclaw gathers a band of allies (including ShadowClan warriors Nightwhisper and Blackfoot) and kills Mousefur's brother, Runningwind. Tigerclaw then persuades [[List of Warriors characters#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]] into accepting him as their leader and becomes Tigerstar, the rank he worked so hard to achieve.<ref name=risingstorm/> From his new position of authority, he is able to conceal his true nature from the other Clans, and secretly lures a pack of wild dogs into ThunderClan's territory in order to get revenge on his former Clanmates while saving only his kits, Bramblekit and Tawnykit. He plans only to save his kits, but not his mate, Goldenflower. To set the final step of his plan in place, he kills Brindleface, who happens to be the mate of Redtail, who he killed as well, to give the dogs a taste for cat blood when they enter the Thunderclan camp.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> When this plan, too, is foiled by Firestar and the others, Tigerstar hatches a plan to rule the entire forest while employing the services of the ruthless [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] in order to intimidate the other Clans into submission. Just as he has betrayed all his other former allies, he intends to betray BloodClan once he has united all the Clans under his rule. However, Tigerstar underestimates the power of [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]], the undersized black tom who leads BloodClan. When Scourge refuses to obey Tigerstar's order to fight the Clans, Tigerstar furiously attacks him, but Scourge slays him easily by slicing him open from chin to tail with his dog-teeth-reinforced claws. This devastating blow drains all of Tigerstar's nine lives at once, causing him to die nine times over, one life after the other.\n\nIn ''The New Prophecy'' series, Tigerstar visits his sons Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost in their dreams, preparing them to take over the Clans for him. It is revealed that because of his evil actions he was denied access to StarClan, and was banished with [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] to a dark, shadowy forest known as the '''Dark Forest''' (also called the '''Place of No Stars''').<ref name=\"Chat3part1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/881|title=Erin Hunter Chat #3 Transcript&nbsp;\u2013 part 1|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=2008-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228062552/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/881|archivedate=2007-12-28|df=}}</ref> He visits his two sons, [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] and [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], in their dreams and teaches them battle skills and leadership tactics. While Brambleclaw is hesitant to be influenced by his father, Hawkfrost welcomes his advice and plots to take control of the Clans much in the same way as his father did. Brambleclaw killed Hawkfrost in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nTigerstar also plays a role in the ''Power of Three'' series as a battle \"mentor\" to [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], along with his dead son Hawkfrost. The consequences of his actions do not appear to be causing any harm to the Clans; Lionblaze becomes a masterful fighter under Tigerstar's influence and excels in battle skills far beyond any other apprentice. Whether or not Lionblaze is part of yet another plan hatched by Tigerstar from the shadows remains to be seen, though it appears unlikely. He is able to communicate with living cats; however, StarClan has said that he should not be able to.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Lionblaze revolts against Tigerstar in ''Sunrise'' after learning that Tigerstar has always known that Squirrelflight wasn't Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze's mother. Lionblaze is able to defeat him, but refuses to kill him and Tigerstar remains in the Dark Forest.\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'', Tigerstar leads the other Dark Forest cats in an attack against the Clans, and when Hawkfrost, Darkstripe, and Brokenstar are killed for the second time, he steps forward, stating that the battle has only begun.<ref name=lasthope/> After a long duel, Tigerstar is killed by his long-time rival Firestar, fading away permanently.\n\nTigerclaw was mentored by Thistleclaw, an ambitious and aggressive cat (this only magnified Tigerstar's own aggressive personality).<ref name=bluestar/> Tigerclaw takes [[#Ravenpaw|Ravenpaw]] as an apprentice for a short time before Firepaw and Greypaw send him to live with Barley.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> He has taken two mates, [[#Goldenflower|Goldenflower]] and [[#Sasha|Sasha]]. He has five direct kits: [[#Tawnypelt|Tawnypelt]] and Brambleclaw from Goldenflower, and [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], Hawkfrost, and Tadpole from Sasha. Tadpole is not shown in the story because he drowned as a kit.<ref name=\"Return to the clans\">{{cite book|title=[[Return to the Clans]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-154794-2}}</ref> It is revealed in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' that Tigerstar is a direct descendant of the kits of Birdflight, a [[List of Warriors characters#SkyClan|SkyClan]] she-cat who was the mate of Cloudstar, the SkyClan leader, and she sheltered in ThunderClan during SkyClan's exile, with her two kits, Spottedpelt and Gorseclaw, who were at the time, to young to make the journey. This makes him part-SkyClan, along with his aunt [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]].<ref name=firestar/>\n\nIt is also revealed in ''[[Code of the Clans]]'' and then ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy]]'' that Tigerstar was the son of Pinestar, the old ThunderClan leader who left his Clan to be a kittypet while on his last life. His mother was Leopardfoot, who was Patchpelt's, Willowpelt's, Spottedleaf's and Redtail's sister, and his siblings were Nightkit and Mistkit, both she-kits, who died shortly after birth. He was the last born, and weakest of his litter.<ref name=bluestar/> He's also a cousin to Sorreltail, Sootfur and Rainwhisker (Willowpelt's kits), Longtail and Greystripe (Patchpelt's kits) and Sandstorm (Redtail's kit). Grandcousin to Poppyfrost, Cinderheart, Molepaw, Honeyfern, Seedkit, and Lilykit (Sorreltail's kits), Stormfur, Feathertail, Briarlight, Bumblestripe, and Blossomfall (Greystripe's kits) and Squirrelflight and Leafpool (Sandstorm's kits). Great grandcousin to Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze (Leafpool's kits) Cherrykit and Molekit (Poppyfrost's kits) and Lark That Sings At Dawn (Lark) and Pine That Clings To Rock (Pine) (Stormfur's kits). His grandsons are Flametail and Tigerheart, and his granddaughter is Dawnpelt(Tawnypelt's kits).\n\n====Cinderpelt====\n'''Cinderpelt''', a dark grey she-cat with blue eyes, is ThunderClan's medicine cat beginning in the original series, and continuing for a large part of ''The New Prophecy'' series. Originally she trains to be a warrior as an apprentice under Fireheart's mentoring, but she is critically injured and therefore crippled by a monster when she stumbles into a trap laid by [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]] for Bluestar, she permanently injures  her leg and cannot become a warrior.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> Soon after she begins training as a medicine cat apprentice under [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]], she receives the title of a full medicine cat in ''[[Forest of Secrets]]'' (though she is still called Cinderpaw until the beginning of ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'').<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> Cinderpelt is one of Firestar's closest friends throughout the series, and remains his trusted advisor whenever he needs spiritual guidance. Initially overexcited and bouncy, she often overwhelms Firestar as an apprentice and frequently dashes off on her own. After she begins training as a medicine cat, her personality greatly matures and she appears to possess the wisdom of a much older cat. She was in love with Firestar and she never stopped loving him, though Firestar himself never realizes this and Cinderpelt never tells him. Though she always wanted to be a warrior, she accepts her new destiny and dedicates her life to becoming a legendary medicine cat. Cinderpelt tried to save Silverstream while she was giving birth to Greystripe's kits. She loses Silverstream, but if not for her, the kits (Stormkit and Featherkit, later Stormfur and Feathertail) would have died. However, Cinderpelt blames herself for Silverstream's death.\n\nCinderpelt is killed in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'' of ''The New Prophecy'' series while defending Sorreltail and her newborn kits in the nursery from a marauding badger. StarClan had originally destined Cinderpelt to be a warrior, and they did not plan on her being caught in Tigerstar's trap on the Thunderpath. As a test of her loyalty, StarClan told Cinderpelt of her impending death in ''Twilight'' before it happened, a secret which Cinderpelt kept hidden even when her apprentice, [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]], pledged to leave the Clan.\n\nAs a reward, Cinderpelt was reincarnated after her death into one of the kits she defended, '''[[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]]''' in the ''Power of Three'' series. Cinderheart herself is not aware of this consciously, however she occasionally exhibits knowledge that she cannot explain from her previous life, and knows of her reincarnation in dreams. The implications of this \"second life\", as well as Cinderpelt's true destiny, have become realized when Jayfeather reveals it to her in a dream. Just before the battle in ''The Last Hope'', Cinderheart chooses to be a warrior and Lionblaze's mate, and Cinderpelt leaves Cinderheart's body, whispering, \"Thank you\". Cinderpelt was mentored by Yellowfang, and mentored her cousin Sandstorm's daughter [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] as her successor. Her mother is Frostfur, which makes [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]] and [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]] her siblings. Her brother, [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]], is the father of Cinderheart, a situation which is slightly confusing given Cinderpelt's reincarnation. This would imply, then, that Cinderpelt's brother is now her father, though the new Cinderheart is still very much an individual cat in her own right. As Cinderpelt has a reincarnation, [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]] is related to Bluestar since Sorreltail's father was Whitestorm, who was Bluestar's nephew.\n\n====Spottedleaf====\n'''Spottedleaf''' is a beautiful, dark tortoiseshell she-cat, with amber eyes, a white muzzle, white paws, a white chest, a black-tipped tail, and a black, brown, and amber dappled pelt. Her eyes have circles of dark fur around them, and one is darker than the other. She also has a gold-and-black striped tail. She has played some minor and slightly major roles in series to date despite her early death in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'', after which she appeared in Firestar's dreams. Originally Spottedleaf was ThunderClan's medicine cat at the start of ''Into the Wild'' and foretold the original series prophecy \"Fire alone can save our Clan\". [[#Firestar|Firestar]], when first introduced into the camp, immediately takes a liking to her and it is said that she begins to return his feelings. Unfortunately, she is killed by ShadowClan in an effort to protect the kits in an unfair fight with Clawface and Brokenstar during a raid by [[List of Warriors characters#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]] near the end of ''Into the Wild''.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nSpottedleaf is perhaps the most prominent member of StarClan, often serving as a spiritual guide to the main characters of each series, most notably Firestar, whom she falls in love with over the course of his adventures in the original series. She is often seen as a source of comfort, and presents cryptic warnings and messages to cats notifying them of future events. Being dead, she cannot serve any more prominent roles in the lives of the cats she watches over, a fact that is frequently a source of frustration to her regarding Firestar's budding relationship with her niece [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]]. It is revealed that she does indeed wish things were different between them, and continues to love Firestar despite their differences of existence. She accepts her position, however, and acknowledges Sandstorm in a dream of her own in order to reassure the living cat of Firestar's loyalty.<ref name=firestar/> Having not found an apprentice by the time of her death, [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]] is the new medicine cat when she joins ThunderClan.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> It is revealed in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' that Spottedleaf is a direct descendant of the kits of Birdflight, a [[List of Warriors characters#SkyClan|SkyClan]] she-cat who stayed with ThunderClan during SkyClan's exile. Therefore, she is part-SkyClan and permitted to walk in the skies of SkyClan's warrior ancestors as well as StarClan. The same she-cat that stayed with ThunderClan after SkyClan left also had the ancestor of Tigerstar's line, making Spottedleaf related to Tigerstar, Brambleclaw, Mothwing, Hawkfrost, Tadpole, Tawnypelt, and Tawnypelt's kits Flametail, Dawnpelt, and Tigerheart.<ref name=firestar/>\n\nSpottedleaf was mentored by Featherwhisker, the medicine cat before her.<ref name=bluestar/> She walks in the dreams of Firestar, Leafpool, and Jayfeather. After Spottedleaf died, Yellowfang became the medicine cat, taking Cinderpelt as an apprentice following her accident. Her parents were Adderfang and Swiftbreeze, making her sister to Patchpelt, Leopardfoot, Willowpelt, and Redtail. She's also aunt to Mistkit, Nightkit and Tigerstar (Leopardfoot's kits), Sorreltail, Rainwhisker and Sootfur (Willowpelt's kits), and Sandstorm (Redtail's daughter), and great aunt to Brambleclaw, Tawnypelt, Hawkfrost, Mothwing and Tadpole (Tigerstar's kits), Poppyfrost, Cinderheart, Honeyfern, and Molepaw (Sorreltail's kits), and Leafpool and Squirrelflight (Sandstorm's kits). She is great-great aunt to Tigerheart, Flametail, and Dawnpelt (Tawnypelt's kits), Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather (Leafpool's kits), and Cherryfall and Molewhisker (Poppyfrost's kits).\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'' she and the other StarClan cats help fight the Dark Forest cats. During the battle, she attempts to beat Mapleshade. However, Mapleshade kills Spottedleaf, causing her to fade away forever.\n\n====Cloudtail====\n'''Cloudtail''', a long-furred snowy white tom with round blue eyes, is a ThunderClan warrior first introduced as a kit, Cloudkit, in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]''. He is the son of [[#Princess|Princess]], [[#Firestar|Firestar]]'s kittypet sister, and Oliver and thus is Firestar's nephew. He has four littermates, Zack, Taylor, Nami, and Livy. Upon learning that her kits are to be given away by her Twoleg owners, Princess gives her eldest kit to Firestar, because she wanted him to be a hero, like Firestar is. Initially, Cloudkit is rejected by many members of ThunderClan, including [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] herself, because of the Clan's reluctance to admit yet another kittypet into its ranks.\n\nCloudtail grew up as a disrespectful, annoying, loud-mouthed apprentice who often refuses to listen to his mentor, Firestar. He is quite slow to understand the warrior code and often takes selfish actions that benefit himself and not the Clan. His loyalty to the Clan is finally established when, after sneaking off to solicit food from Twolegs, he is captured and taken to a suburb on the other side of [[List of Warriors characters#WindClan|WindClan]] territory near [[#Barley|Barley]]'s farm. Firestar and [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]] rescue him with [[#Ravenpaw|Ravenpaw]]'s help. Upon his return to ThunderClan, he is pelted with questions and he refers to his time with the Twolegs as 'capture' and greatly exaggerates his tale. This event serves to firmly cement Cloudtail's place in the Clan, and he behaves in a much more mature manner towards his Clan thereafter.\n\nDespite becoming a loyal warrior, Cloudtail has retained much of his attitude and is one of the most aggressive cats in the Clan; he is known for his sharp tongue and is often one of the first cats to jump at the prospect of a fight. Cloudtail does not believe in StarClan in the first series, making him one of two Clan cats in the series to do so (the other being [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], the RiverClan medicine cat). He does show a significantly softer side when dealing with his mate, [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], however. Cloudtail is primarily responsible for training Brightheart to be able to fight effectively despite her injuries. His personality taken aside, Cloudtail is friendly to most cats (provided they are not from another Clan). He is one of the best climbers and has the best tracking ability in the Clan.<ref name=firestar />\n\nCloudtail has two daughters, and two sons. He first has one daughter with Brightheart, Whitewing. Later in ''The Last Hope'', he and Brightheart have another daughter, Amberkit, and two sons, Dewkit and Snowkit (Now Ambermoon, Dewnose, and Snowbush). He is grandfather to Lilyheart and Snowbush's kits, Honeypaw, Leafpaw, and Larkpaw. Being Firestar's nephew, he also shares kinship with all of Firestar's direct line, including [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]], [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]]. During the second half of ''The New Prophecy'' series, he shows interest in [[#Daisy|Daisy]], a horseplace cat. He is unaware of the fact that Daisy is in love with him, but once he realizes that he is hurting his mate Brightheart, he resolves to stay with Brightheart, and rekindles his relationship with her.<ref name=sunset/> Cloudtail has mentored [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], [[#Rainwhisker|Rainwhisker]], and [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]] as well as temporarily training [[#Flametail|Flamepaw]] of ShadowClan when Tawnypelt and her kits briefly left ShadowClan for ThunderClan in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''. He's grandfather to Dovewing and Ivypool.\n\n====Brightheart====\n'''Brightheart''', a white she-cat with ginger patches along her back, a ginger tail, one missing eye and a disfigured ear, is a ThunderClan warrior introduced in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]''. Brightheart was an apprentice, Brightpaw, for an unusually long period, along with her fellow apprentices [[#Cloudtail|Cloudpaw]], [[#Thornclaw|Thornpaw]], and [[#Swiftpaw|Swiftpaw]] due to [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]]'s paranoia and refusal to trust her warriors following [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]]'s betrayal.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> Brightpaw develops a strong friendship with Cloudpaw, and is the first apprentice to congratulate him after his promotion to warrior status (received just for being [[#Firestar|Fireheart's]] apprentice) despite the other apprentices feeling jealous and angry. She would join an expedition led by Swiftpaw into the lair of the dog pack during ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' in an attempt to prove herself worthy of being a warrior, which results in her being seriously injured as well as Swiftpaw's death.\n\nHalf of Brightheart's face is disfigured due to her injuries, including a missing eye and a scarred ear from the dog attack in [[A Dangerous Path]]. These features cause Bluestar to give her the warrior name of '''Lostface''', which [[#Firestar|Firestar]] soon changes when he becomes leader. Though initially discouraged by her injuries, Brightheart is soon able to develop, with the help of Cloudtail, a system of fighting that makes use of her one-sided vision, making her as effective at fighting as any other warrior.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> She recoils from the sight of her own face and sometimes flinches when other cats are frightened by her scarred face. However, Brightheart is warm and kind-hearted to many warriors in the Clan. She adopts the duties of an unofficial medicine cat during the latter half of ''The New Prophecy'' series, becoming an object of [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]]'s jealousy, but quickly returns to being a warrior after Leafpool becomes ThunderClan's main medicine cat. In ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', Brightheart holds a grudge for [[#Daisy|Daisy]], who often flirts and spends time with her mate, [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]].<ref name=twilight/> However, after Leafpool points out to Cloudtail that he is hurting Brightheart, Daisy tells Brightheart that Cloudtail loves Brightheart.\n\nBrightheart was mentored by [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]], who also mentored her cousin Sandstorm, and had since taken Sandstorm's grandson [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] as an apprentice, although this was only temporary due to Jayfeather later taking the role of medicine cat. She appears to have been hurt by this, likely due to her being desperate to prove to herself and the Clan that she can still function as well as a normal warrior. Despite Jaypaw's prickly attitude towards her during his apprenticeship, he is able to sense her feelings and is sympathetically warmer towards her upon becoming a medicine cat.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> Her mother is [[#Frostfur|Frostfur]], which makes her the littermate of Thornclaw, Cinderpelt, and Brackenfur. She and her mate, Cloudtail, currently have two daughters and two sons. Whitewing is their oldest daughter, born much earlier than her littermates. Later, Brightheart and Cloudtail have another daughter, Amberkit, and two sons, Snowkit and Dewkit, sometime during the course of ''The Last Hope''. She is also aunt to Poppyfrost, Honeyfern, Cinderheart, and Molepaw (Brackenfur's kits) grandaunt to Cherrykit and Molekit (Poppyfrost's kits), and grandmother to Dovewing, Ivypool (Whitewing's kits)Leafpaw, Larkpaw, and Honeypaw (Snowbush and Lilyheart's kits).\n\n====Brackenfur====\n'''Brackenfur''', a muscular golden brown tabby tom, is a ThunderClan warrior first introduced in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'' as an apprentice, Brackenpaw. He is the son of [[#Frostfur|Frostfur]] and the littermate of [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]], [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], and [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]], and he trained as an apprentice under [[#Firestar|Firestar]] and [[#Graystripe|Graystripe]].<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> Firestar, he was [[#Fireheart|Fireheart]] then, often took over his training when Graystripe left the camp to meet with [[#Silverstream|Silverstream]] even though meeting with cats outside one's own Clan is against the warrior code, upon becoming a warrior in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]''.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/>\n\nHe was considered by Firestar to become ThunderClan's deputy in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', but was not chosen due to a sign from StarClan interpreted by Leafpool, making Brambleclaw deputy instead.<ref name=sunset/> He is greatly respected and liked throughout the Clan, and additionally is an excellent fighter, which allows him to be present in most battles.\n\nIn the ''New Prophecy'' series, Brackenfur takes [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] as a mate, and has six kits with her: Molepaw (who dies of disease between ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series),<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]] (who later dies in Sunrise by being bitten by a snake),<ref name=sunrise>{{cite book|title=[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-089218-0}}</ref> [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], later revealed to be the reincarnation of Cinderpelt, his sister, as well as Lilykit and Seedkit, who are born in the ''Omen of the Stars'' series.<ref name=\"newbook7\">Hunter, Erin.

Brackenfur has no apprentice currently but has mentored [[#Tawnypelt|Tawnypelt]] (before she left ThunderClan to go to ShadowClan), [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]], and [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]]. He also trained [[#Tigerheart|Tigerpaw]] of ShadowClan for a while when Tawnypelt and her kits left ShadowClan for ThunderClan in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows1>{{cite book|title=[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows and he is still alive in the current books]] and is still alive up to the last book.|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-089214-2}}</ref>\n\n====Ravenpaw====\n'''Ravenpaw''', a sleek, almost all black (except for the tip of his tail and a little dash on his chest, which is white) tom with amber eyes, is a current loner, first introduced as a ThunderClan apprentice in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''. After [[#Firestar|Firepaw]] is accepted into the forest, he trains along with [[#Greystripe|Greypaw]] and Firepaw and the three become good friends. Ravenpaw is nervous and shy around his Clanmates, mostly due to the fact that his mentor, [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]], treats him harshly and often belittles him in front of the other warriors. Part of this is because Ravenpaw saw Tigerclaw murder [[#Redtail|Redtail]], the ThunderClan deputy. Eventually Tigerclaw decides that Ravenpaw's storytelling abilities are too dangerous, and plots to kill him to keep his secret safe. Firepaw discovers this, and along with Greypaw shows Ravenpaw across the [[List of Warriors characters#WindClan|WindClan]] border to shelter in [[#Barley|Barley]]'s barn, while telling the rest of the Clan that he is dead.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nFirepaw takes Ravenpaw to the barn, and he seems to enjoy his life with Barley. He loses his old nervousness and becomes much more confident and outgoing, while retaining a loyal debt of gratitude towards his former Clanmates. His situation is present throughout the series: while some outsiders such as kittypets appear to have been born to live in a Clan, there are also Clan-born cats whose destinies lie elsewhere. Ravenpaw returns at various times throughout the series to lend assistance or shelter to cats traveling across his territory, most notably helping to feed and shelter all of the forest Clans during the beginning of their relocation in ''[[Dawn (Warriors)|Dawn]]''.<ref name=dawn>{{cite book|title=[[Dawn (Warriors)|Dawn]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-074455-7}}</ref> Ravenpaw also assists Firestar and Greystripe in retrieving Greystripe's kits from [[List of Warriors characters#RiverClan|RiverClan]] during Tigerstar's cruel leadership of the Clan in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''.

He had recently been made an apprentice, Dustpaw, when [[#Firestar|Firepaw]] initially joined the Clan. He was mentored by Redtail, and then by Darkstripe following Redtail's death. He was one of the cats that disliked Firepaw, like Sandpaw; however, this becomes less important as the story goes on.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> He becomes a warrior, Dustpelt, in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]''.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> Originally an ally and strong supporter of [[#Tigerclaw|Tigerclaw]], Dustpelt was horrified to discover that Tigerclaw murdered his mentor, [[#Redtail|Redtail]], and rejected him in front of the Clan when Tigerclaw was exiled.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/>\n\nThough usually depicted as a grudging ally of Firestar throughout all three series, Dustpelt's loyalty to his Clan (and its \"kittypet\" leader) is of importance to him and he is a valued warrior as a result. Dustpelt is a skilled fighter, and is present in most attack parties. He is also a warm and dedicated father, having experienced the deaths of three of his kits, and makes sure to maintain a strong presence in both his kits' lives and that of his mate, Ferncloud.\n\nDustpelt's kits, both living and dead, include Hollykit, Larchkit, [[#Shrewpaw|Shrewpaw]], [[#Foxleap|Foxleap]], [[#Icecloud|Icecloud]], [[#Birchfall|Birchfall]], and [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]], of which four are surviving. His grandchildren, [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]] and [[#Rosepetal|Rosepetal]], are the kits of Spiderleg and his mate [[#Daisy|Daisy]], and [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] and [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]] who are the kits of Birchfall and Whitewing. Throughout the course of the series Dustpelt has mentored [[#Ashfur|Ashfur]], [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]], as well as briefly mentoring [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] for a time.\n\n====Darkstripe====\n'''Darkstripe''', a sleek black and grey tabby tom, is an [[antagonist]] and a warrior in ThunderClan during most of the original series. He is a rude, nasty, and unpleasant individual who maintains a highly negative opinion of [[#Firestar|Firestar]] throughout the series. He is the closest friend and biggest supporter of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]], and as such is fiercely loyal to Tigerstar's ambitions despite their implications. Darkstripe routinely voices his negative opinions at Clan meetings, refusing to trust Firestar due to his kittypet origins and openly mocking any cat who thinks otherwise.\n\nWhen Tigerclaw is exiled from ThunderClan in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'', Darkstripe voices his disappointment that Tigerstar did not include him in his plan to kill [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]] (he did not appear to have a problem with Tigerstar's plan itself, but rather that he was not allowed to be a part of it).<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> Darkstripe's lonely path of a devoted follower continues to reduce his popularity in the Clan, and in ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' he begins secretly plotting with Tigerstar across the border in order to bring the dogs upon the camp and save only Tigerstar's children, [[#Bramblestar|Bramblekit]] and [[#Tawnypelt|Tawnykit]], from the ensuing chaos, but not Tigerstar's mate, Goldenflower.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> After this fails, he attempts to murder his half-sister, Sorrelkit (later Sorreltail), with deathberries when she discovers his meetings with [[#Blackstar|Blackfoot]], Tigerstar's deputy, and he is exiled from the Clan. Darkstripe immediately runs to Tigerstar's side and kills one of Bluestar's children, Stonefur, but when Tigerstar is killed by [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]], Darkstripe is left completely alone. His resulting madness culminates in the battle with [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] during ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''; he forsakes all loyalty to his Clan and tries to murder Firestar in \"revenge\" for Tigerstar's death. He is stopped and killed by his half-brother, [[#Graystripe|Graystripe]] during the battle.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nDarkstripe has mentored Longtail, Dustpelt, and Ferncloud, although his mentorship of Ferncloud was revoked when he was exiled from the Clan. He was mentored by Tigerclaw. His mother was [[#Willowpelt|Willowpelt]] and his father was [[#Tawnyspots|Tawnyspots]], and it can be implied from his personality that hardly any cat liked him very much. He is shown during the prologue of ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' to be walking the Dark Forest/Place of No Stars like Tigerstar, Brokentail, and eventually [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], and all of the other Clan cats that are considered traitors and evil.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nIn ''Code of the Clans'', he is hunting with Longtail. When Longtail catches a plump squirrel, Darkstripe encourages them to eat it since prey is scarce. After eating it and returning to camp with a smaller catch, Poppydawn, who needs food, dies of a case of greencough. While Longtail feels guilty, Darkstripe does not care.\n\n====Longtail====\n'''Longtail''', a pale yellow tabby tom with black stripes and a very long tail, is a recurring ThunderClan warrior introduced in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''. He is the first to challenge [[#Firestar|Firestar]] due to his kittypet origins, and fights him when he first arrives in the Clan. This results in Firestar's collar being ripped off, which is then taken as a sign that he will be accepted into the Clan. Longtail's ear is torn, resulting in a scar. Longtail maintains a grudge against Firestar for much of the series, not only because an apprentice defeated him and gave him his scar, but also because he, Longtail, was a strong supporter of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]], Firestar's chief rival.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nLongtail's attitude slowly matures over the course of the series, and he develops an eventual respect for Firestar as a result of his repeatedly demonstrated courage, something Longtail lacks. He revokes his allegiance with Tigerclaw after the latter is exiled for treason, and sets himself toward becoming a respected warrior within the Clan. His loyalty is further proven when he volunteers to be bait for Tigerstar's vicious dog pack. While he still resents Firestar to some degree, he realizes his Clan's safety is far more important and warns him of his cousin Tigerstar's dark schemes from across the border as well as his cousin [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]]'s [[misplaced loyalty]] during ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'' and ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]''.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/><ref name=risingstorm/> Longtail eventually fights alongside Firestar against [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] during the events of ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', having finally found his true place within the Clan as well as Firestar's respect.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nAlmost ironically, Longtail is blinded shortly thereafter by a rabbit's claws in ''Firestar's Quest''.<ref name=firestar/> He remains in the Clan as an elder throughout ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series, despite being only slightly older than Firestar. He was mentored by [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] and he has mentored Swiftpaw, his niece Ferncloud and his cousin Sootfur (before he was blinded). He also taught his great-great-nephew Jayfeather how to utilize his other senses without sight.<ref name=pwrbook1/> He was killed by a falling tree in [[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]] while trying to retrieve a piece of fresh-kill for Mousefur.<ref name=fadingechoes>{{cite book|title=[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-155512-1}}</ref> Longtail was the oldest tom and second oldest cat in ThunderClan. His parents were Patchpelt and Robinwing. Longtail is also half-brother to Greystripe.\n\nIn ''Code of the Clans'', he is hunting with Darkstripe. When he catches a plump squirrel, Darkstripe encourages them to eat it since prey is scarce. After eating it and returning to camp, Poppydawn, who needs food, dies of a case of greencough. Longtail feels guilty, while Darkstripe does not.\n\n====Mousefur====\n'''Mousefur''', a small dusky brown she-cat, is a ThunderClan warrior introduced in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]''.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> She is a respected warrior in the Clan and is known for having a fierce personality, similar to [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]] and Speckletail. Mousefur was one of the cats who volunteered to be bait for the dog pack.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> Mousefur is usually friendly to [[#Firestar|Firestar]], but has been known to change her attitude towards him depending on the situation. Mousefur is often among any group of cats voicing a counter-opinion to a major decision, forcing the Clan to look at an issue from an opposite perspective. Despite her many arguments and aggressive pride, however, she usually ends up agreeing with the correct choice in a given situation.\n\nMousefur's age causes her to join the elders in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'' in ''The New Prophecy'' series, where she currently remains.<ref name=starlight/> Since then she has fallen ill a number of times, more recently catching greencough and causing [[#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]] to experience his first medical epidemic as a medicine cat in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> Mousefur and [[#Longtail|Longtail]] have become unlikely friends due to their sharing of the elders' den, and often playfully bicker back and forth similar to Yellowfang and Cinderpelt. Although, due to her stubbornness (or thoughtfulness) she sometimes refuses to take herbs or prey, insisting the younger cats need it more. She even volunteers to help take care of the sick cats in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'' as she thinks that being an elder, her life is less valuable than the younger cats. She asked Brambleclaw this even though Firestar had already turned down her request, only to be turned down by Brambleclaw as well.<ref name=longshadows/> Mousefur was killed in ''The Last Hope'' by a Dark Forest warrior.\n\nMousefur has been a mentor to [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]] and [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]]. Mousefur's parents are Halftail and One-eye, and her brother is Runningwind.\n\n====Thornclaw====\n'''Thornclaw''', a golden brown tabby tom, first appears in ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'' as a young ThunderClan apprentice, Thornpaw.<ref name=\"Forest of Secrets\"/> He is an apprentice for a large part of the original series, along with [[#Brightheart|Brightpaw]], [[#Cloudtail|Cloudpaw]] and Swiftpaw, mainly due to [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]]'s descent into paranoia during the last half of the original series and her refusing to trust any of her warriors. When she died, the newly appointed [[#Firestar|Firestar]] conducted his first naming ceremony on Thornclaw, finally making the young tom into a warrior.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nThornclaw's personality begins to show during ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'', where he is shown to be a warrior very similar to [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] in manner and attitude. He is an excellent fighter and is often chosen to assist in battle parties and long-range patrols. Thornclaw, like Brackenfur, becomes slightly worried about the increasing numbers of non-Clan cats present in ThunderClan during the ''Power of Three'' series, as well as at Firestar for being too accepting of them. This is primarily due to increasing hostility from the other three Clans, who begin to make claims that ThunderClan is becoming diluted and weak. Despite these feelings, Thornclaw is always portrayed as a kind, caring, and patient cat and has never been shown to be disloyal. When [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] returns in ''The Forgotten Warrior'' he is among the cats who distrust her.\n\nThornclaw's mother is [[#Frostfur|Frostfur]], and his siblings are  [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]].  As a result, Thornclaw is uncle to both Brightheart's and Brackenfur's kits, including [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]], [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]], [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], Lilyheart, Seedpaw, Cherrypaw and Molepaw, and great uncle to Dovewing and Ivypool (Whitewing's kits) and Cherrykit and Molekit (Poppyfrost's kits). He was mentored by [[#Mousefur|Mousefur]] and has mentored [[#Sootfur|Sootfur]], Shrewpaw, [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]] and [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]]. Thornclaw's also nephew to Brindleface (Frostfur's sister), grandson to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Frostfur's parents), cousin to Sandstorm, Ashfur and Ferncloud (Brindleface's kits), second cousin to Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Birchfall, Hollykit, Larchkit, Foxleap and Icecloud (Ferncloud's kits) and third cousin to Toadstep and Rosepetal (Spiderleg's kits) and Dovewing and Ivypool.\n\n====Whitestorm====\n'''Whitestorm''', a large white tom with yellow eyes, was a senior ThunderClan warrior in the original series. He was one of the few cats who always treated [[#Firestar|Firestar]] with kindness when he is first brought into ThunderClan, and often gave him advice when he sensed that Firestar is troubled.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> Whitestorm was a gallant fighter, but was always more reserved rather than bloodthirsty and carries a thoughtful demeanor.\n\nThough he was one of the most experienced senior warriors in the Clan, Whitestorm does not harbor any ambition toward becoming Clan leader and as such offers his wisdom to younger cats entirely out of good will. He assisted Firestar with the burdens of being Clan deputy during [[#Bluestar|Bluestar]]'s depression, and takes over for him occasionally when Firestar's duties call him elsewhere. Being Bluestar's nephew, as her sister Snowfur was his mother, Whitestorm was one of the warriors who were closest to her, and often stayed by her side in order to comfort her and maintain her sanity when she succumbed into paranoia through the later books. Eventually Firestar appointed Whitestorm as his deputy in appreciation for all his advice, a promotion he was unexpectedly pleased about (a trait that Firestar admires, given the ambitions of previous cats he had encountered). Whitestorm was killed by [[List of Warriors characters#Bone|Bone]] during the battle with [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', his last wish being that Firestar appoint [[#Graystripe|Graystripe]] as his new deputy, which is granted.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nWhitestorm's mate was [[#Minor ThunderClan characters|Willowpelt]]. With Willowpelt he fathered Sorreltail, Sootfur and Rainwhisker. As such he was the grandfather of Sorreltail's kits, [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], Molekit, [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]], [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], [[#Seedpaw|Seedpaw]],and  [[#Lilyheart|Lilyheart]]. And is the great-grandfather of Molepaw and Cherrypaw (Poppyfrost's kits). Snowfur's parents were Stormtail and Moonflower making them his other set of grandparents. His aunts were Bluestar (Snowfur's sister), Sweetpaw and Rosetail, because their brother, Thistleclaw, was his father, making Poppydawn and Windflight, their parents, his paternal grandparents.<ref name=bluestar/>\nHe was mentored by Patchpelt, and later mentored Patchpelt's niece, Sandstorm, and later, Sandstorm's cousin Brightheart. He is great-nephew to Pinestar (Poppydawn's brother), and great-great-grandson to Sweetbriar (Pinestar's mother).\n\n====Yellowfang====\n'''Yellowfang''', a dark grey she-cat with bright orange eyes and a flat, broad face with two scars on her muzzle. She is ThunderClan's medicine cat for much of the duration of the original series. She was originally the medicine cat of [[List of Warriors characters#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]], and formed a forbidden relationship with ShadowClan's leader, Raggedstar (as medicine cats are not supposed to have mates), which resulted in her giving birth to three kits. Two of these kits died, and the third, [[#Brokenstar|Brokentail]], lived and eventually forced his way into becoming ShadowClan's leader by killing his father, Raggedstar. Yellowfang believed that the consequences of her actions weren't that her other two kits died, but that Brokenstar survived to take over ShadowClan. Yellowfang was exiled from the camp when Brokenstar, who had never known who his true mother was, blamed her for the death of two kits he had forced into training too early. Yellowfang was found by [[#Firestar|Firepaw]], who took her back to camp as a prisoner. After [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]]'s death, Yellowfang succeeded her as ThunderClan's new medicine cat. Later Yellowfang feeds deathberries to Brokenstar, after his capture by ThunderClan, killing him.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\n\nYellowfang displays a rough and irritable personality to most cats who encounter her, especially Cinderpelt and Fireheart. She speaks the blunt truth rather often, refusing to soften her words, as she feels this would dilute the truth of the matter. Yellowfang has a close friendship with Firepaw beyond their initial meeting, during which the two attack each other. She is struck by Firepaw's potential and acts as a surrogate mother to him throughout his training. When [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]] is injured and her chances of becoming a warrior forfeited, Yellowfang trains her as a medicine cat.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> Her [[personality clashes]] with that of Cinderpelt's, and the two often bicker playfully back and forth; Yellowfang greatly respects Cinderpelt as a result due to her courage to fire her words right back at her.\n\nYellowfang dies from smoke inhalation in the great fire that destroys much of ThunderClan's camp during the events of ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]''. Her last words are to Fireheart, telling him that he was the son she always wished she had.<ref name=risingstorm/> Yellowfang mentored [[#Runningnose|Runningnose]] as a medicine cat in ShadowClan, who retained a great deal of respect for her despite her exile. She then mentored Cinderpelt in ThunderClan.\n\nIn the ''Power of Three'' series, Yellowfang is one of the first StarClan cats to realize [[#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]]'s ability to transcend dreams. She attempts to stop him from abusing his power, but Jaypaw stubbornly refuses. She also argues with Bluestar and other members of StarClan regarding the prophecy concerning Jaypaw and his siblings, saying that the cats of StarClan are intentionally deceiving the three for an as yet undisclosed reason, however most likely referring to the fact that Leafpool is their mother. She also gave the crow's feather to Jayfeather in ''Sunrise'' to figure out who his father was.<ref name=sunrise/> She appears in \"The Forgotten Warrior\" to tell Jayfeather that Cinderheart needs to know who she really is.\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'', Yellowfang kills Brokenstar a second time.\n\n===''The New Prophecy Series''===\n''The New Prophecy'' series covers events in the story from ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' to ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''. Many characters here were first mentioned in the original series, but had minor or insignificant roles. In addition, as with the original series, most characters listed here play minor or significant roles in the following series, ''Power of Three'', as well. The series circles around Tigerstar's and Firestar's children as the Clans have to find a new home, thanks to the twolegs who are destroying it.\n\n====Ashfur====\n\n'''Ashfur''', a pale gray tom with darker flecks and dark blue eyes, was a ThunderClan warrior who was introduced in the original series as Ashkit and later Ashpaw along with his sister, Fernpaw. During the original series, he and Fernpaw willingly served as bait for the pack of dogs threatening ThunderClan's camp and ran ahead of them in order to lead them off course, because they lost their mother, Brindleface, to Tigerstar.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> In ''Into the Wild'', there is a ShadowClan elder named Ashfur.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> He died in ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'', but since ThunderClan's Ashfur was still Ashpaw at the time, there was no colliding of names.<ref name=risingstorm/> Ashfur is shown to be deeply committed to the warrior code, and, like other warriors such as his brother-in-law Dustpelt and his cousin [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]], has concerns about the increasing amount of half-Clan and rogue cats that have been allowed to join ThunderClan.\n\nDuring the events of ''The New Prophecy'', he falls in love with [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], and attempts to get closer to her while she struggles with [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]]. He is dismayed when Squirrelflight eventually tells him she was in love with Brambleclaw instead of him.<ref name=sunset/> Ashfur's resentment of Brambleclaw is also subconsciously motivated; he has never been able to forgive Brambleclaw for his father [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]]'s actions, mainly his killing of Brindleface, Ashfur's mother.\n\nIn the ''Power of Three'' series, Ashfur starts showing his resentment towards Squirrelflight's decision to raise a family with Brambleclaw. For example, during a sparring match between him and his apprentice, Lionpaw, Brambleclaw's son, he turns ferociously hostile. However, it is revealed in ''Long Shadows'' that he has never been angry with Brambleclaw, just Squirrelflight. It was he who helped Hawkfrost try to kill Firestar in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' since he wanted Squirrelflight to suffer the pain of losing her father in retaliation for her choosing Brambleclaw over him. He tries to do this again by attempting to kill Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Hollyleaf in the forest fire in ''Long Shadows'', but he releases them when Squirrelflight reveals they aren't her kits. He vows to tell all of the cats at the upcoming Gathering, which he claims will destroy Squirrelflight, in that she will lose Lionblaze, Jayfeather and Hollyleaf, Brambleclaw will want nothing to do with her, and no cat in any Clan would respect her. At the end of ''Long Shadows'', before he gets the chance, he is mysteriously killed and his body was found floating in the stream of WindClan territory. Most of the cats of ThunderClan suspect it was a WindClan patrol, but it seemed to be implied that Squirrelflight killed him.<ref name=\"longshadows\"/> The fact that Firestar did not mention the death of Ashfur at the Gathering might have been significant. Many people felt that Squirrelflight did not kill Ashfur, and the authors were instead trying to surprise the readers. Another suspected killer among fans was [[#Sol|Sol]] (though he seemed not to have a motive). In ''Sunrise'', his killer was revealed to be Hollyleaf, rather than Squirrelflight.<ref name=sunrise/>\n\nAshfur's mentor was Dustpelt. He has mentored Lionblaze as well as his nephew Birchfall. His mother is Brindleface. Brindleface was killed by Tigerstar in ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]''.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> He had a sister, Ferncloud, and as such is the uncle of Ferncloud's kits including Larchkit, Hollykit, Icecloud, Foxleap, Shrewpaw, Spiderleg, and Birchfall. He is also the foster brother of [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]], due to his mother Brindleface's serving as Cloudtail's surrogate mother in the Clan. His aunt was Frostfur, making him cousin to Brackenfur, Brightheart, Cinderpelt and Thornclaw. In ''Omen of the Stars'', it is revealed that he was allowed to join StarClan instead of being sent to the Dark Forest because his only fault was loving Squirrelflight too much. He is believed to have forgiven Hollyleaf for killing him when she enters the ranks of StarClan. Ashfur presumably fought in the battle against the Dark Forest, although this has not been confirmed.\n\n====Bramblestar====\n{{anchor|Bramblestar}}\n'''Bramblestar''', first introduced as Bramblekit, and later known as Brambleclaw, is a large, muscular dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes.  In ''[[A Dangerous Path]]'', he becomes Firestar's apprentice and is known as Bramblepaw for the remainder of the original series.<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/>  He receives his warrior name, Brambleclaw, in the beginning of ''[[Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar/>\n\nBramblestar is the current ThunderClan leader, but he is often questioned about his loyalties because of his murderous dead father, Tigerstar. He receives a message from the dead Bluestar, where she tells him that he must travel with cats from each Clan to go to the sun-drown place. That leads him to be traveling with his sister Tawnypelt, Crowfeather, Feathertail,  and her brother Stormfur, and Firestar's daughter Squirrelflight. The cats journey to the sun-drown-place to find the badger, Midnight, who tells them that the Clans must find a new home. Brambleclaw seems to take a leadership role on their journey.<ref name=midnight>{{cite book|title=[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-074449-6}}</ref>\n\nBrambleclaw and the others help to find the Clans a new home around the lake. Once the four Clans had settled in their new homes, Tigerstar began to walk in the dreams of Brambleclaw and Brambleclaw's half-brother, Hawkfrost, both Tigerstar's kin. Tigerstar's goal was to make his two sons ambitious for power, like he was when he was alive. However, he believes that Brambleclaw is too weak to take power by himself, so he plots with his evil son, Hawkfrost, to create a trap for Firestar. Hawkfrost shares his plot with [[#Ashfur|Ashfur]], who agrees to help, wanting to cause terrible pain for Squirrelflight because she chose Brambleclaw instead of him. Under the false assumption that [[#Blackstar|Blackstar]] was waiting at the border, Firestar falls victim to a fox trap. Hawkfrost reveals that he was the one who led Firestar there, hoping Bramblestar would kill Firestar, and planning to kill Brambleclaw if he refused. However, Brambleclaw kills Hawkfrost and frees Firestar. Brambleclaw is later named deputy of ThunderClan after Leafpool has a vision of thorn-sharp brambles encircling the camp.\n\nIn ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight, who had been quarreling before, realize how important they truly are to each other and become mates, angering Ashfur.<ref name=sunset/> They apparently have three kits, [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]]&nbsp;\u2013 however, in ''Long Shadows'', Squirrelflight admits that Brambleclaw is not the father of her kits, and she never even had kits in the first place.<ref name=longshadows/> Brambleclaw himself is unaware of this, according to Squirrelflight, until the end of ''Sunrise''. He becomes furious at Squirrelflight for lying to him.<ref name=sunrise/>  In'' The Fourth Apprentice'', it's revealed that they are not mates anymore due to this.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\">{{cite book|title=[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-155509-1}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Last Hope'', Brambleclaw succeeds Firestar as leader of ThunderClan, and appoints Squirrelflight his deputy, having finally forgiven her for her deception.<ref name=lasthope>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Warriors: Omen of the Stars: The Last Hope|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2012|isbn=978-0-06-155527-5}}</ref>\n\nBrambleclaw has mentored [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]]. Brambleclaw's siblings include Tawnypelt and four half siblings: Hawkfrost, [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], Tadpole and Swiftpaw. He is uncle to Tawnypelt's kits, including [[#Tigerheart|Tigerheart]], [[#Dawnpelt|Dawnpelt]], and [[#Flametail|Flametail]].\n\nBrambleclaw's parents are Goldenflower and Tigerstar, and it is revealed in ''Code of the Clans'' that Brambleclaw's grandparents are Pinestar and Leopardfoot.<ref name=codeoftheclans>{{cite book|title=[[Code of the Clans]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-166009-2}}</ref> He is great-grandson to Sweetbriar (Pinestar's mother), Adderfang and Swiftbreeze (Leopardfoot's parents); his both great-grandmothers being SkyClan's direct descendants (Cloudstar, Birdflight, Gorseclaw and Spottedpelt), Brambleclaw is himself part-SkyClan. He is also nephew to Mistkit and Nightkit (Tigerstar's sisters), Lionheart and Snowkit (Goldenflower's brothers), and great-nephew to Patchpelt, Willowpelt, Redtail and Spottedleaf (Leopardfoot's siblings).\n\n====Squirrelflight====\n<!-- Attention editors: Squirrelflight is not officially documented to be related to Ashfur so please do not add this to the article -->\n\n'''Squirrelflight''', a dark ginger she-cat with green eyes, is the daughter of [[#Firestar|Firestar]] and [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], as well as the littermate of [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]]. She and Leafpool share a special telepathic connection, in which one can always know what the other is thinking or feeling.<ref name=midnight/> She and Leafpool are first introduced as kits, Squirrelkit and Leafkit, in the epilogue of ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar/> In ''The New Prophecy'', Squirrelflight joins the prophesied cats to find Midnight at the sun-drown place, the prophesied cats being [[#Crowfeather|Crowpaw]], [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]], [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] and his sister [[#Tawnypelt|Tawnypelt]]. [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]] tags along as well so he can be with Feathertail, his sister.<ref name=midnight/> Squirrelflight is shown to be arrogant with a temper as an apprentice, but gradually matures during ''The New Prophecy'' series.\n\nAt first, she taunted and resented Brambleclaw, but later fell in love with him during their journey, similar to what happened with her parents, Firestar and Sandstorm. However, when Brambleclaw warms up to his half-brother and RiverClan warrior, [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], Squirrelflight begins to lose her trust in him, believing that Hawkfrost is as murderously ambitious as his father, Tigerstar, and that Brambleclaw will follow in his footsteps. During this time, Squirrelflight began to get closer to Ashfur.<ref name=twilight/> During the badger attack in ThunderClan camp that kills [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]], Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw realize how much they really mean to each other, and Squirrelflight leaves Ashfur to be with Brambleclaw. She tries to remain friends with Ashfur, but he rejects her friendship, feeling betrayed.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nAt the end of ''The New Prophecy'' series, Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw apparently have three kits; [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]]. Ashfur seems to have gotten over Squirrelflight, however he behaves rather strangely. In ''Long Shadows'', Ashfur admits that he was the one who helped Hawkfrost try to kill Firestar in ''Sunset'', in an attempt to hurt Squirrelflight emotionally. He then tries to kill her three kits in a forest fire, but Squirrelflight reveals that they aren't hers, so it would not hurt her that way. At the end of ''Long Shadows'', Ashfur is found mysteriously murdered by WindClan territory, Squirrelflight being a major suspect, but it is revealed in [[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]] that actually [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] killed Ashfur, trying to keep him quiet, as he was planning to tell the secret that Squirrelflight and [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] weren't her parents at a Gathering.<ref name=sunrise/><ref name=longshadows/>\nBrambleclaw is furious that Squirrelflight lied to him about Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather, and in Omen of the Stars, they are not mates anymore. At the end of ''The Last Hope'', he finally forgives her.\n\nWhen her father dies and Brambleclaw becomes leader, she becomes his deputy. In the manga at the end of ''Bramblestar's Storm'', it is revealed that she is not barren, as indicated earlier by Yellowfang, as she is expecting Bramblestar's kits. In ''The Apprentice's Quest'', she has kits Alderpaw and Sparkpaw. Alderpaw looks like his father Bramblestar and Sparkpaw looks like her grandfather Firestar.\n\nSquirrelflight was mentored by Dustpelt and has mentored Foxleap and Rosepetal.\n\n====Leafpool====\n'''Leafpool''', a slender light brown tabby she-cat with white paws and amber eyes, is the medicine cat of ThunderClan. She is the daughter of [[#Firestar|Firestar]] and [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], and the sister of [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], with whom she shares a unique telepathic connection, in which each can always know what the other is feeling.<ref name=midnight/> She is mentioned as a kit, Leafkit, named for [[#Leafstar|Leafstar]] and [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]], in the epilogue of ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'',<ref name=firestar/> and later as a medicine cat apprentice, Leafpaw, in ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'', mentored by her mother's (Sandstorm) cousin [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]].<ref name=midnight/>\nShe makes the Great Journey along with the four Clans in ''Dawn''<ref name=dawn/> and discovers the Moonpool in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'', the Moonstone equivalent in their new territory. Because of this, Cinderpelt gives Leafpaw her full medicine cat name, Leafpool. Leafpool also receives a frightening prophecy from StarClan: ''Before there is peace, blood will spill blood, and the lake will run red.''<ref name=starlight/>\n\nThis prophecy meant Brambleclaw killing Hawkfrost to save Firestar, Leafpool's father. When Leafpool arrives a little after Hawkfrost dies, not going to StarClan but to the Dark Forest seeing that he is just as evil as Tigerstar, she believes that Brambleclaw is a traitor, but when she sees that the blood on his pads weren't her father's but Hawkfrost's, she understood the prophecy at last.\n''Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost were kin; Blood had indeed spilled blood. Brambleclaw had killed his half brother to save Firestar. She had been right about Hawkfrost&nbsp;\u2013 he was too ambitious, too much like his father, Tigerstar-but she has never imagined that Brambleclaw would be the cat to stop him''.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nLeafpool starts to develop feelings for [[#Crowfeather|Crowfeather]], though they are from different Clans and Leafpool is not allowed to take a mate, being a medicine cat. After Cinderpelt finds out that she has been meeting Crowfeather, they attempt to run away to be able to be together in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''. However, when [[#Midnight|Midnight]] the badger arrives to warn the Clans of a badger attack, Crowfeather and Leafpool realize how much their Clans mean to them, and they decide to return. Unfortunately, Leafpool arrives too late to save Cinderpelt when the horde of badgers attack the ThunderClan camp, and continually expresses guilt because of her mentor's death throughout the rest of the series.<ref name=twilight/> She and Crowfeather agree never to see each other again, though for the rest of the books they are both oddly tense whenever they meet on occasion. Leafpool becomes the new ThunderClan medicine cat in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', and discovers that [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] is to be the new deputy in [[#Greystripe|Greystripe's]] absence and that he and Squirrelflight are destined to be mates, as well as the fact that her mentor, Cinderpelt, has been reincarnated as one of [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail's]] kits, [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]].<ref name=sunset/> Spottedleaf also reveals to her that [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], the RiverClan medicine cat and Leafpool's friend, does not believe in StarClan, a result of [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], her brother, tricking Mudfur into taking her as his apprentice and then openly sharing with her what truly happened. Leafpool is also featured in a play written by [[Victoria Holmes]], titled ''After Sunset: We Need to Talk'', in which she appears to have something to tell Crowfeather, but then denies it after Crowfeather confesses that he has taken a new mate, [[#Nightcloud|Nightcloud]], in WindClan.<ref name=\"firstplay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorcats.com/data/downloads/we_need_to_talk.pdf|title=After Sunset: We Need to Talk|last=Hunter|first=Erin|accessdate=June 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206040610/http://warriorcats.com/data/downloads/we_need_to_talk.pdf|archivedate=February 6, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n\nLater, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', she takes [[#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]] as her apprentice, who later decides to quit and become a warrior instead, confessing that she only wanted to be a medicine cat because of the position it would give her. Then, [[#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]], Hollypaw's brother, receives a message from StarClan telling him that he must become a medicine cat, and becomes Leafpool's new apprentice.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> Leafpool gives him his full medicine cat name Jayfeather, in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows/>\n\nIn \"Sunrise\" it is revealed that Leafpool is Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze's mother. Crowfeather is their father. Hollyleaf tells the truth at the Gathering and Crowfeather says that Leafpool, Jayfeather, Lionblaze and Hollyleaf mean nothing to him. Leafpool apologizes to the Clan for her deception and wilingly steps down as a medicine cat. Afterwards, Hollyleaf tries to kill her by forcing her to eat deathberries in the ThunderClan camp. Leafpool asks Hollyleaf what would be worse: if she stayed alive, disowned by Crowfeather, living without the love of her own kits, and no longer a medicine cat, or died; Hollyleaf stops forcing her and Leafpool walks out of the medicine cat's den.<ref name=sunrise/>\n\nIn ''Omen of the Stars'', she has become a warrior because she broke the Warrior Code by having kits. However, Jayfeather and Hollyleaf seem to view her as being incompetent as a warrior and are still furious about her deception. Lionblaze, however, seems to have forgiven her and respects and loves her as his mother. After the events of ''The Last Hope'', she becomes a medicine cat again, sharing the role with Jayfeather.\n\nShe is also niece to Princess (Firestar's sister), half-niece to Scourge, Ruby and Socks (Firestar's half-siblings), Ashfur and Ferncloud (Sandstorm's half-brother and half-sister), cousin to Cloudtail (Princess' son), granddaughter to Redtail and Brindleface (Sandstorm's parents), Jake and Nutmeg (Firestar's parents), great-niece to Willowpelt, Spottedleaf, Patchpelt and Leopardfoot (Redtail's brother and sisters), Dustpelt, Longtail, Ravenpaw and Frostfur (Brindleface's brothers and sister), and great-granddaughter to Adderfang and Swiftbreeze (Redtail's parents), and Fuzzypelt and Robinwing (Brindleface's parents).\n\n====Daisy====\n'''Daisy''' is a beautiful cream-colored long-furred she-cat with dazzling ice blue eyes who lived at the horseplace with two other cats named '''Smoky''' and '''Floss'''. She was afraid that the twolegs  (or 'Nofurs', as she initially referred to them as) at horseplace were going to take away her kits fathered by Smoky (originally named Berry, Mouse, and Hazel) because they had taken away Floss's litter, so she brought them to ThunderClan to keep them safe. Cloudtail volunteers to help teach her battle moves, and she develops feelings for him  over time. She does not enjoy training and complains frequently about the safety of her kits.<ref name=starlight/> She decides to go back to the horseplace following the badger attack in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', worried that Clan life is too dangerous for her kits, but is persuaded to return to ThunderClan by her kits, Berrykit, Mousekit and Hazelkit along with Brambleclaw and Cloudtail. It is also revealed that another reason that she left is because she realizes that Cloudtail will never return her feelings for him after she sees the way he loves [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], his mate.<ref name=sunset/> Her kits trained as ThunderClan warriors and received their warrior names, Berrynose, Mousewhisker, and Hazeltail, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> Daisy's first litter was fathered by Smoky, but her recent mate is Spiderleg, with whom she has two kits; [[#Rosepetal|Rosekit]] and [[#Toadstep|Toadkit]]. In ''Long Shadows'', it is revealed that Spiderleg and Daisy are no longer mates, and that Spiderleg \"never really wanted kits in the first place.\"<ref name=longshadows/> Daisy is a permanent member of ThunderClan, but she is not a warrior; she remains in the nursery throughout the series to help the queens. In ''Fading Echoes'', she becomes grandmother to Cherrykit and Molekit (Berrynose and Poppyfrost's kits).\n\n====Ferncloud====\n'''Ferncloud''' is a pale gray she-cat with darker flecks and pale green eyes. She is mentored by [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] (and [[#Longtail|Longtail]], after Darkstripe is exiled from ThunderClan) as an apprentice, '''Fernpaw''', during the original series. In ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' she helps to lure the dog pack away from the ThunderClan camp along with her brother, [[#Ashfur|Ashpaw]], to avenge the death of their mother, [[#Minor ThunderClan characters|Brindleface]].<ref name=\"dangerous path\"/> She is the mate of [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]], and mother of three litters: first litter: [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]] and [[#Minor ThunderClan characters|Shrewpaw]]; second litter: Hollykit, Larchkit, and [[#Birchfall|Birchfall]]; third litter: [[#Foxleap|Foxleap]] and [[#Icecloud|Icecloud]]. Unfortunately, Hollykit and Larchkit die from starvation, while Shrewpaw dies when he is run over by a monster while hunting a pheasant in ''Dawn''.<ref name=dawn/> Ferncloud is depicted as a gentle, motherly cat who remains in the nursery, where she is suited best. She helps to look after new kits with Daisy. Like Daisy and Goldenflower she usually doesn't leave the nursery but cares for kits.\nFerncloud is also niece to Frostfur, Dustpelt and Ravenpaw, granddaughter to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Brindleface's parents) and Adderfang and Swiftbreeze (Redtail's parents), cousin to Cinderpelt, Brackenfur, Thornclaw and Brightheart (Frostfur's kits), grandcousin to Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter), Honeyfern, Molepaw, Poppyfrost and Cinderheart (Brackenfur's kits), great-grandcousin to Cherrypaw and Molepaw (Poppyfrost's kits) Dovewing and Ivypool (Whitewing's daughters), recently grandmother to Rosepetal and Toadstep (Spiderleg's kits), half-aunt to Squirrelflight and Leafpool (Sandstorm's daughters) and great-half-aunt to Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze (Leafpool's kits).\n\nFerncloud is killed by Brokenstar during the Great Battle and eventually is reunited with Dustpelt in StarClan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Rainwhisker====\nA dark grey tom with blue eyes, '''Rainwhisker''' is a ThunderClan warrior first introduced in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' as a kit, Rainkit. He is the brother of [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] and [[#Sootfur|Sootfur]] and the son of Willowpelt and [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]].<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> He is later an apprentice, Rainpaw, mentored by [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]], in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.  As an apprentice, he was often sent to assist Cinderpelt.<ref name=firestar/> He becomes a warrior sometime between ''Firestar's Quest'' and ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]''. It is revealed in that he was killed by a falling tree branch during a storm between ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' and ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> He is uncle of Sorreltail's kits, including Poppyfrost, Honeyfern (deceased) Cinderheart, and Molepaw (deceased).

His mentor was Cloudtail, and he temporarily mentored [[#Dawnpelt|Dawnpaw]] of ShadowClan when Tawnypelt and her kits briefly left ShadowClan for ThunderClan in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''. Spiderleg's former mate was Daisy and they had two kits, [[#Rosepetal|Rosekit]] and [[#Toadstep|Toadkit]]. In ''Long Shadows'', it is revealed that Spiderleg no longer loves Daisy and that he \"never really wanted kits.\"<ref name=longshadows/> Spiderleg is overall a loyal warrior, but shares his sharp tongue with his father, Dustpelt, and is often one of the key characters to protest against something unusual. He shares the belief with Dustpelt, Thornclaw, and Ashfur that there are too many non-Clanborn cats in ThunderClan. He is one of the few completely \"forest-blooded\" cats left in ThunderClan. He is not one of the main characters, and often flits in and out of scenes in the books since his first real introduction as an apprentice, Spiderpaw, in ''Midnight''.\nSpiderleg's also nephew to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), grandson to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-grandson to Fuzzypelt and Robinwing (Brindleface's parents), great-nephew to Frostfur (Brindleface's sister), Longtail, Dustpelt and Ravenpaw (Brindleface's brothers), uncle to Dovewing and Ivypool (Birchfall's daughters) and kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brightheart, Brackenfur (Frostfur's kits), Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter), Poppyfrost, Honeyfern, Cinderheart and Molepaw (Brackenfur's kits)\n\n====Sootfur====\n'''Sootfur''', a light grey tom with amber eyes, is a ThunderClan warrior first introduced in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', the brother of [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] and [[#Rainwhisker|Rainwhisker]] and the son of Willowpelt and [[#Whitestorm|Whitestorm]].<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> He was seen as an apprentice, Sootpaw, in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''. During the events of the book, his mother Willowpelt dies saving him from a badger.<ref name=firestar/> Sootpaw is made a warrior, Sootfur, sometime between the events of ''Firestar's Quest'' and ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]''. Sootfur appears to be hotheaded and sometimes says somewhat rude things such as when he remarks that Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw may have made the right decision getting out of the forest when they did and when he remarks that Daisy would be too fat and lazy to run fast enough to catch mice.  In the fifth book of ''The New Prophecy'' series, ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', Sootfur is killed during the attack of the badgers invading ThunderClan camp.<ref name=sunset/>\n\nSootfur's mentor was originally [[#Longtail|Longtail]], but after Longtail was blinded by a rabbit in ''Firestar's Quest'', his mentor was changed to [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]].<ref name=firestar/> He is uncle of Sorreltail's kits, including [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]],(deceased) [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], and Molepaw (deceased).

Introduced in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' as Sorrelkit, an adventurous young kit, she followed her half-brother [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] and caught him speaking to Blackfoot, the ShadowClan deputy, on ThunderClan territory during the events of the book. She was seen by Darkstripe, who then tricked her into eating deathberries to keep her quiet about his treachery. After recovering, she told Firestar what Darkstripe did to her, bringing about his exile from ThunderClan.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nShe is an apprentice, Sorrelpaw, in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'', mentored by her cousin [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], although due to Sandstorm's being away from ThunderClan on the journey to find SkyClan during the events of the book, Sorrelpaw is temporarily mentored by [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]].<ref name=firestar/> In between ''Firestar's Quest'' and ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'', Sorrelpaw is struck by a monster (car), injuring her shoulder. Sorrelpaw eventually recovers under Cinderpelt's care, but has to train for longer than that of a usual apprentice. In ''Midnight'', Sorrelpaw finally receives her warrior name, Sorreltail, and becomes best friends with Leafpool. Whenever Leafpool needs to go out, she always asks Sorreltail to go with her.<ref name=midnight/> When the four Clans reach their new lake home, Sorreltail falls in love with [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and they became mates. Sorreltail gives birth to her kits in ''Twilight'' during an unexpected badger attack, but was saved by Cinderpelt, who died trying to defend Sorreltail and her kits. In the end, she gives birth to four kits, Molepaw (dead), Poppyfrost, Honeyfern (dead), and [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], named in honor of Cinderpelt, which is ironic because Cinderheart is the reincarnated form of Cinderpelt - even though Cinderheart doesn't know it herself.<ref name=sunset/> Later in ''The Forgotten Warrior'', Sorreltail and Brackenfur announce that she is carrying kits again, and in the ending chapter of the book, Sorreltail gives birth to two kits, which she names Seedkit and Lilykit. After 'The Last Hope', Sorreltail dies of her wounds. Sorreltail's also niece to Patchpelt, Leopardfoot, Spottedleaf and Redtail (Willowpelt's siblings), granddaughter to Swiftbreeze and Adderfang (Willowpelt's parents) and Snowfur and Thistleclaw (Whitestorm's parents), grandniece to Rosetail, Sweetpaw (Thistleclaw's siblings) and Bluestar (Snowfur's sister), great-granddaughter to Windflight and Poppydawn (Thistleclaw's parents) and Moonflower and Stormtail (Snowfur's parents), great-great-niece to Goosefeather (Moonflower's brother), and Pinestar (Poppydawn's brother), cousin to Tigerstar, Mistkit and Nightkit (Leopardfoot's kits), Longtail (Patchpelt's son), and Sandstorm (Redtail's daughter), second cousin to Brambleclaw, Tawnypelt, Tadpole, Mothwing and Hawkfrost (Tigerstar's kits), Squirrelflight and Leafpool (Sandstorm's daughters), and kin to Mistyfoot, Stonefur, Mosskit (Bluestar's kits), Greymist, Reedwhisker (Mistyfoot's kits), Mallownose and Sneezepaw (Greymist's kits), and Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze (Leafpool's kits).

The series is centered on the apparent children of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather, and the prophecy that was made about them.\n\n====Berrynose====\n'''Berrynose''' is a cream-colored tom, the son of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Smoky|Smoky]], the littermate of [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]] and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]], and the half-brother of Rosepetal and Toadstep. He is first introduced as a very young kit named '''Berry''' in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''. His mother, Daisy, takes him and his littermates away from the horseplace where they were born so the Twolegs inhabiting it would not take them away. After a ThunderClan patrol finds them, they join ThunderClan and Berry is given the Clan name of Berrykit.<ref name=twilight/> He is the most adventurous of his littermates, and he accidentally ventures into a fox trap while sneaking out of camp exploring in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' and loses half of his tail.<ref name=sunset/> This event causes him to be paranoid about his warrior name, afraid Firestar would give him a ridiculous name, such as 'Berrystumpytail'. He is first introduced as an apprentice, Berrypaw, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', mentored by [[#Bramblestar|Brambleclaw]].<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> He is shown to be an arrogant and disrespectful cat similar to [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]], especially after he is made a warrior in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> He criticizes even the littlest mistakes made by apprentices and refuses to listen to any criticism directed at him. It is revealed that [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]] has a crush on him. In ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]'' the two are seen getting along well and are assumed to be in love considering they were suggesting that they would have kits together. He is grief-stricken when she dies from a snake bite.<ref name=sunrise/> In the ''Omen of the Stars'' series, Berrynose is the father of Cherryfall and Molewhisker by Poppyfrost, Honeyfern's sister. Poppyfrost is extremely worried because she thinks Berrynose is still in love with Honeyfern, but it is revealed that Berrynose loves her as much, even more, and is just anxious to keep her safe.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/>\n\n====Blossomfall====\nA tortoiseshell she-cat with white patches on her pelt. '''Blossomfall''' is the daughter of [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] and [[#Millie|Millie]] and the littermate of [[#Bumblestripe|Bumblestripe]] and [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]] as well as the half-sister of [[List of RiverClan cats#Feathertail|Feathertail]] and [[List of RiverClan cats#Stormfur|Stormfur]]. She was first introduced in ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'', along with her littermates.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> She joined the Dark Forest to become a better warrior, but later finds out that the Dark Forest was going to kill Toadstep\nHer mentor is [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]]. She also develops a crush on [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]]. In ''Sign of the Moon'', Ivypool\ndiscovers that Blossomfall is being trained in the Dark Forest. She becomes very jealous of Briarlight because Millie acts as if Briarlight is her only kit. She also has Thornclaw as her mate.\n\n====Birchfall====\nA light brown tabby tom, '''Birchfall''' is Birchkit and Birchpaw in the ''New Prophecy'' series, and is first seen as a warrior in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> Birchfall is the son of [[#Ferncloud|Ferncloud]] and [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]], and as such is the brother of Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Icecloud, Foxleap, Hollykit, and Larchkit, of which the later two are his littermates. During the destruction of the forest in ''The New Prophecy'', his littermates, Hollykit and Larchkit, die of starvation, while his brother Shrewpaw dies when a tree cutter runs over him. As Birchkit, he makes the Great Journey across the mountains with the Clans to their new home, and becomes the first apprentice, Birchpaw, in ThunderClan's new camp.<ref name=dawn/> He was mentored by [[#Ashfur|Ashfur]]. Birchfall's current mate, Whitewing, stayed an apprentice waiting for Birchfall to be able to get his warrior name with her. Birchfall is also nephew to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), and Sandstorm (Ferncloud's half-sister), grandson to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-grandson to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Brindleface's parents), grandnephew to Frostfur (Brindleface's sister), and kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brightheart, Brackenfur (Frostfur's kits), Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter), Poppyfrost, Honeyfern, Cinderheart and Molepaw (Brackenfur's kits). Birchfall fathered [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] and [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]] with his mate, [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]]. Birchfall was seen training in the Dark Forest by his daughter, Ivypool.\n\n====Briarlight====\nA dark brown she-cat, '''Briarlight''' is the daughter of [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] and [[#Millie|Millie]] and the littermate of [[#Bumbleflight|Bumblestripe]]  and [[#Blossomfall|Blossomfall]], as well as the half-sister of [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]] and [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]]. She is first introduced in ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'', along with her littermates.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> She got sick with greencough when her mother, Millie, fell ill, but is in decent health by ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]''. She is nearly bitten by a snake in ''Sunrise'', but is saved by her cousin Honeyfern, who died.<ref name=sunrise/> In [[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]] she is mentored by [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]].<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> She becomes a warrior in [[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]] after being injured by a tree falling on her hind legs, permanently paralyzing them.<ref name=fadingechoes/>\n\nShe feels very guilty, for not being able to hunt, or patrol for her Clan (due to her broken backbone). As a result, she won't eat anything Millie brings her. Jayfeather's solution is for Briarlight to help him in his den (cleaning up herbs, making moss balls, and checking moss for bits of wood,dirt, and thorns). She also finds a small scrap of Hollyleaf's fur in ''The Forgotten Warrior''.\n\n====Bumblestripe====\n{{anchor|Bumbleflight}}\nA pale grey tom with dark black stripes, '''Bumblestripe''' is the son of [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] and [[#Millie|Millie]] and the littermate of [[#Blossomfall|Blossomfall]] and [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]], as well as the half-brother of [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]] and [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]]. He is said to be the biggest kit in his litter and was named for the stripes on his back, making him look like a bumblebee. He was first introduced in ''Eclipse'', along with his littermates.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> In ''[[The Fourth Apprentice]]'' he is mentored by [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]].<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> It is hinted by Blossomfall that Bumblestripe is in love with Dovewing in ''Sign of the Moon''.<ref name=signofthemoon>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Sign of the Moon|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-155518-3}}</ref>\nIn ''The Forgotten Warrior'', he is seen spending a lot of time with Dovewing and by the end of the book, he confesses to Dovewing that he wants to be more than friends. Following ''The Last Hope'', Dovewing begins a relationship with Bumblestripe, but in ''Bramblestar's Storm'', their relationship ends.\n\n====Cinderheart====\n'''Cinderheart''', a grey tabby she-cat with blue eyes, is a ThunderClan warrior first mentioned at the end of ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''<ref name=twilight/> and formally introduced in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She is initially revealed to be the reincarnation of [[#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]], the former ThunderClan medicine cat. This fact becomes clear to Leafpool in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' when Spottedleaf tells her where to find Cinderpelt and shows her Cinderkit. Cinderheart is not consciously aware of her situation and is very much her own character, though her personality is similar to Cinderpelt's before she was injured;<ref name=sunset/> [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather's]] attempts to walk in her dreams result in the personality of the original Cinderpelt revealing herself in the former ThunderClan camp in the forest, implying that Cinderpelt's spirit does indeed reside within Cinderheart's subconsciousness. [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] are the only cats that are aware of Cinderheart's true identity; while Leafpool wants to keep it a secret from Cinderheart indefinitely, Jayfeather wants to reveal the truth to her, thus adding heat to the already obvious indifferences of these two cats (as of ''Night Whispers'', Jayfeather has not revealed the truth to Cinderheart or anybody else).\n\nShe and Lionblaze seemed to become mates between Fading Echoes, and Night Whispers. She and Lionblaze seemed to be deeply in love, but Cinderheart breaks the relationship when Lionblaze tells her that he is part of the prophecy. She tells him that they can't be mates, and as a result, she breaks Lionblaze's heart. In ''The Forgotten Warrior'', Jayfeather convinces her that she and Lionblaze can become mates.\n\nCinderheart is StarClan's answer to Cinderpelt's dreams of becoming a warrior. She becomes an apprentice under [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]] along with Jayfeather, [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] and [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], her best friend, and others. In an ironic twist of fate, however, she falls from a tree branch in ''Dark River'' and injures her leg, in fact the same leg that Cinderpelt injured.<ref name=\"pwrbook2\"/> She is able to recover partially, but reinjures it during her assessment in ''Eclipse'' and is thrown into a state of depression (Cinderpaw's desire to become a warrior is as strong as Cinderpelt's, although it is unknown whether Cinderpelt herself influenced this personality). Jayfeather teaches her to swim in order to stretch and build the muscles without straining them, and by the end of ''Eclipse'', Cinderpaw is able to walk and run normally and receives her warrior name.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> Cinderpelt's original destiny having been fulfilled, it is unknown whether or not Cinderheart's reincarnation will contribute to future events.\n\nAt the end of ''Eclipse'', when she is given her warrior name, Firestar names her Cinderheart \"...in honor of those warriors who have gone before.\"<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> It is unclear whether Firestar is referencing Cinderpelt or not. Though Cinderheart is a reincarnation of Cinderpelt, in this new life she is the daughter of [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] and [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and the sister of Molepaw, who died from a sickness that didn't react to Leafpool's herbs.  [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]] and [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]] are also her siblings. Brackenfur and Cinderpelt are siblings so Cinderpelt and her reincarnation are actually related, Cinderheart being her niece. During ''Sunrise'', Honeyfern dies, and Cinderheart is grief-stricken. She tells Hollyleaf she shouldn't have said anything at the Gathering.  In \"Omen of the Stars\", Cinderheart is Ivypaw's mentor.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Cinderheart and Cinderpelt both fell in love with similar tom cats, since Lionblaze is Firestar's kin, that might also be part of Cinderheart's destiny.\n\nIn '' The Last Hope'', she still cannot decide whether to stay a warrior or be a medicine cat as in her past life. Lionblaze confronts her and tells her that she has a destiny, but she can choose. When she chooses to be a warrior and chooses to be Lionblaze's mate, Cinderpelt's spirit comes out of her body and mouths \"Thank you\" to Lionblaze before she goes to StarClan.\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', she has three kits with Lionblaze: Hollykit, Fernkit, and Sorrelkit, later Hollytuft, Fernsong, and Sorrelstripe.\n\n====Foxleap====\nA reddish tabby tom, '''Foxleap''' was first introduced as a kit, Foxkit, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> He is the son of [[#Ferncloud|Ferncloud]] and [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]] and the littermate of Icecloud as well as the brother of Shrewpaw, Hollykit, Larchkit, [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]], and Birchfall. He becomes an apprentice, Foxpaw, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', and is mentored by his cousin [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], but due to Squirrelflight's temporary departure to the Tribe of Rushing Water during the book, he is mentored by his aunt Sandstorm's cousin [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] for a while.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> His aunt [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]] also takes over as his mentor for Squirrelflight when she becomes ill in ''[[#Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows/> It is said that he wishes his warrior name to be '''Foxcatcher'''. Foxleap is nephew to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother) grandson to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brackenfur, Brightheart (Frostfur's kits), Honeyfern, Poppyfrost, Molepaw, Cinderheart (Brackenfur's kits) and Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter). He's also uncle to Dovewing, Ivypool (Birchfall's daughters), Rosepetal and Toadstep (Spiderleg's kits).\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', Foxleap is said to have died of his wounds shortly after the great battle. This is confirmed in ''Dovewing's Silence''.\n\n====Hazeltail====\n'''Hazeltail''' is a small grey-and-white she-cat, the daughter of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Smoky|Smoky]], the littermate of [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]] and [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]], and the half-sister of [[#Rosepetal|Rosepetal]] and [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]]. She is first introduced as a kit named '''Hazel''' in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', when her mother Daisy took her and her littermates away from the horseplace where they were born so the Twolegs there would not take them away. After a ThunderClan patrol found them, they joined ThunderClan and Hazel was given the Clan name of Hazelkit.<ref name=twilight/> In ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]] visits the nursery and shows her and Mousewhisker (then Mousekit) a butterfly, which she says they can catch, leading [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] to discover the truth about the RiverClan medicine cat, [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]].<ref name=sunset/> She was introduced as an apprentice, Hazelpaw, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', mentored by [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]],<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> and continues this apprenticeship until she becomes a warrior, Hazeltail, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', along with her littermates.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\nIn Sunrise, she meets her father, Smoky, and Floss for the first time.  Smoky appears proud of her and Floss is concerned when she mentions that Berrynose lost half his tail in a fox trap.<ref name=sunrise/>\nShe was the mentor of Blossomfall.\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', she is said to be killed by greencough.\n\n====Hollyleaf====\n'''Hollyleaf''', a slender black she-cat with green eyes, is a ThunderClan kit, apprentice and warrior introduced in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She is one of the protagonists of the ''Power of Three'' series with her ThunderClan brothers [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], and is on the cover of ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]''. Initially, Hollyleaf chooses to become a medicine cat as a result of the respect she sees other cats giving [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]], the current medicine cat, and wants to be considered extremely important to her Clan. She abandons this choice after a short time, as she cannot remember herbs very well and gets easily disgusted when dealing with wounds and injuries. She develops an affinity for battle training and realizes that she would best serve her Clan as a warrior, and begins training under [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]]. Hollyleaf learned under her mentor to be incredibly loyal and devoted to follow the warrior code.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> As a result, Hollyleaf highly disapproved of her brother Lionblaze's affinity for Heathertail, a WindClan she-cat.\n\nHollyleaf is considered the most cunning and bound to the warrior code of the three siblings, prone to thinking out strategies carefully rather than rushing in blindly. She is not one of the Three in the prophecy, even though both of her brothers are. As a result, she has no power. She is devoted to the warrior code and considers it to be the foundation of Clan life, and is terrified to think of a Clan operating without it. She has aspirations about becoming Clan leader, a function that she feels would best serve her Clan. Her ideologies differ from her brothers in this respect, in that she is always trying to think of what would benefit all cats and not just herself. Hollyleaf seems deeply burdened by responsibility upon learning of the prophecy concerning herself and her siblings. It was revealed in ''Long Shadows'' that Squirrelflight is not her mother. Her real parents are Leafpool and Crowfeather. In ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'', Hollyleaf becomes so obsessed with the code, she scares Jayfeather at one point. At the end of the book, she kills Ashfur to stop him from telling the clans that Squirrelflight is not her mother.<ref name=longshadows/> In ''Sunrise'', she goes mad having been the daughter of a medicine cat and a WindClan warrior thus breaking the warrior code. Eventually, in a Gathering, she reveals to every cat that Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw weren't the parents of her and Lionblaze and Jayfeather, but it was Leafpool and Crowfeather. Then, she runs into a tunnel which collapses onto her, leading most cats to believe she is dead.\n\nShe also tries to kill Leafpool by forcing her eat deathberries, but lets her go when Leafpool points out that it would be more painful for her to live on than die. Hollyleaf's extreme devotion to the warrior code eventually led to her downfall. While most thought that Hollyleaf was part of the Three, she truly was not. Rather, the three relates to Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Dovewing. She is proven alive in  ''The Forgotten Warrior'' and she returns to ThunderClan.\n\nShe is killed by Dark Forest warrior Hawkfrost while helping defeat Hawkfrost with  Ivypool, who brought Hollyleaf back to ThunderClan in '' The Last Hope '' and is seen walking out with the rest of the spirits of StarClan when they retrieve Firestar to go to StarClan.\n\nShe is great-granddaughter to Jake and Nutmeg (Firestar's parents), and Redtail and Brindleface (Sandstorm's parents), she is half-sister to Breezepelt (Nightcloud's and Crowfeather's son), granddaughter to Firestar and Sandstorm (Leafpool's parents) and Ashfoot, the WindClan deputy (and Crowfeather's mother), niece to Eaglekit (Crowfeather's brother) and Squirrelflight (Leafpool's sister), grandniece to Princess (Firestar's sister), half-grand-niece to Scourge, Ruby and Socks (Firestar's half-siblings) and kin to Cloudtail (Firestar's nephew), Whitewing (Cloudtail's daughter), Dovepaw and Ivypaw (Whitewing's daughters). As her father, Crowfeather, is a direct descendant to Windstar and Gorsestar (WindClan's first and second leaders), Hollyleaf is their descendant too. She's half-WindClan, 25% ThunderClan, 25% kittypet, and part SkyClan, because Spottedleaf is Sandstorm's aunt. As Spottedleaf is related directly to Birdflight's (Cloudstar's mate) kits, and Sandstorm is Hollyleaf's grandmother.\n\n====Honeyfern====\n'''Honeyfern''' is a light brown tabby she-cat with blue eyes and the daughter of [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]]. She is sister to [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], and Molepaw. She was first introduced as a kit, Honeykit, near the end of ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', and as an apprentice,<ref name=sunset/> Honeypaw, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''. She was mentored by [[#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], who also mentored her mother, Sorreltail.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She continues her apprenticeship for the rest of the series until she receives her warrior name, Honeyfern, in ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> It is revealed that she has a crush on [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]]. In ''Sunrise'' Berrynose starts to return the affection. Soon after, she dies of a snake bite while saving Briarkit, however.<ref name=sunrise/> In ''The Fourth Apprentice'', Honeyfern saves Jayfeather from Breezepelt when Breezepelt attacks the ThunderClan medicine cat at the Moonpool.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/>\n\n====Icecloud====\n'''Icecloud''' is a white she-cat with bright blue eyes, first introduced as a kit, Icekit, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She is the daughter of [[#Ferncloud|Ferncloud]] and [[#Dustpelt|Dustpelt]] and the littermate of Foxleap, as well as the younger sister of Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Birchfall, Hollykit (who died before the Great Journey) and Larchkit. Icepaw and Foxpaw shared dens with Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Hollyleaf before the three later became apprentices. She became an apprentice in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', mentored by Whitewing.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> It is said that she wishes her warrior name to be '''Icestorm'''. Icecloud is a niece to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), granddaughter to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-granddaughter to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Brindleface's parents), grandniece to Frostfur (Brindleface's sister), kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brackenfur, Brightheart (Frostfur's kits), Honeyfern, Poppyfrost, Molepaw, Cinderheart (Brackenfur's kits) and Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter). She's also aunt to Dovepaw, Ivypaw (Birchfall's daughters), Rosepetal and Toadstep (Spiderleg's kits).\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', she is said to be killed by greencough.\n\n====Jayfeather====\n'''Jayfeather''' is a grey tabby tom with blue eyes, and he is [[Blindness|blind]].<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> He is the brother of [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] as well as the half-brother of [[#Breezepelt|Breezepelt]], and one of the protagonists of the ''Power of Three'' series with his siblings. Jayfeather is currently a full medicine cat in\nThunderClan. Initially, Jayfeather wanted to become a warrior, because he desired to be just as important as his littermates to the Clan and felt that the duties of a medicine cat were insignificant compared to the glories a warrior could experience. He began warrior training under his grandmother's cousin [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]], but soon tired of it. He did not receive much training and barely explored ThunderClan's territory. In a rebellious act, Jayfeather decides to explore himself. This led to him walking over a cliff in the middle of WindClan's territory and falling into the lake. Luckily, a WindClan patrol consisting of Crowfeather, Heatherpaw, Breezepaw, and Whitetail was nearby, but because of this, Jayfeather is afraid of water after his father, Crowfeather, pulls him out. Later, Spottedleaf persuaded him to become a medicine cat. Jayfeather is very conscious of his condition and adamantly refuses to be treated differently because of it, as he hates the thought of being pitied.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/>\n\nDespite his inability to see, Jayfeather's other senses are greatly magnified and he is often able to navigate just as well as any other cat. His superior sense of smell enables him to diagnose medicinal ailments instantly and from a great distance away, a trait that is obviously ideal for a medicine cat. Jayfeather is able to hear and smell cats approaching from a great distance, well before any other cat nearby. In addition to his heightened senses, Jayfeather was born with a form of [[Extrasensory Perception|extrasensory perception]] which enables him to read other cats' minds, as well as enter the dreams of other cats and listen in on their conversations with members of StarClan. It is shown in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' that this ability extends to cats who do not fall under the jurisdiction of StarClan, such as cats of the [[List of characters in the Warriors novel series#The Tribe of Rushing Water|Tribe of Rushing Water]].<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> Jayfeather's mind-reading abilities can be blocked, however, if the intended target is aware of his intention; Leafpool is aware of her son's ability and consciously damps her thoughts whenever she does not want him in her head. Jayfeather is also unable to read the mind of [[#Sol|Sol]] because his thoughts are so rapid and many that he can't focus on him.<ref name=longshadows/>\n\nJayfeather's personality is somewhat on par with [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]] in that he is typically grumpy and easily angered. Jayfeather is the first to learn of the prophecy concerning himself and his siblings, and takes its meaning to imply that they are more important than any of the other cats and as such do not have to follow their rules. He has stumbled upon a seemingly insignificant stick which inexplicably emanates the thoughts and feelings of past members of the [[List of Warriors characters#Ancient Cats|Ancient Clans]], who used to live by the lake long ago.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> Many fans have claimed that he had a \"relationship\" with it<ref>forums</ref> until he broke it deliberately in The Fourth Apprentice, after finding out that Rock had been lying to him.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Jayfeather feels he is on the verge of a great discovery, the implications of which have greater importance than StarClan. He is also aware of [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]]'s reincarnation. Despite these pieces of knowledge, Jayfeather seems to care about his Clanmates and performs quite well as a medicine cat. Jayfeather has abilities that other medicine cats don't, such as walking in other cat's dreams. One of the first times he did this was when he followed Leafpool to the Moonpool and overheard her dream. Over the course of the series he has become more tolerant of his Clanmates and less irritable, mainly due to his liberal use of mind-reading and being able to sympathize with their thoughts.  It was revealed in ''Long Shadows'' that Squirrelflight is not his mother.<ref name=longshadows/> Prior to the release of ''Sunrise'', it was rumoured Leafpool and Crowfeather are his parents because of the attitude and coloring. This is found true which leads to Hollyleaf's so-called \"death\" and during his naming ceremony, Leafpool felt a feeling of love to him, and, in ''The New Prophecy'' series, Leafpool and Crowfeather were alone together at one point when they ran off. He saves Firestar after he is attacked by a fox in \"The Fourth Apprentice,\" although it was too late and he lost another life. He follows Poppyfrost (heavily pregnant with Berrynose's kits, Cherrypaw and Molepaw) to the Moonpool when she wants to see Honeyfern again, and gets attacked by Breezepelt, but Honeyfern drives him and another cat from the Dark Forest (Brokenstar) away. He is the first of the Three to learn about the battle between StarClan and the Dark Forest.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Jayfeather is a reincarnation of Jay's Wing, who was an [[#Ancient Cats|ancient cat]].<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> In \"Long Shadows\", he meets the cat he loves, Half Moon, who later becomes the first Teller of the Pointed Stones. Half Moon reappears in \"The Forgotten Warrior\" and says that she waits for him forever.\n\nHe is great-grandson to Jake and Nutmeg, Firestar's parents. He is also related to the leader of BloodClan, Scourge, because Firestar and Scourge are half brothers\n\n====Lionblaze====\n'''Lionblaze''', a muscular golden brown tabby tom with amber eyes and thick fur around his neck, is a protagonist of the ''Power of Three'' series with his siblings Jayfeather and Hollyleaf and is the half brother of Breezepelt, a WindClan warrior. He is secretly taught by the spirits of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]] and [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]] about different battle moves in ''Dark River''. A pretty young WindClan apprentice named [[#Heathertail|Heatherpaw]] convinces him to form a play Clan called '''DarkClan''' inside the underground tunnels, with the leader being Heatherpaw and the deputy being Lionblaze, under the assumed names '''Heatherstar''' and '''Lionclaw''', respectively. Lionblaze unknowingly falls in love with her, and she falls in love with him. [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] and [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]] find out about the meetings, and Hollyleaf threatens to tell. Lionblaze hates her nosiness. He enjoys the secret night meetings immensely, but falls behind in his training. One night, Lionblaze teaches Heatherpaw some of Tigerstar's moves and Hawkfrost gets angry, later rebuking him for teaching battle techniques to the enemy. He tells Lionblaze that Heatherpaw will probably use them against him in battle.  Lionblaze is devastated, and tells Heatherpaw that he won't see her anymore. She is deeply hurt, but Lionblaze stays true to his word.<ref name=\"pwrbook2\"/> Soon his battle and hunting skills improve again and his mentor, [[#Ashfur|Ashfur]], is pleased. No one is aware of his haunted visits with his apparent grandfather and uncle, and Hollyleaf notices that his fighting skills exceed the level for normal apprentices, and Brambleclaw recognizes his father's fighting moves. She and the other apprentices are horrified as Ashfur and Lionblaze begin a dangerous sort of play-fight, where they act as if the other is an enemy. Hollyleaf notes that Ashfur looked as if he hated Lionblaze with all his heart during the fight, but afterward praised him and acted proud.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\">Hunter, Erin.

(2007) ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]''. <!-- For Lionblaze:322pp --></ref> His power is the ability to remain unharmed during fighting.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> At the end of ''Eclipse'', Lionblaze has an argument with Tigerstar and Hawkfrost.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> This could be because of Tigerstar's teaching method and his constant bullying if Lionblaze doesn't train the way Tigerstar wants him to or if Lionblaze tries to talk to Tigerstar and Hawkfrost about the prophecy. He is chosen to mentor [[#Dovewing|Dovepaw]], the last of the Three in ''The Fourth Apprentice''. He is chosen to go find out what is causing the water not to flow along with Dovepaw, [[#Tigerheart|Tigerheart]] and Toadfoot of ShadowClan, Petalfur and Rippletail of RiverClan, and Sedgewhisker and Whitetail of WindClan.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/>\n\nSince the beginning of the ''Omen of the Stars'' series, Lionblaze has been growing closer to Cinderheart. In ''Night Whispers'', he asks Cinderheart if they are becoming more than friends and she agrees that they are. However, she later learns that Lionblaze is a part of the prophecy and claims that, since StarClan has chosen him to be someone with a greater destiny, she can not become his mate. She grows even more distant when her life as Cinderpelt's reincarnation is revealed. However, in ''The Last Hope'', he confronts Cinderheart about their destinies and they become mates, while Cinderpelt's spirit finally joins StarClan.<ref name=nightwhispers>{{cite book|title=[[Night Whispers (Warriors)|Night Whispers]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-155515-2}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the release of ''Sunrise'', it was speculated that Leafpool and Crowfeather were his parents. Also, in the latest \"Warriors New\" E-Mail, it mentioned \"the parentage of a certain trio of ThunderClan cats\" as well as \"the shocking rumors about who might really be their mother,\" hinting that the rumor may be true. It was revealed in ''Long Shadows'' that Squirrelflight is not his mother, and in ''Sunrise'' that Leafpool and Crowfeather are his true parents. Lionblaze's also half-brother to Breezepelt (Crowfeather's other son), grandson to Firestar and Sandstorm (Leafpool's parents) and Ashfoot, the ex-WindClan deputy (and Crowfeather's mother), nephew to Eaglekit (Crowfeather's brother) and Squirrelflight (Leafpool's sister), grandnephew to Princess (Firestar's sister),great-grandson to Jake and Nutmeg (Firestar's parents), half-grandnephew to Scourge, Ruby, and Socks (Firestar's half-siblings) and Ashfur and Ferncloud (Sandstorm's half-siblings) and kin to Cloudtail (Firestar's nephew), Whitewing (Cloudtail's daughter), Dovewing and Ivypool (Whitewing's daughters). He is also kin to Tigerstar, Nightkit and Mistkit (Sandstorm's cousin). He is father to Hollytuft, Sorrelstripe, and Fernsong (Cinderheart's kits). As his father, Crowfeather, is a direct descendant to Wind and Gorsestar (WindClan's first and second leaders), Lionblaze is their descendant too. He's half WindClan, a quarter ThunderClan, a quarter kittypet and a part SkyClan, because Sandstorm's aunt is Spottedleaf. He is the reincarnation of Lion's Roar, an ancient Tribe cat.\n\n====Mousewhisker====\n'''Mousewhisker''' is a grey-and-white tom, the son of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Smoky|Smoky]], the brother of [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]] and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]], and the half-brother of [[#Rosepetal|Rosepetal]] and [[#Toadstep|Toadstep]]. He was first introduced as a kit named '''Mouse''' in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', when his mother Daisy took him and his littermates away from the horseplace where they were born so the Twolegs there would not take them away. After a ThunderClan patrol found them, they joined ThunderClan and Mouse was given the Clan name of '''Mousekit'''.<ref name=twilight/> In ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'', [[#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]] visits the nursery and shows him and Hazelkit a butterfly, which she says they can hunt, leading [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] to discover the truth about the RiverClan medicine cat, [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]].<ref name=sunset/> He is later an apprentice, '''Mousepaw''', in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', mentored by [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]],<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> and becomes a warrior, Mousewhisker, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> In the battle in ''Eclipse'' he wounds his eye so [[#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]] guides him out of battle.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> He was the mentor of [[#Bumblestripe|Bumblestripe]]. He also trains in the Dark Forest.\n\n====Millie====\n'''Millie''' is a silver tabby she-cat, a former kittypet. She is first formally introduced in [[The Sight (Warriors)|''The Sight'']] (first book in the ''Power of Three'' series), when she and her mate [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] show up on the island that the Clan cats use for Gatherings. Though all the cats in every Clan were glad to see Greystripe alive, they were worried about his kittypet mate.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She later has three kits: [[#Bumblestripe|Bumblestripe]], [[#Briarlight|Briarlight]] and [[#Blossomfall|Blossomfall]]. In ''Long Shadows'', Millie is infected with greencough. [[#Silverstream|Silverstream]] watches over her, because \"Greystripe doesn't deserve to have his heart broken again\" due to Greystripe going into a cycle of grief after [[#Silverstream|Silverstream]] died having his kits.<ref name=longshadows/> In ''Sunrise'', [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]] died saving Briarkit from being bitten by a venomous snake.<ref name=sunrise/> In ''The Fourth Apprentice'', her kits are seen as apprentices.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> In ''Fading Echoes'' her kits receive their warrior names, Briarlight, Blossomfall, and Bumblestripe.<ref name=fadingechoes/> In Apprentice's Quest, she is an elder.\n\n====Poppyfrost====\n'''Poppyfrost''' is a tortoiseshell and white she-cat and the daughter of [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and [[#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]]. She is also the sister of [[#Cinderheart|Cinderheart]], [[#Honeyfern|Honeyfern]], and Molepaw. She was first introduced as a kit, Poppykit, near the end of ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'',<ref name=sunset/> and as an apprentice, Poppypaw, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', mentored by her uncle, [[#Thornclaw|Thornclaw]]. In ''The Sight'', Poppypaw comes close to dying due to an extreme case of greencough, but Jayfeather heals her by entering her dreams and leading her away from StarClan, and she recovers.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She continues her apprenticeship until ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'', when she receives her warrior name, Poppyfrost, along with her sister Honeyfern.<ref name=\"pwrbook4\"/> At the end of ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'', she gave birth to two unnamed kits, with Berrynose being the father.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Later in Fading Echoes, they are called Cherrykit and Molekit (in honor of her deceased brother Molepaw).<ref name=fadingechoes/> In \"The Fourth Apprentice\", she tells Jayfeather that she has always loved Berrynose, even when Honeyfern was alive.\n\nShe is niece to Rainwhisker, Sootfur (Sorreltail's brothers), Brightheart, Thornclaw and Cinderpelt (Brackenfur's siblings), granddaughter to Willowpelt and Whitestorm (Sorreltail's parents) and Frostfur (Brackenfur's mother), grandniece to Spottedleaf, Redtail, Patchpelt, Leopardfoot (Willowpelt's siblings) and Brindleface, Dustpelt and Ravenpaw (Frostfur's siblings), great-granddaughter to Snowfur and Thistleclaw (Whitestorm's parents), Swiftbreeze and Adderfang (Willowpelt's parents) and Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Frostfur's parents), great-grandniece to Sweetpaw, Rosetail (Thistleclaw's sisters) and Bluestar (Snowfur's sister), great-great-granddaughter to Windflight and Poppydawn (Thistleclaw's parents), Stormtail and Moonflower (Snowfur's parents), great-great-grandniece to Goosefeather (Moonflower's brother), cousin to Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter), grandcousin to Dovewing and Ivypool (Whitewing's daughters) and kin to Ferncloud, Ashfur (Brindleface's kits), Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Larchkit, Hollykit, Birchfall, Foxleap, Icecloud (Ferncloud's kits), Toadstep, Rosepetal (Spiderleg's kits), Tigerstar, Mistkit, Nightkit (Leopardfoot's kits), Brambleclaw, Tawnypelt, Hawkfrost, Mothwing, Tadpole (Tigerstar's kits), Tigerheart, Dawnpelt, Flametail (Tawnypelt's kits), Stonefur, Mistyfoot, Mosskit (Bluestar's kits). Poppyfrost's also related to SkyClan by Swiftbreeze being a direct descendant of Spottedpelt, Cloudstar and Birdflight's daughter, and sister to Gorseclaw, whose direct descendant is Sweetbriar, mother to Pinestar, former leader of ThunderClan.\n\n====Whitewing====\n'''Whitewing''' is a white she-cat with green eyes. She is first introduced as a kit, Whitekit, in the epilogue of ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' though she is almost an apprentice already,<ref name=firestar/> and as an apprentice, Whitepaw, throughout the ''New Prophecy'' series. She is one of two daughters of [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]] and [[#Brightheart|Brightheart]]. In between ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]'' and ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', she becomes a warrior, Whitewing. She was appointed much later than she could have been because she herself had wanted to remain behind so Birchpaw would not be the only apprentice. This is later confirmed when Birchfall complains about her getting an apprentice, with Sandstorm reminding him that Whitewing requested to stay an apprentice.<ref name=\"pwrbook1\"/> She was mentored by her uncle [[#Brackenfur|Brackenfur]] and received her first apprentice, [[#Icecloud|Icepaw]], in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> It is confirmed by the end of ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'' that she is carrying [[#Birchfall|Birchfall's]] kits, so therefore her status is now a queen.<ref name=longshadows/> In ''Sunrise'' she gave birth to two kits, [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] and [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]], of which Dovewing will become the last cat in the prophecy of the Power of Three, but as revealed in ''[[The Last Hope (Warriors)|The Last Hope]]'', Dovewing is, in fact, the third cat, with Firestar being the last and the fourth.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Whitewing's also granddaughter to Princess (Cloudtail's mother) and Frostfur (Brightheart's mother), great-niece to Firestar (Princess' brother), Brindleface, Longtail, Dustpelt and Ravenpaw (Frostfur's siblings), great-granddaughter to Fuzzypelt and Robinwing (Frostfur's parents), half-great-niece to Scourge, Ruby and Socks (Princess' half-siblings), niece to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw and Brackenfur (Brightheart's siblings), cousin to Honeyfern, Molepaw, Poppyfrost and Cinderheart (Brackenfur's kits) and kin to Leafpool, Squirrelflight (Firestar's daughters), Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf (Leafpool's kits), Sandstorm, Ferncloud and Ashfur (Brindleface's kits), Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Hollykit, Larchkit, Birchfall, Icecloud and Foxleap (Ferncloud's kits) and Toadstep and Rosepetal (Spiderleg's kits).\n\n====Rosepetal====\n'''Rosepetal''' is a dark cream she-cat first introduced in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> It is  revealed she has a crush on a ThunderClan tom, Foxleap. She is the daughter of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]], the littermate of Toadstep, and the half-sister of [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]], [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]], and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]].

Also related to Firestar, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf.\n\n====Toadstep====\n'''Toadstep''' is a black-and-white tom, first introduced in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', along with his sister Rosepetal.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> He is the son of [[#Daisy|Daisy]] and [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]], and the half-brother of [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]], [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]], and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]]. In The Fourth Apprentice, Toadstep was given his warrior name.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> He was mentored by Cloudtail.\nToadstep's also nephew to Shrewpaw, Larchkit, Hollykit, Birchfall, Icecloud and Foxleap (Spiderleg's siblings), cousin to Ivypool and Dovewing (Birchfall's daughters), grandson to Ferncloud and Dustpelt (Spiderleg's parents), grandnephew to Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), great-grandson to Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-great-grandson to Robinwing and Fuzzypelt (Brindleface's parents), great-grandnephew to Frostfur (Brindleface's sister) and kin to Cinderpelt, Thornclaw, Brightheart, Brackenfur (Frostfur's kits), Honeyfern, Molepaw, Poppyfrost, Cinderheart, Lilykit, Seedkit (Brackenfur's kits), Cherrypaw and Molepaw (Poppyfrost's kits) and Whitewing (Brightheart's daughter).\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', he is said to be killed by greencough.\n\n===''Omen of the Stars Series''===\n''Omen of the Stars'' is the fourth series in ''Warriors''.  The titles of all six books have been revealed: ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'' and ''[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]''. The third book's title is ''Night Whispers''. A fourth book has also come out, called  ''Sign of the Moon'', which came out in April 2011. The fifth book is called ''The Forgotten Warrior''. The final book in the series is titled ''The Last Hope''. The fourth series is centered on two sisters, [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]] and [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]], and which one of them is the third cat in the prophecy, as well as around [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], the other two cats in the prophecy. In  ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy (Warriors)|Bluestar's Prophecy]]'', it is revealed that both of the kits' grandmothers are Frostfur and Brindleface, who in the book are said to be sisters (Frostfur&nbsp;\u2013 Brightheart&nbsp;\u2013 Whitewing; Brindleface&nbsp;\u2013 Ferncloud&nbsp;\u2013 Birchfall). This either means that the book is incorrect or Dovepaw and Ivypaw's mother and father are related. This is not significant, as most of the Clan cats are related anyway.\n\n====Dovewing====\n{{anchor|Dovepaw}}\n'''Dovewing''', a fluffy pale grey she-cat whose eye color has been described as green, blue, and golden. No one actually knows what her true eye color is, although she has been described with green the most. She is the daughter of [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]] and [[#Birchfall|Birchfall]], and sister of [[#Ivypool|Ivypool]]. She was born at the end of ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]'' and it is mentioned that either she or her sister is the third cat of the prophecy, as [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] wasn't really part of the prophecy.<ref name=sunrise/> Her mentor is Lionblaze.\nIn ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'', it is revealed that her power is the ability to hear and see things that are very far away. Dovepaw is later found to be the third cat of the prophecy. Even though Dovepaw is excited about being the third cat in the prophecy, she hates to hide the secret from her clanmates.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> In ''Night Whispers'', Dovepaw ends up telling Ivypaw why she has such good senses; Ivypaw forgives her.  When she asks Jayfeather why she has to keep the secret from every cat, he asks her if she even wants to be special. She says yes, even if she doesn't. During her warrior assessment, when she decides to turn off her powers because other cats can hunt without special powers, she admits in her thoughts that Ivypool deserves to be a warrior more than she does.\n\nIt is also rumored that Dovepaw may have a crush on Tigerheart of ShadowClan. This is confirmed in ''[[Night Whispers (Warriors)|Night Whispers]]'', when the two of them admitted their feelings for each other. They began meeting on the ShadowClan-ThunderClan border by night,  and at one point Dovepaw mentioned to Tigerheart that ThunderClan had some catmint, a herb which could cure ShadowClan's sick medicine cat Littlecloud, but which was supposed to be a secret. Tigerheart told ShadowClan this information, and Ivypaw was captured and traded for the catmint.<ref name=nightwhispers/> In the books afterwards, Tigerheart seems to want to stay away from Dovewing to avoid speaking to her, though he does not believe that Jayfeather killed Flametail, unlike Dawnpelt. In the Sign of the Moon, Dovepaw earns her warrior name Dovewing. In ''The Forgotten Warrior'', she falls in love with Bumblestripe.\n\nDovewing is also granddaughter to Cloudtail and Brightheart (Whitewing's parents) and Dustpelt and Ferncloud (Birchfall's parents), great-granddaughter to Princess (Cloudtail's mother), Frostfur (Brightheart's mother), Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother) and kin to Leafpool, Squirrelflight (Firestar's daughters), Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Sorreltail, Honeyfern, Molepaw, Cinderheart and Poppyfrost. During her warrior assessment, Icecloud falls through the tunnels that supposedly buried Hollyleaf. Dovewing then rescues her, leading Jayfeather and Lionblaze\nto the fact that Hollyleaf might not be dead. Dovewing is the reincarnation of Dove's Wing, an ancient cat.\n\n====Ivypool====\n{{anchor|Ivypaw}}\n'''Ivypool''', a silver tabby-and-white she-cat with dark blue eyes, is the daughter of [[#Whitewing|Whitewing]] and [[#Birchfall|Birchfall]], and sister of [[#Dovewing|Dovewing]]. She was born at the end of ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]'' and it is mentioned that either she or her sister is the third cat of the prophecy, as [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] wasn't really part of the prophecy.<ref name=sunrise/> When revealed by Vicky Holmes that [[#Dovepaw|Dovepaw]] will be the Fourth Apprentice, she also stated that Ivypaw will not be happy about her sister's new found powers. Ivypaw's mentor is Cinderheart. In ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'', Ivypaw becomes jealous of Dovepaw because she gets to go on the journey upriver to find the source of the problem of the drying up lake (which is later revealed to be beavers). At the end of the book when Lionblaze and Dovepaw return, she seems to get over her jealousy.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> But in ''[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]'', Ivypaw becomes jealous of her sister again (this is after Firestar discovers that Jayfeather, Lionblaze and Dovepaw are the Three). Later on she begins to be trained in her dreams by Hawkfrost, thinking he's a StarClan warrior. Ivypaw then begins to feel special because \"Dovepaw has never been visited by a StarClan warrior, she would have told me\". At first Ivypaw seems happy to inform her sister that she was visited by a StarClan cat in her dreams, but decides against it later out of jealousy. She also does this because she \"wants to have a secret too\".<ref name=fadingechoes/> In Night Whispers, she is kidnapped by ShadowClan and traded for catmint because Littlecloud is ill with greencough. \nShe continues to visit the Dark Forest in ''[[Night Whispers (Warriors)|Night Whispers]]'', but realizes their evil intentions towards the end of the book and decides to keep going to the Dark Forest to spy on them for Dovepaw, Jayfeather, and Lionblaze. While there, Brokenstar tells her to kill the already dead Flametail, to keep him from helping ShadowClan. She agrees in order to gain Brokenstar's trust, but is stopped by Tigerheart.<ref name=nightwhispers/> In the Sign of the Moon, she earns her warrior name Ivypool.\n\nIvypaw's also niece to Spiderleg, Shrewpaw, Icecloud, Foxleap, Hollykit, and Larchkit (Birchfall's siblings), cousin to Rosepetal and Toadstep (Spiderleg's kits), granddaughter to Cloudtail and Brightheart (Whitewing's parents) and Dustpelt and Ferncloud (Birchfall's parents), greatniece to Thornclaw, Cinderpelt, and Brackenfur (Brightheart's siblings), Frostfur, Brindleface, and Ravenpaw (Dustpelt's siblings) and Ashfur (Ferncloud's brother), half-greatniece to Sandstorm (Ferncloud's half-sister) and Longtail (Dustpelt's half-brother), great-granddaughter to Princess (Cloudtail's mother), Frostfur (Brightheart's mother) and Brindleface (Ferncloud's mother), great-greatniece to Firestar (Princess's brother), and kin to Leafpool, Squirrelflight, Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Honeyfern, Molepaw, Cinderheart and Poppyfrost.\n\n====Mapleshade====\n'''Mapleshade''' is a large, primarily ginger, tortoiseshell-and-white she-cat with amber eyes and a long, thick, fluffy, white tail. She is a warrior of the Dark Forest who was originally a ThunderClan warrior. However, she ended up falling in love with RiverClan tom called Appledusk and they had kits together. When ThunderClan discovered this, Mapleshade and her kits were exiled as traitors. While fleeing from ThunderClan to RiverClan along with her three kits to be with her mate, Mapleshade's kits were swept away and drowned in the raging river. Appledusk blamed Mapleshade for the kits' deaths, and she found herself unwelcome in RiverClan as well. \n\nHeartbroken and enraged, Mapleshade swore eternal vengeance on the Clans. She murdered Ravinwing, the ThunderClan medicine cat who had revealed her secret and then Frecklewish, the ThunderClan leader's daughter who had watched her kits drown and made no move to help. Finally, when Appledusk took another she-cat as his mate, after having promised to love Mapleshade forever, she murdered Appledusk. However, by then, Appledusk's new mate was already expecting kits. Mapleshade knew Appledusk would live on in these kits and so swore revenge on her former mate's descendants. Because of the murders she committed, Mapleshade's spirit was denied entry into StarClan and instead sent to the Dark Forest.\n\nMapleshade visits Crookedkit (later Crookedstar) of RiverClan in dreams and visions starting before his apprenticeship, training him in exchange for his promise that he would place loyalty to his Clan above all other concerns. At first Crookedkit believes Mapleshade is one of StarClan. Her anger at his attachment to individual Clanmates confuses him. He obeys her when a dog attacks the RiverClan camp, chasing the dog and protecting the Clan instead of tending to the fatal injury delivered to his mother, Rainflower. Crookedstar suspects Mapleshade is responsible for sending the crooked-jawed squirrel sign that convinces Hailstar to make Crookedjaw his deputy after Shellheart retires to the elders' den. When Hailstar is injured on his last life, she headbutts Crookedjaw away while he attempts to save Hailstar's life.\n\nEventually, Mapleshade acknowledges to Crookedstar that she is not of StarClan but from the Dark Forest, and explains her evil actions and deception before explaing her tragic past. Lastly Mapleshade reveals that Shellheart, Crookedstar's father, was the grandson of her former mate, and that she feels her own descendants should have attained the greatness that is Crookedstar's destiny. Crookedstar blames Mapleshade for the illness and death of his mate Willowbreeze and two of their newborn kits, Willowkit and Minnowkit, in addition to the earlier deaths of Rainflower and Hailstar. She is responsible for killing Spottedleaf a second time.\n\n====Cherryfall====\n{{anchor|Cherrypaw}}\n'''Cherryfall''' is the daughter of [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]] and [[#Poppyfrost|Poppyfrost]], sister of [[#Molewhisker|Molewhisker]].

As such, WindClan cats are known for their speed and endurance, a skill that is imperative for hunting their main source of prey, rabbits.<ref name=\"secrets\">{{cite book|title=Warriors Field Guide: Secrets of the Clans|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-123903-8|title-link=Secrets of the Clans|date=2007-05-29}}</ref>{{rp|176}} WindClan have been driven off their territory by [[#ShadowClan|ShadowClan]] by the time Firepaw enters the forest, but are soon brought back with the aid of Fireheart and Graystripe.<ref name=\"fire and ice\" /> WindClan are forced to deal with attacks from both ShadowClan and [[#RiverClan|RiverClan]] throughout the series, since they are seen as being the weakest Clan. As a result, WindClan often allies itself with [[#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]], a recurring relationship that has further repercussions in later series.\n\nWindClan, along with the other Clans, undergoes a dramatic shift in territory during the course of ''The New Prophecy'' series. During the time that Crowpaw and the others are on their journey, much of WindClan territory is destroyed as the Two Legs proceed with their deforestation of the area.<ref name=moonrise>{{cite book|title=Moonrise|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-074452-6|title-link=Moonrise (Warriors)|date=2005-08-02}}</ref> Eventually, WindClan and the other Clans are able to relocate to the lake territory, the WindClan camp of which is an area much resembling their old territory: wide-open hills and moors. Their territory is between ThunderClan's and RiverClan. A Twoleg horse place (horse ranch) is located nearby, and occasionally dogs living there are set loose and chase the WindClan cats. The open hills give the greatest view of the surrounding area, and a WindClan cat is typically positioned on top of one of them as a lookout, able to detect threats much more quickly than in the forests. WindClan undergo a rather stressful period in leadership when Tallstar, their wise leader, dies of old age and changes his successor from Mudclaw to Onewhisker at the last minute.<ref name=starlight>{{cite book|title=Starlight|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082762-5|title-link=Starlight (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the ''Power of Three'' series, WindClan have resolved to become more hostile towards ThunderClan as a result of their being viewed as ThunderClan's \"puppets\" in the past. Onestar, once a warm and thoughtful friend of Firestar, has completely withdrawn his previous relationship with the ThunderClan leader. WindClan cats often hunt prey near and over ThunderClan's borders, the reasoning being that ThunderClan is stretched too thin to defend itself. This attitude climaxes in ''Eclipse'', when the entirety of WindClan sneak into ThunderClan's camp to start the largest battle ever conceived in the history of the series.<ref name=eclipse>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Eclipse|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-089208-1|title-link=Eclipse (Warriors)|date=2008-04-22}}</ref>{{rp|336}}\n\n====Heatherstar====\n'''Heatherstar''' is a pinkish-gray she-cat with blue eyes.

Many characters mentioned here were introduced in the original series, but play minor or significant roles in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series as well.\n\n====Onestar====\n'''Onestar''', a small, mottled-brown tabby tom with amber eyes, is the leader of WindClan for the last two books of the second series, the entirety of the third and fourth series, and the first three books of the fifth series.\nWhen [[#Firestar|Fireheart]] and [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] brought WindClan home in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'', '''Onewhisker''' became close friends with Fireheart and still retained this friendship even when WindClan were angry with ThunderClan for sheltering Brokentail.<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/>  In ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', in the battle with BloodClan, Onewhisker was nearly killed by the BloodClan leader, Scourge, if not for Firestar saving him.<ref name=\"darkest hour\">{{cite book|title=The Darkest Hour|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-052585-9|title-link=The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|date=2005-10-04}}</ref>\nLater, in ''Starlight'', Tallstar appoints Onewhisker deputy on the brink of death, which meant that Onestar was now the leader of WindClan, though Tallstar didn't use the right words for appointing a deputy.<ref name=starlight /> At first Onestar is very timid about his new position, but after he receives his nine lives and name from StarClan, he becomes more confident and concludes that there can be no more friendship between WindClan and ThunderClan, and WindClan must prove itself capable of taking care of itself without help from others. He then assumes a more leader-like attitude and abandons his friendship with Firestar. Rock states in ''[[Cats of the Clans (Warriors)|Cats of the Clans]]'' that Onestar knows more than any other cat thui \nin the Clans about the loneliness that power brings and that he truly misses Firestar.<ref name=catsotc>{{cite book|title=Cats of the Clans|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|year=2008|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-145856-9|title-link=Cats of the Clans (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the story arc ''Power of the Three'', Onestar becomes increasingly hostile towards Firestar and ThunderClan, occasionally ordering his warriors hunt both near and over their borders. He claims ThunderClan thinks it's better than the other Clans and ignores the warrior code by taking in non-Clan born cats. In the book ''Eclipse'', he decides to teach Firestar a lesson and launches an attack with the whole of WindClan on ThunderClan through the tunnels. This leads to all four Clans fighting, with ShadowClan siding with ThunderClan and RiverClan siding with WindClan. The battle is only stopped by an eclipse.\n\nThroughout the next story arc ''Omen of the Stars'', Onestar remains largely hostile towards ThunderClan, even accusing them of plotting an invasion against WindClan in ''The Forgotten Warrior'', even though, as it turns out, he has no evidence for his false accusation. However, in the final book, ''The Last Hope'', he unites with the other Clans to defeat the Dark Forest cats. In the super edition ''Bramblestar's Storm'', however, Onestar resumes his hostile attitude towards ThunderClan, now led by Bramblestar. During the flood, he orders his warriors to shift the border between WindClan and ThunderClan without talking to them so that WindClan can have the water in the stream all to themselves, as it's their only source. However, Bramblestar and his warriors later revert the border back to its original setting after chasing out the trespassing WindClan warriors and dislodging the fallen tree trunk which they have been using to cross the stream. At the end of the super edition, Onestar agrees to Bramblestar's proposal of adding a new law to the warrior code only reluctantly.\n\nBy the time of fourth series, ''A Vision of Shaduows'', Onestar is now very old and has a graying muzzle. In the second book ''Thunder and Shadow'', Onestar loses a life to the rogue cat Darktail. This incident causes him to go rather mad, punishing his Clanmates for breaking the warrior code the slightest. He holds ShadowClan responsible for the rogues because they didn't drive them out sooner and refuses to give them a special herb which can cure the sickness that's spreading through their Clan. After several failed attempts to reason with Onestar, ShadowClan holds Twigpaw, a ThunderClan apprentice, hostage in return for ThunderClan giving them the herb. However, Onestar realizes what Jayfeather and Alderpaw are trying to do, and refuses to give ThunderClan the herb. Kestrelflight and Harespring are forced to go behind his back to bring the herb to ShadowClan, outraging Onestar. However, many cats, including some from his own Clan, look at him accusingly when Rowanstar blames Onestar. Nevertheless, Onestar refuses to accept his mistake, calling ShadowClan a bunch of rogues.\n\nIn the next book, ''Shattered Sky'', it is revealed that Darktail is actually Onestar's biological son. Onestar reveals that when he was still known as Onewhisker, he fell in love with a kittypet called Smoke. He refused to let her join WindClan when she revealed she was expecting his kits, partly because it wasn't the life for her and partly because he was afraid of what would happen to him if his Clan found out he'd mated with a kittypet. The only one of their litter to survive was Darktail, whom Onewhisker turned away for the same reason as his mother. This rejection caused Smoke to raise Darktail to hate his father, the Clans and their way of life.\n\nBecause he has made many mistakes which led to terrible consequences, Onestar is afraid that he will be sent to the Dark Forest when he dies. Kestrelflight points out that the Dark Forest is for cats who are pure evil and assures Onestar that he was never evil. Onestar admits that his fears where selfish and apologizes for his actions (according to the authors, this includes his hostility toward Firestar, which he secretly always felt bad about). Onestar rights his wrongs when he confronts Darktail, and engages him in a fight that results in both cats drowning each other.\n\n====Tallstar====\n'''Tallstar''', a black and white tom with amber eyes and a very long tail, was the leader of WindClan before [[#Onestar|Onestar]]. Tallstar and his Clan were chased off from their territory by ShadowClan under [[#Brokentail|Brokenstar]]'s rule until [[#Firestar|Fireheart]] and [[#Greystripe|Greystripe]] brought them back. WindClan began a friendship with ThunderClan afterward as a result of this, although it faltered when Tallstar became furious with ThunderClan for sheltering Brokentail, the cat who drove them out of their territory. When Bluestar suspects WindClan of allegedly stealing prey, Fireheart seeks Tallstar to talk with Bluestar in peace. In ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', when Tigerstar announces joining all four Clans and territories into a single alliance, Tallstar and Firestar both reject his offer. After BloodClan attacks, Tallstar and Firestar agree to fight them with the other Clans in a temporary alliance, called LionClan.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>\n\nTallstar loses his last life in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'' with Onewhisker and Firestar at his side, making him the only cat to have served as a Clan leader throughout the entire original series. He switched the deputy from Mudclaw to Onewhisker on his deathbed, fearing that Mudclaw was not the right cat to lead WindClan after his death because, in the end, he wanted to keep the friendship with ThunderClan. He feared that Mudclaw would do harm to ThunderClan because he had shown signs of bloodthirstiness.<ref name=starlight />  He mentors Morningflower and Deadfoot. His warrior name was '''Talltail'''. He is born Tallkit, but another kit, a tom named Shrewkit, calls him Wormkit because of his expected destiny of digging tunnels. Both his mother and father (Palebird and Sandgorse) want him to be a tunneler, but Tallkit wishes to be a moor-runner, free to run and catch prey out on the open moors. Heatherstar, the leader of WindClan in Tallkit's days, recognizes his eagerness to run and apprentices him to be a moor-runner. Sandgorse is especially displeased, and he despises Tallkit as he reveals his true wishes.  When Sandgorse dies in a tunnel collapse apparently due to the actions of a loner named Sparrow, Palebird mates with another tunneler named Woolytail and gives birth to his half-siblings. Tallpaw takes offense that his own mother is not grieving for Sandgorse and instead mated with another cat and says that her kits are another excuse to stay in the nursery as Palebird had been in the nursery ever since he was born and when his littermate, Finchkit died right after being born. Tallpaw swears vengeance upon Sparrow. After completing his training, he leaves the clan to pursue Sparrow, and, after days of traveling, he finds where Sparrow and his traveling friends are making camp. Talltail plans to attack Sparrow at night, but after Talltail has a talk with Sparrow, the night he was supposed to kill Sparrow, the loner reveals that Sandgorse actually sacrificed himself so he could escape. Talltail has mixed emotions that night, and the next day, he decides to go back to WindClan in peace. When Talltail comes back, Heatherstar reveals that she knew this was going to happen and when she got her 9 lives, StarClan warned her that a cat would have to travel far to realize where his true destiny lied and that warrior leader cat was him not a kittypet.\n\n====Deadfoot====\n'''Deadfoot''', a black cat with a crooked front paw, was the former deputy of WindClan under [[#Tallstar|Tallstar]], and was deputy when ShadowClan chased them out of their territory. Like [[#Onestar|Onewhisker]], Deadfoot became friends with [[#Firestar|Fireheart]] when he and [[#Graystripe|Graystripe]] brought WindClan home. Deadfoot wasn't seen alive after ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. He appears in StarClan as the cat who chooses Crowpaw (his son) (later Crowfeather) to go on the journey to the sun-drown place. Victoria Holmes confirmed that he died in the battle with BloodClan. He was the mate of Ashfoot and was the father of Crowfeather and Eaglekit. He was originally a kit of Meadowslip named Hopkit, but he twisted his paw and when he was apprenticed, Heatherstar named him Deadpaw. Meadowslip is horrified, and states that Heatherstar can't change Hopkit's name because of the way he looks, but \nDeadpaw says it's fine.\n\n===''The New Prophecy Series''===\n''The New Prophecy'' series covers events in the story from ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' to ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''. Many characters here were first mentioned in the original series, but had minor or insignificant roles. In addition, as with the original series, most characters listed here play minor or significant roles in the following series, ''Power of Three'', as well.\n\n====Crowfeather====\n{{anchor|Crowpaw}}\n'''Crowfeather''' is a muscular, smoky grey tom with blue eyes,<ref name=fourthchat>{{cite web|url=http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/2998 |title=Erin Hunter Chat #4 Transcript &mdash;January 19, 2008 |publisher=Wands and Worlds |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505035257/http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/2998 |archive-date=May 5, 2008 }}</ref> first introduced in ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' as an apprentice, Crowpaw.

He chose his warrior name based on her to honor her memory.\n\nNot long after they reached their new home, he fell in love with [[#Leafpool|Leafpaw]] (later Leafpool), the ThunderClan medicine cat. He revealed his affections in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'', when he saves Leafpaw from falling to her death.<ref name=starlight /> It has been revealed that his relationship with Feathertail was more like \"highschool romance\", and his relationship with Leafpaw was the real thing. She returned his feelings and the two decided to meet on the border between their Clans, where a stream runs through. Eventually Leafpool's mentor, Cinderpelt, finds out, and the two leave their Clans in order to be together. However, they weren't away for long before they returned and broke off their connections, as [[#Midnight|Midnight]] had told them about a plot her kin had made to destroy the Clans. Crowfeather moves on to mate with a she-cat named [[#Nightcloud|Nightcloud]] and has a son, [[#Breezepelt|Breezepelt]]. He is the father of [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], and [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], with Leafpool being the mother. Crowfeather shows little affection to Nightcloud and even less paternal love for his son, due to the fear he'd lose him. Nightcloud loved Crowfeather, but he never returned her love, making them an awful couple. However, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', a den collapses on Breezepelt and [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]], and Crowfeather is worried for his son's life.<ref name=thesight>Hunter, Erin.

Fiercely loyal to WindClan and highly aggressive to all other cats, Mudclaw was appointed deputy of WindClan after the death of Deadfoot. As ''The New Prophecy'' series continues, [[#Tallstar|Tallstar]] continues to grow more ill and Mudclaw takes over many of his duties, often acting as a secondary leader. It also implied that he even occasionally steals prey from the other Clans without his leader's knowledge.\n\nWhen Tallstar is about to die, he abruptly replaces Mudclaw with [[#Onestar|Onewhisker]] as deputy, thus effectively revoking Mudclaw right to become leader. His reasons for doing so involve Mudclaw hostile demeanour, which he fears would lead WindClan into a state of chaos. Mudclaw is outraged by this and conspires with [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]] of [[List of Warriors characters#RiverClan|RiverClan]] in order to overthrow Onewhisker and take back the position he believes is rightfully his. Before his plan can succeed, however, [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] and a number of [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]] cats interfere, resulting in Mudclaw being crushed by a falling tree. The tree now serves as a bridge to an island where the Clans now have Gatherings. Mudclaw does not reside in the Dark Forest/Place of No Stars with Tigerstar, Darkstripe, and Hawkfrost as a result of his revolt, as he truly felt he was doing the right thing.\n\n===''Power of Three Series''===\nThe ''Power of Three'' series covers events in the story from ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' to ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]''.\n\n====Heathertail====\nA pretty, well-mannered light brown tabby WindClan she-cat with stunning heather-colored eyes, '''Heathertail''' develops a close friendship with [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] during ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' and ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]''.<ref name=darkriver>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Dark River|isbn=9780060892050|publisher=HarperCollins|url=https://archive.org/details/warriorspoweroft00erin_3|date=2007-12-26}}</ref><ref name=thesight />   Heathertail discovers a series of secret tunnels connecting WindClan and [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]]'s territories and shares this knowledge with Lionblaze. The two then begin to meet each other during the night in the tunnels, pretending to be members of the fictional DarkClan, of which Heathertail is the leader. These meetings eventually take a toll on both cats' daily lives, and Heathertail is hurt when Lionblaze decides that they must put their respective Clans first and that their relationship can no longer continue. Heathertail's relationship with Lionblaze is further strained in ''Eclipse'' when Lionblaze, in a bloodlust caused from the Clan-wide battle started by WindClan, where he accuses her of betraying the secret of the tunnels to her Clanmates.<ref name=eclipse />  Heathertail denies this, but Lionblaze does not believe her and vows to forever be her enemy, thus shattering their friendship. Lionblaze might have realized what he has done, but when he attempted to speak with Heathertail and possibly say he was sorry, she acted as if she didn't want to be near him. In a Wands and World chat it is revealed that she feels no affection toward Breezepelt, and still loves Lionblaze.\n\nIn ''Long Shadows'' of the ''Power of Three'' series, Lionblaze takes catmint from WindClan territory to treat a large breakout of greencough. Heathertail confronts him, reminding him to not become a bully like his kin Tigerstar.\n\n====Breezepelt====\nA black tom with amber eyes, '''Breezepelt''', the son of [[#Crowfeather|Crowfeather]] and [[#Nightcloud|Nightcloud]], is a headstrong WindClan warrior first introduced as an apprentice, Breezepaw, in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]''.<ref name=thesight />  He often makes tactless remarks and is not afraid to voice his negative opinions. He has been shown to panic during times of crisis, and is quick to argue. Despite his grumpy demeanor, Breezepelt has been known to cooperate on a few occasions, losing his hostile attitude almost completely in favor of the task at hand. In ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', he joins his father and the other Clan cats on the journey to the Tribe of Rushing Water to aid them in defeating a group of intruders.<ref name=\"powerbook3\"/>  It has been revealed that much of Breezepelt errant behavior stems from a lack of support from his father, Crowfeather, who shows little regard for his well-being. Crowfeather's reasons for rejecting his son are most likely due to his past (and still ongoing) love interest in Leafpool. He is also half-brother to Hollyleaf, Jayfeather and Lionblaze, because they all have the same father: Crowfeather. Mentored by Whitetail.  When it is revealed, he takes the fact his father has three kits in another Clan very badly. In ''The Fourth Apprentice'', he follows Poppyfrost to the Moonpool.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\">{{cite book|title=The Fourth Apprentice|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-155509-1|title-link=The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)}}</ref> He threatens to kill her when Jayfeather shows up, stating that he hates his half-siblings and would never forgive them for what their mother did. Ignoring Jayfeather's pleas, he attacks the two ThunderClan cats. Poppyfrost, who is pregnant, is unable to fight him off, so Jayfeather is forced to fight his half-brother himself, along with Honeyfern, who helps Jayfeather, and Brokenstar, who helps Breezepelt. It is revealed that he is being trained by Dark Forest, and is part of the battle between StarClan and the Dark Forest. During the Great Battle, his father, Crowfeather stops him from killing Lionblaze. In Crowfeather's Trail, Breezepelt reconciles with his [[wikt:estranged|estranged]] Father and Lionblaze.\n\n====Nightcloud====\nA black she-cat, '''Nightcloud''' is introduced in ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' as the mate of [[#Crowfeather|Crowfeather]] and the mother of their son, [[#Breezepelt|Breezepelt]].<ref name=thesight />  Her relationship with Crowfeather is depicted as somewhat distant, as Crowfeather does not seem to have any genuine affection for her. Nightcloud is clearly aware of Crowfeather's past relationship with [[#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and resents Leafpool for Crowfeather's ongoing affection for her, even though Leafpool is a medicine cat from another Clan and she can never love him.  This implies that Crowfeather took Nightcloud as a mate only out of necessity in an attempt to either \"move on\", or, as Rock states in ''[[Cats of the Clans (Warriors)|Cats of the Clans]]'', to prove his loyalty to WindClan.<ref name=catsotc />  Nightcloud cherishes her son, Breezepelt, and is shown to be angered by Crowfeather's lack of affection for him. Later on in Sunrise, she gets furious when Hollyleaf says Crowfeather is also mates with Leafpool. Crowfeather's inability to love Nightcloud causes them to [[Breakup|break up]]. However they reconcile in Crowfeather's Trail even though they never become mates again.\n\n===Minor WindClan characters===\nThe following are WindClan characters introduced or appearing in the ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' novel series, having small, less significant, and/or single instances in the story.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|+Minor Characters in '''WindClan'''\n!style=\"background:#D4AF37; color:white\"|Name || style=\"background:#D4AF37; color:white\"|Pelt Color || style=\"background:#D4AF37; color:white\"|Description\n|-\n|style=\"background:#D4AF37; color:white\"| '''Acorntail''' ||?|| Mentioned in ''Code of the Clans''.

The situation leads to the creation of the twelfth code.\n|}\n\n==ShadowClan==\n'''ShadowClan''' territory is mainly in a giant collection of [[swamp]]s and [[bog]]s and thick wet grass covered in thick pine trees, giving the area a dark and gloomy feel.<ref name=secrets /> ShadowClan cats are skilled at hunting and navigating in near-complete darkness, because the night is when their main sources of prey are active.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/> Along with lizards, frogs, and small forest animals, such as voles, ShadowClan also occasionally catch rats who reside in the nearby '''Carrionplace''' (garbage dump); however, they must be careful when eating these rats as they occasionally carry harmful diseases. ShadowClan are often depicted as the primary antagonists of the series, and as such many of their individual members are rude and hostile. However, many ShadowClan cats are completely devoted to their leader; since a number of ShadowClan's leaders have been truly villainous, the actions of their followers have expectedly followed suit. Some cats say that ShadowClan cats are so mean because the cold wind in their territory supposedly chills their hearts.\n\nShadowClan, along with the other Clans, undergoes a dramatic shift in territory during the course of ''The New Prophecy'' series. During the time that Tawnypelt and the others are on their journey, much of ShadowClan's territory is destroyed as the Twolegs proceed with their deforestation of the area.<ref name=moonrise /> Eventually ShadowClan and the other Clans are able to relocate to the lake territory, the ShadowClan camp of which is located in a dense pine forest. Though not quite the same as the marshes they used to inhabit, the thickness of the forest often shrouds the territory in gloom and darkness, perfectly suited for ShadowClan's stealth prowess. The area is not very suitable for prey, however, resulting in ShadowClan inhabiting the least desirable territory once again. Despite their bad luck, they manage to feed themselves decently enough (a testament to the tenacity of ShadowClan warriors). The forest's primary hazard is a Twoleg house on the northern fringes of ShadowClan's territory, home to two violent kittypets who often attack Clan cats who stray too close and call their Twolegs to fend off patrols. ThunderClan assists in telling these two cats to leave the Clan cats alone in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''.<ref name=twilight/>{{rp|352}}\n\n===''Warriors'' (original series)===\nThe original series covers events in the story from ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' to ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''.

In ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'', Boulder brought Tigerstar to BloodClan to meet its leader Scourge.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> Boulder revealed to [[#Firestar|Firestar]] that after [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]] was killed, BloodClan attacked their Clan and some ShadowClan warriors had joined them.

Blackfoot, along with Brokenstar, Clawface and Boulder, were chased out of their territory. Blackfoot lived as a rogue with Brokenstar and attacked the ThunderClan camp under his command. When [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]] became leader of ShadowClan, Blackfoot was appointed deputy again. In TigerClan, Blackfoot helped [[#Darkstripe|Darkstripe]] kill [[#Stonefur|Stonefur]] because he was a half-Clan cat, causing [[#Firestar|Firestar]] to view him as untrustworthy, even when he agreed to fight on their side with LionClan. After the battle with BloodClan, he announced that he would prepare for his journey to Highstones to receive his nine lives and his new name, as he was now leader of ShadowClan due to Tigerstar's death. He is introduced as a leader in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar/> In ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', Blackstar seems to lose some hostility towards ThunderClan, as he reminisces with Firestar about the old forest after two ThunderClan warriors were found in ShadowClan territory.<ref name=outcast>Hunter, Erin.

During the battle in ''The Last Hope'', Blackstar kills Redwillow for training in the Dark Forest and later loses a life due to an attack on the ShadowClan camp, but quickly recovers and thanks Firestar for his help in back-up warriors.\n\nIn ''Bramblestar's Storm'', he dies as a result of a flood, making Rowanclaw leader.\n\n====Clawface====\nClawface is a cruel and evil warrior.

He was the son of Raggedstar and [[#Yellowfang|Yellowfang]], but didn't know that the latter was his mother, who bore him and two she-kits (who died) in secret.

It's time to return to the forest... where we belong.\"\n\nHe has also made an appearance in ''The Fourth Apprentice'' where he attacks Jayfeather along with Breezepelt as a \"ghost cat\".<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> They were both driven off by Honeyfern before they could kill him or Poppyfrost. He, along with Tigerstar and Hawkfrost, watch over Poppyfrost's kits greedily at the end of the book. He also makes Ivypool attempt to kill Flametail, before Tigerheart stops her and Tigerstar agrees with Tigerheart.\n\nHe appears again in ''The Last Hope'' where he and the other Dark Forest cats invade the ThunderClan camp. During the battle he kills Ferncloud who was guarding the nursery before being killed by Yellowfang a second time causing him to die and fade away forever.\n\n====Nightstar====\n'''Nightstar''', a lean, but frail, black tom with amber eyes and a long tail, was the leader of ShadowClan before [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]]. After [[#Brokenstar|Brokenstar]] was driven out of ShadowClan in ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'', '''Nightpelt''', one of the Clan's senior warriors, offered to take leadership of ShadowClan and appointed Cinderfur as his deputy.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>  However, in ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'', he became violently ill due to the sickness from Carrionplace raging through the ShadowClan camp at the time and died, though he apparently had nine lives to spare.<ref name=\"rising storm\" /> [[#Runningnose|Runningnose]], ShadowClan's medicine cat at the time, later told [[#Firestar|Fireheart]] that Nightstar had never actually received his nine lives when he first journeyed to the Moonstone, perhaps due to the fact that Brokentail, ex-leader of ShadowClan, was still alive and remained ShadowClan's leader in the eyes of StarClan. Following Brokentail's death, Nightstar was too weak to travel back to the Moonstone and died sometime in ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'', thus allowing Tigerclaw to take control of ShadowClan. Nightpelt has mentored Dawncloud.<ref name=\"rising storm\" />\n\n====Tigerstar====\nTigerstar (born Tigerkit) is a huge dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes and unusually long front claws. He is born in ThunderClan, son of Pinestar and Leopardfoot, but is [[exile]]d for attempting to [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|murder]] Bluestar, the former leader of ThunderClan. He is mentored by Thistleclaw, and because his father, Pinestar, left the Clan to become a kittypet, and he tries to prove he will not leave ThunderClan as his father did, but Tigerclaw was enraged by the fact that his own Clan didn't trust him. Before he is exiled, he accuses his apprentice, Ravenpaw, of [[treason]], and mates with Goldenflower, a ThunderClan she-cat. They have two kits, Tawnykit (later Tawnypelt) and Bramblekit (later Bramblestar). He then retreats with a sworn vengeance on ThunderClan. He reappears in ShadowClan as Tigerstar. At the time, Shadowclan is in need of a strong leader; they are in chaos because of the sudden death of Nightstar, the leader who never receives the traditional nine lives from StarClan. Tigerstar is more than willing to lead them. He brings rogues to the Clan, and when his cats question his leadership, Tigerstar meets it with violence and ferocity. He spends the rest of his life plotting against Fireheart, and one of his plans includes leading wild dogs directly into the ThunderClan camp. Bluestar is killed while saving Firestar. Since he is deputy before she dies, he becomes Firestar, leader of ThunderClan. Before Tigerstar dies at the claws of Scourge, a vicious cat and the leader of BloodClan, he becomes mates with a loner named Sasha. They have three kits, Tadpole, Hawk (later Hawkkit, then Hawkfrost), and Moth (later Mothkit, then Mothwing). Tadpole dies, drowning in a basement flood. Instead of going to StarClan, Tigerstar is sent to the Place of No Stars, or the Dark Forest. There he still plans his \"revenge\" on Firestar. In the end, in ''The Last Hope'', his spirit is finally and permanently destroyed by Firestar.\n\n====Tall Shadow====\nAppearing in the ''Dawn of the Clans'' series, Tall Shadow is a night black she-cat with dark green eyes. Her only known family is her brother, Moon Shadow, and [[nephew]], Sun Shadow. Born in the mountains, she leaves with a fraction of the Tribe to find a new home. After the leader of the group, Shaded Moss, dies, she takes up the leadership position. She sets up the camp in the moor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sun Trail|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> She eventually steps down and becomes a co-leader with Gray Wing after Moon Shadow dies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thunder Rising|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Eventually, she leaves the moor and sets up a new camp in the marsh.

Many characters here were first mentioned in the original series, but had minor or insignificant roles. In addition, as with the original series, most characters listed here play minor or significant roles in the following series, ''Power of Three'', as well.\n\n==== Tawnypelt ====\nA slender, mottled, calico she-cat with green eyes and well-muscled shoulders (though as a kit she was listed as a golden tabby), '''Tawnypelt''' is the daughter of Goldenflower and [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]], as well as the littermate of [[#Brambleclaw|Brambleclaw]] and half-sister of [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]], [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], Tadpole and Swiftpaw. When she lived in ThunderClan as an apprentice, Tawnypaw, most of her Clanmates did not trust her because her father was Tigerstar, so instead of putting up with their suspicions, she left ThunderClan to join ShadowClan, then part of an alliance under Tigerstar's rule called TigerClan, in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>  She became a loyal ShadowClan warrior, though some of her Clanmates still doubt her allegiances because she was born in ThunderClan. Her full warrior name is revealed in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar />  In ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'', she is chosen as the ShadowClan representative on the quest to find a new home for the Clans.<ref name=newbook1 />  Coincidentally, her brother, Brambleclaw, is also chosen, as the ThunderClan representative.\n\nTigerstar offered her the same plan of power he offered to her brothers, Hawkfrost and Brambleclaw, to make her leader of ShadowClan, but she rejected him, saying that if she were ever to become leader, it would be through honesty and loyalty. In the ''Power of Three'' series, she mates with Rowanclaw to have three kits: [[#Dawnpelt|Dawnkit]], [[#Tigerheart|Tigerkit]] and [[#Flametail|Flamekit]].\n\nShe goes with her brother, Brambleclaw, [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]], [[#Brook Where Small Fish Swim|Brook]], [[#Crowfeather|Crowfeather]] and his son [[#Breezepelt|Breezepaw]], [[#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]], [[#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]], and [[#Lionblaze|Lionpaw]] in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' to help the Tribe of Rushing Water deal with a group of rogues that have invaded their territory.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  In ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'', Tawnypelt and her kits leave ShadowClan temporarily and go to ThunderClan after Blackstar loses faith and denounces StarClan.<ref name=longshadows />  Tawnypelt is tough and stands for nothing from no one, but has an affectionate side that comes through when her friends need her.<ref name=starlight/><ref name=\"newbook3\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Dawn|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=27 December 2005|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dawnwarriorsnewp00erin/page/368 368]|isbn=978-0-06-074457-1|title-link=Dawn (Warriors)}}</ref><ref name=\"newbook2\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Moonrise|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=1 August 2005|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/moonrisewarriors00erin/page/320 320]|isbn=978-0-06-074454-0|title-link=Moonrise (Warriors)}}</ref><ref name=\"newbook1\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Midnight|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=10 May 2005|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/midnight00hunt/page/336 336]|isbn=978-0-06-074451-9|oclc=66296992|title-link=Midnight (Warriors)}}</ref><ref name=\"newbook5\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Twilight|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=22 August 2006|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/starlightwarrior00erin/page/352 352]|isbn=978-0-06-082762-5|oclc=86112121|title-link=Twilight (Warriors)}}</ref><ref name=\"newbook6\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Sunset|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=26 December 2006|series=[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]|volume=6|pages=320|isbn=978-0-06-082769-4|oclc=70673118|title-link=Sunset (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\n=== '' Power of Three '' ===\nThe ''Power of Three'' series covers events in the story from ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' to Sunrise.\n\n==== Tigerheart ====\nThe son of Tawnypelt and Rowanclaw and the brother of Dawnpelt and Flametail, '''Tigerheart''' is a handsome, sleek dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes and straight, thick whiskers. He is the grandson of Tigerstar, whom he is named after. While resembling the latter, he is very cheerful and kind.\n\nHe is first introduced as a kit, Tigerkit, in ''Dark River'' and later as an apprentice in ''Long Shadows''. He is the best hunter out of his siblings.  In ''Long Shadows'', Tigerheart, along with his siblings and Tawnypelt, leave ShadowClan temporarily for ThunderClan after ShadowClan loses its faith in StarClan. He also helps Lionblaze, Hollyleaf and Jayfeather to convince Blackstar to believe that StarClan still watch over them by creating a fake StarClan sign. Tigerheart had the same mentors that his mother Tawnypelt did, both when she was in ThunderClan and ShadowClan. He was temporarily mentored by Brackenfur, while staying in ThunderClan and was mentored by Oakfur when he returned to ShadowClan. In The Fourth Apprentice, there are hints about him having a crush on Dovepaw, Lionblaze's apprentice. This is confirmed in ''Night Whispers'', when the two of them admitted their feelings for each other. In ''Sign of the Moon'' and ''The Forgotten Warrior'', Tigerheart's relationship with Dovewing is damaged after Dovewing's sister, Ivypaw, is captured and traded for catmint, a result of Tigerheart telling his Clan about the herb.\n\n==== Flametail ====\nThe second son of Tawnypelt and Rowanclaw, and the brother of Dawnpelt and Tigerheart, '''Flametail''' has a bright ginger pelt like his father and faded light green eyes, thick fur, a bushy tail, and short, pudgy legs. He dreams of becoming a medicine cat under Littlecloud instead of a warrior, probably based on his bond with [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] and curiosity. He was first introduced as a kit, Flamekit, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'',<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  and as an apprentice in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows />  In ''Long Shadows'' he leaves ShadowClan for ThunderClan with his siblings and Tawnypelt after ShadowClan loses faith in StarClan, and also helps create the fake StarClan sign.<ref name=longshadows />  He was temporarily mentored by [[#Cloudtail|Cloudtail]] while staying in ThunderClan, and is being trained to be a medicine cat in Sunrise by Littlecloud. Flametail died when he drowned in the frozen lake in ''Night Whispers''.<ref name=nightwhispers>{{cite book|title=Night Whispers|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-155515-2|title-link=Night Whispers (Warriors)}}</ref> His sister Dawnpelt thinks that Jayfeather is the one who drowns him, but it is because of Rock, an ancient cat, that Jayfeather is not able to save Flametail.\n\n==== Dawnpelt ====\nThe only daughter of Tawnypelt and Rowanclaw and the sister of Flametail and Tigerheart, '''Dawnpelt''' has a creamy pelt and a fiery personality much like her mother, and seems to be closer to [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]] than her other apparent cousins, [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] and [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], and is the best fighter out of her siblings. She was first introduced as a kit, Dawnkit, in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'',<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  and as an apprentice in ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]''.<ref name=longshadows />  She left ShadowClan for ThunderClan with her mother and littermates after it lost faith in StarClan, and helped to create the fake StarClan sign. She was temporarily mentored by [[#Spiderleg|Spiderleg]] when she stayed in ThunderClan. Her mentor was revealed in ''Sunrise'' as Ivytail. In ''The Forgotten Warrior'', she blames Jayfeather for Flametail's death.<ref name=sunrise/>\n\nIn ''Thunder and Shadow'', the second book of ''A Vision of Shadows'', Dawnpelt is one of the many ShadowClan cats who choose to desert Rowanstar and join Darktail's rogues. She does this mainly because her rebellious kits have joined the rogues and she doesn't want to leave them or her home. In the next book, ''Shattered Sky'', Dawnpelt, along with most of the deserters, grows to regret her decision after seeing how cruel and dishonourable Darktail and his rogues truly are. She decides to leave along with her sons Strikestone and Juniperclaw, but not her daughter Sleekwhisker, who is implied to have a crush on Darktail. However, just as Dawnpelt is leaving, she is caught by Darktail and disappears after an argument with him. It is unknown exactly what happens to her, but is heavily implied that Darktail took her to the lake and drowned her, along with several other former ShadowClan cats who tried to leave. Dawnpelt is confirmed to be deceased in ''Darkest Night'', when she appears among the spirit of the cats who died during Darktail's reign. She is shown to deeply regret her decision to abandon the Clans and the fact that she gave up her life trying to make it right. She later gives her brother Tigerstar, one of his nine lives.\n\n=== '' A Vision of Shadows '' ===\n\n====Needletail====\nA silver-grey she-cat with a white chest and bold green eyes, '''Needletail''' is the daughter of Berryheart and Sparrowtail.\n\nIn ''The Apprentice's Quest'' and ''Thunder and Shadow'', she is a rebellious and disrespectful apprentice, who, along with many others feels that ShadowClan needs to be feared again. She is angry when Rowanstar turned away Darktail's rogues. Needlepaw openly [[Criticism|criticized]] Rowanstar, and she was punished for speaking out against her leader. Her words later spark controversy within ShadowClan. When Darktail asks again to join ShadowClan, Rowanstar denies them, and Needlepaw leads an apprentice rebellion against Rowanstar, claiming she, along with the other apprentices do not want to live like Clan cats and leave to join the rogues. Needlepaw, Juniperpaw, and Sleekpaw leave, and Needlepaw taking the young Violetkit with her. Although their fellow apprentices Yarrowpaw, Beepaw, and Strikepaw decide to stay in ShadowClan, Beepaw, Cloverfoot, and Berryheart follow in suit. Upon joining the rogues, Needlepaw grants herself her warrior name, Needletail, along with Sleekpaw and Juniperpaw, who become Sleekwhisker and Juniperclaw.\n\nIn the ''Thunder and Shadow'' Barnes & Noble exclusive chapter, Needletail, then Needlepaw, is shown training with Tawnypelt. An [[owl]] takes her and no patrols are sent out to search for her. She meets a rogue named Tree, and he takes her back to ShadowClan. Needlepaw is deeply hurt and disappointed to learn that her Clanmates assumed she was dead, sending her on the path of rebelliousness.\n\nIn ''Shattered Sky'', Needletail is shown to have become one of Darktail's most loyal followers, and is perfectly content when Darktail makes them into the Kin and leaves the weaker cats to fend for themselves. Needletail becomes Violetpaw's only friend during the reign and believes Darktail to be the true leader ShadowClan needs. However, along with the majority of the former ShadowClan cats, she grows to regret her [[Treason|betrayal]] after realizing that Darktail is a brutal [[tyrant]] who wishes nothing more than to inflict harm onto other cats. She becomes part of the plot to get rid him, but this backfires when Sleekwhisker notices Violetpaw putting [[poppy seed]]s in Darktail's prey. Darktail decides to punish Violetpaw by killing the one thing she has left, Needletail. Needletail [[Suicide attack|sacrifices]] herself to allow Violetpaw to escape to ThunderClan, and as a result is drowned by Darktail, Sleekwhisker, and Roach.\nNeedletail's actions are remembered by Violetpaw, and Needletail's parents, Berryheart and Sparrowtail, greatly miss their daughter and are distraught to know that she, at the time, was one of Darktail's most devoted followers.\n\nIn ''Darkest Night'', it is revealed that along with all the other cats who were drowned by Darktail, Needletail was not granted entry into StarClan, nor the Place of No Stars. Instead, she has been sent to an unnamed residence where she connects with Tree, to who she admits she was wrong to trust Darktail, and later her childhood friend, Alderheart, giving him a prophecy to not dispel the incoming shadows. Upon doing so, Needletail and the other cats are allowed into StarClan. In ''River of Fire'', Needletail, despite having previously acknowledged her mistakes, continues to blame Rowanstar for ShadowClan's downfall for being a \"weak leader\". Shadowstar rebukes her statement, saying there is more to it than that, and Needletail seemingly accepts her point.\n\nOn Kate's Blog, Kate Cary stated that she has sympathy for Needletail, but she can't understand why she was so \"crabby\".\n\n===Minor ShadowClan characters===\nThe following are ShadowClan characters introduced or appearing in the ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' novel series, having small, less significant, and/or single instances in the story.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|+Minor Characters in '''ShadowClan'''\n!style=\"background:#001010; color:white\"|Name || style=\"background:#001010; color:white\"|Pelt Color || style=\"background:#001010; color:white\"|Description\n|-\n|style=\"background:#001010; color:white\"| '''Applefur''' || Mottled Brown || Kit mentioned in ''The New Prophecy''.

Their camp was located where the Twolegplace where Barley's farm currently sits and they have the unique ability to jump very high, a technique that has been passed on to some kittypets and rogues in the rocky canyon. SkyClan's camp also spread over to where Firestar's friend, Smudge, lives. They were driven out when their part of the forest was excavated to create Twolegplace. Homeless and starving, SkyClan appealed to the other Clans for help, but none of them wanted to redivide their territory and as such SkyClan was forced to leave the forest. They traveled north along the river before finally settling in a rocky canyon. Before long, however, an intelligent and malicious horde of rats attacked and killed most of the Clan, forcing the remnants to scatter across the nearby forest and Twolegplaces.<ref name=firestarsquest>Hunter, Erin. (2007) ''[[Firestar's Quest]]''. 610pp.</ref>\n\nModern SkyClan was reformed when Firestar, with the help of Sandstorm, set out to reunite the lost descendants of the Clan throughout the nearby area. Later, after rebuilding the lost Clan, SkyClan was able to defeat the rat pack and live in peace for moons to come under leadership of Leafstar. SkyClan is still trying to make their clan larger since at the moment it is very small. SkyClan have warriors that are at the gorge in the morning but sleep with their human owners at night. These cats are called \"Daylight warriors\", but the warriors in the clan sometimes call them \"Kitty warriors\".\n\nThey are eventually driven out by The Kin who claim the Gorge as their own. During their exile, SkyClan is discovered by a ThunderClan apprentice named Twigpaw (later Twigbranch) who is revealed to be Hawkwing's daughter shortly afterwards. Twigpaw brings her kin back to the Lake Territories where she Introduces Hawkwing to her sister Violetpaw (later Violetshine). With all of the five clans together, Darktail and his rouges are defeated.\n\n===Current SkyClan===\n\n====Leafstar====\n'''Leafstar''', a brown and cream tabby she-cat with amber eyes, was a rogue named '''Leaf''' before she came to SkyClan. After she joined, Firestar gave her the warrior name of '''Leafdapple''', and she mentored Sparrowpelt. StarClan later chose Leafdapple to be leader because of her thoughtful personality and understanding of the warrior code. Firestar at first doesn't feel comfortable with her being the leader, but he realizes how perceptive she is when she tells him that she knows his first loyalty is to his own Clan at home.  During her leader ceremony, the ancient leaders of the four Clans come together to give her four of her nine lives as an apology to SkyClan for driving them out.

At first she was unsure of interpreting dreams from her warrior ancestors, but later grew into her role as a medicine cat. Later, Fawnstep, the medicine cat of SkyClan at the time of its exile, said she would be sharing dreams with her, implying that Fawnstep would be Echosong's mentor, in the way that Leafpool was Willowshine's mentor when Mothwing could not teach her about StarClan.<ref name=firestar /> She receives the vision that makes Leafstar leader.\n\n====Skywatcher====\nA scarred, very old, dark grey tom with matted fur and pale blue eyes, '''Skywatcher''' was also known as '''Moony'''.

He died in his sleep, but Firestar believes that he wanted to live to see SkyClan rebuilt. He returns to give Leafstar one of her nine lives and he is also the cat to inform Firestar of the ''Power of Three'' prophecy: \"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws.\"<ref name=firestar/><ref name=sight>Hunter, Erin.

Stick is a little hostile to Leafstar because she refused to kill Dodge in Skyclan's Destiny.\n\n====Shorty====\nBrown tom with a stub for a tail and amber eyes. '''Shorty''' joined SkyClan but when it was time for his warrior naming, he decided to keep his name, similar to what Stick did. He stayed at his town after the battle with Dodge.\n\n====Coal====\nBlack tom with amber eyes and a long coat. '''Coal''' joined SkyClan but when it was time for his warrior naming, he decided to keep his name.

'''Curlypaw''' trained under Hawkwing before leaving SkyClan to become a Kittypet.\n\nAncient SkyClan cats\n\nNot much is known about the ancient SkyClan cats, who were driven out of the forest by Twolegs, as not many details were added. There are more cats, but some of their names are not mentioned in the book.\n\n===Skystar===\nFormerly a mountain cat, Skystar is the first leader of SkyClan. His parents are Quiet Rain and Dewy Leaf and his brother was Gray Wing. First called Clear Sky, he abandoned his son Thunder, later becoming the first leader of ThunderClan.\n\n====Cloudstar====\nA small, light pale grey tom with white patches like clouds, huge water-blue eyes, thorn-sharp claw tips, and a neat, well-shaped head, '''Cloudstar''' was the leader of SkyClan when they were driven from the forest. Cloudstar and his Clan used to live in what is now the Twolegplace and were forced to leave the forest because of human developments over that area, despite asking other Clans for assistance. Cloudstar's mate, Birdflight stayed behind with ThunderClan because of her kits. Cloudstar came into Firestar's dreams to plead for help and to tell him that he must rebuild SkyClan, and also visited the dreams of Firestar's old friend Smudge, whose house is situated over the place where the SkyClan camp used to be. In the end, SkyClan was rebuilt and Cloudstar comes to give Leafstar one of her nine lives and reunites with Birdflight, as well as their kits, Spottedpelt and Gorseclaw. Because of Spottedleaf and Tigerclaw's striking resemblance to Spottedpelt and Gorseclaw, it is believed that they are descended from SkyClan.<ref name=catsotc/>{{rp|91}}<ref name=firestar />\n\n====Buzzardstar====\nCloudstar's deputy, a ginger tom with green eyes.

Birdflight was Cloudstar's mate, and stayed behind in ThunderClan to save her kits, Spottedpelt and Gorseclaw.\n\n====Fernpelt====\n'''Fernpelt''' is a dark brown tabby she-cat.

BloodClan does not have a warrior code, do not believe in StarClan, and do not have the organization structure found in the other Clans. As a result, BloodClan is run in the style of a [[dictatorship]], and cats who either break the rules or desire to leave are maimed or killed.<ref name=darkesthour>Hunter, Erin. (2004) ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. 336pp.</ref>\n\n=== Bone===\nBoney is a huge, muscular, battle-scarred, black-and-white tom with green eyes. He serves as the unofficial \"deputy\" of [[#BloodClan|BloodClan]], and is [[#Scourge|Scourge]]'s main enforcer, performing his dirty work. He also wears a collar around his neck similar to Scourge's. Said collar has similar dog and cat teeth. He kills Whitestorm during the final battle in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' before being swarmed and killed by a group of apprentices: Bramblepaw, Tawnypaw, Ashpaw, Featherpaw, and Stormpaw.\n\n=== Scourge ===\nScourge (Tiny at birth), a small black tom with icy blue eyes and single white paw, rules BloodClan through fear and a survival-of-the-fittest mentality, and refuses to provide for any cat who cannot support him- or herself. He permits the mates of she-cats nursing kits to hunt for their mates purely out of pragmatism, so that the Clan does not cease to exist when all the elder cats die and there are no younger cats to replace them. Despite his small size, he is a very capable and dangerous fighter, and neither any sort of warrior's ethical code or merciful impulses restrain him in battle; he is brutal and ruthless (Rock says in ''Cats of the Clans'' that he lacks \"any sense of right or wrong\").<ref name=catsotc/>{{rp|91}}<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> To show his capability to kill, he wears a collar studded with teeth and claws from dogs and cats he has killed, and his claws have been reinforced with dogs' teeth. The color of his collar has not been mentioned in the books, but was colored purple in ''[[The Rise of Scourge]].'' His weakness is revealed to be his skepticism towards StarClan, which means he does not have nine lives.\n\nIt has been confirmed by the authors that Firestar is Scourge's [[Half sibling|half-brother]] (Scourge and Firestar share the same father),<ref name=\"authorchat5\"/> as implied in ''[[The Rise of Scourge]]'' when Quince wonders about why the litter did not share its father's ginger color, making Firestar also the half-brother of Socks and Ruby, Scourge's littermates. Scourge is then related to Cloudtail, Leafpool, Princess, Squirrelflight, Whitewing, Whitewing's kits Dovewing and Ivypool, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Jayfeather.\n\nScourge's evil nature is explained in ''The Rise of Scourge''. It is revealed that he was originally known as Tiny and from a young age, his brother Socks and sister Ruby treat him very badly, bullying him about his size and mocking him. His mother tells them not to pick on him, but never really defends him the way he wants her to. When Ruby taunts him that he will be drowned in the river because no humans want to adopt him, Tiny runs away by himself. He wanders into forest territory and is attacked by Tigerpaw who is patrolling the border of ThunderClan territory with Bluefur and his mentor, Thistleclaw. Tigerpaw wants to kill him, but is stopped at the last moment by Bluefur. Tiny develops a lifelong grudge against Tigerpaw for this unfair fight. Afraid to go home and terrified to go into the forest and face more abuse from cats like Tigerpaw, Tiny soon moves to the [[alley]]s of a city, where he finds an old dog. One of its teeth falls out and he tries to use it to cut off his collar, but ends up getting it stuck. He finds a group of thin cats who are eating a small piece of chicken from human garbage. In order to convince them to share their food he makes up a story about killing a dog and ripping the teeth from its skull as a sort of trophy. Though skeptical, the cats let him have a bite.\n\nThe next day, however, a group of cats, led by two cats called Bone and Brick, have heard his story. They ask him to kill a dog behind a deli who is stealing their food. Afraid of the dog, but realizing that he will be revealed to be a liar and driven out if he refuses to fight the dog, Tiny approaches the dog. By sheer luck, the dog is frightened by Tiny's shadow, which appears about three times as large as Tiny really is, and flees; Tiny is clever enough to convince the other cats he frightened the dog away. The other stray cats are amazed and treat him almost like a god. This is the point where he decides to change his name; the other cats have never asked for his name before, so instead of telling them his name is Tiny, he makes up the new, more intimidating name Scourge. He becomes the leader by default, and cats begin to seek his advice and aid. A group of rogues from the forest wander in and begin bullying and abusing the local cats, who turn to their leader, Scourge, for protection. Scourge cannot bluff these cats as he tricked the dog, and the forest rogues openly mock and threaten him. Unwilling to back away from his position of power, Scourge kills one of them in cold blood, frightening the other forest rogues away and solidifying his hold over the alley cats.\n\nLater, Socks and Ruby wander into his territory; they were adopted as house cats, but later become lost and forgotten when their owners move; as dependent pets, they never learned to hunt for their own food. They ask Scourge for help, but he snarls at them, asking why he should help them after everything they did to him. Ruby then asks if blood means anything to him, to which Scourge replies that it is everything to him and how the blood of his enemies soaks into his fur. He then says that he is the leader of BloodClan, which shocks his siblings. Scourge finally lets them eat some of his food until they are full, but after they are finished, Scourge permanently [[Exile|banishes]] them from his territory, completing his transformation into a cold-blooded villain.\n\nScourge forms the allycats into BloodClan. They copy his ways, even making collars for themselves out of the teeth of the dogs they have slain and cats they have murdered. Scourge appoints Bone, a terrifying black and white cat, as his second-in-command.\nTigerstar is led by Boulder, a former follower of Scourge, into Scourge's territory within the maze-like alleys. Tigerstar, who is at this point leader of ShadowClan, is slightly amused by the tiny leader, but after seeing the numbers of his followers and their collars, decides to ask Scourge to join him in battle against Thunderclan and WindClan, promising him a share of their land. He never intends to keep his word, thinking that once he has all the forest clans united under his rule, he will easily be able to get rid of Scourge, whom he severely underestimates because of Scourge's small size and Tigerstar's own arrogance. Tigerstar clearly does not remember the time when he almost murdered the small black cat as a kitten, though Scourge certainly remembers and despises him, though he very deliberately says nothing about their past confrontation. When WindClan and ThunderClan still refuse to submit to Tigerstar, he shouts at BloodClan to attack, but Scourge's followers refuse to fight without Scourge's orders, enraging Tigerstar. When Scourge refuses to order BloodClan to attack, Tigerstar attacks Scourge, who proves more formidable than Tigerstar ever expected. Scourge takes his revenge by killing Tigerstar, cutting him open from chin to tail, and watches him gleefully as all his nine lives are stripped from him. Later, during the battle with LionClan (all the warrior clans allied together), Scourge takes one of Firestar's lives, but is slain later by the ThunderClan leader.<ref name=rise>Hunter, Erin. (2008)''[[The Rise of Scourge]]''. 112pp.</ref> It is unknown where Scourge's spirit went after his death.\n\n===Ice===\nIce (born Jumper) is one of Barley's brothers who joins BloodClan and becomes one of Scourge's followers, like Snake. He nearly kills his own sister, Violet.\n\n===Snake===\nSnake (born Hoot) is the other one of Barley's brothers who joined BloodClan. He, too, was responsible for almost killing Violet, and is the first to tell Barley of their major change.\n\n===Brick===\nBrick is a russet colored cat, a friend of Bone and Scourge, but also a supporter of Tiny/Scourge even before BloodClan is formed. Brick asks Tiny/Scourge to fight one of the dogs in the town that is keeping them from a dumpster full of food.\n\n== StarClan ==\nAfter death, most of the spirits of Clan cats join to StarClan. StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt (the [[Milky Way]]), and each individual star represents a single dead warrior. Once a cat dies, he or she joins StarClan in a form in which he or she was most comfortable in. For example, blindness and deafness would be cured, unless the cat had been happier being deaf or blind. StarClan's territory is a forest that is perpetually in warm, comfortable, summer-like conditions. There are neither conflicts (usually) nor disease present. StarClan cats do not remain in StarClan eternally. Instead, they are eventually forgotten by the living and their spirits in StarClan fade slowly away, as mentioned in ''Fading Echoes''.<ref name=\"fadingechoesbook\">{{cite book|title=Fading Echoes|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-155512-1|title-link=Fading Echoes (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\nStarClan warriors keep watch over the Clans, usually watching their own Clan. They provide guidance to the Clans, often in dreams and other signs and omens. StarClan usually visits leaders and medicine cats.  Often, this occurs with medicine cats at either the Moonstone revealed in ''Into the Wild'' or later at the Moonpool revealed in ''Starlight''. StarClan cannot or do not choose to influence events in the real world. However, in ''Firestar's Quest'', Spottedleaf visited both Firestar and Sandstorm, and treated an injured warrior, showing that StarClan indeed has some level of effect on the real world.<ref name=firestarsquest/> The fact that Cinderpelt was reincarnated as Cinderheart is contradictory to that StarClan cannot influence the real world, although they may have chosen to do so.\n\n== The Place of No Stars/The Dark Forest ==\n\nThe Place of No Stars, also known as the Dark Forest, is where the spirits of cats who have caused great pain and suffering in the lives of others go or are banished to. In this place, although there is no sun, moon, nor any stars, the entire forest is bathed in a sickly glow. There is no prey and cats feel no hunger either. Cats known to walk the Dark Forest include Thistleclaw, Tigerstar, Hawkfrost, Brokentail, Darkstripe, Clawface, Mapleshade, Shredtail, and Snowtuft.<ref name=\"fadingechoesbook\"/> Victoria Holmes revealed on the website concerning fantasy authors ''Wands and Worlds'' that StarClan and The Dark Forest exist on different planes; however, there is a clear border between the territories, marked by a wall of mist. Many Clan cats in the ''Omen of the Stars'' series visit there for training for a battle against the Clans. However, many of them are oblivious to the fact that the warriors of the Dark Forest are actually training them to destroy the Clans, including StarClan, in their upcoming battle. Instead, they tell the Clan cats that they are doing this to become better warriors. In The Place of No Stars, cats who wish to leave are killed. The cats in training are ordered to fight with their claws unsheathed, which causes wounds in the waking world. Some of the Dark Forest warriors demonstrate what they will be training by using other Dark Forest warriors as dummies. During many of the demonstrations the 'dummies' are maimed or killed. In ''Omen of the Stars'', Ivypool trains there, but when she realizes that it is not right, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Dovewing ask her to spy on the Dark Forest, because there is a battle between them, StarClan, and the Clans yet to come. In the Great Battle, the Dark Forest spirits attack the Clans.Some cats have escaped, like maple shade.\n\n== The Tribe of Rushing Water ==\n\nThe Tribe of Rushing Water is a group of smaller cats living in the northern caves of the mountain range that divides much of the land between the old forest territories and the lake territories. Tribe cats do not believe in StarClan; instead, they have their own spiritual equivalent, the Tribe of Endless Hunting. In the Tribe, there is no medicine cat or deputy: the leader, always known as Teller of the Pointed Stones, or Healer, serves both duties in addition to leader.<ref name=moonrise /> Upon birth, Tribe cats are named by their mother for the first thing they see (which, incidentally, is usually not Floor/Roof/Wall of Cave or somesuch, as described by Rock in \"Cats of the Clans\"). Eventually, a Tribe cat trains as a to-be (apprentice). They can be either a cave-guard or a prey-hunter, based on their physical appearance, and this future role is determined at birth. Strong, sturdy cats are chosen to be cave-guards, whose job is to defend the Tribe's camp against intruders as well as provide cover for the prey-hunters while hunting. Prey-hunters, chosen for their slender, agile bodies, are adept at hunting in the rocky mountain terrain and can leap high enough to catch large birds. Kit-mothers take care of kits.<ref name=catsotc /> Tribe cats often cover themselves in mud in order to better blend in with their surroundings, allowing them to catch larger, more exotic prey such as hawks and eagles. It also protects them from the cold mountain wind.<ref name=outcast/>{{rp|317}}\n\nThe Tribe typically have no enemies, which leaves them unprepared for attacks by other large predators, an example being Sharptooth. Another example is the other groups of cats attempting to take their territory.<ref name=moonrise /><ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> They have a firmly rooted tradition, and as such do not welcome the beliefs of other cats, a theme which incorporates the use of people from different cultural and traditional ways of thinking working together to solve a common goal. It is revealed in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' of the ''Power of Three'' series that the Tribe is among the descendants of the [[#Ancient Cats|ancient clan]] of cats who originally lived in the lake territories, of which [[#Rock|Rock]] and [[#Fallen Leaves|Fallen Leaves]] are members.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\n\nThroughout the series, the Clan cats commonly call the Tribe cats by the first word in their name, rather than the whole name (e.g., Lark, Pine, and Brook).\n\n=== ''The New Prophecy'' Series ===\nThe Tribe of Rushing Water is primarily introduced in ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]''<ref name=moonrise />  and visited again briefly in ''[[Dawn (Warriors)|Dawn]]''.<ref name=dawn/> In ''Twilight'', Stormfur and Brook visit ThunderClan, staying until ''Outcast''. Following ''The New Prophecy'' series, the Tribe is featured again in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' of the ''Power of Three'' series.  All characters listed here also appear in ''Outcast''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/> In Moonrise, they thought Stormfur was the silver cat who was supposed to kill Sharptooth, the mountain lion, but Feathertail (Stormfur's sister) was actually the silver cat and died for the Tribe.<ref name=moonrise />  When the Clans traveled in Dawn to their new lake home, they were sheltered in the Tribe's caves.<ref name=dawn/> In Outcast, they used the Clan's help to drive out intruders.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\n\n====Stormfur====\nA dark gray tom with amber eyes, Stormfur was formerly a RiverClan cat and has lived in ThunderClan, but currently lives in the Tribe of Rushing Water. He was first introduced as a kit, Stormkit, in Forest of Secrets, when his mother, Silverstream, a RiverClan cat, bore him and his sister, Featherkit, on Sunningrocks in ThunderClan territory, ultimately bleeding out her life for it. Their father was Graystripe, a ThunderClan cat, and in order to avoid shedding blood because of a war between RiverClan and ThunderClan over the kits, he brought them himself to RiverClan and stayed with them. Stormkit became an apprentice, Stormpaw, along with his sister Featherpaw, in A Dangerous Path, mentored by Stonefur.\n\nHe and his mate, Brook, met in her Tribe home, and fell in love. He and Brook returned to the forest and helped ThunderClan rebuild from the badger attack and head on to RiverClan. Then, he stayed in ThunderClan when he was banished from RiverClan. He is Graystripe and Silverstream's son, Feathertail's brother, and the half-brother of Bumblestripe, Briarlight, and Blossomfall. Stormfur was very close to Feathertail, but as protective as he was of his sister, he wasn't very happy with her relationship with Crowpaw and openly rejected the tom. He has since decided to return to the Tribe with Brook. He forged his strongest relationships from the journey with Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight. In Moonrise, he felt a brief attraction to Squirrelflight, but flung his affections aside for the good of their Clans. He was unable to ignore his love for Brook so easily. He gets over his mild crush on Squirrelflight and proves it by playfully teasing Bramblestar and Squirrelflight, along with Tawnypelt, about their care for each other. In Outcast, he shows a close relationship with Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight's apparent son Lionblaze. He confides in Lionblaze his past feelings for his supposed mother, making Lionblaze wonder what it would have been like to have Stormfur as a father instead. When Stormfur, Brook, Brambleclaw, Tawnypelt, Crowfeather, Breezepelt, Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, and Jayfeather go with Night and Talon to help the Tribe with the intruders, Stormfur and Brook decide that they want to stay in the Tribe, so they say good-bye to the others in Eclipse.\n\nHe is father of Lark That Sings At Dawn (Lark) and Pine That Clings To Rock (Pine). Stormfur's also grandson to Crookedstar (Silverstream's father), grand-nephew to Oakheart, great-grandson to Rainflower and Shellheart, cousin to Stonefur (who also was his mentor), Mistystar, and Mosskit (Oakheart's kits), grand-cousin to Primrosepaw, Pikepaw, and Perchkit, Greymist, and Reedwhisker, Mallowpaw and Sneezepaw (Graymist's kits).\n\n====Brook Where Small Fish Swim====\n'''Brook''' is a slender, brown tabby she-cat with gray eyes<ref name=thesight/>{{rp|215}} and is a prey-hunter within the Tribe. She is first introduced in ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]'', when the journeying group of Clan cats accidentally stumbles upon the Tribe, and instantly takes a liking to [[#Stormfur|Stormfur]].<ref name=moonrise />\n\nStormfur decides to stay with Brook in the mountains when the exodus of the four Clans passes through. However, they are exiled from the Tribe following a disastrous attempt by Stormfur to rally the Tribe cats in order to force a group of intruding cats out, after which they travel to the new lake territory of ThunderClan. Brook is sorrowful for [[#Teller of the Pointed Stones|Stoneteller's]] decision to banish Stormfur, but remains by his side. She would learn to hunt and live in the forest and is accepted as a full ThunderClan cat, often providing advice to the younger cats based on her experiences in the mountains. During the events of ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' she and Stormfur return to the Tribe along with a collection of Clan warriors in order to deal with the intruders threatening the mountains.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\n\nBrook has two brothers, Crag Where Eagles Nest (Crag), and Talon of Swooping Eagle (Talon). She is Stormfur's mate. She is the mother of Lark That Sings At Dawn (Lark) and Pine That Clings To Rock (Pine).\n\n====Talon of Swooping Eagle====\n'''Talon''' is a massive, broad-shouldered dark brown tabby tom with amber eyes and a scar across the side of his face who serves as a cave-guard in the Tribe. He was first introduced in ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]'' as a Tribe exile, banished by Stoneteller along with other cats for failing to successfully kill the mountain lion Sharptooth.<ref name=moonrise /> He is also revealed to be Brook's brother, along with Crag. After the group of Clan cats chosen by StarClan on the journey to the sun-drown-place pass through the mountains and attempt to solve the Tribe's problem, Talon, Bird, and Rock return to the Tribe in order to help with the plan to kill Sharptooth. He becomes a member of the Tribe once again after Sharptooth is killed. Talon returns in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' and, along with '''Night of No Stars (Night)''', journeys to the Clans for help when the Tribe is having problems with trespassing cats stealing prey.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  In Sign of the Moon he becomes an elder.<ref name=signofthemoon/>\n\n====Teller of the Pointed Stones====\n'''Stoneteller''', as he is more commonly known, serves as the Healer of the Tribe. He is an old, long-bodied dark brown tabby tom with a white muzzle and amber eyes. The Healer performs the duties of both a leader and medicine cat, essentially granting him both traditional and spiritual authority over his Tribemates. The name given to the Tribe's healer is always the same, and as such there have been several Stonetellers over the course of the Tribe's history. This particular Stoneteller is well-suited to leading his Tribe, but is forced to deal with a number of crises (Sharptooth, the unnamed group of trespassing cats, etc.) that threaten their survival and unnerve his faith in the Tribe of Endless Hunting, the Tribe's spiritual equivalent of StarClan. As there are no other cats in a position of power to advise him, Stoneteller often feels overwhelmed by his responsibilities and can be prone to making rash decisions. Later in ''Sign of the Moon'', he dies of old age.\n\n====Crag Where Eagles Nest====\nA dark grey tom with amber eyes, '''Crag''' was one of the cats that found the Clans when they were lost on the mountains on the Great Journey. In ''Sign of the Moon'' he becomes the new Teller of the Pointed Stones after his predecessor dies.<ref name=signofthemoon />  He is a brother of Brook and Talon.\n\n== Ancient cats ==\n\nThese are characters first mentioned in ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'' of the ''Power of Three'' series.<ref name=darkriver/>{{rp|322}} They are as yet unknown to all cats except Jayfeather, whose [[extrasensory perception]] allows him to discover clues hidden in an ancient stick located near the lake. It is hinted in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' that these cats have ties to the [[#The Tribe of Rushing Water|Tribe of Rushing Water]]. In [[Long Shadows (Warriors)|''Long Shadows'']] (5th book in the third series ''Power of Three''), Jayfeather convinces the group to journey to the mountains to live there, hinting they are the direct ancestors of the Tribe.<ref name=longshadows/>{{rp|364}} Although, the stick is broken by Jayfeather, he still is able to connect with Rock since his first birth is as Jay's Wing in the time of the ancient cats, where he realised that his brother, Lionblaze, and Dovewing  are also first born in the time of the ancient cats as Lion's Roar and Dove's Wing, except Dove's Wing is Jay's Wing's(Jayfeather's) sister and Lion's Roar is not his brother at that time.\n\n===Ancient Clan conventions===\n\nThere are several differences between the modern Clans and the Ancient ones. These will be listed below.\n\n*Ancient Clan cats are more like a group of cats living together than a Clan, in that leaders can retire whenever they like, and that there are no definite territory boundaries.\n*The cats in the Clan make major decisions by, 'casting stones', where a line is drawn in the dirt, and each cat pushes a stone to the side\\decision they choose.\n*In the modern Clans, Clan deputies, when they became leaders, had to stay leaders until they died, even if they grew old. With the Ancient Clans, leaders could choose their successors and step down from the post whenever they wanted.\n\n===''Power of Three Series''===\nThe Ancient Clan was primarily introduced in ''Dark River''<ref name=darkriver />  and has played a minor role in all subsequent novels.\n\n====Fallen Leaves====\n'''Fallen Leaves''', a muscular shouldered ginger and white tom with green eyes and the son of Broken Shadow and Stone Song, is one of the Ancient Cats who went into the tunnels to become sharpclaws (the equivalent of warriors). These tunnels run underneath ThunderClan and WindClan territory, in which [[List of Warriors characters#Lionblaze|Lionpaw]] and [[List of Warriors characters#Heathertail|Heatherpaw]] played in at night. Three WindClan kits strayed into them when the floods were rising, and Lionpaw, [[List of Warriors characters#Jayfeather|Jaypaw]], [[List of Warriors characters#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]], Heatherpaw, and [[List of Warriors characters#Breezepelt|Breezepaw]] had to rescue them. It was then that Fallen Leaves guided Jaypaw through, finding the kits and averting a battle. Later, in ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'', the three kits reveal the tunnels to WindClan, and WindClan use them as an opportunity to ambush ThunderClan.<ref name=eclipse/>\n\nFallen Leaves had entered the tunnels to prove he was a sharpclaw. However, he neglected to mention to Rock that rain might fall. This proved his downfall, as when it rained, the tunnels flooded, and he drowned. Jayfeather dreamed about his journey in the tunnels, and before he died, Fallen Leaves suddenly realized Jayfeather was walking with him.\n\nThe Erins said that Fallen Leaves still hasn't accepted the fact that he is dead, and this is why Fallen Leaves' spirit still walks through the tunnels. In ''Long Shadows'', he was dismayed to hear that Jayfeather was not staying with him, and his death is a catalyst for the Ancient Clans moving from the lake to the mountains.<ref name=longshadows />\n\n==== Rock ====\n'''Rock''' is a very old cat. He is described in ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'' as his pelt like moleskin, the fur gone except for tufts along his spine, and his sightless eyes bulging like eggs, thus depicting him as ancient to the Ancient Clans.<ref name=darkriver />  He watches over all of the Clans (including SkyClan, BloodClan, and the Tribe of Rushing Water, in addition to the rogues, loners, and kittypets known to the four Clans, as well as having an acquaintance with Midnight and Sol), and as he says in ''[[Cats of the Clans (Warriors)|Cats of the Clans]]'' he knows the destiny and innermost thoughts of each cat.<ref name=catsotc />  In his introduction in the prologue of ''Dark River'', he is in a cave and greets [[#Fallen Leaves|Fallen Leaves]] before the young cat goes into the tunnels.<ref name=darkriver />  He later meets with Jayfeather and tells him he must go to the mountains in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>   He is the narrator of ''Cats of the Clans'', and talks with three kits from StarClan: Mosskit, a half-ThunderClan, half-RiverClan kit who died on the way to RiverClan with Stonefur and Mistyfoot, '''Adderkit''', a WindClan kit ironically killed by a snake, and '''Blossomkit''', a ShadowClan kit who was forced into battle when she was too young on Brokenstar's demand, and was killed in the battle.  He seems to know all about the Clans (although some of his knowledge is a little off in ''[[Cats of the Clans (Warriors)|Cats of the Clans]]''), and is very keen in particular to Jayfeather, supporting the prophecy.<ref name=catsotc /> It is revealed in The Fourth Apprentice that he knew of Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze's heritage.<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> In Sign of the Moon he tells Jayfeather that he was once the Teller of Pointed Stones for the Tribe of Rushing Water.<ref name=signofthemoon/>\n\n==== Furled Bracken ====\nA dark ginger tabby tom with muscular shoulders and amber eyes, '''Furled Bracken''' is the leader of the ancient Clan that lived at the lake before the four Clans. When Stone Song requests for the stones to be cast, he accepts. When Jayfeather, or who the Clan thinks he is, Jay's Wing, tries to go forward to make his decision, he holds him back, telling him that he must choose last because he is the newest sharpclaw. When the decision is made to leave, Furled Bracken appoints Stone Song as leader, much to Jayfeather's surprise.\n\n==== Stone Song ====\nA hefty dark grey tabby tom with piercing ice blue eyes, '''Stone Song''' is known to be a sharpclaw of the ancient Clan that lived at the lake before the four Clans. He is intrigued by Jay's Wing's, or rather Jaypaw's dream about the mountains. He seems quite confident and is the cat who asks Furled Bracken for the stones to be cast. After the decision is made to leave, Furled Bracken appoints him as leader. Stone Song later asks Jay's Wing to help him lead the tribe to their new home. He is the father of Fallen Leaves and mate of Broken Shadow.\n\n==== Broken Shadow ====\nA slender orange tabby she-cat with white paws and amber eyes, '''Broken Shadow''' is also known to be a sharpclaw of the ancient Clan that lived at the lake before the four Clans. In ''Dark River'', Broken Shadow is not mentioned directly by name.<ref name=darkriver />  She is seen sadly watching her son, Fallen Leaves, enter the tunnels for his assessment with Rock to become a sharpclaw. Broken Shadow protests his leaving, saying that the skies look like they might rain. Fallen Leaves continues on stubbornly though, not wanting to put off his becoming a full sharpclaw any longer, though that same impatience was ultimately his fate.\n\nIn ''Long Shadows'' when everyone is congrating Jaypaw for making it out of the tunnels and all throughout the times we see Broken Shadow, she is still grieving for Fallen Leaves.\n\n==== Half Moon ====\nA white she-cat with green eyes, '''Half Moon''' is another one of the Ancient Cats known to be the ancestors of the Tribe of Rushing Water. She is a calm and kind she-cat, and she was in love with Jay's Wing. Half Moon helped Jaypaw (Jay's Wing) when he was confused about where he was, and she shows obvious affection towards Jay's Wing, willing to leave if he was. At the end of ''Sign of the Moon'', she says: \"I will wait for you forever, Jay's Wing!\". She defended him when '''Fish Leap''' bullied him, and during the casting of the stones, Half Moon went to the 'leave' side. She also made a brief appearance during Jaypaw's naming ceremony, and it could be noted that she loves both Jayfeather and Jay's Wing since they are both to be the same cat. She is apparently a very good hunter, helping Jay's Wing to catch prey when he found it difficult. In ''Sign of the Moon'', Half Moon is made the first Teller of the Pointed Stones by Jayfeather, because she was the one who saw the \"sign of the moon\"<ref name=signofthemoon /> She is also mentioned in the prologue in \"The Sun Trail\".\n\n==== Jay's Wing ====\nA grey tabby tom with blue eyes, '''Jay's Wing''' is a cat training to be a sharpclaw (warrior) of the ancients that lived at the lake before the four Clans. In ''Long Shadows'', Jayfeather is taken back in time by Fallen Leaves, and walks in Jay's Wing's pawsteps.<ref name=longshadows />  Jay's Wing/Jayfeather asks questions that confuse most of the Ancients. He helps Fallen Leaves's tribe decide to leave the lake by telling the leader, Furled Bracken, about a dream he had, one about the mountains the Tribe of Rushing Water lives in. He never truly had that dream, but rather had visited the mountains himself. After the beginning of the journey, Rock calls Jayfeather back and tells him it is time to return to ThunderClan. He reincarnated as Jayfeather, which is why when Jayfeather went back in time, he becomes Jay's Wing.\n\n==== Dove's Wing ====\n<!-- In an autochat, Erin Hunter has said dovepaw is not dove's wing's reincarnation; however, it is claimed that she is in Sign of the moon. I will check as soon as i get the book -->\nA pretty pale grey she-cat with blue eyes, '''Dove's Wing''' is known to be a cat training to be a sharpclaw (warrior). Dove's Wing is sister to Jay's Wing, who, unknown to her, is Jayfeather thrust into the past. When Jay's Wing asks a strange question in front of a group of softpaws (apprentices), she says he must have hit his head on the rocky floor of the tunnel. When Jayfeather goes back in time and comes out as Jay's Wing, he suspects that Dove's Wing might be Dovewing's counterpart.\n\n==== Lion's Roar ====\nA small, compact, strong golden tabby tom, '''Lion's Roar''' is born to Shy Fawn and Dark Whiskers in Sign of the Moon.<ref name=signofthemoon />  When he first enters the world, he is motionless and so all the other cats think he is dead. Jayfeather (Jay's Wing) licks him, and he lets out a loud wail, which some other cat says sounds like a lion's roar, which is what Shy Fawn named him. Jayfeather thinks he reincarnated as Lionblaze, which gives him the idea that Dove's Wing might be Dovewing, as it would make sense for the Three to have had a past life since he did, too.\n\n===''Dawn of the Clans''===\n\n====Gray Wing====\nGray Wing is a sleek, dark grey tom with golden eyes. When Stoneteller (also known as Half Moon) receives the vision of some of her cats leaving to follow the sun to a better home, he cast his rock with the ones that want to stay. He watches with a sad heart as the majority of his tribe leaves, though his mother still remains. His brother and sister (still kits) are too young to go, so they stay as well. When Jagged Peak, Grey Wing's brother, leaves to follow the group going to a better place, he bravely goes out to find him. At this point, Jagged Peak is being attacked by an eagle. Grey Wing arrived just in time to save Jagged Peak, and they rush to catch up with the rest of the group. One of Grey Wing's best friends, Turtle Tail, is there, and she secretly likes Grey Wing. At the time, he just regards her as a friend. Clear Sky, his brother, really wants to get to their new home, and upon arrival, he moves into the forest instead of staying in the moor. He establishes boundaries and challenges any trespassing cat, much to Grey Wing's dismay. Turtle Tail moves to live as a housecat, hurt when she figures out that Grey Wing is in love with a cat named Storm, though the latter ultimately mates with Clear Sky. Lonely now, he continues his roles as a moor cat. When Tall Shadow, the leader of the group, begins to make choices that most cats in the group disagree with, a cat named Shattered Ice challenge her leadership. He requests Grey Wing take over, but Grey Wing refuses and explains that every cat should give Tall Shadow the respect she deserves. Turtle Tail returns, and Shattered Ice is furious that she dares to come back. Tall Shadow accepts her, which angers Shattered Ice further. Later on, Grey Wing discovers that Turtle Tail is bearing the kits of a kittypet named Tom. Turtle Tail reveals to him that she left the humans because one of her friends, a she-cat named Bumble, told her that once she gave birth, the humans would take her kits away. She asked if Grey Wing would be their father and at first he is hesitant. Later, he accepts and Turtle Tail gives birth to three healthy kits: Pebble Heart, Sparrow Fur, and Owl Eyes. After a fire, Tall Shadow steps down from leadership and gives it to Grey Wing. Grey Wing unwillingly takes the role, but is permanently weakened from too much smoke inhalation. He leads for a while, but eventually steps down and never becomes a true Clan leader. However, his actions and wise decisions cause many future generations to know him as Grey Wing the Wise.\n\n====Clear Sky====\nClear Sky is a light gray tom with ice blue eyes, the founder of SkyClan, comes from the Tribe of Rushing Water. Kit of Quiet Rain, brother of Gray Wing, Jagged Peak and Fluttering Bird. Mate of Bright Stream, Storm and Star Flower, father of Thunder(star), Dew Petal, Flower Foot and. He chose to follow the Sun Trail when cats were casting stones. He brought several cats to follow his group, choosing the forest as their place to set camp. He's also the creator of borders, the first cat to establish it. After the deaths of Fluttering Bird, Bright Stream and Storm, he went so depressed, and thought about never let his cats went dying like they do, so he set borders, and drove the cats who crossed the borders away. However, he decided to move his borders for a bigger territory for hunting and more prey to fill their bellies. Near the end of \"The Sun Trail\", he asked Gray Wing to take Thunder away, because he thought that he couldn't hold the responsibilities that a father should do. After he told this, he and Gray Wing declared the end of their brotherhood. He also kicked Jagged Peak out of his group because he broke his leg. Soon a fire broke out in his group, so he moved to the moor. Thunder joined his group, but later left because he thought his father's methods were too extreme. Soon, the hostility between Gray Wing and him went too far, and a fierce battle broke out. During the battle, Clear Sky killed his old friend Rainswept Flower because she shouted at him for being greedy. He responded with, \"I'm not greedy, I'm just strong.\" He also fought Gray Wing, shouting at him to give in. Gray Wing rejected, and challenged him to kill him. Clear Sky finally realised that he had gone too far, and announced that the battle was over. He met the spirit cats, and Storm asked him to stop bossing other cats around. He agreed, and rebuilt the brotherhood with Gray Wing. He then returned to his territory.\n\n== The Sisters ==\n'''The Sisters''' are a small group of nomadic she-cats who are descended from a single kittypet family. As such, they retain much of the physical appearances as their ancestors; notably having long, thick, and sleek fur, as well as being large and well-muscled. They are much larger and stronger than the average Clan cat, even more so than Bramblestar, who has long been regarded as one of the largest and strongest cats in the Clans.\n\nAs their name implies, the Sisters are a primarily all-female group; they exile their male kits once they are barely old enough to hunt for themselves, because they believe the toms have a deep connection to the land and must wander and protect it, not tied to the Sisters. However, it is also very heavily implied that the Sisters have a personal dislike for toms (more specifically ones not related to them), as Moonlight states that they prefer to live without toms, and Snow is openly prejudiced against toms. Aside from this questionable and sexist custom, the Sisters are generally peaceful and kind, as they dislike violence (though they are perfectly willing to be aggressive and forceful if they need to be), honour nature, sing to honour the dead, and work together to raise kits. All members of the Sisters and cats descended from them, can communicate with ghost cats.\n\n====Moonlight====\nA huge, broad-shouldered, long-furred, bushy-tailed grey she-cat, '''Moonlight''' was the leader of the Sisters, serving as a major character in ''Squirrelflight's Hope''. Moonlight is a complicated character; on the one hand, she can be peaceful, loyal and kind in the sense that she dislikes violence and prefers to avoid whenever possible, that she is willing to help others and is fiercely devoted to the Sisters and their customs. On the other hand, however, she can be stubborn and wilfull in the sense that she is a little ''too'' set in her ways, allows her pride to influence her decisions, and sometimes disregards what unintended consequences her actions might have.\n\nAt some point in the past, Moonlight had a son named Earth and a currently unnamed daughter. Immediately after Earth succeeded in killing his first mouse, Moonlight abandoned him per the Sisters' custom, taking her daughter with her to parts unknown. Earth subsequently became a loner and renamed himself Tree, but harbored a powerful grudge against his mother for leaving him as soon as he could hunt and for not letting have his own say in choosing his fate.\n\nMany moons later, Moonlight mates with a tom called Jack and becomes pregnant with his kits. She and the Sisters make a camp just beyond the Clans' territories. When Moonlight is about a moon from giving birth, Leafstar and Squirrelflight come in looking for new territory. Distrustful of the Clans, Moonlight and the Sisters take the two captive, intending to let them go only when her kits are born and weaned. However, ThunderClan and SkyClan soon arrive and the Sisters let them go. During the encounter, Moonlight briefly reunites with Tree, but her excitement at seeing her son again turns to surprise and then indifference when he angrily condemns her for abandoning him as a kit.\n\nThe Sisters later get into a fight with a ShadowClan patrol, during which Sunrise nearly dies and Strikestone's hearing is permanently damaged. This causes the majority of the Clans to regard the Sisters as their latest enemy. Despite the rising tension, Moonlight refuses to move her group until her kits are born and weaned. Later, Tree, now the Clans' mediator, reluctantly agrees to attempt to convince Moonlight to leave for the sake of peace. However, the attempt fails due to Moonlight's stubbornness and Tree's grudge against her, resulting in the two parting on bad terms.\n\nEventually, tensions between the Clans grow to a point where they are willing to force out the Sisters, but Moonlight, long overdue for her kits, goes into labor, giving birth to two she-cats and a tom. However, as soon as they are born, she leaves her kits and goes to fight in the battle instigated by the Clans, but is badly injured and later dies, despite the efforts of the medicine cats to save her.\n\n====Snow====\nA large, broad-shouldered, sleek-furred, snowy-white she-cat with blue eyes, '''Snow''' appears to be the most aggressive of the Sisters, as she is especially mistrustful of strangers and is the most openly prejudiced against toms, notably disliking Bramblestar, Thornclaw and Tree simply for being toms.\n\nWhen Leafstar and Squirrelflight are taken captive by the Sisters, Snow is the most hostile to them, and even deliberately wounds Leafstar when she tries to escape. However, she eventually warms up to the two. Later, Snow, Hawk, Tempest and Sunrise track and corner Strikestone and Stonewing to find out why they were on their land. The two toms try to fight them off, and in the ensuing scuffle, Strikestone loses one of his ears and Sunrise is badly injured. Desperate, the Sisters seek help from ThunderClan, which is torn between helping an innocent cat and fueling more fights against the other Clans. Bramblestar eventually and reluctantly agrees to let the medicine cats treat Sunrise. During their stay, Snow voices her dislike of Bramblestar for being a tom, believing he shouldn't be in a position of authority, to which Leafpool and Squirrelflight explain that Bramblestar is their leader and all ThunderClan cats need to follow and respect him.\n\nLater, when Leafstar, Squirrelflight and Tree come to negotiate with Moonlight, Snow again shows her disdain for toms by initially refusing to let Tree into the Sisters' camp, glaring at him and wrinkling her nose in disgust. However, she eventually relents when they assert it is in everyone's best interest.\n\nWhen the Clans attack the Sisters' camp, Snow and the other Sisters stubbornly refuse to leave, and lose the battle. Afterwards, Snow and Tempest thank Squirrelflight for helping them and express doubt that the Clans will find peace, with Snow again showing her bias towards toms by saying they \"never want peace\". Once Moonlight's orphaned kits are weaned, Snow and the other Sisters leave the lake.\n\n====Other members====\n*Sunrise: a long-furred, broad-shouldered yellow she-cat.\n*Tempest: a muscular, broad-shouldered and long-furred tabby she-cat.\n*Furze: a long-furred, ginger she-cat.\n*Flurry: a huge, long-furred ginger-and-white she-cat.\n*Sparrow: a long-furred ginger-and-white she-cat.\n*Hawk: a tortoiseshell she-cat.\n\n==Characters not in other groups==\n\n===''Original Series''===\nThe ''Original'' series covers events in the story from ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' to ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. Many characters mentioned here were introduced in the ''Original'' series, but play minor or significant roles in ''The New Prophecy'' and ''Power of Three'' series as well.\n\n====Barley====\n\n'''Barley''' is a black-and-white tom that lives in a barn beyond WindClan territory. He is met by [[#Firestar|Firepaw]] while he is on his first journey to the Highstones, a remote region of caves which house the Moonstone, the source of the Clans' connection to StarClan. Barley is a friendly cat and always willing to help cats in need of shelter. He openly accepts [[#Ravenpaw|Ravenpaw]] when he makes his escape from [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]], and the two live a comfortable existence afterward.\n\nBarley comes with Ravenpaw to ThunderClan in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' in order to assist Firestar as he deals with the impending invasion of [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]], when he reveals that he was, in fact, a former member of BloodClan.<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/> Barley and his littermates were automatically placed under [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge's]] rule at birth, and his two brothers, Ice and Snake, formerly called Jumper and Hoot, soon became fierce enforcers of Scourge's orders. When Barley defied one of the Clan's principal rules in caring for and living with his sister, Violet, Ice and Snake attacked them and left Violet heavily injured. Barley narrowly escaped with Violet and left her in the care of a generous Twoleg, while he left the territory altogether and eventually happened upon the abandoned barn (which revealed by \"Secrets of the Clans\",<ref name=secrets/> he crossed clan territory to get there). He reveals the secret of Scourge's weakness to Firestar: that since Scourge does not believe in StarClan, he only has one life. Barley then fights alongside Firestar and Ravenpaw. The remaining cats of all four Clans against BloodClan.\n\nBarley and Ravenpaw finally assisted the Clans in their exodus by allowing them shelter in ''The New Prophecy'' series. They are presumed to be continuing their peaceful existence, though they are now effectively separated from the Clans due to the immense distance between them.\n\nHowever, in ''Ravenpaw's Farewell'' Ravenpaw dies of [[liver cancer]] in Barley's paws. In ''The Ultimate Guide'' Ravenpaw, now with StarClan, says that Barley will be in Starclan soon. Vicky Hunter has confirmed that Barley is dead.\n\n====Hattie====\n'''Hattie''' is a pretty brown tabby she-cat with amber eyes who now lives in [[#Firestar|Firestar]]'s former Twoleg home. She was shown in Firestar's old Twolegs' garden in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'',<ref name=\"darkest hour\"/>  but it was in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]'' when she was properly introduced as the new kittypet of Firestar's former Twoleg owners when she asked him if he wanted to use her scratching tree. She is a neighbor and friend of [[#Smudge|Smudge]], and has not been mentioned after ''Firestar's Quest''.<ref name=firestar/>\n\n====Princess====\n'''Princess''', a light brown tabby with a distinctive white chest and paws, is [[#Firestar|Firestar]]'s kittypet sister. He initially discovers her garden in ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'',<ref name=\"fire and ice\"/> and returns regularly to talk with her throughout the ''Original'' series. Princess is enthralled by Firestar's stories of living in the forest, but also worries about him due to his often ragged appearance. Upon learning that her kits are to be given away, she gives one of them to Firestar to take back to [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]]. This kit eventually becomes [[#Mistytail|Cloudtail]], a well-known ThunderClan warrior.\n\n==== Jake ====\n<!-- Jake is not muscular, so please do not say that he is; see Bluestar's Prophecy, pg. 196 -->\nJake is a plump ginger tom. He is [[List of Warriors characters#Firestar|Firestar]]'s father.\nHe is also the father of [[List of Warriors characters#Princess|Princess]] and the grandfather of Cloudtail, [[List of Warriors characters#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and [[List of Warriors characters#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]]. He is the father of [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]], [[List of Warriors characters#Socks|Socks]], and [[List of Warriors characters#Ruby|Ruby]], but they have a different mother, [[List of Warriors characters#Quince|Quince]].\nIn ''Bluestar's Prophecy'', Bluepaw talked to Jake when a squirrel she was chasing went over a twoleg fence.<ref name=bluestar>{{cite book|title=Bluestar's Prophecy|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-158247-9|title-link=Bluestar's Prophecy|date=2009-07-28}}</ref> His mate is Nutmeg. In ''Tallstar's Revenge'', Tallpaw leaves WindClan to find a cat that he thinks killed his father. During this journey, he meets Jake, and Jake helps Tallpaw on his journey.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is a cat who lives in the Twolegplace that Firestar originally came from.  He apparently went to the vet and was never the same since.  Henry is only mentioned in the first book and does not have any real significance in the story.<ref name=\"Into the Wild\"/>\nHe was brought to the cutter (vet) and apparently got 'fixed', losing his ability to be a 'real tom'.\n\n====Ravenpaw====\n'''Ravenpaw''' is a sleek, skinny black loner with a tiny white dash on his chest, and a white-tipped tail who lives at the barn with Barley. Ravenpaw has lost his clumsiness, and become more confident while living with Barley. Ravenpaw was originally a ThunderClan apprentice but was forced to leave the clan when he saw Tigerclaw, his mentor, murder the ThunderClan deputy, Redtail. This knowledge put his life in danger. He is happy at Barley's barn; the loner lifestyle suits him better than Clan life.  In Ravenpaw's Farewell, he dies in Barley's paws due to Liver cancer.\n\nRavenpaw has his own manga series, ''[[Warriors (novel series)#Ravenpaw's Path|Ravenpaw's Path]]'', which was released on November 24, 2009.\n\n====Smudge====\n'''Smudge''' is a friendly, contented, plump black and white tom with a narrow face, round amber eyes, black shoulders, a white tail-tip, and a black nose who was [[#Firestar|Firestar]]'s best friend during his kithood. Smudge was upset when Firestar decided to leave Twolegplace and live in the forest, but he accepted his friend's decision. Smudge is very comfortable with his life, and cannot imagine why Firestar wants to live in the forest with a bunch of \"violent ruffians\". Though he misses his friend, he manages to get along well with Firestar's replacement, a she-cat named Hattie.\n\nSmudge's garden sits on the exact location of the ancient camp of [[List of Warriors characters#SkyClan|SkyClan]], and as a result he is fraught with dreams involving the lost Clan's exodus in ''[[Firestar's Quest (Warriors)|Firestar's Quest]]''.<ref name=firestar/>  He mistakenly interprets these dreams as a sign that he must live in the forest, as Firestar had done, and goes into the forest to find his friend. He is attacked by a border patrol, but Firestar arrives in time and calls the patrol off. Firestar then spends the night in Smudge's garden to better ascertain the will of SkyClan's elusive leader. Smudge is very relieved to learn that he does not have to live in the forest after all, and wishes his friend luck on his journey.\n\n=== ''The New Prophecy Series'' ===\n''The New Prophecy'' series covers events in the story from ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' to ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''. Many characters here were first mentioned in the ''Original'' series, but had minor or insignificant roles. In addition, as with the ''Original'' series, most characters listed here play minor or significant roles in the following series, ''Power of Three'', as well.\n\n====Midnight====\n'''Midnight''' is an elderly female badger first introduced in ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'' of ''The New Prophecy'' series.<ref name=midnight/> The journeying cats are initially quite surprised to discover that Midnight is actually a badger, as most badgers are hostile towards cats and several cats have been killed by them. Midnight reveals the true purpose of their journey by telling them that the forest is going to be destroyed. She later instructs the cats to return home through the mountains, resulting in the death of [[#Feathertail|Feathertail]]. She later returns in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'' to warn [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]] of an impending badger attack.<ref name=twilight>{{cite book|title=Twilight|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-082764-9|title-link=Twilight (Warriors)|date=2006-08-22}}</ref>\n\nMidnight is shown to have connections with numerous spiritual entities, including StarClan and the Tribe of Endless Hunting. She is also known to be acquainted with Rock and Sol. Her knowledge of events occurring in the future and distant past is comparable to Rock, who also has near-omniscient knowledge of the cats' universe. She hints that there are many more communities of cats living in Clans and Tribes other than the forest cats, foreshadowing the introduction of the [[List of Warriors characters#The Tribe of Rushing Water|Tribe of Rushing Water]]. Midnight was aware of the Tribe's prophecy regarding Feathertail before she sent the cats to the mountains, effectively sending Feathertail to her death. She appeared in the prologue of Starlight.<ref name=starlight/> She is also capable of speaking and understanding the languages of many other animals, including cat, dog, fox, and rabbit, in addition to her own species' language. Her last appearance is in ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''.<ref name=sunset/> She did, however, made two appearances in ''Long Shadows'', one in the prologue, where she is seen talking to the original leaders of the four Clans and then to Rock, and one while talking to Jayfeather in a dream.<ref name=longshadows/>\nWhen Brambleclaw goes to find Midnight in ''Sunrise'', they don't find her.<ref name=sunrise/> Midnight does however, appear to Jayfeather in another dream.\n\n====Cody====\nA sweet, plucky, sleek, heavily furred, and plump brown tabby kittypet and bright blue eyes, '''Cody''' was captured in ''The New Prophecy'' by Twolegs because her collar had been ripped off when she ran away from her housefolk (Twoleg owners), intending only to have a bit of fun before returning home, so the Twolegs mistook her for a wild cat. She became friends with Leafpool while they were held captive and woke her up from her depression. After being rescued by ThunderClan, she stayed for a while to look after Ferncloud's kit, Birchkit. Before the Clans left the forest, Cody is forced to say goodbye to Leafpool, as although she was willing to help the clan in their hour of need, the life of a warrior cat was not for her, since she couldn't stand the blood and dying, and goes home to her owners.\n\n====Sasha====\nA tawny she-cat with bright blue eyes, darker brown-tipped ears, paws, muzzle, and tail with brown brindle stripes on her legs, '''Sasha''' (also called '''Brownie''' by a Twoleg) used to be a kittypet in her early days. But when her housefolk moved due to the death of the wife, Sasha was left on her own, venturing into ShadowClan territory. Her collar was taken off by Pine, another rogue. She caught sight of a patrol of [[#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]], Jaggedtooth and Rowanclaw, calling Tigerstar \"the big handsome tabby.\" He sees her in a tree, but does not tell his Clanmates. The next day, she leaps from her tree to give the frog that slipped out of Rowanclaw's claws to them. Tigerstar and Sasha begin speaking, and they soon meet every night. They have a bump in their relationship when Tigerstar discovers that Sasha is a kittypet, and he despises kittypets because of Firestar and his father, Pinestar, who had left him and his Clan to become a kittypet, so he does not come. But when he saves her from foxes, their relationship grows stronger, and he invites her to join ShadowClan. However, after she learns of his evil plan to rule the forest and kill all cats with \"half-Clan\" blood, she realizes he lied to her all along and rejects his offer.\n\nShe is the mother of [[#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]] and [[#Mothwing|Mothwing]], and another kit, named '''Tadpole'''. She left Hawkfrost and Mothwing in RiverClan because she knew that Clan life wasn't for her, yet she wanted her kits to grow into warriors. Earlier, Tadpole, Hawk (Hawkfrost) and Moth (Mothwing) traveled away from their nest in order to find Ken. They got lost in the Twolegplace and were trapped. Tadpole sacrificed his life in order to save his littermates. The place where they were trapped flooded and Tadpole drowned. She asked them to stay with her in the forest when the Clans were leaving, but they refused. It was revealed in a chat that Sasha is alive, still looking for her housefolk.\n\n====Smoky====\nA muscular grey and white tom, '''Smoky''' lives at the horseplace with Floss and formerly [[#Daisy|Daisy]]. He was first introduced in ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]''.<ref name=starlight />  He is the father of Daisy's kits, [[#Berrynose|Berrynose]], [[#Mousewhisker|Mousewhisker]], and [[#Hazeltail|Hazeltail]], and (along with the other horseplace cats) refers to humans as 'Nofurs' instead of 'Twolegs'.\nAlthough he is the mate of both Daisy and Floss, Daisy knows that they care more for each other than they do for her. But in ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]'' when he meets Hazeltail, she tells him that Daisy has moved on; Smoky is saddened by this.<ref name=sunrise />\n\n====Floss====\nA small grey-and-white she-cat, '''Floss''' lives at the horseplace with Smoky, her mate. Her kits were all taken by the Twolegs; or as the horseplace cats call them, the Nofurs. Sister to Daisy, and aunt to Berrynose, Mousewhisker, Hazeltail, Toadstep and Rosepetal and great-aunt to Poppyfrost and Berrynose's kits, born at the end of \"The Fourth Apprentice.\"<ref name=\"Fourth Apprentice\"/> Dies between ''The Last Hope'' and ''Bramblestar's storm.''\n\n====Sharptooth====\n'''Sharptooth''' is a huge tawny mountain lion that terrorized the Tribe of Rushing Water when the journeying cats met them. He was introduced in Moonrise, and has not appeared in any other books.<ref name=moonrise/> Feathertail met her end driving a spike of rock into him, successfully killing him and fulfilling the prophecy that said: \"A silver cat, not from this Tribe, will rid us of Sharptooth once and for all\".\n\n===''Power of Three Series''===\nThe ''Power of Three'' series covers events in the story from ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' to ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]''.\n\n==== Brightspirit ====\nBrightspirit is a deceased, very young, beautiful silver tabby she-cat with dazzling green eyes mentioned in ''Long Shadows''.<ref name=longshadows />  She was created in memory of 10-year-old ''Warriors'' fan Emmy Grace Cherry, who died when a tornado struck her house in Russellville, Arkansas.\n\nWhen ThunderClan was low on catmint she appeared in Jayfeather's dream and told him that catmint was where \"wind was\". After thinking about it, Jayfeather realized that it was in WindClan.\n\n====Flick====\nA skinny light brown tom with large pointed ears, '''Flick''' is one of the intruders invading the territory of the Tribe of Rushing Water in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\">Hunter, Erin. (2008) ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''. 352pp.</ref>\n\n====Flora====\nA dark brown-and-white she-cat with green eyes, '''Flora''' is one of the intruders invading the territory of the Tribe of Rushing Water in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>\n\n====Sol====\n'''Sol''' is a tall, stocky, long-furred dark brown and bright tortoiseshell loner with pale yellow eyes, a face that tapers at the muzzle, a curving tail bushed at the tip, and large wide-spaced ears. He is a mysterious character introduced in ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]''.<ref name=eclipse/> He has knowledge of all four Clans (given to him by Midnight), despite none of them ever having seen him before. Sol predicts the forthcoming [[Solar eclipse|eclipse of the sun]], an act that appears to be the beginnings of his attempt to convince the Clans that StarClan are not all-powerful. He later convinces [[#Blackstar|Blackstar]], who has already begun to lose faith in StarClan, to renounce his faith altogether and not allow his Clan to attend Gatherings.\n\nSol's character is, for the moment, ambiguous. He is polite, but not friendly. An attempt by [[#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]] to scan his mind results in a whirlwind of thoughts ranging locations far beyond any of the Clan territories, implying that this cat knows far more about the Clans' universe than he cares to reveal. He is also aware of the prophecy concerning Jayfeather, [[#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] and [[#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]]. Sol plays a large part in ''Long Shadows''; his face is on the cover and in the excerpt he is seen attempting to convince the Clans to renounce faith in StarClan. It is mentioned in ''Long Shadows'' that [[#Midnight|Midnight]] told Sol all about StarClan and the four Clans, for a reason she will not disclose.<ref name=longshadows />  Also, Hollyleaf has a nightmare in which she sees Sol blotting out the moon and her Clanmates crying out in fear. It is perhaps a sign that Sol will destroy all the Clans. In ''Long Shadows'', when Hollyleaf runs into Sol on the lakeshore, he heads towards WindClan's territory where Ashfur's body is later found.<ref name=longshadows />  Some people suspected him to be Ashfur's murderer rather than [[#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]], but Sol does not appear to have a motive. Additionally, when Jayfeather read Squirrelflight's mind following Ashfur's murder, she was afraid, seeming to confirm that she killed Ashfur, not Sol. But in the prologue of ''Sunrise'', as Leafpool is examining Ashfur's body, she finds a tuft of black fur carrying Hollyleaf's scent, identifying Hollyleaf as the real killer.<ref name=sunrise />  However, the rest of the Clan does not know this, so Ashfoot, the WindClan deputy, reveals to Brambleclaw that she saw Sol near where Ashfur's body was found. Upon hearing this, [[#Firestar|Firestar]] sent a patrol consisting of Brambleclaw, Brackenfur, Birchfall, Hazeltail, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. They search a large Twolegplace near the sun-drown-place and find a group of cats that Sol convinced to fight a pack of wild dogs that were threatening their home. After hearing the horrific story of their defeat, the new leader, Jingo, leads them to Purdy as Sol is staying with him. They find him and take him to the ThunderClan camp to be questioned by Firestar, with Purdy tagging along, becoming a ThunderClan elder. After being interrogated by Firestar, Sol is kept as a prisoner, but escapes when he lures Lionblaze to help him out by telling him he knows who his real father is. When the rest of the Clan finds out, it is rather a relief, because the other Clans were threatening Firestar, as they were nervous at the fact that someone like Sol was among them. Therefore, Firestar just told the other Clans that he banished Sol.\n\nIn ''The Forgotten Warrior'', Lionblaze finds Sol in the tunnels while trying to discover if Hollyleaf is dead or not. Sol goes to the ThunderClan camp and lies to the Clan, telling them that he saves Cherrypaw and Molepaw from a fox (Hollyleaf is the one that saves them). Berrynose, Poppyfrost, and the younger cats accept him. The older cats do not trust him but, Firestar allows Sol to stay with them. Dovewing and Ivypool do not trust him and while in the tunnels, hear him plotting with some WindClan cats, planning to attack ThunderClan through the tunnels. Dovewing and Ivypool are almost caught by WindClan, but a cat saves them and reveals herself to be Hollyleaf. Lionblaze brings Hollyleaf to camp and she reveals that she is the one who saved Cherrypaw and Molepaw from the fox. Many cats, including Berrynose and Poppyfrost, grow furious with Sol and discover he has not returned to camp for a few days. Hollyleaf trains the cats in underground fighting, and with the training they defeat WindClan. Hollyleaf pins down Sol and tells him to never return and that if he does, she will kill him herself.\n\nSol is also a main character in the ''SkyClan and the Stranger'' manga series, which takes place long before his first appearance. He joins [[#Skyclan|SkyClan]], revealing that Sol does not know the Clans just because Midnight told him about them. Although he is desperate to become a warrior and tries to fit in with his new Clanmates, Sol quickly proves himself to be self-centred, lazy when it comes to duties and completely unconcerned about the potential consequences of his actions. This is shown when he steals food from some [[fox]]es that live nearby, inadvertently leading them to the Clan's camp, which makes [[#Leafstar|Leafstar]], the leader of SkyClan, angry with him. In an attempt to impress her, Sol steals Leafstar's three very young kits and hides them far away from the gorge so that he can play a heroic role in finding them. However, his plot is discovered and, in a rage, Leafstar exiles Sol from SkyClan, telling him that he can never be a true warrior because he is selfish and has no understanding of the Warrior Code at all. Sol leaves, cursing the Clans for their \"foolishness\".\n\n====Stripes====\nA large silver tabby tom with dark stripes and amber eyes, '''Stripes''' is the leader of the intruders invading the territory of the Tribe of Rushing Water in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  He is shown as a mocking, cruel and amoral cat, leading the intruders by no code of honor other than a life-or-death policy similar to BloodClan. At the end of the book, he and the other intruders are defeated in battle by the Clan cats and the Tribe, and surrenders, promising to leave the Tribe alone and to respect their borders.\n\n====Twist====\nA young tortoiseshell she-cat with white stripes on her face, '''Twist''' is one of the intruders invading the territory of the Tribe of Rushing Water in ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]''.<ref name=\"pwrbook3\"/>  It is noted by [[#Hollyleaf|Hollypaw]] that she is of apprentice age, and if she had been a Clan cat, they might have been friends.\nOn a side note, during a Wands and Worlds chat, one fan asked if Twist would make another appearance.<ref name=authorchat5 />  This was followed by Erin Hunter asking who Twist was. Therefore, it is assumed that Twist will not appear again.\n\n====Jingo====\nA dark brown tabby she-cat with the tip of her tail missing, '''Jingo''' is the leader that is trying to keep the band of Twolegplace cats together after Sol's dark leadership, introduced in ''Sunrise''.<ref name=sunrise />  When the wild dogs were chasing the ThunderClan cats, she found them and led them to safety in her abandoned Twoleg nest, and she led them back to were [[#Purdy|Purdy]] lives. Sol convinced Jingo to leave her housefolk and join his new Twolegplace \"Clan\", and she decided that it sounded exciting, and she told her neighbor, [[#Flower|Flower]], about this, too. Unfortunately, Flower was killed by the wild dogs while on a hunting mission.\n\nWhen Sol was leader of the Twolegplace cats, he acted like their king, always asking them to bring him food, but never hunting himself. After Flower was killed, he devised a plan to show the dogs whose territory the nest was. He made it sound as if there was no other choice, and [[#Pepper & Jet|Pepper]], [[#Jester & Frosty|Jester]], and [[#Jester & Frosty|Frosty]] were killed as a result of his bad judgment, and all the cats had wounds, except for Sol, because he didn't raise a paw to help his own cats. After the battle, Sol refused to take responsibility for his mistake and Jingo asked him to leave.\n\nJingo is obviously a very emotionally strong character, as she had to deal with guilt from inviting Flower to join Sol, only for her to be killed. She also has to keep the shattered group together, and Lionblaze and Brambleclaw are impressed by this personality trait. Brambleclaw, as she is going back to the abandoned Twoleg nest, says, too softly for her to hear, \"Goodbye, Jingostar. May StarClan light your path.\" This shows that he thinks she is as noble as a Clan leader.\n\n====Hussar====\nA broad-shouldered grey tom, '''Hussar''' has a long scar on his side from the fight with the wild dogs. He joined the Twolegplace \"Clan\" with [[#Jingo|Jingo]], so they may be very good friends. Hussar is probably the strongest of the group, and therefore he acts as deputy to Jingo. He is rather calm, despite his size and strength, but shows an uncharacteristic hatred for [[#Sol|Sol]].\n\n====Speckle====\nA flecked brown she-cat, '''Speckle''' is nursing four kits, one of which is named '''Frisk'''. Her mate left when the wild dogs started to terrorize the lone cats in the abandoned Twoleg nest, but she is now in love with Sol, as she said she \"wanted them [the kits] to be Sol's\" and she would be \"very glad to see him.\" She also defends Sol's reputation when they are discussing him with the Clan cats. She seems very protective of her kits and extremely suspicious of the Clan cats, perhaps because she knows they are looking for Sol, and when they find him it won't be for a friendly visit.\n\n====Fritz====\n'''Fritz''' is a small black and white tom with a torn ear from the dog fight. He is a very jumpy, soft-spoken cat. He is evidently friends with [[#Jingo|Jingo]], or possibly mates, because he was comforting her when the subject of [[#Flower|Flower]] came up, and vice versa when Fritz was scared. He was the first to meet the ThunderClan cats, near the edges of the Twolegplace, and tipped them off that [[#Sol|Sol]] was nearby when he said, obviously scared to death of the Clan cats, \"That's what ''he'' said! And look what happened!\" They assumed that he was talking about Sol. In the battle with so-called \"BloodClan,\" Fritz was '''kidnapped''' by BloodClan and ThunderClan attacks BloodClan to stop BloodClan from launching raids and stealing fresh-kill from ThunderClan after Mitzi, Fritz's mother requests them.\n\n====Pod====\nA scrawny brown tom with a scarred, grey muzzle, '''Pod''' is rather skittish, but he is very talkative and is not afraid to speak his mind, as opposed to [[#Fritz|Fritz]]. He complains quite a lot, and often insults things he hates, such as the dogs or Sol. It seems he has a grudge against Sol for acting as a leader among the Twolegplace cats, while he and his \"Clanmates\" went hungry and had to train nonstop for the fight against the dogs. Pod was one of the first to come to Sol's abandoned Twoleg nest, along with Fritz and [[#Speckle|Speckle]].\n\n====Merry & Chirp====\n'''Merry''' is a ginger and white she-cat with green eyes, while '''Chirp''' is a pale grey tabby tom. They are the last of the Twolegplace cats to meet the ThunderClan patrol. Their appearance triggered all of the Twolegplace cats into hiding, thinking they were the dogs. When they arrive, Merry leaves soon after, muttering, \"These cats are just like Sol.\" This signals she probably dislikes strangers, like everybody else in the abandoned Twoleg nest after [[#Sol|Sol]]'s leadership. But Chirp stays near the door. As he listens to the discussion, he gives the Clan cats very valuable information: there are rumors that Sol is back, and he is living with [[#Purdy|Purdy]].\n\n====Flower====\n'''Flower''' was a beautiful young she-cat killed by the wild dogs. She was a former kittypet, and was [[#Jingo|Jingo]]'s neighbor. Jingo convinced her to come with her to the abandoned Twoleg nest. Her death caused [[#Sol|Sol]] to create a plan to fight the wild dogs, resulting in more deaths. Jingo misses Flower and feels guilty about bringing her here to her death.\n\n====Pepper & Jet====\n'''Jet''' is a long-furred black tom, and '''Pepper''' is his littermate. Pepper was chosen by [[#Sol|Sol]] to lead the dogs to the unused monster's den. But he never made it; the dogs outran him and killed him, then played with his body. After the battle, Sol walked in and asked Jet to bring him some food, and Jet would have killed Sol if [[#Hussar|Hussar]] had not held him back. Jet walked in while the Clan cats and the Twolegplace cats were discussing Sol, and he showed extreme anger towards Sol, saying to [[#Jingo|Jingo]], \"It's not okay. It'll never be okay. I don't want to ''think'' about that cat ever again!\"\n\n====Jester & Frosty====\n'''Jester''' and '''Frosty''' were the two cats that died as a result of [[#Sol|Sol]]'s plan to fight the dogs. Jester was a tom that was so seriously wounded, he died from his injuries in the abandoned Twoleg nest. Frosty was a she-cat that was ripped to pieces by the dogs.\n\n====Oscar====\nOscar is a kittypet that Firestar meets while searching for cats who would be willing to join the new SkyClan. He is very grouchy and thinks that everything Firestar tells him is complete nonsense, and refuses to join. He is described as a muscular black tom with green eyes.\n\n====Stick, Cora, Coal, Snowy, and Shorty====\nThese five cats meet Firestar when he is traveling to rebuild SkyClan, and is separated from Sandstorm.  Stick is a brown tom with yellow eyes and a torn ear, Cora is a black she cat with a ripped ear, Coal is a black tom with amber eyes and a long coat, Snowy is a pretty white she cat with bright blue eyes, and Shorty is a brown tabby tom with a stub for a tail and amber eyes.  Shorty saves Sandstorm from some Twoleg kits, and then shows Firestar which way she went. In ''Dawn'', there is a cat whose name is Coal in a twoleg nest,<ref name=dawn/> who may be the same Coal that was mentioned in ''Firestar's Quest''. They are also seen in ''SkyClan's Destiny'' where they join SkyClan for a while.<ref name=skyclan>{{cite book|title=SkyClan's Destiny|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-169994-8|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780061699962}}</ref> They leave after SkyClan helps them in the battle with Dodge, Stick's greatest enemy. During this battle, Stick's daughter Red was killed. Red's mother was Velvet, Stick's former mate.\n\n===''A Vision of Shadows Series''===\n====Darktail====\n'''Darktail''', a large, muscular, glossy white tom with blue eyes, black spots, and a long black tail, hence his name, is the main antagonist of the first three books of the story arc ''A Vision of Shadows'', as well as the super edition ''Hawkwing's Journey''.\n\nDarktail is later to be the biological son of Onestar, the leader of WindClan. According to Onestar, Darktail was born as the result of his forbidden relationship with Smoke, a beautiful, pampered kittypet while he was still known as Onewhisker back in the Clans' old forest territories. While still heavily pregnant, Smoke wanted to join WindClan so that her kittens could be brought up as warriors (Onewhisker having never told her the harsher side of the Warrior life). Onewhisker refused, partly because it wasn't the life for her and partly because he knew the fact that he'd mated with a kittypet would ruin his reputation. The only one of her litter to survive was Darktail, and Onewhisker refused to let his son join WindClan for the same reason as his mother. Enraged at this double rejection, Smoke vowed to Onewhisker that she would raise their son to hate his father, the Clans and their way of life.\n\nWhat happened to Darktail afterwards is unknown, as a very long period of time (several years at least) passed between his father's rejection and when he reappeared next. However, apparently his father's rejection and his mother's teachings had a dramatically negative effect on his personality; he grew into a cold and bitter cat with cruelty and vengeance. By the time Darktail resurfaces, he has become the leader of a large group of rogue cats that attempt to copy the Clans' way of life, but are without honor, mercy or compassion. He seeks to hunt down the Warrior Clans and destroy them for rejecting him all those years ago. He and his group join SkyClan, the long-lost fifth Clan, but later betray them and drive them away.\n\nNot long afterwards, Alderpaw and his friends come searching for SkyClan, but come across Darktail and his group instead. They are fooled into believing Darktail and his rogue ''are'' SkyClan, but they eventually find out the truth and escape. Darktail and his group secretly follow them to the Clans' territories.\n\nDarktail and his group eventually manage to take over ShadowClan's territory, with many of its cats choosing to join their group, as they are fed up with Roawnstar for being a \"weak leader\". Darktail dubs his group 'The Kin\", although the title has no real meaning to it. He drowns any cat who tries to leave the group. At one point, Onewhisker, now Onestar and leader of WindClan and with the other Clans launches a full-scale attack on Darktail and his rogues. During the battle, Onestar personally fights Darktail and comes very close to killing him, but before he can do so, Darktail whispers in his ear that \"surely a cat who rejected and then killed his own son would end up in the Dark Forest\". Frightened by this, Onestar orders his Clan to retreat. This costs the Clans the battle and leads to the deaths of several cats, and many others being severely wounded. Shortly afterwards, Darktail takes over RiverClan's territory. When the battle ends, Darktail dishonourably refuses to allow RiverClan to take their wounded Clanmates for treatment or to take their dead for burial, instead taking the wounded as prisoners and leaving the dead in the sun like \"carrion.\" Darktail sadistically tortures the RiverClan prisoners by starving them and leaving their wounds to fester, and humiliates them by forcing them to swear an oath of loyalty to the Kin.\n\nHowever, the captured cats eventually break free and many of the former ShadowClan warriors rebel, forcing the Kin to flee the RiverClan camp. Later, SkyClan reappears and all five Clans take on Darktail's group. Most of Darktail's rogues flee and a now fully determined Onestar takes on his evil son. Onestar eventually drives Darktail into the lake, where their battle takes them further and further out until both of them sink under and neither resurface.\n\n====Nettle====\nA brown tabby tom with long, spiky fur, '''Nettle''' is an exceptionally cruel and sadistic member of Darktail's group. He is the closest the rogues have to a medicine cat, but only knows a few herbs. He tried them all on sick cats, but nothing made them any better. He is also a vicious fighter.\n\nSometime after Darktail's death, Nettle steals the two kits given birth to by his former mate Yarrowleaf, who was born in ShadowClan, as part of Sleekwhisker's plot to kill Rowanclaw. He is stopped and killed by Rowanclaw, though the later dies in the process.\n\n====Raven====\n'''Raven''' is a long-furred, black she-cat and a senior member of Darktail's group. She believes strongly in Darktail's brutal ways.\n\n====Rain====\nA big, long-furred gray tom with a single green eye and a bushy tail, '''Rain''' is originally a temporary member of SkyClan, but later betrays them and joins Darktail's group. He acts as a second-in-command of sorts to Darktail, but later grows frustrated with his leader and tries to murder him, but Darktail kills him.\n\n====Sleekwhisker====\nA sleek, golden-yellow she-cat with green eyes, '''Sleekwhisker''' is the daughter of Dawnpelt and Crowfrost of ShadowClan, and the sister to Juniperclaw and Strikestone, also making her the granddaughter of Rowanclaw and Tawnypelt. She is mentored by her uncle, Tigerheart, and it is apparent that she does not believe in StarClan when she was observed by Alderheart, then Alderpaw, at a Gathering when he first met her and Needlepaw.\n\nSleekwhisker follows Needlepaw, Juniperpaw, and Violetkit to join Darktail and his rogues, leaving her parents and other brother Strikepaw in ShadowClan.\nShe has given herself a warrior name, Sleekwhisker. She taunts Needletail for training Violetpaw and says they are rogues now, not Clan cats, and that she can learn to hunt and fight on her own like rogues do. It becomes apparent she does not like or favor Violetpaw. This shows more as Darktail favors Violetpaw more. Once Darktail and his rogues go to ShadowClan and force out Rowanstar out of leadership, she follows suite as does Needletail, Juniperclaw, and some other ShadowClan cats such as Spikefur and Mistcloud. She asks Dawnpelt, her mother, if she is glad to see her and Juniperclaw as herself, Juniperclaw, and Strikestone since Crowfrost, her father, had died of Yellowcough. Dawnpelt reluctantly agrees with her, saying that she can't leave every one of her kits, and ShadowClan is the only home she ever knew and can't leave it. Sleekwhisker, satisfied with her answer, stays in the newly formed Kin.\n\nSleekwhisker is noted to be one of Darktail's most loyal followers after he takes over ShadowClan and merge the remaining ShadowClan cats and his rogues and form what he has called the Kin. She supports every decision he has made and is deeply suspicious of Violetpaw. She begins to become suspicious of Needletail as well, after Rain had died in the claws of Darktail for betraying him. When Dawnpelt realizes that it was a mistake to stay with the Kin, she tells Violetpaw that she is going to leave and already has sent Juniperclaw and Strikestone to seek for ThunderClan. Dawnpelt tells Violetpaw that Sleekwhisker would never want to leave the Kin and hasn't even asked her about leaving. When Dawnpelt mysteriously disappears, Sleekwhisker shows no emotions about her mother's absence and doesn't seem to care about it either, unlike her brothers who show extreme concern over their missing mother.\n\nWhile the former ShadowClan cats soon realize that Darktail is a cruel and dishonorable cat, Sleekwhisker still remains by his side and agrees with practically every word he says. She tells Darktail that she is Kin now, through and through, and hasn't considered herself a ShadowClan cat in a long time. She shows no remorse when Violetpaw's plan to feed Darktail and his followers poppy seeds has failed, and Violetpaw is to be punished. The punishment is for Darktail to drown Needletail, to show Violetpaw what it's like for the only cat she cared about gone. Once a weak and starved Needletail turns on Darktail, herself, Roach, and Raven, she attacks Needletail along with Roach and Darktail. Sleekwhisker helps drown Needletail in the end by the lake and shows no remorse in murdering her childhood friend, showing her complete devotion to Darktail.\n\nOnce the Kin has been driven out by the other Clans, she runs away with what is left of the Kin; Yarrowleaf and Spikefur follow suit. It is noted by Rowanstar that Sleekwhisker ran off with the Kin, and he declares her and the others traitors. She is missed by Juniperclaw and Strikestone, who wonder where she has gone. The spirits of the cats who drowned in the lake reveal that Sleekwhisker, along with the ShadowClan cats who had not returned, are likely still alive.\n\nSleekwhisker and a heavily pregnant Yarrowleaf later stay in ShadowClan's former camp. Violetshine, Tree, and Sandynose find them, and are surprised and angry to see them. Violetshine notes that Sleekwhisker helped murder Needletail, and that Yarrowleaf showed no remorse in attacking her former Clanmates. Sleekwhisker tells them that Spikefur had died of the sickness as they couldn't find the right herbs to treat him with, and no one else helped. Upon arriving, Strikestone and Juniperclaw greet her warmly, and Sleekwhisker and Yarrowleaf beg Leafstar for them to join SkyClan and appear sad once they find out that ShadowClan is no more. They get turned away, however, on account of their past crimes, but are hidden by Whorlpaw, Juniperclaw, Strikestone, Snowbird, and Scorchfur. Once Tree has found a solution to let them stay, Leafstar finally agrees, albeit reluctantly. Tawnypelt also shows hatred for them, calling them traitors; on the other hand, Rowanstar, now Rowanclaw, forgives them. Juniperclaw supports his sister, claiming that many former ShadowClan cats followed Darktail, himself being one, and asks if Leafstar doesn't believe a cat can change.\n\nNow an apprentice once again in SkyClan, Sleekwhisker is later revealed to have betrayed her brothers, who went behind Leafstar's back to get her a place to stay, as well as Yarrowleaf, who relied on Sleekwhisker during her pregnancy and had thought the two she-cats were friends. She has secretly teamed up with two troublesome kittypets, Susan and Jacques, to help with a plan to get \"revenge\" on Rowanclaw, blaming him for everything that went wrong in her life. Sleekwhisker drugs Yarrowleaf with poppy seeds and steals her kits, Hopkit and Flaxkit, to use as hostages. She also teams up with Nettle and Raven to capture Tawnypelt, intending to murder her right in front of Rowanclaw, as she is the cat he loves most and the one thing he has left. However, Rowanclaw, Macgyver, Yarrowleaf, and Violetshine manage to rescue Tawnypelt, retrieve the stolen kits and defeat Sleekwhisker and the others. She and Nettle take down Rowanclaw by fatally wounding him, though Rowanclaw manages to kill Nettle in the process. Violetshine and the others help drive Sleekwhisker and the other rogues and kittypets away, telling them to never return, as they have betrayed the Clans too many times.\n\n====Smoke====\n'''Smoke''' is a kittypet who never appears, but rather is mentioned and described. She is the former lover and mate of Onestar, and mother of the Darktail. She is described by Onestar as a beautiful she-cat with soft grey fur, and brilliant blue eyes like \"pools of pure water\".\n\nAccording to Onestar, he and Smoke met and fell in love in a Twolegplace when he was known as Onewhisker back in the Clans' old territories. Onewhisker won Smoke's affection by telling her exaggerated stories of Clan life (leaving out the harsher aspects), while Smoke's unique beauty won her Onewhisker's affection. Eventually, Smoke becomes pregnant with Onewhisker's kits, and went to find him on WindClan territory, luckily coming across him while he was out hunting alone. She asked to join WindClan, so that her kits could become warriors. Onewhisker denied Smoke's request, partly because life in the wild wasn't for her (as she was \"soft and delicate\") and partly because he knew he'd be in terrible trouble for mating with a kittypet, as mating with non-Clan cats was forbidden by the Warrior Code. Smoke argued with Onewhisker for a while, but eventually left. However, while she was still on her way home, she went into labor, and because she had no help, only one of her kits survived. That kit was Darktail. Smoke and her son then went back to Smoke's owners, but only for a short while. As soon as Darktail was old enough to leave her, Smoke brought him to his father, begging for him to let his son join WindClan, while he was still young enough to learn about the Warrior Code. Onewhisker, however, rejected his son for the same reason he'd rejected Smoke; partly because he knew the fact that he'd sired a kit with a kittypet would ruin his reputation and partly because he feared Darktail would not be able to survive being a Clan cat. Smoke was infuriated by this double rejection and turned on Onewhisker, raging that she would raise their son alone and teach him to hate the Clans who rejected him. Smoke evidently went through with this, as Darktail grew into a cold and brutal cat with a single purpose: to destroy the Warrior Clans.\n\n===''The Rise of Scourge''===\n\n====Socks====\nThe brother of [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]] and Ruby and the son of Quince, '''Socks''' is a black tom with a white muzzle, tail tip, and paws. He, along with Ruby, tormented their younger brother Tiny into running away from home in ''The Rise of Scourge''.<ref name=\"Rise of Scourge\"/> However, he seems to have a less vicious personality than his sister.\nLater in the book, Socks and Ruby appear before Tiny, now Scourge, abandoned by their Twolegs and desperate for food and shelter.\nAfter a vengeful speech in which Scourge states that he no longer thinks of them as family, and indeed, doesn't think of family at all, he allows them to eat, but afterwards, he exiles them both. It was revealed in a Wands and Worlds chat with Erin Hunter on August 16, 2008,<ref name=authorchat5>{{cite web |url=http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784 |title=Erin Hunter chat #5 transcript - August 16, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203132110/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784 |archivedate=2009-02-03 }}</ref> that Socks and Ruby are still alive.\n\n====Ruby====\nScourge's sister, '''Ruby''', along with her brother Socks, taunted and scared their brother Tiny enough so that he ran away from his Twoleg nest, by saying that Tiny was going to be thrown in the river because he \"wasn't wanted.\" She and Socks were later adopted by housefolk, but were abandoned when they moved away. They came to Tiny (now Scourge), begging for assistance, but were soon turned away. It was revealed in a Wands and Worlds chat with Erin Hunter that they are still alive.<ref name=authorchat5 />  She is described as a light grey she-cat.\n\n====Quince====\nScourge's mother, '''Quince''' had one litter: Ruby, Socks, and Tiny (later Scourge). It is revealed in a Wands and Worlds chat with Erin Hunter that she is still alive, but is quite old.<ref name=authorchat5 />  She mated with [[ThunderClan#Firestar|Firestar]]'s father, although she is not his mother. She is described as a dark grey she-cat with a red collar and amber eyes.\n\n===''Graystripe's Adventure Trilogy''===\n\n====Diesel====\nA light brown tabby tom with black zig-zag stripes and a white chest, paws, and muzzle, '''Diesel''' befriended Graystripe and Millie at a truck stop in ''[[Warrior's Return]]''.<ref name=warrior's>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Warrior's Return|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-06-147867-3|title-link=Warrior's Return}}</ref> When he met the duo, he offered them food and shelter. Millie accepted, while Greystripe was reluctant but was forced to accept the offer when shortly afterwards, Greystripe was hit by a car. Diesel suggested they get to the sun-drown-place by hitching a ride on a truck. Diesel is a very wise cat, but he wasn't always like tat\n\n====Duke====\nA huge, black-and-white tom with a spiked collar and nicks in his ears, '''Duke''' was first introduced in ''[[The Lost Warrior (Warriors)|The Lost Warrior]]''.<ref name=lostwarrior>{{cite book|title=The Lost Warrior|last=Hunter|first=Erin|authorlink=Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-1-4352-0944-2|title-link=The Lost Warrior (Warriors)|date=September 2007}}</ref> One of the house cats in the surrounding Twolegplace where Greystripe lives for a while with the Twoleg family, he is leader of a small gang of hostile kittypets. It is said that \"no one defeats Duke\", as he is a vicious fighter. Graystripe, weakened from his stay with the Twolegs, is defeated by him once, but later Duke and his two cronies are defeated through the combined efforts of a strengthened Graystripe and newly trained Millie. Ironically, as Duke leaves in shame, he hypocritically calls Graystripe 'savage', but Graystripe, remembering what it means to be a warrior, does not listen to him, and walks proudly away with his 'apprentice', Millie.\n\n====Husker====\nA long-haired dark grey tom with a lighter grey muzzle and a tuft of lighter grey fur on the top of his head, '''Husker''' is a patriarch of sorts of the family of barn cats Graystripe and Millie discovers in ''[[Warrior's Refuge (Warriors)|Warrior's Refuge]]''.<ref name=warrior's /> He is the mate of Moss and the father of Birdy, Pad, Raindrop, and Little Mew. He offers shelter to Millie and Graystripe after Millie's eyes are injured in the cornfield close to the barn where he and his family live. He explains that he and his family used to live with a family of kind, elderly Twolegs, but when they died, a new Twoleg family moved in and chased the cats away. He is seen playing with the Twolegs after Graystripe and Millie earn the Twolegs' gratitude for saving one of the Twoleg kits and lead them to the barn to meet the barn cats. It is assumed Husker becomes one of the Twolegs' kittypets afterward, as well as the rest of the family.\n\n====Moss====\nA slender black she-cat, '''Moss''' is the mate of Husker and the sister of Splash, as well as the mother of Birdy, Raindrop, Pad, and Little Mew. She is first introduced, along with the other barn cats, in ''[[Warrior's Refuge (Warriors)|Warrior's Refuge]]'', and convinces Husker to let Graystripe and Millie shelter in the barn after Millie's eyes are injured from the cornfield.<ref name=warrior's/>  Due to Graystripe and Millie's saving one of the Twoleg kits, Moss and the rest of her family are accepted by the Two Legs in the end of the novel, and it is assumed that they have become their new kittypets.\n\n====Splash====\nA young black-and-white tom, '''Splash''' is the brother of Moss and is one of the barn cats in ''[[Warrior's Refuge (Warriors)|Warrior's Refuge]]''.<ref name=warrior's/>  He maintains a minor role throughout the novel, and in the end is accepted by the Two Legs who were previously hostile to them. It is assumed that he and the rest of the barn cats have become their new kittypets.\n\n===''Tigerstar and Sasha's Trilogy''===\n\n====Patch====\n'''Patch''' is a black-and-white kitten who was first introduced in ''Escape From the Forest''.<ref name=\"escape from forest\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Escape from the Forest|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-06-154793-5|title-link=Escape from the Forest}}</ref> He would have drowned in the river if it hadn't been for Sasha alerting the captain of the boat in the river at that time. Over time, the captain started to grow fond of Patch. As the river froze, the captain was loading up a truck, but Sasha wouldn't get in, saying that she had to stay and told Patch to \"take care of the captain.\" The captain said his goodbyes to Sasha, understanding she \"was a wanderer,\" and left with Patch.\n\n====Pine====\nA battle-scarred, pale tom with dark markings running across his back, '''Pine''' is a loner outside the forest and befriended Sasha in her early days as a loner. He was first introduced in ''Into the Woods'', the first novel in the ''Tigerstar and Sasha'' trilogy.<ref name=\"into the woods\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Into the Woods (Warriors)|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-06-154792-8|title-link=Into the Woods (Warriors)}}</ref>\n\n====Tadpole====\nTadpole is a black tomkit, a son  of Tigerstar and Sasha. He drowns in a Twoleg den.\n\n===''Ravenpaw's Path''===\n\n====Violet====\n'''Violet''' is Barley's sister, a cat originally mentioned in ''[[Secrets of the Clans]]''. In the field guide, Violet is almost killed by Barley's (and therefore also her own) brothers Ice and Snake (born Jumper and Hoot), but Barley takes her to live with Fuzz, a kittypet. Violet is described as being a \"tiny cat, pale orange with thin darker orange stripes\" as well as with white paws.<ref name=secrets/>{{rp|138}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Warriors (Erin Hunter)}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Warriors'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Warriors characters}}\n[[Category:Warriors (novel series)|Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in children's literature]]\n[[Category:Lists of fictional animals by work]]\n[[Category:Lists of fictional animals in literature]]\n", "name_user": "Brambleclawx", "label": "safe", "comment": "oops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Warriors_characters"}

Harrell has also played for the [[LG Twins]] of the [[KBO League]].\n\n==High school==\nAs a [[shortstop]]/[[pitcher]], Harrell led Ozark High School to its first state championship in 2004 over Mary Institute and the Saint Louis Country Day School. That same year Harrell went 10\u20131 with a 1.09 ERA. Harrell had three hits in the State Championship game against MICDS. In the semi-final game at the state championship, Harrell was 2\u20133 with a double and go-ahead home run to lead off the 6th inning.

He has played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Chicago White Sox]], [[Houston Astros]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. Harrell has also played for the [[LG Twins]] of the [[KBO League]].\n\n==High school==\nAs a [[shortstop]]/[[pitcher]], Harrell led Ozark High School to its first state championship in 2004 over Mary Institute and the Saint Louis Country Day School. That same year Harrell went 10\u20131 with a 1.09 ERA. Harrell had three hits in the State Championship game against MICDS. In the semi-final game at the state championship, Harrell was 2\u20133 with a double and go-ahead home run to lead off the 6th inning. He also threw a complete game as Ozark scored a 2\u20131 victory over nationally ranked [[Sikeston, Missouri]].

Harrell began his professional career for the Rookie League [[Bristol White Sox]] in {{Baseball year|2004}}. Making 9 starts in 13 appearances, he had a 3\u20135 record with a 5.59 [[Earned run average|ERA]].\n\nIn 2005, Harrell advanced to the Single-A [[Kannapolis Intimidators]].

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Los Angeles Angels]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. Weaver was drafted in the first round (12th overall) in the [[2004 Major League Baseball draft]] by the Angels out of [[California State University, Long Beach|Long Beach State]]. He was a three-time All Star, and twice led the [[American League]] in wins. He is the younger brother of former pitcher [[Jeff Weaver]].\n\n==Early years==\nWeaver grew up in [[Simi Valley, California]], and attended [[Simi Valley High School]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=weaveje02 |title=Jered Weaver Stats |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nWeaver attended college at [[California State University, Long Beach]]. Weaver went 37\u20139 during his baseball career at Long Beach State.  In his final season of 2004, he became the top pro pitching prospect in the country, going 15\u20131, with a 1.62 [[earned run average]] (ERA), 213 [[strikeout]]s and just 21 [[Base on balls|walks]] in 144 innings.  After the 2004 season, he won the [[Golden Spikes Award]] as the top amateur baseball player in America, the [[Dick Howser Trophy]] as the national collegiate baseball player of the year, the [[Roger Clemens Award]] as college baseball's top pitcher, and was named starting pitcher on the All-American first team by [[Baseball America]].  A 2004 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called him dominating, describing his pitching as overwhelming \"batters with a fastball between 89 and 94 mph, a sharp slider and an improving curveball all thrown with the same three-quarter arm delivery. He also has a fiery streak that is revealed with a fist pump or yell after a strikeout that ends an inning or a long at-bat.\" The article compared him to 2001 college pitching sensation [[Mark Prior]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Eric |title=Absolute Power |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/30/sports/sp-weaver30 |publisher=latimes.com |date=March 20, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===2004 draft and minor leagues===\nWeaver was originally speculated to be one of the top three overall draft picks in 2004; however, the bonus demands of his agent, [[Scott Boras]], turned off several teams. On draft day, [[Baseball America]] asked \"Where In The World Is Jered Weaver Going? That is the $10.5 million question. No team is claiming him as a possible first-round pick, and there's no sense that a club is lying in the weeds on him. He and adviser Scott Boras don't seem to be backing down from a reported desire for Mark Prior money, and he could slide through the entire first round altogether.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Callis |first=Jim |title=2004 MLB Draft Blog |date=June 7, 2004 |publisher=baseballamerica.com}}</ref> Weaver was drafted in the 1st round (12th pick overall) by the Angels in the [[2004 Major League Baseball Draft]]. The Angels scouting director [[Eddie Bane]] said he did not know until two minutes before the draft that he'd definitely get the opportunity to choose Weaver. Bane told [[Baseball America]] about their scouting, \"We did our homework. We started when Jered first got to Long Beach. I watched him in intrasquad games back in January. All our guys had seen him. We didn't back off because of reports in the paper. We do our stuff privately. We were prepared if he was there at 12 to take him.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Callis |first=Jim |title=Bush In Hand Worth Two Boras Clients |url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/2004draft/day1cap.html |publisher=Baseball America |date=June 8, 2004}}</ref> However, negotiations did not proceed smoothly. Talks broke down multiple times. Boras and client Weaver held out until the last minutes before the May 2005 deadline, becoming the longest holdout in draft history. Weaver received a $4 million signing bonus, less than the $10.5 million originally sought and also less than a $7\u20138 million range mentioned in the media just months before signing.<ref>{{cite news |last=Callis |first=Jim |title=Weaver, Drew End Record Holdouts |url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/news/050530signings.html |date=May 30, 2005 |publisher=Baseball America}}</ref>\n\nWeaver's ascent to the major leagues was quick.

In 2006, Weaver moved up to Triple-A Salt Lake where he dominated hitters. MiLB wrote of Weaver's success, \"It's fairly common for prospects to struggle in their first exposure to Triple-A ball, but the 23-year-old Weaver dominated the Pacific Coast League almost immediately, posting a 6\u20131 record with a 2.10 ERA in 12 games for the Bees.\"<ref name=\"milb\" /> Angels management were impressed enough to call Weaver up when ace [[Bartolo Col\u00f3n]] was on the disabled list.\n\n===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===\n====2006\u20132007====\nHe made his MLB debut on May 27, 2006, starting against the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. He pitched seven [[shutout]] innings, striking out five, and earned the victory. This was followed with three more consecutive victories. Despite his success, when [[Bartolo Col\u00f3n]] returned from the [[disabled list]], Weaver was bumped out of the rotation and sent back down to the minors. He was recalled to the majors on June 30, 2006, when the Angels [[designated for assignment|designated]] Weaver's brother Jeff for assignment.\n\nWeaver continued his impressive performance, at one point lowering his ERA to 1.12 after six starts.

He also used the changeup with two strikes, but not the curveball. Against right-handers, Weaver used the four-seamer and slider most of the time, and rarely used his curveball.

He also used the changeup with two strikes, but not the curveball. Against right-handers, Weaver used the four-seamer and slider most of the time, and rarely used his curveball.

That season, he posted a 12-12 win\u2013loss record with an [[earned run average]] (ERA) of 3.92,<ref name=\"greatath\"/> and finished fifth in the year's [[American League]] (AL) [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] voting.\n\nIn 1991, Abbott went 18\u201311 for the Angels, who finished in last place in the [[American League West|AL West]] with an 81\u201381 record. Abbott posted the fourth-lowest ERA in the AL (2.89) while pitching 243 [[inning]]s. As a result, Abbott finished third in the AL [[Cy Young Award]] voting.<ref name=\"greatath\"/> In the 1992 season, he posted a 2.77 ERA (fifth-lowest in the AL) but his win\u2013loss record fell to 7\u201315 for the sixth-place Angels.<ref name=\"greatath\"/> Abbott also won the [[Tony Conigliaro Award]] in 1992.\n\nIn the offseason, the Angels attempted to trim payroll and traded Abbott to the [[New York Yankees]] for their top minor league prospect first baseman [[J.T. Snow]], pitchers Russ Springer and Jerry Nielsen. Abbott had an up and down year for the Yankees but on September 4, 1993, Abbott pitched a [[no-hitter]] against the [[Cleveland Indians]].<ref name=\"greatath\"/> On November 26 in the same year, Abbott appeared as himself on the TV series ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' in the episode \"[[List of Boy Meets World episodes|Class Pre-Union]]\".\n\n[[File:MIL1999H25ABBOTT.png|thumb|left|200px|1999 Milwaukee Brewers #25 Jim Abbott home jersey]] In 1994, Abbott's Yankees led the [[American League East|AL East]], but the season halted, and the playoffs were canceled, due to a [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players strike]] on August 12. The following year, after starting the season with the [[Chicago White Sox]], he returned to the Angels, who held an 11-game lead over the [[Seattle Mariners]] in August, but lost the AL West division title in a [[1995 American League West tie-breaker game|one-game playoff to the Mariners]].\n\nHe struggled through the 1996 season, posting a 2\u201318 record with a 7.48 ERA and briefly retired.\n\nAbbott returned to the White Sox in 1998, starting five games and winning all five. Abbott continued his comeback the following year with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], but pitched ineffectively. This was the first time he had played for a [[National League]] team, forcing him to [[batting (baseball)|bat]] for the first time in his career. He recorded two [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in 21 [[at bats]] during his Brewers stint.\n\nAbbott retired after the 1999 season with a career record of 87\u2013108, with a 4.25 ERA.\n\n==Playing with one hand==\nWhen preparing to pitch the ball, Abbott would rest his mitt on the end of his right forearm.

One of the [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period, it was opened in July 1841. A [[Church of England]] foundation, it is well known for its classical, military and sporting traditions, and currently has approximately 640 pupils.\n\n==History==\nTwo Cheltenham residents, G. S. Harcourt and J. S. Iredell, founded Cheltenham College in July 1841 to educate the sons of gentlemen. It originally opened in three houses along Bays Hill Terrace in the centre of the town.\n\nWithin two years it had moved to its present site\u2014with Boyne House as the first College Boarding House\u2014and soon became known simply as Cheltenham College. Accepting both boarding and day boys, it was originally divided into Classical and Military sides until the mid-twentieth century. The 1893 book ''Great Public Schools'' by E. S. Skirving, S. R. James, and [[Henry Churchill Maxwell Lyte]] contained a chapter on each of what they considered England's ten greatest public schools; it included a chapter on Cheltenham College. It is now an independent fee paying school, governed by Cheltenham College Council. A few girls were admitted in 1969 and then in 1981 when the first girls' house opened, the Sixth Form became fully co educational. In 1998, girls were admitted to all other years, making the College fully co-educational.\n\nIn 1865, a Junior Department was added to the main College buildings. In 1993 it opened its doors to girls and also opened a pre-Prep department, Kingfishers, for 3\u20137-year olds.\n\n==Work and service==\n[[File:Cheltenham College Chapel and library.jpg|thumb|right|Cheltenham College chapel and library (Big Modern)]]\nIn the [[First World War]] 702 [[Cheltonian Society|Old Cheltonians]] (former pupils) were killed in the service of their country, and a further 363 died in [[World War II]]. Cheltenham's military past is recognised by the fact that it is one of only three schools in England (the others being Eton College, founded in 1440, and the Duke of York's Royal Military School, founded in 1803) to have its own [[Colours, standards and guidons|military colours]] (last presented in 2000 by The Princess Royal). [[Queen Victoria School]] in [[Dunblane]], Scotland, also has Colours.\n \nThe names of those Old Cheltonians killed in World War I are recorded in the College Chapel, completed in 1896, which to a degree resembles [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]] and is one of the chapels of an English [[Independent school (UK)|public school]]. The names of those killed in the World War II are displayed on the memorial in the College's dining hall.\n\nCheltenham has approximately 640 pupils (a fifth being day pupils) between the ages of 13 and 18.<ref>[http://www.cheltcoll.gloucs.sch.uk/cc/news/facts.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822151818/http://www.cheltcoll.gloucs.sch.uk/cc/news/facts.php|date=22 August 2007}}</ref> The fees are upwards of approximately \u00a330,000 per annum, making it amongst the most expensive schools in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cheltenhamcollege.org/senior-school-fees |title=Fees 2011/2012 |publisher=Cheltenham College |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229191847/http://www.cheltenhamcollege.org/senior-school-fees |archivedate=29 February 2012  }}</ref> The school is now co-educational and maintains a strong academic reputation, with the majority of pupils going to The [[Russell Group]] Universities, and around 7% going on to [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] universities.

Leconfield also hosts day students.\n\n==''If....''==\nCheltenham College was used to film the majority of the school scenes in the popular 1968 British film ''[[If....]]'', starring [[Malcolm McDowell]], although an agreement between the school's then Headmaster, David Ashcroft, and the film's director, [[Lindsay Anderson]] (who was a former pupil and Senior Prefect), prevented the filmmakers from crediting the school. Additional interior scenes were filmed at [[Aldenham School]] in Hertfordshire, which gained sole accreditation in the film's closing credit. Two Surrey independent schools, [[Charterhouse School]] and [[Cranleigh School]], had also negotiated to appear, but pulled out of negotiations once the subject matter of the film became clear.{{citation needed|reason=pulled out|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Old Cheltonians==\n\n===Victoria Cross recipients===\nFourteen Victoria Crosses (VCs) have been won by Old Cheltonians,<ref>Michael Croke Morgan, (1968), ''Cheltenham College: The First Hundred Years'', page 219, (published for the Cheltonian Society by Sadler)</ref> with only [[Eton College]] (37), [[Harrow School]] (20), [[Haileybury College]] (17), and [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]] (15), having higher totals.(Although it should be taken into account that the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]] does not publish lists of recipients of bravery awards in order not to diminish the service of those several thousand former pupils who have fought in battle and not received the VC, but only lesser awards for gallantry).<ref>Fully referenced cited article on number of VCs, school by school, can be found at [[List of Victoria Crosses by School]]</ref>\n\nThe list of names, with age and rank at the time of the deed that merited the award of the [[Victoria Cross|VC]], is as follows:\n\n* Lieutenant [[Andrew Cathcart Bogle]], 78th Regiment, Oonao, India, 29 July 1857, aged 28\n* Mr [[William Fraser McDonell]], Bengal Civil Service, Arrah, India, 30 July 1857 aged 27 \n* Midshipman [[Duncan Gordon Boyes]], RN, HMS Euryalus, Japan, 6 September 1864, aged 17<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dhs.kyutech.ac.jp/~ruxton/boyes.html |title=The Life of Duncan Boyes, V.C |publisher=Dhs.kyutech.ac.jp |accessdate=28 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054505/http://www.dhs.kyutech.ac.jp/~ruxton/boyes.html# |archive-date=4 February 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref> \n* Captain [[George Nicolas Channer]], 1st Gurkha Rifles, Perak Expedition, 20 December 1875, aged 32 \n* Lieutenant [[Teignmouth Melvill]], 24th Regiment of Foot, Isandlwanha, Zululand, 22 January 1879, aged 36 \n* Lieutenant [[Reginald Clare Hart]], Royal Engineers, Afghan War, 31 January 1879, aged 30  \n* Lieutenant [[John Duncan Grant]], 8th Gurkha Rifles, Gyantse Jong, Tibet Expedition, 6 July 1904 aged 27\n* Captain [[Douglas Reynolds]], Royal Field Artillery, Le Cateau, France, 26 August 1914, aged 31\n* Lieutenant [[Philip Neame]], Royal Engineers, Neuve Chapelle, France, aged 26\n* Lieut.

One of the [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period, it was opened in July 1841. A [[Church of England]] foundation, it is well known for its classical, military and sporting traditions, and currently has approximately 640 pupils.\n\n==History==\nTwo Cheltenham residents, G. S. Harcourt and J. S. Iredell, founded Cheltenham College in July 1841 to educate the sons of gentlemen. It originally opened in three houses along Bays Hill Terrace in the centre of the town.\n\nWithin two years it had moved to its present site\u2014with Boyne House as the first College Boarding House\u2014and soon became known simply as Cheltenham College. Accepting both boarding and day boys, it was originally divided into Classical and Military sides until the mid-twentieth century. The 1893 book ''Great Public Schools'' by E. S. Skirving, S. R. James, and [[Henry Churchill Maxwell Lyte]] contained a chapter on each of what they considered England's ten greatest public schools; it included a chapter on Cheltenham College. It is now an independent fee paying school, governed by Cheltenham College Council. A few girls were admitted in 1969 and then in 1981 when the first girls' house opened, the Sixth Form became fully co educational. In 1998, girls were admitted to all other years, making the College fully co-educational.\n\nIn 1865, a Junior Department was added to the main College buildings.

He could throw in the mid 80s with good control, but his relatively slight stature (5'10\", 150&nbsp;lbs.) scared away scouts.<ref name=\"jockbio\" /> Oswalt reflected, \"I always heard that I was too small.\"<ref name=\"Ortiz2006\" /> Weir itself was very small in size, making it difficult for scouts to hear about Oswalt. Nonetheless, he was recruited to join the baseball team at [[Holmes Community College]].<ref name=\"jockbio\" />\n \nAt Weir High School, Oswalt played [[defensive back]] and [[wide receiver]] on the football team, which won a state title his senior year. He graduated in a class with 32 students. Oswalt attended [[Holmes Community College]] in [[Goodman, Mississippi]] for two years.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Minor league career===\nOswalt was spotted by only one major league scout, James Farrar of the Houston Astros. Convinced that Oswalt's anonymity kept him hidden from other teams, the Astros allowed him to drop into the 23rd round of the [[1996 Major League Baseball draft]]. By this point, Oswalt had drawn the attention of the [[Mississippi State Bulldogs]], for whom he had long wanted play. The Astros enticed Oswalt with a $500,000 signing bonus,<ref name=\"jockbio\" /> and he signed with the club on May 18, 1997.<ref name=\"bbrefoswaltmaj\"/> Oswalt would eventually become the latest-drafted player to lead his draft class in career [[Baseball-Reference]] [[Wins Above Replacement]] {{as of|2019|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thebaseballgauge.com/history.php?tab=AmDraft|title=All-Time bWAR|date=2019|publisher=The Baseball Gauge|work=thebaseballgauge.com|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Oswalt played rookie ball in the [[Gulf Coast League]], where he gave up only two runs in five starts.

After a month of pain in his upper shoulder, Oswalt was convinced that his shoulder was torn. Shortly thereafter, he was checking the [[spark plug]] wires on his pickup truck. He touched one of the spark plug wires, causing the truck's engine to start. The truck's [[electric current]] flowed through Oswalt's body, and consequently the muscles in his hand tightened on the spark plug wire. Unable to let go of it, Oswalt grasped the wire for almost one minute.

Oswalt was only expected to pitch a few games and had been given a round-trip ticket. But after striking out 15 batters in his first start with the Express, [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Jackie Moore (baseball)|Jackie Moore]] tore up his ticket. [[Nolan Ryan]], owner of the Express and Oswalt's idol, admired his calm demeanor and his aggressiveness so much that he successfully lobbied to keep Oswalt on the roster, where he would go 11\u20134 with a 1.94 ERA, and recording 141 strikeouts over 19&nbsp;games (18 starts). It was here that he met pitching coach [[Mike Maddux]], who counseled the young Oswalt to be economical in his pitch selection by throwing more breaking balls and inducing groundouts early in the count.\n\nAs a result of his success at Round Rock, Oswalt was selected to play on the U.S. Olympic baseball team at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]. In [[Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Olympic baseball]] competition, Oswalt pitched in the semi-finals against [[South Korea]], a game that the U.S. won with a walk-off home run by [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] en route to their [[gold medal]] finish.

It was here that he met pitching coach [[Mike Maddux]], who counseled the young Oswalt to be economical in his pitch selection by throwing more breaking balls and inducing groundouts early in the count.\n\nAs a result of his success at Round Rock, Oswalt was selected to play on the U.S. Olympic baseball team at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].

Pursuant to the secret communications with the British, he sought and obtained the command of [[West Point]], a critical American defense post in the highlands of the [[Hudson River]].  Peggy and their infant son Edward Shippen Arnold (born 19 Mar 1780) joined him there in a home on the Hudson two miles south of West Point. General Arnold systematically weakened the defenses of West Point with the intent of making it easier for the British to capture.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21, 1780, General Arnold met with Andr\u00e9 on the shores of the Hudson River and gave him documents and maps about the fortifications at West Point in anticipation of the British capture of that site. On Saturday, September 23, Andr\u00e9 was arrested as he rode towards British territory, the documents were discovered, and the plot was exposed.  On Monday, September 25, Arnold received a note announcing Andr\u00e9's capture and possession of treasonous papers and maps. That same morning, General [[George Washington]] was planning to meet Arnold at his home, two miles south of West Point. Arnold first dashed upstairs to Peggy, then fled, eventually reaching HMS ''Vulture'' on the Hudson River.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pages=94\u201396}}\n\nPeggy Shippen Arnold was then dressing in anticipation of hosting a breakfast for Washington and his party. Possibly based on a brief discussion with her husband, she pretended hysteria in order to falsely convince General Washington and his staff that she had nothing to do with her husband's betrayal.  The delay caused by her histrionics may have allowed Arnold time to escape, leaving Peggy with their infant son.  Fearing for her safety, she traveled to Philadelphia to stay with her family.  She also played the innocent when asked about her husband, even though she knew his whereabouts.  Philadelphia authorities soon found a letter from Andr\u00e9 to Peggy written from British-occupied New York\u2014the so-called \"millinery letter\"\u2014and seized upon it as proof that Arnold's wife had been complicitous in the treason. That led the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania to banish her from Philadelphia. In November 1780, her father escorted Peggy and her infant son to the shores of the Hudson where she boarded a boat to New York City to join Arnold.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|page=112}}<ref>{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Clare | title = The Man in the Mirror: A Life of Benedict Arnold | publisher = Random House | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-679-40106-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 234\u2013238] | url = https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a military trial, Major Andr\u00e9 was condemned to death as a common spy and was hanged at [[Tappan, New York]].

[[Queen Charlotte]] awarded her an annuity of 100 [[pound sterling]] for the maintenance of her children, including those not yet born. King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] also presented her with \u00a3350 \"obtained for her services, which were meritorious.\"{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pp=135, 112}} A girl (Margaret) and a boy (George), born in 1783 and 1784 respectively, died in infancy while the Arnolds lived in London.\n\nArnold left for a business opportunity in 1784 and sent to Connecticut for his three sons Benedict, Richard, and Henry (by his first wife) to join him in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]].  During Arnold's stay in New Brunswick, Peggy Shippen Arnold gave birth to their third surviving child Sophia Matilda Arnold, while her husband may have fathered an illegitimate child (John Sage) in New Brunswick.<ref>{{harvnb|Randall|1990|page=613}} Many historians suggest an Arnold liaison in New Brunswick, although Canadian historian Barry Wilson notes the weakness of the traditional account that Sage is the product of such a liaison. Sage's gravestone indicates that he was born on April 14, 1786, a date roughly confirmed by Benedict Arnold's will, which stated that Sage was 14 when Arnold wrote it in 1800. Arnold arrived in New Brunswick in December 1785, so Sage's mother could not have been from there. Wilson believes that the explanation most consistent with the available documentation is that Sage was either the result of a liaison before Arnold left England, or that he was Arnold's grandson by one of his older children. Wilson, pp. 231\u2013233</ref> Peggy sailed to Saint John to join her husband in 1787, leaving her two older sons with a private family in London; in New Brunswick, Peggy gave birth to son George in 1787; their last child William Fitch was born in 1794 after their return to London.\n\nIn 1789, she returned briefly to Philadelphia, accompanied by her infant son George and a maid, to visit with her parents and family. She was treated coldly by Philadelphians in spite of her father's considerable influence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Peggy sailed back to New Brunswick with young George in the spring of 1790, and from there returned to England with Arnold in late December 1791. Their departure was unhappy, with mobs gathering on their property to protest against them and calling them \"traitors.\"\n\nAfter Arnold died in 1801, Peggy auctioned the contents of their home, the home itself, and many of her personal possessions to pay off his debts.  She died in London in 1804, reportedly of cancer,{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=102}} and was buried with her husband at [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Battersea]] on August 25, 1804.\n\n==Role in conspiracy==\n\nHistorians are unanimous in her complicity\u2014and she accepted a reward for her services from the king. Her family in Philadelphia denied everything. \n\n[[James Parton]], a biographer of [[Aaron Burr]], published an account in the 19th century, after all of the principal actors had died, implying that Peggy Shippen Arnold had manipulated or persuaded Benedict to change sides. The basis for the claim was interviews that Burr conducted with Theodosia Prevost, the widow of [[Jacques Marcus Prevost]] who later married Burr, and notes later made by Burr. While en route to Philadelphia from West Point in 1780, Peggy Shippen Arnold visited with Prevost at [[Paramus, New Jersey]]. According to Parton, she unburdened herself to Prevost, claiming that she \"was heartily tired of all the theatricals she was exhibiting\", referring to her histrionics at West Point.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} According to Burr's notes, Shippen Arnold \"was disgusted with the American cause\" and \"through unceasing perseverance, she had ultimately brought the general into an arrangement to surrender West Point.\"{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}}\n\nWhen these allegations were first published, the Shippen family countered with allegations of improper behavior on Burr's part.  They claimed that Burr rode with Peggy Shippen Arnold in the carriage to Philadelphia after her stay with Mrs. Prevost, and that he fabricated the allegation because she refused advances that he made during the ride.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} Arnold biographer [[Willard Sterne Randall]] suggests that Burr's version has a more authentic ring to it: first, Burr waited until all were dead before it could be published; and second, Burr was not in the carriage on the ride to Philadelphia.  Randall also notes that ample further evidence has since come to light showing that Peggy Shippen Arnold played an active role in the conspiracy.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=572}} British documents from 1792 show that Mrs. Arnold was paid \u00a3350 for handling secret dispatches.<ref>Willard N.

General Arnold systematically weakened the defenses of West Point with the intent of making it easier for the British to capture.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21, 1780, General Arnold met with Andr\u00e9 on the shores of the Hudson River and gave him documents and maps about the fortifications at West Point in anticipation of the British capture of that site. On Saturday, September 23, Andr\u00e9 was arrested as he rode towards British territory, the documents were discovered, and the plot was exposed.  On Monday, September 25, Arnold received a note announcing Andr\u00e9's capture and possession of treasonous papers and maps. That same morning, General [[George Washington]] was planning to meet Arnold at his home, two miles south of West Point. Arnold first dashed upstairs to Peggy, then fled, eventually reaching HMS ''Vulture'' on the Hudson River.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pages=94\u201396}}\n\nPeggy Shippen Arnold was then dressing in anticipation of hosting a breakfast for Washington and his party. Possibly based on a brief discussion with her husband, she pretended hysteria in order to falsely convince General Washington and his staff that she had nothing to do with her husband's betrayal.  The delay caused by her histrionics may have allowed Arnold time to escape, leaving Peggy with their infant son.  Fearing for her safety, she traveled to Philadelphia to stay with her family.  She also played the innocent when asked about her husband, even though she knew his whereabouts.  Philadelphia authorities soon found a letter from Andr\u00e9 to Peggy written from British-occupied New York\u2014the so-called \"millinery letter\"\u2014and seized upon it as proof that Arnold's wife had been complicitous in the treason. That led the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania to banish her from Philadelphia. In November 1780, her father escorted Peggy and her infant son to the shores of the Hudson where she boarded a boat to New York City to join Arnold.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|page=112}}<ref>{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Clare | title = The Man in the Mirror: A Life of Benedict Arnold | publisher = Random House | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-679-40106-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 234\u2013238] | url = https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a military trial, Major Andr\u00e9 was condemned to death as a common spy and was hanged at [[Tappan, New York]].

[[Queen Charlotte]] awarded her an annuity of 100 [[pound sterling]] for the maintenance of her children, including those not yet born. King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] also presented her with \u00a3350 \"obtained for her services, which were meritorious.\"{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pp=135, 112}} A girl (Margaret) and a boy (George), born in 1783 and 1784 respectively, died in infancy while the Arnolds lived in London.\n\nArnold left for a business opportunity in 1784 and sent to Connecticut for his three sons Benedict, Richard, and Henry (by his first wife) to join him in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]].  During Arnold's stay in New Brunswick, Peggy Shippen Arnold gave birth to their third surviving child Sophia Matilda Arnold, while her husband may have fathered an illegitimate child (John Sage) in New Brunswick.<ref>{{harvnb|Randall|1990|page=613}} Many historians suggest an Arnold liaison in New Brunswick, although Canadian historian Barry Wilson notes the weakness of the traditional account that Sage is the product of such a liaison. Sage's gravestone indicates that he was born on April 14, 1786, a date roughly confirmed by Benedict Arnold's will, which stated that Sage was 14 when Arnold wrote it in 1800. Arnold arrived in New Brunswick in December 1785, so Sage's mother could not have been from there. Wilson believes that the explanation most consistent with the available documentation is that Sage was either the result of a liaison before Arnold left England, or that he was Arnold's grandson by one of his older children. Wilson, pp. 231\u2013233</ref> Peggy sailed to Saint John to join her husband in 1787, leaving her two older sons with a private family in London; in New Brunswick, Peggy gave birth to son George in 1787; their last child William Fitch was born in 1794 after their return to London.\n\nIn 1789, she returned briefly to Philadelphia, accompanied by her infant son George and a maid, to visit with her parents and family. She was treated coldly by Philadelphians in spite of her father's considerable influence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Peggy sailed back to New Brunswick with young George in the spring of 1790, and from there returned to England with Arnold in late December 1791. Their departure was unhappy, with mobs gathering on their property to protest against them and calling them \"traitors.\"\n\nAfter Arnold died in 1801, Peggy auctioned the contents of their home, the home itself, and many of her personal possessions to pay off his debts.  She died in London in 1804, reportedly of cancer,{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=102}} and was buried with her husband at [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Battersea]] on August 25, 1804.\n\n==Role in conspiracy==\n\nHistorians are unanimous in her complicity\u2014and she accepted a reward for her services from the king. Her family in Philadelphia denied everything. \n\n[[James Parton]], a biographer of [[Aaron Burr]], published an account in the 19th century, after all of the principal actors had died, implying that Peggy Shippen Arnold had manipulated or persuaded Benedict to change sides. The basis for the claim was interviews that he conducted with Theodosia Prevost, the widow of [[Jacques Marcus Prevost]] who later married Burr, and notes later made by Burr. While en route to Philadelphia from West Point in 1780, Peggy Shippen Arnold visited with Prevost at [[Paramus, New Jersey]]. According to Parton, she unburdened herself to Prevost, claiming that she \"was heartily tired of all the theatricals she was exhibiting\", referring to her histrionics at West Point.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} According to Burr's notes, Shippen Arnold \"was disgusted with the American cause\" and \"through unceasing perseverance, she had ultimately brought the general into an arrangement to surrender West Point.\"{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}}\n\nWhen these allegations were first published, the Shippen family countered with allegations of improper behavior on Burr's part.  They claimed that Burr rode with Peggy Shippen Arnold in the carriage to Philadelphia after her stay with Mrs. Prevost, and that he fabricated the allegation because she refused advances that he made during the ride.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} Arnold biographer [[Willard Sterne Randall]] suggests that Burr's version has a more authentic ring to it: first, Burr waited until all were dead before it could be published; and second, Burr was not in the carriage on the ride to Philadelphia.  Randall also notes that ample further evidence has since come to light showing that Peggy Shippen Arnold played an active role in the conspiracy.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=572}} British documents from 1792 show that Mrs. Arnold was paid \u00a3350 for handling secret dispatches.<ref>Willard N.

This was transliterated, that is, phonetically Anglicized by the English-speaking settlers of the 19th century and later to the name \"SMACKOVER.\"\n\nThe name Bayou de Chemin Couvert (Smackover Creek) first appeared in an April 5, 1789, letter written by the commandant of Fort Miro (Monroe, Louisiana) to the French territorial governor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/smackover-union-county-1000/|title=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|accessdate=Dec 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOil was discovered in this area in 1922; it attracted national attention, speculators, and an economic boom.

Within a year, almost 1,000 wells had produced 25 million barrels of oil.\n\nIn October 1922, a lighter oil was produced further west, from the Meakin sand, at depths between 2230 and 2350 feet. Oil was discovered in the Blossom sand at a depth of 2610 feet in March 1923. The Graves sand was exploited for oil at a depth of 2501 feet in January 1925.\n\nOn 8 May 1936, oil was discovered in the [[Jurassic]] [[Smackover Formation]] [[limestone]] at a depth of 4800 feet by the [[Phillips Petroleum Company]].

According to the 2010 census, the population was at 1,865. It had a large oil boom in the 1920s, with production continuing for some time.\n\n==History==\nIn 1686, the French settlers called this area ''\"SUMAC COUVERT\"'', which translates to \"covered in [[Sumac|sumac bushes]]\".  This was transliterated, that is, phonetically Anglicized by the English-speaking settlers of the 19th century and later to the name \"SMACKOVER.\"\n\nThe name Bayou de Chemin Couvert (Smackover Creek) first appeared in an April 5, 1789, letter written by the commandant of Fort Miro (Monroe, Louisiana) to the French territorial governor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/smackover-union-county-1000/|title=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|accessdate=Dec 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOil was discovered in this area in 1922; it attracted national attention, speculators, and an economic boom. Smackover was incorporated in 1923. In the 1920s there was a large-scale oil industry in Smackover.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzk9g9TuMNYC&lpg=PA42&dq=fleatown%20ohio&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q=fleatown%20ohio&f=false | title=A Place Called Peculiar: Stories About Unusual American Place-Names | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | date=May 17, 2012 | accessdate=2013-04-19 | author=Gallant, Frank K. | pages=20}}</ref> The industry declined here and across southern Arkansas by the 1960s, at a cost of many jobs and major losses to the area economy.\n\n==Smackover Oil Field==\nThe '''Smackover Oil Field''' was discovered on April 14, 1922. The J.T. Murphy well drilled by Oil Operators Trust, reached the [[Upper Cretaceous]] Nacatoch sand at a depth of 2024 feet, part of the Norphlet [[dome (geology)|dome]].  Within a year, almost 1,000 wells had produced 25 million barrels of oil.\n\nIn October 1922, a lighter oil was produced further west, from the Meakin sand, at depths between 2230 and 2350 feet. Oil was discovered in the Blossom sand at a depth of 2610 feet in March 1923. The Graves sand was exploited for oil at a depth of 2501 feet in January 1925.\n\nOn 8 May 1936, oil was discovered in the [[Jurassic]] [[Smackover Formation]] [[limestone]] at a depth of 4800 feet by the [[Phillips Petroleum Company]].  Oil and gas were produced from the [[porosity|porous]] Reynolds [[oolite]] at a depth of 4897 feet.<ref name=aogc>{{cite web |url=http://www.aogc.state.ar.us/recovery/FINALS/Chap16.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172549/http://www.aogc.state.ar.us/recovery/FINALS/Chap16.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-23 |df= }}, AOGC, State of Arkansas</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe city is in northern Union County along [[Smackover Creek]].
