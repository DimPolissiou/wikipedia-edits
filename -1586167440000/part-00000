After the stress of promoting Radiohead's acclaimed 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]'', songwriter [[Thom Yorke]] envisioned a radical change in direction. The band incorporated [[Synthesizer|synthesisers]], [[drum machines]], [[string orchestra|string]]s and [[brass instrument|bras]]s, drawing influence from [[electronic music]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[krautrock]], [[jazz]], and [[20th-century classical music]]. They recorded ''Kid A'' with ''OK Computer'' producer [[Nigel Godrich]] in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown [[Oxford]], England. Another album recorded in the same sessions, ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'', was released the following year.\n\nRadiohead released no singles or [[music videos]] to promote ''Kid A'' and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. Instead, they became one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool; the album was made available to [[Streaming media|stream]] and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. [[Bootleg recording|Bootlegs]] of early performances were shared on [[file sharing|file-sharing]] services, and the album was [[Internet leak|leaked]] before release.\n\n''Kid A'' debuted at the top of the charts in Britain, where it went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the first week. It also became Radiohead's first number-one album in the United States. Like ''OK Computer'', it won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].

After the stress of promoting Radiohead's acclaimed 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]'', songwriter [[Thom Yorke]] envisioned a radical change in direction. The band incorporated [[Synthesizer|synthesisers]], [[drum machines]], [[string orchestra|string]]s and [[brass instrument|bras]]s, drawing influence from [[electronic music]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[krautrock]], [[jazz]], and [[20th-century classical music]]. They recorded ''Kid A'' with ''OK Computer'' producer [[Nigel Godrich]] in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown [[Oxford]], England. Another album recorded in the same sessions, ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'', was released the following year.\n\nRadiohead released no singles or [[music videos]] to promote ''Kid A'' and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. Instead, they became one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool; the album was made available to [[Streaming media|stream]] and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. [[Bootleg recording|Bootlegs]] of early performances were shared on [[file sharing|file-sharing]] services, and the album was [[Internet leak|leaked]] before release.\n\n''Kid A'' debuted at the top of the charts in Britain, where it went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the first week. It also became Radiohead's first number-one album in the United States. Like ''OK Computer'', it won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. Its departure from Radiohead's earlier sound divided fans and critics, and some dismissed it as pretentious, deliberately obscure, or derivative. However, ''Kid A'' later attracted wider acclaim; at the turn of the decade, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' and the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' ranked ''Kid A'' the greatest album of the 2000s. In 2012, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked it number 67 on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time]].\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of their 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]'', the members of Radiohead suffered [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].<ref name=\"ZORIC\"/> Yorke became ill, describing himself as \"a complete fucking mess ... completely unhinged\".<ref name=\"ZORIC\" /> Drummer [[Philip Selway]] said Radiohead worried that the success had \"turned us into a one-trick band\".<ref name=\"monsters\">{{cite journal |last=Cavanagh |first=David |date=October 2000 |title=I Can See The Monsters |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|pages=96\u2013104}}</ref> Bassist [[Colin Greenwood]] said: \"We felt we had to change everything.

The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|Hosts\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|Spanish commentators\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Interviewers\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|Pre-show panel\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced Bobby Lashley (accompanied by Lana). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler.\n\nThe Firefly Fun House match between \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt and John Cena was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt and Cena suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering to a [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) entrance and in nWo gear, acting as [[\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] with Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. In the end, McIntyre countered a fourth F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|Hosts\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|English Commentators\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|Spanish commentators\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Interviewers\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|Pre-show panel\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced Bobby Lashley (accompanied by Lana). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler.\n\nThe Firefly Fun House match between \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt and John Cena was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt and Cena suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering to a [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) entrance and in nWo gear, acting as [[\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] with Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. In the end, McIntyre countered a fourth F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.

The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5\u20136 metres height. The tree is of medium hardiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plum, prune, European type|publisher=Purdue University|year=1999|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412183755/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|archivedate=2012-04-12}}</ref> Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres in height and spread across 10 metres. They blossom in different months in different parts of the world; for example, in about January in Taiwan and early April in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|title=Prunus domestica Plum, European plum PFAF Plant Database|work=pfaf.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122110734/http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|archivedate=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n\nFruits are usually of medium size, between 2 and 7 centimetres in diameter, globose to oval. The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is a [[drupe]], meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard seed.\n[[File:Plum blossom on the first day of spring - geograph.org.uk - 1214413.jpg|thumb|Plum flowers]]\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Closeup of blackthorn aka sloe aka prunus spinosa sweden 20050924.jpg|thumb|Sloe or blackthorn, ''Prunus spinosa'']]\n\nPlum [[cultivar]]s include:\n* [[Damson]] (purple or black skin, green flesh, clingstone, astringent)\n* [[Greengage]] (firm, green flesh and skin even when ripe)\n* [[Mirabelle Plum|Mirabelle]] (dark yellow, predominantly grown in northeast [[France]])\n* [[Satsuma plum]] (firm red flesh with a red skin)\n* [[Victoria plum|Victoria]] (yellow flesh with a red or mottled skin)\n* [[Yellowgage (plum)|Yellowgage]] or golden plum (similar to greengage, but yellow)\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Different plum cultivars\">\nFile:Slivka.JPG|Damsons\nFile:Greengages 0.jpg|Greengages\nFile:Mirabellen.jpg|Mirabelles\nFile:Prunus domestica 'Reine Victoria'.jpg|Victoria plums\n</gallery>\n\nWhen it flowers in the early spring, a plum tree will be covered in [[blossom]]s, and in a good year approximately 50% of the flowers will be pollinated and become plums. Flowering starts after 80 [[growing degree day]]s.\n\nIf the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]]. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]], including [[November moth]], [[willow beauty]] and [[short-cloaked moth]].\n[[File:970718-DriedGoldenPlum-IMG 7527-2.jpg|thumb|Dried yellow plums]]\n\nThe taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[\u0161ljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159\u2013165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Vel\u00ed\u0161ek |author2=Franti\u0161ek Pudil |author3=Ji\u0159\u00ed Dav\u00eddek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463\u2013466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726}}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.\n\nAs with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064\u20131094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum.

The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5\u20136 metres height. The tree is of medium hardiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plum, prune, European type|publisher=Purdue University|year=1999|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412183755/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|archivedate=2012-04-12}}</ref> Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres in height and spread across 10 metres. They blossom in different months in different parts of the world; for example, in about January in Taiwan and early April in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|title=Prunus domestica Plum, European plum PFAF Plant Database|work=pfaf.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122110734/http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|archivedate=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n\nFruits are usually of medium size, between 2 and 7 centimetres in diameter, globose to oval. The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is a [[drupe]], meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard seed.\n[[File:Plum blossom on the first day of spring - geograph.org.uk - 1214413.jpg|thumb|Plum flowers]]\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Closeup of blackthorn aka sloe aka prunus spinosa sweden 20050924.jpg|thumb|Sloe or blackthorn, ''Prunus spinosa'']]\n\nPlum [[cultivar]]s include:\n* [[Damson]] (purple or black skin, green flesh, clingstone, astringent)\n* [[Greengage]] (firm, green flesh and skin even when ripe)\n* [[Mirabelle Plum|Mirabelle]] (dark yellow, predominantly grown in northeast [[France]])\n* [[Satsuma plum]] (firm red flesh with a red skin)\n* [[Victoria plum|Victoria]] (yellow flesh with a red or mottled skin)\n* [[Yellowgage (plum)|Yellowgage]] or golden plum (similar to greengage, but yellow)\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Different plum cultivars\">\nFile:Slivka.JPG|Damsons\nFile:Greengages 0.jpg|Greengages\nFile:Mirabellen.jpg|Mirabelles\nFile:Prunus domestica 'Reine Victoria'.jpg|Victoria plums\n</gallery>\n\nWhen it flowers in the early spring, a plum tree will be covered in [[blossom]]s, and in a good year approximately 50% of the flowers will be pollinated and become plums. Flowering starts after 80 [[growing degree day]]s.\n\nIf the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]]. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]], including [[November moth]], [[willow beauty]] and [[short-cloaked moth]].\n[[File:970718-DriedGoldenPlum-IMG 7527-2.jpg|thumb|Dried yellow plums]]\n\nThe taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[\u0161ljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159\u2013165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Vel\u00ed\u0161ek |author2=Franti\u0161ek Pudil |author3=Ji\u0159\u00ed Dav\u00eddek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463\u2013466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726}}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.\n\nAs with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064\u20131094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum.

{"title_page": "Pan toting", "text_new": "{{copy edit|date=February 2020|for=quotations, consistency, and style}}\n\n'''Pan toting''', also known as the '''service pan''', was the practice of [[African-American]] [[domestic worker]]s taking dry goods or leftover table scraps from their white employers as a [[Reparations for slavery|form of compensation]]. African-American domestic workers required compensation due to the wealth they produced for their masters during their former status as [[Slavery|slaves]] and the low wages received post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]]. As their way of seeking justice, domestic workers implemented the strategy of \u201cpan-toting\u201d by \u2018re-appropriating the material assets of their employers for their use.'<ref name=Hunter-60>Hunter, p. 60.</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\nThere were various forms of compensation that domestic workers could receive instead of actual wages. The most common form was food and the most common worker who \u201cpan-toted\u201d was the cook. African-American household employees would take leftover food from their white employer's kitchen as a supplement for low or infrequently paid wages. (Clothing was also taken in partial compensation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Honey |first= Michael |date=December 1998|title=Review of books: TERA W. HUNTER, To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War |journal=The American Historical Review|volume=103|page= 1702 |doi=10.1086/ahr/103.5.1702|issn=1937-5239}}</ref>) \u201cPan-toting\u201d helped alleviate the pressures low wage labor brought to domestic workers. Along with low wages, some employers outright refused to pay wages and were dishonest with wages or deprived workers of wages for a lengthened time. These deprived and frustrated workers then used \u201cpan-toting\u201d as a counter-tactic. The \"pan-toting\" strategy was essential for making ends meet and asserting their new-found freedom. Household laborers expected employees to acknowledge their duty to ensure basic needs by supplementing wages with leftover food, or they would reclaim the fruits of their labor without the employers\u2019 consent.<ref name=Hunter-60-61>Hunter, pp. 60-61.</ref> This was an expectation from the worker due to their low wages. Employers were expected to recognize their obligation to this practice and ensure workers receive basic provisions from leftover food. If the employer did not recognize this, some workers would leave without consent. Some employers admitted to the practice, openly admitting that they paid low wages with table scraps in mind. Other employers interpreted \u201cfree\u201d labor to mean expropriating labor without compensation'.<ref name=Hunter-61>Hunter, p. 61.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n\"Pan-Toting\" originated in [[slavery in the United States]] during the late nineteenth century, among the African-American population. This practice evolved during the transition from slave to free labor as an expression of a dissolving \u201cmoral economy\u201d. It is consistent with the \u201cvails\u201d and prerequisites claimed by servants across cultures and dating back centuries.<ref name=Hunter-61 /> It was African-American domestic workers that claimed the right to this form of compensation and privileges as workers in the new free labor market due to their former status as slaves and the unpaid work they carried out for their masters and the white community. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, African-American domestic workers continued to implement this practice. They continued to express their opposition to work conditions that deprived them of a decent standard of living by drawing on decades of experiences with creative resistance.<ref name=Hunter-227>Hunter, p. 227.</ref>\n\n== Dependence ==\nA lot of African-American workers and their families depended upon this form of payment as they were short for money. This left-over food was important to their survival. The \u201cservice pan\u201d augmented wages in almost two-thirds of the employers\u2019 households in Athens, Georgia, in 1913.<ref name=Sharpless-74>Sharpless, p. 74.</ref> A \u201c[[Negro]] Nurse\u201d writing in 1912 portrays this dependence: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be frank with you, if it were not for the service pan, I don\u2019t know what the majority of our Southern colored families would do. The service pan is the mainstay in many a home\u2026others may denounce the service pan, and say that it is used to support idle negroes, but many a time, when I was a cook and had the responsibility of rearing my three children upon my lone shoulders, many a time I have had the occasion to bless the Lord for the service pan!\u201d.<ref>Sharpless, pp. 74-75.</ref> Consequently, due to African-American domestic workers and their families reliance on \u201cpan-toting\u201d, their diets were decided by and depended on the white employer. Most poignantly, Richard Wright remembered waiting for his mothers\u2019 employers to finish their meals so that he could learn what his own dinner would be: \u201cIf the white people left anything, my brother and I would eat well; but if they did not, we would have our usual bread and tea. Watching the white people eat would make my empty stomach churn and I would grow vaguely angry. Why could I not eat when I was hungry? Why did I always have to wait until others were through?

African-American domestic workers required compensation due to the wealth they produced for their masters during their former status as [[Slavery|slaves]] and the low wages received post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]]. As their way of seeking justice, domestic workers implemented the strategy of \u201cpan-toting\u201d by \u2018re-appropriating the material assets of their employers for their use.'<ref name=Hunter-60>Hunter, p. 60.</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\nThere were various forms of compensation that domestic workers could receive instead of actual wages. The most common form was food and the most common worker who \u201cpan-toted\u201d was the cook. African-American household employees would take leftover food from their white employer's kitchen as a supplement for low or infrequently paid wages. (Clothing was also taken in partial compensation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Honey |first= Michael |date=December 1998|title=Review of books: TERA W. HUNTER, To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War |journal=The American Historical Review|volume=103|page= 1702 |doi=10.1086/ahr/103.5.1702|issn=1937-5239}}</ref>) \u201cPan-toting\u201d helped alleviate the pressures low wage labor brought to domestic workers. Along with low wages, some employers outright refused to pay wages and were dishonest with wages or deprived workers of wages for a lengthened time. These deprived and frustrated workers then used \u201cpan-toting\u201d as a counter-tactic. The \"pan-toting\" strategy was essential for making ends meet and asserting their new-found freedom. Household laborers expected employees to acknowledge their duty to ensure basic needs by supplementing wages with leftover food, or they would reclaim the fruits of their labor without the employers\u2019 consent.<ref name=Hunter-60-61>Hunter, pp. 60-61.</ref> This was an expectation from the worker due to their low wages. Employers were expected to recognize their obligation to this practice and ensure workers receive basic provisions from leftover food. If the employer did not recognize this, some workers would leave without consent. Some employers admitted to the practice, openly admitting that they paid low wages with table scraps in mind. Other employers interpreted \u201cfree\u201d labor to mean expropriating labor without compensation'.<ref name=Hunter-61>Hunter, p. 61.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n\"Pan-Toting\" originated in [[slavery in the United States]] during the late nineteenth century, among the African-American population. This practice evolved during the transition from slave to free labor as an expression of a dissolving \u201cmoral economy\u201d. It is consistent with the \u201cvails\u201d and prerequisites claimed by servants across cultures and dating back centuries.<ref name=Hunter-61 /> It was African-American domestic workers that claimed the right to this form of compensation and privileges as workers in the new free labor market due to their former status as slaves and the unpaid work they carried out for their masters and the white community. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, African-American domestic workers continued to implement this practice. They continued to express their opposition to work conditions that deprived them of a decent standard of living by drawing on decades of experiences with creative resistance.<ref name=Hunter-227>Hunter, p. 227.</ref>\n\n== Dependence ==\nA lot of African-American workers and their families depended upon this form of payment as they were short for money. This left-over food was important to their survival. The \u201cservice pan\u201d augmented wages in almost two-thirds of the employers\u2019 households in Athens, Georgia, in 1913.<ref name=Sharpless-74>Sharpless, p. 74.</ref> A \u201c[[Negro]] Nurse\u201d writing in 1912 portrays this dependence: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be frank with you, if it were not for the service pan, I don\u2019t know what the majority of our Southern colored families would do. The service pan is the mainstay in many a home\u2026others may denounce the service pan, and say that it is used to support idle negroes, but many a time, when I was a cook and had the responsibility of rearing my three children upon my lone shoulders, many a time I have had the occasion to bless the Lord for the service pan!\u201d.<ref>Sharpless, pp. 74-75.</ref> Consequently, due to African-American domestic workers and their families reliance on \u201cpan-toting\u201d, their diets were decided by and depended on the white employer. Most poignantly, Richard Wright remembered waiting for his mothers\u2019 employers to finish their meals so that he could learn what his own dinner would be: \u201cIf the white people left anything, my brother and I would eat well; but if they did not, we would have our usual bread and tea. Watching the white people eat would make my empty stomach churn and I would grow vaguely angry. Why could I not eat when I was hungry? Why did I always have to wait until others were through? I could not understand why some people had food and others did not\u201d.<ref>Sharpless, pp. 102-103.</ref> \u201cToting\u201d was a custom important to African-American families\u2019 but it could not always ensure a steady supply of food. However, some employers did recognize this. One employer stated, \u201cthere are hungry children in the cabin awaiting their mothers return, when I give out my meals I bear these little blackberry pickaninnies in mind, and I never wound the feelings of any cook by asking her \u2018what that is she has under her apron.\u2019\u201d She added, \u201cI know what it is \u2013 every biscuit, scrap of meat, or bit of cake she can save during the day, and if possible, a little sugar filched from the pantry\u201d.<ref name=Hunter-132>Hunter, p. 132.</ref>\n\n== Advantages ==\n==== Advantages for the Worker ====\nMany domestic workers used pan-toting to help alleviate the consequences of low pay.
