Haslingden Cricket Club is a member of the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Haslingden.jpg|thumb|left|Arms of the former Haslingden Borough Council]]\nPart of what is now Haslingden, along with the neighbouring towns of [[Rawtenstall]] and beyond that [[Bacup]] were part of the [[Forest of Rossendale]], part of the Forest of Blackburnshire. The Forest was a hunting park during the late 13th and 14th centuries; 'Forest' referred to it being parkland rather than being heavily wooded, as the forest declined much earlier, during the Neolithic period. The Forest of Rossendale contained eleven vaccaries (cow-pastures) and was poorly populated, with Haslingden being the only town of significance and with a church.<ref name=\"Rossendale 1994\">Rossendale, Benita Moore and Nick Dunnachie, Alan Sutton pub. 1994. {{ISBN|0-7509-0783-5}}</ref>\n\nHaslingden appears to have held markets during the sixteenth century, with the first reference in a Court Roll of 1555 where it records a John Radcliffe being fined for being a 'forestaller of the lords market of Haslyngden'.<ref name=\"Tupling\">{{cite book |last1=Tupling |first1=Dr. G.H. |title=The Economic History of Rossendale |date=1927 |publisher=The Chetham Society}}</ref> There are later references to markets and fairs in The Shuttleworth Accounts (1582-1621)<ref name=\"Tupling\" /> and the map-maker Richard Blome writing in 1673 describes Haslingden as originally having 'a small Market-town on Wednesdays', and later, at the time of Charles 1st, the market had been moved to Saturday.<ref>{{cite web |title=Townships: Haslingden |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/lancs/vol6/pp427-433#anchorn79 |website=British History Online |location=Manors. Final para. Footnotes 78, 79}}</ref> The market continued to grow and Haslingden was designated a Market Town in 1676. It became a coaching station <ref>{{cite web |title=Haslingden |url=https://www.visitlancashire.com/explore/haslingden-p96280 |website=Visit Lancashire |publisher=Marketing Lancashire 2020}}</ref> and a significant industrial borough during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Haslingden benefited in particular with the mechanisation of the [[wool]] and cotton [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] industries from the 18th to the 19th centuries, and the development of [[watermills]], and later steam power. By the final half of the nineteenth century, the diversity and wealth of industry earned the area the name 'The Golden Valley'.<ref name=\"Rossendale 1994\"/> \nIn the 20th century the population declined from 19,000 in the 1911 census to 15,000 in the 1971 census. The 2001 census recorded a population of 16,849 living in the town.\n\n== Industrial ==\n\n===Quarrying===\nHaslingden is notable for its stone quarrying,<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Haslingden |volume=13 |page=50}}</ref> and [[Flagstone|Haslingden Flag]] (a quartz-based [[sandstone]]) was distributed throughout the country in the 19th century with the opening up of the rail network. This stone was used in the paving of London, including [[Trafalgar Square]]. Flagstone is a type of sedimentary rock, relatively easy to split or quarry in slabs, and hence ideal for paving. Locally it is also used for making fences and roofing. Geologists have found that it has a hardness and silica content not unlike granite, and its presence was the main reason for the growth of quarrying in Rossendale. Haslingden Flag is unique; two other, common types of flagstone ('rough rocks') are found throughout the Pennines, but a third type is found only in the local Haslingden Flags.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rock strata, Haslingden Flag and fossils. |url=http://www.valleyofstone.org.uk/journey/inthebeginning/rockstrata |website=Valley of Stone |publisher=Groundwork Pennine Lancashire}}</ref>\n\n===Textiles===\nLike much of East Lancashire, Haslingden also has a long association with the textile industry. From the 16th century, after the old Forest of Rossendale was opened up to settlement, farmers raised sheep on the moorlands and made woollen cloth. Initially this was small-scale and local but towards the end of the 18th century cloth workers came together to work in small groups of houses. At the same time advances in technology meant that the first mills were appearing in the area. Most of these were small, water-powered buildings; and Haslingden, with its elevated situation, was not a natural place for the development of these early mills. Locally they were situated lower down in the river valleys, such as at nearby [[Helmshore]].<ref>The Changing Faces of Rossendale - Production Lines. Rossendale Groundwork Trust and Rossendale Borough Council. 1984. {{ISBN|0 947738 17 7}}</ref>\n\nThe long association with wool meant that Haslingden and the other Rossendale towns had expertise with the processes of cloth production, and so were able to switch easily to [[cotton]] weaving. Cotton was better suited than wool to industrialised spinning as its fibres were less likely to break than wool. Cotton cloth manufacture quickly became a highly successful industry, and its impact on the landscape and on the lives of its work force was enormous. Cotton weaving in the new factories was largely unregulated, and the workforce kept almost at starvation levels. Hunger drove men and women to fight back, and mobs attacked the power-looms that were seen to be the cause of the decline in status of the workforce. In 1826 almost 3,000 people were reported as 'attacking machinery' in Haslingden. A troop of cavalry was stationed in the vicinity, and ring-leaders were arrested. It was reported from Haslingden in the same year, 1826, that 'a great majority of the unemployed must literally perish from extreme want'. By the 1850 steam power began to supersede water power, and mills grew in size.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lancashire: The First Industrial Society, [[Chris Aspin]], Carnegie 1995 {{ISBN|1-85936-016-5}}</ref> Grudgingly a minimum wage was introduced, and through the efforts of reformers, the churches and a few enlightened mill-owners, conditions for factory workers slowly improved. Conditions were still harsh, despite the whole Rossendale area being known as the 'Golden Valley'. No longer dependent on the rivers as a source of energy, the mill owners were freed to build elsewhere, and Haslingden began to find that successful mills, such as Hargreaves Street Mill, could be built on its higher land.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe long decline of the cotton industry began in the early years of the 20th century. During the First World War, India and Japan were able to develop their own industries, and after the Second World War, immigration - mainly from [[Pakistan]] - was encouraged to help bolster a failing industry. But by the 1950s, mills were closing at an ever-faster rate. The old buildings often re-occupied by small businesses specialising in other occupations.\n\n===The Cockerill family===\n[[William Cockerill]] (1759-1832) and his son [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]] (1790-1840), along with other family members, both sons and daughters, are worth a footnote to the industrial history of Haslingden. Both were born in Haslingden, but they eventually left the town and settled in [[Belgium]], where they built up one of the largest industrial and machinery complexes in mainland [[Europe]]. It is said that they instituted the spread of the Industrial Revolution in continental Europe. \n\nWilliams beginning are obscure, although it is likely that that he worked as a blacksmith in Haslingden before travelling to [[St. Petersburg]], [[Sweden]], and finally to [[Verviers]], near [[Liege]] in Belgium. Here he set up spinning and carding machines with his sons Willam, Charles James, and John. <ref>{{cite web |title=William Cockerill, British inventor |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Cockerill |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> John had also been born in Haslingden but moved to Vervier at the age of 12. he eventually was offered a Chateau in [[Seraing]] which became the heart of Belgium's iron, steel and machine-building industries. <ref>{{cite web |title=Seraing |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Seraing#ref51773 |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He is considered to be the founder of Belgian manufacturing and was known as a humanitarian employer.\n\n===Immigration and community===\n\nIn the 19th century when the cotton industry was thriving, the town became a magnet for immigrants to Britain. In particular the port of Liverpool was a gateway for waves of immigrants, and many of these were attracted by work in the mills. From the late 1840s a large influx of Irish immigrants forced out of [[Ireland]] by the Great Famine of 1846-1852, came to Lancashire and some ended up in Haslingden.<ref>W. J. Lowe, The Irish in Mid-Victorian Lancashire: The Shaping of a Working-Class Community (Peter Lang, 1989).</ref> At almost the same time, as a result of the political instability in Italy, Italians came to Liverpool and Manchester and a few families moved on to Haslingden. Similarly, in the 1930s various eastern European refugees fleeing Nazi persecution settled in the area. Immediately after World War II young women from Germany were brought over to work in the mills, and a few came to Haslingden and stayed.<ref>German Migrants in Post-War Britain: An Enemy Embrace. Dr Inge Weber-Newth, Johannes-Dieter Steinert. Routledge 2006</ref>\n\nFrom 1950 onwards migrants were encouraged to travel from Commonwealth countries to work in the post-war textile industry. Initially this tended to mean young men who travelled from Pakistan, and later [[Bangladesh]], fully expecting to return home after building up their savings. But by the 1970s, many were joined by wives and families and settled permanently in Haslingden. As a result, the town is now home to a substantial and vibrant community of people with a South Asian heritage, mainly Bangladeshi and Pakistani. Many of the families come from just a few villages: from the [[Attock]] and [[Mirpur, Pakistan|Mirpur]] areas of north-west Pakistan, and from Patli Union in the [[Sylhet]] region of Bangladesh.<ref>Horse + Bamboo: Transcriptions from Interviews with first generation immigrants. Heritage Lottery Fund 2015, available at local libraries.</ref>\n\nThe town now houses two mosques and a considerable number of Asian grocers and other shops. There is also Apna (Rossendale) that provides classes, workshops and a meeting place mainly for South Asian women. It is based at the [[Dave Pearson (painter)|Dave Pearson Studio]], and has a focus on Islamic arts, well-being, health and general education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/rossendale|title=Rossendale Census Demographics United Kingdom|website=localstats.co.uk|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://differentmoons.org/home-2/sa-community/|title=SA Communities \u2013 Different Moons|website=differentmoons.org|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nA civil parish was created in 1866 from the [[Township (England)|township]] of Haslingden in the ancient parish of Whalley.<ref name=VoB>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10354353|title=Haslingden CP/CP through time|publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth|work=visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> A [[Local board of health|local board]] was formed for the town in 1875 and the district it governed was extended to cover parts of the townships of Henheads, Higher and Lower Booths in the parish of Whalley, and [[Musbury Valley|Musbury]] and part of Tottington in the ancient parish of Bury.<ref name=Townships>{{citation|chapter=The Parish of Whalley: Haslingden| title=A History of the County of Lancaster| volume=6 |year=1911| pages=427\u2013433| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53147}}</ref> Subsequently, Haslingden was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1891 and in 1894 the civil parish was extended to match the borders of the borough.<ref name=VoB/><ref name=Townships/> Following the [[Local Government Act 1972|local government reorganisation]] in 1974 Haslingden became part of the [[Borough of Rossendale]].\n\nIn 2005 the Audit Commission rated Rossendale District Council performance as 'Poor', and was listed as the worst performing  district council in the country in their Comprehensive Performance Assessment.<ref>http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Society/documents/2005/09/06/DCPAScoresandAnalysis.pdf</ref> By 2009 the council was described as 'performing well' by the Audit Commission, rating Rossendale Council as three out of four stars.<ref>https://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/news/local-news/three-star-rating-for-council-1707611</ref>\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n===St. James Church and the 'Top of the Town'===\nHaslingden's [[Anglican]] parish church, [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]', was rebuilt in 1780<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=EB1911/> on a site occupied by a church building since at least 1284. Murray's says \"it stands well and is plain Georgian, dully Gothicised inside\".<ref name=\"Murrays\">Murray's Lancashire Guide. P. Fleetwood-Hesketh. John Murray 1955</ref> In 1296 a deed of gift of the [[Earl of Lincoln]] to the monks of Stanlaw granted them the parish of Whalley. Haslingden was recorded as being one of Whalley's seven independent chapelries, and was served by two priests.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. James the great, Haslingden |url=https://rossendale-fhhs.org.uk/files/haslingden_churches/church_103.html |website=Rossendale Family History Society}}</ref> The church is considered to be the highest parish church above sea level in England,<ref>https://stjameshaslingden.com/about-us/</ref> and locally has been known as the 'top church' by reason of its dominating position. \n[[File:St. James the Great, Haslingden Parish Church.jpg|thumb|right|St. James, Haslingden]]\n\nSt. James now sits well to the north of the town centre, but until the 1930s it was adjacent to the 'Top of the Town' - the area between Town Gate and Church Street, and the old centre of Haslingden. This was an area containing several public house drinking places, the original market, the town stocks, and Marsden Square, where travelling shows pitched their tents. Clearance began in 1932 and the area is now largely housing.<ref name= \"Aspin\">{{cite book |last1=Aspin and Pilkington |title=Haslingden |date=1979 |publisher=Helmshore Local History Society |isbn=0 906881 00 5 |pages=3\u20137}}</ref>\n\nBy the west side of the church entrance is a large [[Plague cross|Plague Stone]], with two carved holes. There is some uncertainty about its exact purpose, but most opinion is that such stones were used in times of plague to enable food (or other alms) to be offered to plague victims while avoiding direct contact.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mee |first1=Arthur |title=Lancashire |date=1936 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |page=106/7 |edition=4th}}</ref> A Saxon Cross is mentioned in the Clitheroe court rolls of 1547, and the stone may have been at the base of the cross, so the stone probably dates from the 16th century or earlier.<ref>{{cite web |title=Haslingden Parish Church - St. James the Great |url=https://rossendale-fhhs.org.uk/files/haslingden_churches/church_103.html |publisher=Rossendale Family History Society}}</ref>\n\n===Other Churches===\nBeside the Memorial Gardens, the Manchester Road [[Methodist]] Church is a classic building with an Italian-inspired interior. Murray's Guide also mentions St. Thomas, [[Helmshore]] (1851); St Stephen, [[Haslingden Grane|Grane]] (1867); St. John the Baptist, Stonefold (1885); St. Peter, Laneside (1893) and the [[Roman Catholic]] Church of the Immaculate Conception (1859) and 'various other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] churches', largely built in the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Murrays\"/>{{rp|146}}\n\nSt. Stephen's, Grane, has a particularly interesting history. The construction of the Ogden Reservoir (which opened in 1912) led to almost total depopulation of the community of Grane. St. Stephen's remained in use, with most of the villagers having moved to Haslingden town. In 1925 they decided to move the church stone by stone to a new site, two miles away at Three Lanes End, near Holden Cemetery.<ref name= \"Aspin\"/> The church is now an antiques centre and cafe.\n\n===The Public Hall===\nThe Public Hall was opened in 1868 and built by a private company formed by 'gentlemen representing the working classes and [[temperance movement]]'. It was bought by the town council in 1898 but by the 1990s it was largely unused except for occasional entertainments. The hall had been used for 50 or more years by Rossendale Amateur Operatic Society and other local community groups, but it was finally closed by Rossendale Council in 2005. The hall has since been sold by the council to a group representing the Asian heritage community and is in the process of being turned into a [[mosque]].<ref>https://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/news/local-news/new-lease-life-public-hall-1709648</ref>\n\nThe hall was once a venue of [[Winston Churchill]] during his early political career. [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] once addressed the people of Haslingden from the stage and, after the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916, it was a temporary hospital for the survivors of the [[Accrington Pals]] who were sent home for treatment.\n\n===Schools===\nThe Wesleyan School, formerly on the site of the current [[health centre]], was the site of the first test in the world to introduce standardised [[intelligence test]]s. It was initiated by the industrialist and Liberal politician [[Sir William Mather]] in 1901. Mather introduced apprentice schemes at his factories that used testing as part of the selection method. He also introduced a 48 hour working week for employees. <ref>https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2317722</ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Boschi and Taylor |title=The History of Mather & Platt Ltd |url=https://sites.google.com/site/thebookofthejubilee1958/a-history-of-mather-and-platt-limited |website=The Book of the Jubilee 1958 |publisher=Google}}</ref>\n\n[[Haslingden High School]] is a [[Specialist school|specialist arts, maths and computing college]].

A blue plaque commemorates [[Michael Davitt]]. The young Davitt migrated to Haslingden with his family in 1840 as a result of the family being evicted from their tenant farm by a British Landlord.  He began working in a cotton mill but at the age of 11 his right arm was entangled in a cogwheel and mangled so badly it had to be amputated. When he recovered from his operation a local benefactor, John Dean, helped to give him an education. He also started night classes at the Mechanics' Institute and used its library.<ref>http://www.davitts.org/history-of-michael-davitt/</ref> Michael Davitt's family home from 1867\u20131870 on Wilkinson Street is now marked by a memorial plaque.<ref>Michael Davitt's Lancashire Apprenticeship. John Dunleavy. Pub. Galway Archaeological & Historical Society. 2007</ref> Amongst the library's collection is an early photograph (c. 1892) of [[Thomas Frederick Worrall]] labelled ''Tom Worrall, artist'', whose watercolours included a depiction of the Old White Horse Inn (long demolished).\n\n===Railway===\nHaslingden was once connected to [[Accrington]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] by railway (Rush, 1983). The [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]] built a station here, which remained open to passengers under [[British Railways]] until 7 November 1960 and to goods until 2 November 1964. The withdrawal of the passenger service was therefore not a victim of [[Dr. Beeching]]. The Bury \u2013 Accrington line itself remained in use until December 1966. Much of the trackbed of the railway is no longer visible, with the A56 by-pass built over it between Grane Road and Blackburn Road, however, the line can still be traced through [[Helmshore]] towards [[Stubbins]] where several magnificent viaducts still remain. The East Lancashire Railway Preservation Society was originally established at Helmshore Station in the mid 1960s with the aim of reopening the railway line to Stubbins, the project was abandoned with the organisation relocating to Bury in the 1970s and eventually reopening the Rawtenstall to Bury line.<ref>The Lost Railways of Lancashire.G. Suggitt {{ISBN|1-85306-801-2}}</ref>\n\n===Other notable places===\nThe town centre is home to the famous Big Lamp originally erected in 1841 and from where all distances in Haslingden are measured, although the original lamp has been replaced by a replica, the original being lost after being taken to America. Cissy Green's Bakery can be found on Deardengate. People visit from across [[Lancashire]] to sample the handmade pies which are still made to the original 1920s recipe. To the north of the town is the [[Holland's Pies]] factory, and Winfield's, a large warehouse-style retail development selling footwear and clothing, and promoting itself as a family day out. Haslingden's War Memorial is unusual in that it has no names recorded on it. To the northeast there is a 2&nbsp;kW digital television transmitter serving a wide area.\n\n[[Chris Aspin]] writes of the haunting of Tor View, a house no longer standing that was situated behind the Rose & Crown pub on Manchester Road. Young Emma Walton died in the 1840s after a tragic love affair. This story was reported in 1956 by Joseph Braddock, who claimed to have had first-hand experiences of the ghost, in his book ''Haunted Houses''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aspin |first1=Chris |title=True Stories of our Local Ghosts |date=2016 |publisher=HLHS}}</ref>\n\n===Beauty spots===\n[[File:calfhey reservoir.jpg|thumb|240px|Calf Hey Reservoir in Grane Valley]]\n[[File:Halo in Haslingden, Rossendale, England.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Haslingden Halo]]\n\nThere is an extensive area of [[moorland]] to the west of Haslingden. These moors are divided into [[Oswaldtwistle#Oswaldtwistle Moor|Oswaldtwistle Moor]] and Haslingden Moor. The area forms part of the [[West Pennine Moors]]. Plans were made in 2007 to build a [[wind farm]] consisting of twelve [[wind turbines]] on the moors. This attracted both support and opposition, but the plan was approved by councillors in 2010.<ref>[http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/5038328.Oswaldtwistle_Moor_wind_farm_approved_by_councillors/: Plans for wind farm on Oswaldtwistle Moor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318115238/http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/5038328.Oswaldtwistle_Moor_wind_farm_approved_by_councillors/%3A/ |date=18 March 2012 }} The Citizen</ref> Further developments have yet to take place, and the plan remains controversial.\n\nThe nearby [[Snighole]] (''eel-hole'') in [[Helmshore]] is a well-known beauty spot. The [[Haslingden Grane|Grane Valley]] including three reservoirs to the west of the town is popular with walkers.\n\nVictoria Park has a [[bowling green]], children's [[playground]], [[skateboard park]] and ball court. The top of the park affords views of Musbury Hill.\n\n===The Halo===\nThe Panopticons competition was launched in May 2003 by [[RIBA Competitions]] organised by Mid-Pennine Arts. The Halo artwork designed by John Kennedy was selected and opened in 2007 and is sited in the hills above Haslingden as the centrepiece of a reclaimed landscape. It glows at night with an impressive viewpoint.<ref>http://midpenninearts.org.uk/projects/halo/</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n\n* [[Armour Ashe]], professional footballer who played for Accrington Stanley and Southport\n* [[Chris Aspin]], journalist, historian and author.

Haslingden Cricket Club is a member of the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Haslingden.jpg|thumb|left|Arms of the former Haslingden Borough Council]]\nPart of what is now Haslingden, along with the neighbouring towns of [[Rawtenstall]] and beyond that [[Bacup]] were part of the [[Forest of Rossendale]], part of the Forest of Blackburnshire. The Forest was a hunting park during the late 13th and 14th centuries; 'Forest' referred to it being parkland rather than being heavily wooded, as the forest declined much earlier, during the Neolithic period. The Forest of Rossendale contained eleven vaccaries (cow-pastures) and was poorly populated, with Haslingden being the only town of significance and with a church.<ref name=\"Rossendale 1994\">Rossendale, Benita Moore and Nick Dunnachie, Alan Sutton pub. 1994. {{ISBN|0-7509-0783-5}}</ref>\n\nHaslingden appears to have held markets during the sixteenth century, with the first reference in a Court Roll of 1555 where it records a John Radcliffe being fined for being a 'forestaller of the lords market of Haslyngden'.<ref name=\"Tupling\">{{cite book |last1=Tupling |first1=Dr. G.H. |title=The Economic History of Rossendale |date=1927 |publisher=The Chetham Society}}</ref> There are later references to markets and fairs in The Shuttleworth Accounts (1582-1621)<ref name=\"Tupling\" /> and the map-maker Richard Blome writing in 1673 describes Haslingden as originally having 'a small Market-town on Wednesdays', and later, at the time of Charles 1st, the market had been moved to Saturday.<ref>{{cite web |title=Townships: Haslingden |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/lancs/vol6/pp427-433#anchorn79 |website=British History Online |location=Manors. Final para. Footnotes 78, 79}}</ref> The market continued to grow and Haslingden was designated a Market Town in 1676. It became a coaching station <ref>{{cite web |title=Haslingden |url=https://www.visitlancashire.com/explore/haslingden-p96280 |website=Visit Lancashire |publisher=Marketing Lancashire 2020}}</ref> and a significant industrial borough during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Haslingden benefited in particular with the mechanisation of the [[wool]] and cotton [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] industries from the 18th to the 19th centuries, and the development of [[watermills]], and later steam power. By the final half of the nineteenth century, the diversity and wealth of industry earned the area the name 'The Golden Valley'.<ref name=\"Rossendale 1994\"/> \nIn the 20th century the population declined from 19,000 in the 1911 census to 15,000 in the 1971 census. The 2001 census recorded a population of 16,849 living in the town.\n\n== Industrial ==\n\n===Quarrying===\nHaslingden is notable for its stone quarrying,<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Haslingden |volume=13 |page=50}}</ref> and [[Flagstone|Haslingden Flag]] (a quartz-based [[sandstone]]) was distributed throughout the country in the 19th century with the opening up of the rail network. This stone was used in the paving of London, including [[Trafalgar Square]]. Flagstone is a type of sedimentary rock, relatively easy to split or quarry in slabs, and hence ideal for paving. Locally it is also used for making fences and roofing. Geologists have found that it has a hardness and silica content not unlike granite, and its presence was the main reason for the growth of quarrying in Rossendale. Haslingden Flag is unique; two other, common types of flagstone ('rough rocks') are found throughout the Pennines, but a third type is found only in the local Haslingden Flags.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rock strata, Haslingden Flag and fossils. |url=http://www.valleyofstone.org.uk/journey/inthebeginning/rockstrata |website=Valley of Stone |publisher=Groundwork Pennine Lancashire}}</ref>\n\n===Textiles===\nLike much of East Lancashire, Haslingden also has a long association with the textile industry. From the 16th century, after the old Forest of Rossendale was opened up to settlement, farmers raised sheep on the moorlands and made woollen cloth. Initially this was small-scale and local but towards the end of the 18th century cloth workers came together to work in small groups of houses. At the same time advances in technology meant that the first mills were appearing in the area. Most of these were small, water-powered buildings; and Haslingden, with its elevated situation, was not a natural place for the development of these early mills. Locally they were situated lower down in the river valleys, such as at nearby [[Helmshore]].<ref>The Changing Faces of Rossendale - Production Lines. Rossendale Groundwork Trust and Rossendale Borough Council. 1984. {{ISBN|0 947738 17 7}}</ref>\n\nThe long association with wool meant that Haslingden and the other Rossendale towns had expertise with the processes of cloth production, and so were able to switch easily to [[cotton]] weaving. Cotton was better suited than wool to industrialised spinning as its fibres were less likely to break than wool. Cotton cloth manufacture quickly became a highly successful industry, and its impact on the landscape and on the lives of its work force was enormous. Cotton weaving in the new factories was largely unregulated, and the workforce kept almost at starvation levels. Hunger drove men and women to fight back, and mobs attacked the power-looms that were seen to be the cause of the decline in status of the workforce. In 1826 almost 3,000 people were reported as 'attacking machinery' in Haslingden. A troop of cavalry was stationed in the vicinity, and ring-leaders were arrested. It was reported from Haslingden in the same year, 1826, that 'a great majority of the unemployed must literally perish from extreme want'. By the 1850 steam power began to supersede water power, and mills grew in size.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lancashire: The First Industrial Society, [[Chris Aspin]], Carnegie 1995 {{ISBN|1-85936-016-5}}</ref> Grudgingly a minimum wage was introduced, and through the efforts of reformers, the churches and a few enlightened mill-owners, conditions for factory workers slowly improved. Conditions were still harsh, despite the whole Rossendale area being known as the 'Golden Valley'. No longer dependent on the rivers as a source of energy, the mill owners were freed to build elsewhere, and Haslingden began to find that successful mills, such as Hargreaves Street Mill, could be built on its higher land.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe long decline of the cotton industry began in the early years of the 20th century. During the First World War, India and Japan were able to develop their own industries, and after the Second World War, immigration - mainly from [[Pakistan]] - was encouraged to help bolster a failing industry. But by the 1950s, mills were closing at an ever-faster rate. The old buildings often re-occupied by small businesses specialising in other occupations.\n\n===The Cockerill family===\n[[William Cockerill]] (1759-1832) and his son [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]] (1790-1840), along with other family members, both sons and daughters, are worth a footnote to the industrial history of Haslingden. Although both born in Haslingden, they left the town and eventually settled in [[Belgium]], where they built up one of the largest industrial and machinery complexes in mainland [[Europe]]. It is said that they instituted the spread of the Industrial Revolution in continental Europe. \n\nWilliams beginning are obscure, although it is likely that that he worked as a blacksmith in Haslingden before travelling to [[St. Petersburg]], [[Sweden]], and finally to [[Verviers]], near [[Liege]] in Belgium. Here he set up spinning and carding machines with his sons Willam, Charles James, and John. <ref>{{cite web |title=William Cockerill, British inventor |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Cockerill |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> John had also been born in Haslingden but moved to Vervier at the age of 12. he eventually was offered a Chateau in [[Seraing]] which became the heart of Belgium's iron, steel and machine-building industries. <ref>{{cite web |title=Seraing |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Seraing#ref51773 |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He is considered to be the founder of Belgian manufacturing and was known as a humanitarian employer.\n\n===Immigration and community===\n\nIn the 19th century when the cotton industry was thriving, the town became a magnet for immigrants to Britain. In particular the port of Liverpool was a gateway for waves of immigrants, and many of these were attracted by work in the mills. From the late 1840s a large influx of Irish immigrants forced out of [[Ireland]] by the Great Famine of 1846-1852, came to Lancashire and some ended up in Haslingden.<ref>W. J. Lowe, The Irish in Mid-Victorian Lancashire: The Shaping of a Working-Class Community (Peter Lang, 1989).</ref> At almost the same time, as a result of the political instability in Italy, Italians came to Liverpool and Manchester and a few families moved on to Haslingden. Similarly, in the 1930s various eastern European refugees fleeing Nazi persecution settled in the area. Immediately after World War II young women from Germany were brought over to work in the mills, and a few came to Haslingden and stayed.<ref>German Migrants in Post-War Britain: An Enemy Embrace. Dr Inge Weber-Newth, Johannes-Dieter Steinert. Routledge 2006</ref>\n\nFrom 1950 onwards migrants were encouraged to travel from Commonwealth countries to work in the post-war textile industry. Initially this tended to mean young men who travelled from Pakistan, and later [[Bangladesh]], fully expecting to return home after building up their savings. But by the 1970s, many were joined by wives and families and settled permanently in Haslingden. As a result, the town is now home to a substantial and vibrant community of people with a South Asian heritage, mainly Bangladeshi and Pakistani. Many of the families come from just a few villages: from the [[Attock]] and [[Mirpur, Pakistan|Mirpur]] areas of north-west Pakistan, and from Patli Union in the [[Sylhet]] region of Bangladesh.<ref>Horse + Bamboo: Transcriptions from Interviews with first generation immigrants. Heritage Lottery Fund 2015, available at local libraries.</ref>\n\nThe town now houses two mosques and a considerable number of Asian grocers and other shops. There is also Apna (Rossendale) that provides classes, workshops and a meeting place mainly for South Asian women. It is based at the [[Dave Pearson (painter)|Dave Pearson Studio]], and has a focus on Islamic arts, well-being, health and general education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/rossendale|title=Rossendale Census Demographics United Kingdom|website=localstats.co.uk|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://differentmoons.org/home-2/sa-community/|title=SA Communities \u2013 Different Moons|website=differentmoons.org|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nA civil parish was created in 1866 from the [[Township (England)|township]] of Haslingden in the ancient parish of Whalley.<ref name=VoB>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10354353|title=Haslingden CP/CP through time|publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth|work=visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> A [[Local board of health|local board]] was formed for the town in 1875 and the district it governed was extended to cover parts of the townships of Henheads, Higher and Lower Booths in the parish of Whalley, and [[Musbury Valley|Musbury]] and part of Tottington in the ancient parish of Bury.<ref name=Townships>{{citation|chapter=The Parish of Whalley: Haslingden| title=A History of the County of Lancaster| volume=6 |year=1911| pages=427\u2013433| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53147}}</ref> Subsequently, Haslingden was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1891 and in 1894 the civil parish was extended to match the borders of the borough.<ref name=VoB/><ref name=Townships/> Following the [[Local Government Act 1972|local government reorganisation]] in 1974 Haslingden became part of the [[Borough of Rossendale]].\n\nIn 2005 the Audit Commission rated Rossendale District Council performance as 'Poor', and was listed as the worst performing  district council in the country in their Comprehensive Performance Assessment.<ref>http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Society/documents/2005/09/06/DCPAScoresandAnalysis.pdf</ref> By 2009 the council was described as 'performing well' by the Audit Commission, rating Rossendale Council as three out of four stars.<ref>https://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/news/local-news/three-star-rating-for-council-1707611</ref>\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n===St. James Church and the 'Top of the Town'===\nHaslingden's [[Anglican]] parish church, [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]', was rebuilt in 1780<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=EB1911/> on a site occupied by a church building since at least 1284. Murray's says \"it stands well and is plain Georgian, dully Gothicised inside\".<ref name=\"Murrays\">Murray's Lancashire Guide. P. Fleetwood-Hesketh. John Murray 1955</ref> In 1296 a deed of gift of the [[Earl of Lincoln]] to the monks of Stanlaw granted them the parish of Whalley. Haslingden was recorded as being one of Whalley's seven independent chapelries, and was served by two priests.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. James the great, Haslingden |url=https://rossendale-fhhs.org.uk/files/haslingden_churches/church_103.html |website=Rossendale Family History Society}}</ref> The church is considered to be the highest parish church above sea level in England,<ref>https://stjameshaslingden.com/about-us/</ref> and locally has been known as the 'top church' by reason of its dominating position. \n[[File:St. James the Great, Haslingden Parish Church.jpg|thumb|right|St. James, Haslingden]]\n\nSt. James now sits well to the north of the town centre, but until the 1930s it was adjacent to the 'Top of the Town' - the area between Town Gate and Church Street, and the old centre of Haslingden. This was an area containing several public house drinking places, the original market, the town stocks, and Marsden Square, where travelling shows pitched their tents. Clearance began in 1932 and the area is now largely housing.<ref name= \"Aspin\">{{cite book |last1=Aspin and Pilkington |title=Haslingden |date=1979 |publisher=Helmshore Local History Society |isbn=0 906881 00 5 |pages=3\u20137}}</ref>\n\nBy the west side of the church entrance is a large [[Plague cross|Plague Stone]], with two carved holes. There is some uncertainty about its exact purpose, but most opinion is that such stones were used in times of plague to enable food (or other alms) to be offered to plague victims while avoiding direct contact.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mee |first1=Arthur |title=Lancashire |date=1936 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |page=106/7 |edition=4th}}</ref> A Saxon Cross is mentioned in the Clitheroe court rolls of 1547, and the stone may have been at the base of the cross, so the stone probably dates from the 16th century or earlier.<ref>{{cite web |title=Haslingden Parish Church - St. James the Great |url=https://rossendale-fhhs.org.uk/files/haslingden_churches/church_103.html |publisher=Rossendale Family History Society}}</ref>\n\n===Other Churches===\nBeside the Memorial Gardens, the Manchester Road [[Methodist]] Church is a classic building with an Italian-inspired interior. Murray's Guide also mentions St. Thomas, [[Helmshore]] (1851); St Stephen, [[Haslingden Grane|Grane]] (1867); St. John the Baptist, Stonefold (1885); St. Peter, Laneside (1893) and the [[Roman Catholic]] Church of the Immaculate Conception (1859) and 'various other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] churches', largely built in the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Murrays\"/>{{rp|146}}\n\nSt. Stephen's, Grane, has a particularly interesting history. The construction of the Ogden Reservoir (which opened in 1912) led to almost total depopulation of the community of Grane. St. Stephen's remained in use, with most of the villagers having moved to Haslingden town. In 1925 they decided to move the church stone by stone to a new site, two miles away at Three Lanes End, near Holden Cemetery.<ref name= \"Aspin\"/> The church is now an antiques centre and cafe.\n\n===The Public Hall===\nThe Public Hall was opened in 1868 and built by a private company formed by 'gentlemen representing the working classes and [[temperance movement]]'. It was bought by the town council in 1898 but by the 1990s it was largely unused except for occasional entertainments. The hall had been used for 50 or more years by Rossendale Amateur Operatic Society and other local community groups, but it was finally closed by Rossendale Council in 2005. The hall has since been sold by the council to a group representing the Asian heritage community and is in the process of being turned into a [[mosque]].<ref>https://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/news/local-news/new-lease-life-public-hall-1709648</ref>\n\nThe hall was once a venue of [[Winston Churchill]] during his early political career. [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] once addressed the people of Haslingden from the stage and, after the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916, it was a temporary hospital for the survivors of the [[Accrington Pals]] who were sent home for treatment.\n\n===Schools===\nThe Wesleyan School, formerly on the site of the current [[health centre]], was the site of the first test in the world to introduce standardised [[intelligence test]]s. It was initiated by the industrialist and Liberal politician [[Sir William Mather]] in 1901. Mather introduced apprentice schemes at his factories that used testing as part of the selection method. He also introduced a 48 hour working week for employees. <ref>https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2317722</ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Boschi and Taylor |title=The History of Mather & Platt Ltd |url=https://sites.google.com/site/thebookofthejubilee1958/a-history-of-mather-and-platt-limited |website=The Book of the Jubilee 1958 |publisher=Google}}</ref>\n\n[[Haslingden High School]] is a [[Specialist school|specialist arts, maths and computing college]]. Haslingden Primary School was last inspected by [[Ofsted]] on 11 March 2014 and received a grading of 'Good'.\n<ref>http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2344149/urn/119194.pdf</ref>\n\n===Library===\nOriginally Haslingden [[Mechanics' Institute]] and opened in 1860, it became the public library in 1905. A blue plaque commemorates [[Michael Davitt]]. The young Davitt migrated to Haslingden with his family in 1840 as a result of the family being evicted from their tenant farm by a British Landlord.  He began working in a cotton mill but at the age of 11 his right arm was entangled in a cogwheel and mangled so badly it had to be amputated. When he recovered from his operation a local benefactor, John Dean, helped to give him an education. He also started night classes at the Mechanics' Institute and used its library.<ref>http://www.davitts.org/history-of-michael-davitt/</ref> Michael Davitt's family home from 1867\u20131870 on Wilkinson Street is now marked by a memorial plaque.<ref>Michael Davitt's Lancashire Apprenticeship. John Dunleavy. Pub. Galway Archaeological & Historical Society. 2007</ref> Amongst the library's collection is an early photograph (c. 1892) of [[Thomas Frederick Worrall]] labelled ''Tom Worrall, artist'', whose watercolours included a depiction of the Old White Horse Inn (long demolished).\n\n===Railway===\nHaslingden was once connected to [[Accrington]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] by railway (Rush, 1983). The [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]] built a station here, which remained open to passengers under [[British Railways]] until 7 November 1960 and to goods until 2 November 1964. The withdrawal of the passenger service was therefore not a victim of [[Dr. Beeching]]. The Bury \u2013 Accrington line itself remained in use until December 1966. Much of the trackbed of the railway is no longer visible, with the A56 by-pass built over it between Grane Road and Blackburn Road, however, the line can still be traced through [[Helmshore]] towards [[Stubbins]] where several magnificent viaducts still remain. The East Lancashire Railway Preservation Society was originally established at Helmshore Station in the mid 1960s with the aim of reopening the railway line to Stubbins, the project was abandoned with the organisation relocating to Bury in the 1970s and eventually reopening the Rawtenstall to Bury line.<ref>The Lost Railways of Lancashire.G. Suggitt {{ISBN|1-85306-801-2}}</ref>\n\n===Other notable places===\nThe town centre is home to the famous Big Lamp originally erected in 1841 and from where all distances in Haslingden are measured, although the original lamp has been replaced by a replica, the original being lost after being taken to America. Cissy Green's Bakery can be found on Deardengate. People visit from across [[Lancashire]] to sample the handmade pies which are still made to the original 1920s recipe. To the north of the town is the [[Holland's Pies]] factory, and Winfield's, a large warehouse-style retail development selling footwear and clothing, and promoting itself as a family day out. Haslingden's War Memorial is unusual in that it has no names recorded on it. To the northeast there is a 2&nbsp;kW digital television transmitter serving a wide area.\n\n[[Chris Aspin]] writes of the haunting of Tor View, a house no longer standing that was situated behind the Rose & Crown pub on Manchester Road. Young Emma Walton died in the 1840s after a tragic love affair. This story was reported in 1956 by Joseph Braddock, who claimed to have had first-hand experiences of the ghost, in his book ''Haunted Houses''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aspin |first1=Chris |title=True Stories of our Local Ghosts |date=2016 |publisher=HLHS}}</ref>\n\n===Beauty spots===\n[[File:calfhey reservoir.jpg|thumb|240px|Calf Hey Reservoir in Grane Valley]]\n[[File:Halo in Haslingden, Rossendale, England.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Haslingden Halo]]\n\nThere is an extensive area of [[moorland]] to the west of Haslingden. These moors are divided into [[Oswaldtwistle#Oswaldtwistle Moor|Oswaldtwistle Moor]] and Haslingden Moor. The area forms part of the [[West Pennine Moors]]. Plans were made in 2007 to build a [[wind farm]] consisting of twelve [[wind turbines]] on the moors. This attracted both support and opposition, but the plan was approved by councillors in 2010.<ref>[http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/5038328.Oswaldtwistle_Moor_wind_farm_approved_by_councillors/: Plans for wind farm on Oswaldtwistle Moor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318115238/http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/5038328.Oswaldtwistle_Moor_wind_farm_approved_by_councillors/%3A/ |date=18 March 2012 }} The Citizen</ref> Further developments have yet to take place, and the plan remains controversial.\n\nThe nearby [[Snighole]] (''eel-hole'') in [[Helmshore]] is a well-known beauty spot. The [[Haslingden Grane|Grane Valley]] including three reservoirs to the west of the town is popular with walkers.\n\nVictoria Park has a [[bowling green]], children's [[playground]], [[skateboard park]] and ball court. The top of the park affords views of Musbury Hill.\n\n===The Halo===\nThe Panopticons competition was launched in May 2003 by [[RIBA Competitions]] organised by Mid-Pennine Arts. The Halo artwork designed by John Kennedy was selected and opened in 2007 and is sited in the hills above Haslingden as the centrepiece of a reclaimed landscape. It glows at night with an impressive viewpoint.<ref>http://midpenninearts.org.uk/projects/halo/</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n\n* [[Armour Ashe]], professional footballer who played for Accrington Stanley and Southport\n* [[Chris Aspin]], journalist, historian and author.

They fall under the general term of ''color'', which is the hypernym.\n[[File:Colortaxonomy.png|thumb|Taxonomy showing the hypernym \"color\"]]\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''Color (hypernym) \u2192 red, green, yellow, blue (hyponyms)''\n|}\n\nHyponyms and hypernyms can be described by using a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], as seen in the example.\n\n=== Synonymy ===\n[[Synonymy]] refers to words that are pronounced and spelled differently but contain the same meaning.\n{|\n|-\n|  \n ''Happy, joyful, glad <ref name=\"Glossary\" />''''\n|}\n\n=== Antonymy ===\n[[Antonymy]] refers to words that are related by having the opposite meanings to each other.\nThere are three types of antonyms: [[Opposite (semantics)#Gradable antonyms|graded antonyms]], [[Opposite (semantics)#Complementary antonyms|complementary antonyms]], and [[Converse (semantics)|relational antonyms]].\n{|\n|-\n|  \n ''dead, alive <ref name=\"Glossary\" />\n ''long, short ''\n|}\n\n=== Homonymy ===\n[[Homonymy]] refers to the relationship between words that are spelled or  pronounced the same way but hold different meanings.\n{|\n|-\n|  \n ''bank (of river)\n ''bank (financial institution)''\n|}\n[[File:Semantic Net.svg|thumb|An example of a semantic network]]\n\n=== Semantic networks ===\nLexical semantics also explores whether the meaning of a lexical unit is established by looking at its neighbourhood in the [[Semantic network|semantic net]], (words it occurs with in natural sentences), or whether the meaning is already locally contained in the lexical unit.\n\nIn English, [[WordNet]] is an example of a semantic network. It contains English words that are grouped into [[Synonym Ring|synsets]]. Some semantic relations between these synsets are [[meronymy]], [[hyponymy]], [[synonymy]], and [[antonymy]].\n\n== Semantic fields ==\n\n=== How lexical items map onto concepts ===\nFirst proposed by Trier in the 1930s,<ref name=famer1999>Famer, Pamela B.; Mairal Us\u00f3n, Ricardo (1999). \"Constructing a Lexicon of English Verbs\". Functional Grammar (in English) 23 (illustrated ed.). Walter de Gruyter. p. 350. {{ISBN|9783110164169}}.</ref> [[semantic field]] theory proposes that a group of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words ''boil'', ''bake'', ''fry'', and ''roast'', for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of ''cooking''. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words.<ref>{{cite book|first=Adrienne|last=Lehrer|title=Historical Semantics, Historical Word Formation|chapter=The influence of semantic fields on semantic change|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|pages=283\u2013296 |chapter-url=http://alehrer.faculty.arizona.edu/sites/alehrer.faculty.arizona.edu/files/Semantic%20fields%20and%20change.pdf}}</ref> Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between [[lexeme]]s, including synonymy ''(big'' and ''large),'' antonymy ''(big'' and ''small),'' hypernymy and hyponymy ''(rose'' and ''flower),'' converseness ''(buy'' and ''sell),'' and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.<ref name=famer1999 />\n\nKnowing the meaning of a lexical item therefore means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words ''rose'' and ''rabbit'' without knowing what a ''marigold'' or a ''muskrat'' is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word ''red'' without knowing the meaning of ''scarlet,'' but understanding ''scarlet'' without knowing the meaning of ''red'' may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like ''German shepherd,'' would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. ''corgi'', or ''poodle''), thus expanding the semantic field further.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Grandy\n | first = Richard E.\n | title = Frames, Fields, and Contrasts: New Essays in Semantic and Lexical Organization\n | publisher = Routledge\n | date = 2012\n | chapter = Semantic Fields, Prototypes, and the Lexicon\n | pages = 103\u2013122\n | isbn = 9781136475801}}</ref>\n\n=== How lexical items map onto events ===\nEvent structure is defined as the semantic relation of a verb and its syntactic properties.<ref>\n {{Citation\n | last = Malaia\n | title =Effects of Verbal Event Structure on Online Thematic Role Assignment\n | journal =Journal of Psycholinguistic Research\n | volume =41\n | issue =5\n | pages =323\u2013345\n | year =2012\n | doi =10.1007/s10936-011-9195-x| pmid =22120140\n |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\nEvent structure has three primary components:<ref name=Pustejovsky>{{cite journal | last1 = Pustejovsky | first1 = James | year = 2012 | title = The syntax of event structure | url = http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/james/Papers/Pustejovsky-event-structure.pdf | journal = Cognition | volume = 41 | issue = 1\u20133| pages = 47\u201381 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(91)90032-y | pmid = 1790655 }}</ref>\n* primitive event type of the lexical item\n* event composition rules\n* mapping rules to lexical structure\nVerbs can belong to one of three types: states, processes, or transitions.\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''(1) a.

The term ''generative linguistics'' was based on Chomsky's [[generative grammar]], a linguistic theory that states systematic sets of rules ([[X' theory]])  can predict grammatical phrases within a natural language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Syntactic Structures|date=1957|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter}}</ref> Generative Linguistics is also known as Government-Binding Theory.\nGenerative linguists of the 1960s, including [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], believed semantic relations between [[transitive verbs]] and [[intransitive verbs]] were tied to their independent syntactic organization.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> This meant that they saw a simple verb phrase as encompassing a more complex syntactic structure.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/>\n\n=== Lexicalist theories in the 1980s ===\nLexicalist theories became popular during the 1980s, and emphasized that a word's internal structure was a question of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and not of [[syntax]].<ref name=ReferenceA>{{cite journal|last1=Scalise|first1=Sergio|last2=Guevara|first2=Emiliano|title=The Lexicalist Approach to Word-Formation|date=1985}}</ref> Lexicalist theories emphasized that complex words (resulting from compounding and derivation of [[affixes]]) have lexical entries that are derived from morphology, rather than resulting from overlapping syntactic and phonological properties, as Generative Linguistics predicts. The distinction between Generative Linguistics and Lexicalist theories can be illustrated by considering the transformation of the word ''destroy'' to ''destruction'':\n\n* '''Generative Linguistics theory''': states the transformation of ''destroy'' \u2192 ''destruction'' as the nominal, ''nom'' + ''destroy,'' combined with [[phonological rule]]s that produce the output ''destruction''. Views this transformation as independent of the morphology.\n* '''Lexicalist theory''': sees ''destroy'' and ''destruction'' as having idiosyncratic lexical entries based on their differences in morphology. Argues that each morpheme contributes specific meaning. States that the formation of the complex word ''destruction'' is accounted for by a set of ''Lexical Rules,'' which are different and independent from syntactic rules.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA [[lexical entry]] lists the basic properties of either the whole word, or the individual properties of the morphemes that make up the word itself. The properties of [[lexical item]]s include their category selection ''c-selection'', selectional properties ''s-selection'', (also known as semantic selection),<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> phonological properties, and features. The properties of lexical items are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and contain specific information about the lexical items that they describe.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/>\n\nThe following is an example of a lexical entry for the verb ''put'':\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''put:'' V DP<sub>''agent''</sub> DP<sub>''experiencer''</sub>/PP<sub>''locative''</sub>\n|}\n\nLexicalist theories state that a word's meaning is derived from its morphology or a speaker's lexicon, and not its syntax. The degree of morphology's influence on overall grammar remains controversial.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> Currently, the linguists that perceive one engine driving both morphological items and syntactic items are in the majority.\n\n=== Micro-syntactic theories: 1990s to the present ===\nBy the early 1990s, Chomsky's [[Minimalist program|minimalist framework]] on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry|last2=Lepore|first2=Ernie|date=Aug 1999|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=96|issue=8|pages=381\u2013403|jstor=2564628|doi=10.5840/jphil199996818|title=All at Sea in Semantic Space|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b71ab3386f6eb9fbf5e855fa4cf4b80d9dc3b268}}</ref> These probing techniques analyzed negative data over [[prescriptive grammar]]s, and because of Chomsky's proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved to in order to fulfill the EPP. This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as [[Ditransitive verb|ditransitive]], [[inchoative verb|inchoative]], and [[causative verb|causative]] verbs), could select their own specifier element within a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]] construction. (For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., & Gamlin, P. (1979)).\n\nThis brought the focus back on the syntax-lexical semantics interface; however, syntacticians still sought to understand the relationship between complex verbs and their related syntactic structure, and to what degree the syntax was projected from the lexicon, as the Lexicalist theories argued.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, linguists [[Heidi Harley]], [[Samuel Jay Keyser]], and [[Kenneth L. Hale|Kenneth Hale]] addressed some of the implications posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template.<ref>Pinker, S. 1989. \"Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure.\" Cambridge. MIT Press. pp 89</ref> ''Predicates'' are verbs and state or affirm something about the subject of the sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates ''went'' and ''is here'' below affirm the argument of the subject and the state of the subject respectively.\n\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''Lucy went home.\n ''The parcel is here.''\n|}\n\nThe subunits of Verb Phrases led to the Argument Structure Hypothesis and Verb Phrase Hypothesis, both outlined below.<ref>Harley, Heidi. \"Events, agents and the interpretation of VP-shells.\" (1996).</ref> The recursion found under the \"umbrella\" Verb Phrase, the VP Shell, accommodated binary-branching theory; another critical topic during the 1990s.<ref>Kayne, Richard S.

Thus, the structure of a predicate is strictly a lexical representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree. The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky's Empty Category Principle. This lexical projection of the predicate's argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis.<ref name=\"Hale\" /> This idea coincides with Chomsky's [[Projection Principle]], because it forces a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).\n\nBased on the interaction between lexical properties, locality, and the properties of the EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a lexical unit must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.<ref>Paul Bennett, 2003.

Essentially, the idea that under the Extended Projection Principle there is a local boundary under which a special meaning occurs.

This branching ensures that the Specifier is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.\n\nRamchand also introduced the concept of Homomorphic Unity, which refers to the structural synchronization between the head of a complex verb phrase and its complement. According to Ramchand, Homomorphic Unity is \"when two event descriptors are syntactically Merged, the structure of the complement must unify with the structure of the head.\"<ref name=Ramchand>{{cite book|last1=Ramchand|first1=Gillian|title=Verb Meaning and the Lexicon: A First Phase Syntax|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511486319}}</ref>\n\n== Classification of event types ==\n\n=== Intransitive verbs: unaccusative versus unergative ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 100\n\n| image1 = Unaccusativeexample.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (2a)\n\n| image2 = Unergativeexample.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (2b)\n\n}}\n\nThe unaccusative hypothesis was put forward by David Perlmutter in 1987, and describes how two classes of intransitive verbs have two different syntactic structures.

(For example, the VP ''the vase broke'' carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.) There are two types of change-of-state predicates: [[inchoative]] and [[causative]].\n\nInchoative verbs are [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]], meaning that they occur without a direct object, and these verbs express that their subject has undergone a certain change of state. Inchoative verbs are also known as [[anticausative]] verbs.<ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\">{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Kent|title=An Overview of Lexical Semantics|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=2008|pages=119\u2013134|url=http://www.lps.uci.edu/~johnsonk/Publications/Johnson.AnOverviewOfLexicalSemantics.pdf}}</ref> Causative verbs are transitive, meaning that they occur with a direct object, and they express that the subject causes a change of state in the object.\n\nLinguist [[Martin Haspelmath]] classifies inchoative/causative verb pairs under three main categories: causative, anticausative, and non-directed alternations.<ref name=\"Haspelmath1\">{{cite book|last1=Haspelmath|first1=Martin|title=More on the typology of inchoative/causative verb alternations|journal=Causatives and Transitivity|date=1993|volume=23|pages=87\u2013121|url=https://www.academia.edu/3452966|doi=10.1075/slcs.23.05has|series=Studies in Language Companion Series|isbn=978-90-272-3026-3}}</ref> Non-directed alternations are further subdivided into labile, equipollent, and suppletive alternations.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 160\n\n| image1 = Vasebreak.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (3a)\n\n| image2 = Johnbrokevase.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (3b)\n\n}}\n[[English language|English]] tends to favour [[Ambitransitive verb|labile alternations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pi\u00f1\u00f3n|first1=Christopher|title=A finer look at the causative-inchoative alternation|date=2001|pages=346\u2013364|url=http://elanguage.net/journals/salt/article/viewFile/11.346/1719}}</ref> meaning that the same verb is used in the inchoative and causative forms.<ref name=\"Haspelmath1\" /> This can be seen in the following example: ''broke'' is an intransitive inchoative verb in (3a) and a transitive causative verb in (3b).\n{|\n|-\n| \n (3) '''English''' <ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" />\n     a.

In the underlying tree structure for (3b), the silent subunits CAUS and BECOME are both embedded within the VP, resulting in the causative change-of-state meaning (x cause y become z).<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\" />\n\nEnglish change of state verbs are often de-adjectival, meaning that they are derived from adjectives. We can see this in the following example:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (4) a.

The causative verbs in these languages remain unmarked. [[Martin Haspelmath|Haspelmath]] refers to this as the [[anticausative]] alternation.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 170\n\n| image1 = Zerbrach.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (4a)\n\n| image2 = Hanszerbrach.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (4b)\n\n}}\nFor example, inchoative verbs in [[German language|German]] are classified into three morphological classes. ''Class A'' verbs necessarily form inchoatives with the reflexive pronoun ''{{lang|de|sich}}'', ''Class B'' verbs form inchoatives necessarily without the reflexive pronoun, and ''Class C'' verbs form inchoatives optionally with or without the reflexive pronoun. In example (5), the verb ''{{lang|de|zerbrach}}'' is an unmarked inchoative verb from ''Class B'', which also remains unmarked in its causative form.<ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n{|\n|-\n| \n (5) '''German'''  <ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n     a.

While this debate is still unresolved in languages such as [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], it has been suggested by linguist Florian Sch\u00e4fer that there are semantic differences between marked and unmarked inchoatives in [[German language|German]]. Specifically, that only unmarked inchoative verbs allow an unintentional causer reading (meaning that they can take on an \"''x unintentionally caused y''\" reading).<ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n\n==== Marked causatives ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 190\n\n| image1 = angbata.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (7a)\n\n| image2 = sirosa2.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (7b)\n\n}}\nCausative morphemes are present in the verbs of many languages (e.g., [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], etc.), usually appearing in the form of an affix on the verb.<ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" /> This can be seen in the following examples from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], where the causative prefix ''pag-'' (realized here as ''nag'') attaches to the verb ''tumba'' to derive a causative transitive verb in (7b), but the prefix does not appear in the inchoative intransitive verb in (7a).

The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path. This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument.<ref name=\"Kayne\">Kayne, R. (1981). Unambiguous paths. In R. May & F.

In this tree structure it can be seen that the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb. Tree diagram (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English.

In ditransitive verbs such as ''give someone something'', ''send someone something'', ''show someone something'' etc. there is an underlying causative meaning that is represented in the underlying structure. As seen in example in (9a) above, ''John sent Mary a package'', there is the underlying meaning that 'John \"caused\" Mary to have a package'.\n\nLarson proposed that both sentences in (9a) and (9b) share the same underlying structure and the difference on the surface lies in that the double object construction \"John sent Mary a package\" is derived by transformation from a NP plus PP construction \"John sent a package to Mary\".\n\n==== Beck & Johnson's 2004 double object construction ====\n\nBeck and Johnson, however, give evidence that the two underlying structures are not the same.<ref name=beck>{{cite journal|last1=Sigrid|first1=Beck|last2=Johnson|first2=Kyle|title=Double Objects Again|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=2004|volume=35|issue=1|pages=97\u2013124|url=http://people.umass.edu/partee/docs/Beck_and_Johnson_2004.pdf|doi=10.1162/002438904322793356}}</ref> In so doing, they also give further evidence of the presence of two VPs where the verb attaches to a causative verb. In examples (14a) and (b), each of the double object constructions are alternated with NP + PP constructions.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (14) a. ''Satoshi sent Tubingen the Damron Guide.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b. ''Satoshi sent the Damron Guide to T\u00fcbingen''.\n|}\nBeck and Johnson show that the object in (15a) has a different relation to the motion verb as it is not able to carry the meaning of HAVING which the possessor (9a) and (15a) can. In (15a), Satoshi is an animate possessor and so is caused to HAVE kisimen. The PP ''for Satoshi'' in (15b) is of a benefactive nature and does not necessarily carry this meaning of HAVE either.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (15) a. ''Thilo cooked Satoshi kisimen.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b. ''Thilo cooked kisimen for Satoshi''.\n|}\nThe underlying structures are therefore not the same. The differences lie in the semantics and the syntax of the sentences, in contrast to the transformational theory of Larson. Further evidence for the structural existence of VP shells with an invisible verbal unit is given in the application of the adjunct or modifier \"again\". Sentence (16) is ambiguous and looking into the two different meanings reveals a difference in structure.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (16) ''Sally opened the door again''.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n|}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 150\n\n| image1 = Larson3.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (17a)\n\n| image2 = Larson1.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (17b)\n\n}}\nHowever, in (17a), it is clear that it was Sally who repeated the action of opening the door.

It contains English words that are grouped into [[Synonym Ring|synsets]]. Some semantic relations between these synsets are [[meronymy]], [[hyponymy]], [[synonymy]], and [[antonymy]].\n\n== Semantic fields ==\n\n=== How lexical items map onto concepts ===\nFirst proposed by Trier in the 1930s,<ref name=famer1999>Famer, Pamela B.; Mairal Us\u00f3n, Ricardo (1999). \"Constructing a Lexicon of English Verbs\". Functional Grammar (in English) 23 (illustrated ed.). Walter de Gruyter. p. 350. {{ISBN|9783110164169}}.</ref> [[semantic field]] theory proposes that a group of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words ''boil'', ''bake'', ''fry'', and ''roast'', for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of ''cooking''. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words.<ref>{{cite book|first=Adrienne|last=Lehrer|title=Historical Semantics, Historical Word Formation|chapter=The influence of semantic fields on semantic change|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|pages=283\u2013296 |chapter-url=http://alehrer.faculty.arizona.edu/sites/alehrer.faculty.arizona.edu/files/Semantic%20fields%20and%20change.pdf}}</ref> Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between [[lexeme]]s, including synonymy ''(big'' and ''large),'' antonymy ''(big'' and ''small),'' hypernymy and hyponymy ''(rose'' and ''flower),'' converseness ''(buy'' and ''sell),'' and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.<ref name=famer1999 />\n\nKnowing the meaning of a lexical item therefore means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words ''rose'' and ''rabbit'' without knowing what a ''marigold'' or a ''muskrat'' is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word ''red'' without knowing the meaning of ''scarlet,'' but understanding ''scarlet'' without knowing the meaning of ''red'' may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like ''German shepherd,'' would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. ''corgi'', or ''poodle''), thus expanding the semantic field further.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Grandy\n | first = Richard E.\n | title = Frames, Fields, and Contrasts: New Essays in Semantic and Lexical Organization\n | publisher = Routledge\n | date = 2012\n | chapter = Semantic Fields, Prototypes, and the Lexicon\n | pages = 103\u2013122\n | isbn = 9781136475801}}</ref>\n\n=== How lexical items map onto events ===\nEvent structure is defined as the semantic relation of a verb and its syntactic properties.<ref>\n {{Citation\n | last = Malaia\n | title =Effects of Verbal Event Structure on Online Thematic Role Assignment\n | journal =Journal of Psycholinguistic Research\n | volume =41\n | issue =5\n | pages =323\u2013345\n | year =2012\n | doi =10.1007/s10936-011-9195-x| pmid =22120140\n |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\nEvent structure has three primary components:<ref name=Pustejovsky>{{cite journal | last1 = Pustejovsky | first1 = James | year = 2012 | title = The syntax of event structure | url = http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/james/Papers/Pustejovsky-event-structure.pdf | journal = Cognition | volume = 41 | issue = 1\u20133| pages = 47\u201381 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(91)90032-y | pmid = 1790655 }}</ref>\n* primitive event type of the lexical item\n* event composition rules\n* mapping rules to lexical structure\nVerbs can belong to one of three types: states, processes, or transitions.\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''(1) a.

The term ''generative linguistics'' was based on Chomsky's [[generative grammar]], a linguistic theory that states systematic sets of rules ([[X' theory]])  can predict grammatical phrases within a natural language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Syntactic Structures|date=1957|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter}}</ref> Generative Linguistics is also known as Government-Binding Theory.\nGenerative linguists of the 1960s, including [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], believed semantic relations between [[transitive verbs]] and [[intransitive verbs]] were tied to their independent syntactic organization.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> This meant that they saw a simple verb phrase as encompassing a more complex syntactic structure.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/>\n\n=== Lexicalist theories in the 1980s ===\nLexicalist theories became popular during the 1980s, and emphasized that a word's internal structure was a question of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and not of [[syntax]].<ref name=ReferenceA>{{cite journal|last1=Scalise|first1=Sergio|last2=Guevara|first2=Emiliano|title=The Lexicalist Approach to Word-Formation|date=1985}}</ref> Lexicalist theories emphasized that complex words (resulting from compounding and derivation of [[affixes]]) have lexical entries that are derived from morphology, rather than resulting from overlapping syntactic and phonological properties, as Generative Linguistics predicts. The distinction between Generative Linguistics and Lexicalist theories can be illustrated by considering the transformation of the word ''destroy'' to ''destruction'':\n\n* '''Generative Linguistics theory''': states the transformation of ''destroy'' \u2192 ''destruction'' as the nominal, ''nom'' + ''destroy,'' combined with [[phonological rule]]s that produce the output ''destruction''. Views this transformation as independent of the morphology.\n* '''Lexicalist theory''': sees ''destroy'' and ''destruction'' as having idiosyncratic lexical entries based on their differences in morphology. Argues that each morpheme contributes specific meaning. States that the formation of the complex word ''destruction'' is accounted for by a set of ''Lexical Rules,'' which are different and independent from syntactic rules.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA [[lexical entry]] lists the basic properties of either the whole word, or the individual properties of the morphemes that make up the word itself. The properties of [[lexical item]]s include their category selection ''c-selection'', selectional properties ''s-selection'', (also known as semantic selection),<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> phonological properties, and features. The properties of lexical items are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and contain specific information about the lexical items that they describe.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/>\n\nThe following is an example of a lexical entry for the verb ''put'':\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''put:'' V DP<sub>''agent''</sub> DP<sub>''experiencer''</sub>/PP<sub>''locative''</sub>\n|}\n\nLexicalist theories state that a word's meaning is derived from its morphology or a speaker's lexicon, and not its syntax. The degree of morphology's influence on overall grammar remains controversial.<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\"/> Currently, the linguists that perceive one engine driving both morphological items and syntactic items are in the majority.\n\n=== Micro-syntactic theories: 1990s to the present ===\nBy the early 1990s, Chomsky's [[Minimalist program|minimalist framework]] on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry|last2=Lepore|first2=Ernie|date=Aug 1999|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=96|issue=8|pages=381\u2013403|jstor=2564628|doi=10.5840/jphil199996818|title=All at Sea in Semantic Space|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b71ab3386f6eb9fbf5e855fa4cf4b80d9dc3b268}}</ref> These probing techniques analyzed negative data over [[prescriptive grammar]]s, and because of Chomsky's proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved to in order to fulfill the EPP. This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as [[Ditransitive verb|ditransitive]], [[inchoative verb|inchoative]], and [[causative verb|causative]] verbs), could select their own specifier element within a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]] construction. (For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., & Gamlin, P. (1979)).\n\nThis brought the focus back on the syntax-lexical semantics interface; however, syntacticians still sought to understand the relationship between complex verbs and their related syntactic structure, and to what degree the syntax was projected from the lexicon, as the Lexicalist theories argued.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, linguists [[Heidi Harley]], [[Samuel Jay Keyser]], and [[Kenneth L. Hale|Kenneth Hale]] addressed some of the implications posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template.<ref>Pinker, S. 1989. \"Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure.\" Cambridge. MIT Press. pp 89</ref> ''Predicates'' are verbs and state or affirm something about the subject of the sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates ''went'' and ''is here'' below affirm the argument of the subject and the state of the subject respectively.\n\n{|\n|-\n| \n ''Lucy went home.\n ''The parcel is here.''\n|}\n\nThe subunits of Verb Phrases led to the Argument Structure Hypothesis and Verb Phrase Hypothesis, both outlined below.<ref>Harley, Heidi. \"Events, agents and the interpretation of VP-shells.\" (1996).</ref> The recursion found under the \"umbrella\" Verb Phrase, the VP Shell, accommodated binary-branching theory; another critical topic during the 1990s.<ref>Kayne, Richard S.

Thus, the structure of a predicate is strictly a lexical representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree. The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky's Empty Category Principle. This lexical projection of the predicate's argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis.<ref name=\"Hale\" /> This idea coincides with Chomsky's [[Projection Principle]], because it forces a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).\n\nBased on the interaction between lexical properties, locality, and the properties of the EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a lexical unit must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.<ref>Paul Bennett, 2003.

This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.\n\nRamchand also introduced the concept of Homomorphic Unity, which refers to the structural synchronization between the head of a complex verb phrase and its complement. According to Ramchand, Homomorphic Unity is \"when two event descriptors are syntactically Merged, the structure of the complement must unify with the structure of the head.\"<ref name=Ramchand>{{cite book|last1=Ramchand|first1=Gillian|title=Verb Meaning and the Lexicon: A First Phase Syntax|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511486319}}</ref>\n\n== Classification of event types ==\n\n=== Intransitive verbs: unaccusative versus unergative ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 100\n\n| image1 = Unaccusativeexample.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (2a)\n\n| image2 = Unergativeexample.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (2b)\n\n}}\n\nThe unaccusative hypothesis was put forward by David Perlmutter in 1987, and describes how two classes of intransitive verbs have two different syntactic structures. These are [[unaccusative verb]]s and [[unergative verb]]s.<ref name=\"Lappin\">Lappin, S. (Ed.). (1996). Handbook of contemporary semantic theory. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers.</ref> These classes of verbs are defined by Perlmutter only in syntactic terms. They have the following structures underlyingly:\n\n* unaccusative verb: __ [<sub>VP</sub> V NP] <ref name=\"Lappin\" />\n* unergative verb: NP [<sub>VP</sub> V]\n\nThe following is an example from English:\n\n{|\n|-\n|  \n (2) '''Unaccusative'''\n     a.

''Mary worked.''\n''\n|}\n\nIn (2a) the verb underlyingly takes a direct object, while in (2b) the verb underlyingly takes a subject.\n\n=== Transitivity alternations: the inchoative/causative alternation ===\n{{main article|Causative alternation}}\nThe change-of-state property of Verb Phrases (VP) is a significant observation for the syntax of lexical semantics because it provides evidence that subunits are embedded in the VP structure, and that the meaning of the entire VP is influenced by this internal grammatical structure. (For example, the VP ''the vase broke'' carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.) There are two types of change-of-state predicates: [[inchoative]] and [[causative]].\n\nInchoative verbs are [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]], meaning that they occur without a direct object, and these verbs express that their subject has undergone a certain change of state. Inchoative verbs are also known as [[anticausative]] verbs.<ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\">{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Kent|title=An Overview of Lexical Semantics|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=2008|pages=119\u2013134|url=http://www.lps.uci.edu/~johnsonk/Publications/Johnson.AnOverviewOfLexicalSemantics.pdf}}</ref> Causative verbs are transitive, meaning that they occur with a direct object, and they express that the subject causes a change of state in the object.\n\nLinguist [[Martin Haspelmath]] classifies inchoative/causative verb pairs under three main categories: causative, anticausative, and non-directed alternations.<ref name=\"Haspelmath1\">{{cite book|last1=Haspelmath|first1=Martin|title=More on the typology of inchoative/causative verb alternations|journal=Causatives and Transitivity|date=1993|volume=23|pages=87\u2013121|url=https://www.academia.edu/3452966|doi=10.1075/slcs.23.05has|series=Studies in Language Companion Series|isbn=978-90-272-3026-3}}</ref> Non-directed alternations are further subdivided into labile, equipollent, and suppletive alternations.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 160\n\n| image1 = Vasebreak.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (3a)\n\n| image2 = Johnbrokevase.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (3b)\n\n}}\n[[English language|English]] tends to favour [[Ambitransitive verb|labile alternations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pi\u00f1\u00f3n|first1=Christopher|title=A finer look at the causative-inchoative alternation|date=2001|pages=346\u2013364|url=http://elanguage.net/journals/salt/article/viewFile/11.346/1719}}</ref> meaning that the same verb is used in the inchoative and causative forms.<ref name=\"Haspelmath1\" /> This can be seen in the following example: ''broke'' is an intransitive inchoative verb in (3a) and a transitive causative verb in (3b).\n{|\n|-\n| \n (3) '''English''' <ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" />\n     a. ''The vase '''broke'''.''\n     b. ''John '''broke''' the vase''.\n|}\nAs seen in the underlying tree structure for (3a), the silent subunit BECOME is embedded within the Verb Phrase (VP), resulting in the inchoative change-of-state meaning (y become z). In the underlying tree structure for (3b), the silent subunits CAUS and BECOME are both embedded within the VP, resulting in the causative change-of-state meaning (x cause y become z).<ref name=\"WILEY Blackwell\" />\n\nEnglish change of state verbs are often de-adjectival, meaning that they are derived from adjectives. We can see this in the following example:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (4) a. ''The knot is loose.'' <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tham | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = Change of state verbs and result state adjectives in Mandarin Chinese | url = | journal = Journal of Linguistics | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 647\u2013701 | doi=10.1017/s0022226713000261}}</ref>\n     b. ''The knot loosened.''\n     c. ''Sandy loosened the knot.''\n|}\nIn example (4a) we start with a stative intransitive adjective, and derive (4b) where we see an intransitive inchoative verb. In (4c) we see a transitive causative verb.\n\n==== Marked inchoatives ====\nSome languages (e.g., [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[French language|French]]), have multiple morphological classes of inchoative verbs.<ref name=\"Schafer\">{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=Florian|title=The Syntax of (Anti-)Causatives|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027255099|page=1|year=2008}}</ref> Generally speaking, these languages separate their inchoative verbs into three classes: verbs that are obligatorily unmarked (they are not marked with a [[reflexive pronoun]], [[clitic]], or [[affix]]), verbs that are optionally marked, and verbs that are obligatorily marked. The causative verbs in these languages remain unmarked. [[Martin Haspelmath|Haspelmath]] refers to this as the [[anticausative]] alternation.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 170\n\n| image1 = Zerbrach.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (4a)\n\n| image2 = Hanszerbrach.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (4b)\n\n}}\nFor example, inchoative verbs in [[German language|German]] are classified into three morphological classes. ''Class A'' verbs necessarily form inchoatives with the reflexive pronoun ''{{lang|de|sich}}'', ''Class B'' verbs form inchoatives necessarily without the reflexive pronoun, and ''Class C'' verbs form inchoatives optionally with or without the reflexive pronoun. In example (5), the verb ''{{lang|de|zerbrach}}'' is an unmarked inchoative verb from ''Class B'', which also remains unmarked in its causative form.<ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n{|\n|-\n| \n (5) '''German'''  <ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n     a.

''Hans '''\u00f6ffnete''' die T\u00fcr.''\n        John opened the door\n        'John opened the door.'\n|}\n\nThere has been some debate as to whether the different classes of inchoative verbs are purely based in morphology, or whether the differentiation is derived from the lexical-semantic properties of each individual verb. While this debate is still unresolved in languages such as [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], it has been suggested by linguist Florian Sch\u00e4fer that there are semantic differences between marked and unmarked inchoatives in [[German language|German]]. Specifically, that only unmarked inchoative verbs allow an unintentional causer reading (meaning that they can take on an \"''x unintentionally caused y''\" reading).<ref name=\"Schafer\" />\n\n==== Marked causatives ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 190\n\n| image1 = angbata.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (7a)\n\n| image2 = sirosa2.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (7b)\n\n}}\nCausative morphemes are present in the verbs of many languages (e.g., [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], etc.), usually appearing in the form of an affix on the verb.<ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" /> This can be seen in the following examples from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], where the causative prefix ''pag-'' (realized here as ''nag'') attaches to the verb ''tumba'' to derive a causative transitive verb in (7b), but the prefix does not appear in the inchoative intransitive verb in (7a). [[Martin Haspelmath|Haspelmath]] refers to this as the [[causative]] alternation.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (7) '''Tagalog''' <ref name=\"An Overview of Lexical Semantics\" />\n     a.

The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path. This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument.<ref name=\"Kayne\">Kayne, R. (1981). Unambiguous paths. In R. May & F. Koster (Eds.), Levels of syntactic representation (143-184). Cinnaminson, NJ: Foris Publications.</ref> When applied to ditransitive verbs, this hypothesis introduces the structure in diagram (8a). In this tree structure it can be seen that the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb. Tree diagram (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English. This analysis was a step toward binary branching trees, which was a theoretical change that was furthered by Larson's VP-shell analysis.<ref name=\"Larson\" />\n\n==== Larson's 1988 \"VP-shell\" analysis ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 170\n\n| image1 = LexicalSemanticsDOCtree.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Tree diagram for (9a)\n\n| image2 = Lexicalsemantics7btree.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Tree diagram for (9b)\n\n}}\nLarson posited his Single Complement Hypothesis in which he stated that every complement is introduced with one verb. The Double Object Construction presented in 1988 gave clear evidence of a hierarchical structure using asymmetrical binary branching.<ref name=Larson>{{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Richard|title=On the Double Object Construction|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=1988|volume=19|issue=3|pages=589\u2013632|jstor=25164901}}</ref> Sentences with double objects occur with ditransitive verbs, as we can see in the following example:\n[[File:Vpshelltree.png|thumb|Larson's proposed binary-branching VP-shell structure for (9)]]\n{|\n|\n| \n (9) a. ''John sent Mary a package.'' <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miyagawa|first1=Shigeru|last2=Tsujioka|first2=Takae|title=Argument Structure and Ditransitive Verbs in Japanese|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|date=2004|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1\u201338|doi=10.1023/b:jeal.0000007345.64336.84|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.6553}}</ref>\n     b. ''John sent a package to Mary.''\n|}\nIt appears as if the verb ''send'' has two objects, or complements (arguments): both ''Mary'', the recipient and ''parcel'', the theme. The argument structure of ditransitive verb phrases is complex and has undergone different structural hypothesis.\n\nThe original structural hypothesis was that of ternary branching seen in (9a) and (9b), but following from Kayne's 1981 analysis, Larson maintained that each complement is introduced by a verb.<ref name=\"Kayne\" /><ref name=\"Larson\" />\n\nTheir hypothesis shows that there is a lower verb embedded within a VP shell that combines with an upper verb (can be invisible), thus creating a VP shell (as seen in the tree diagram to the right). Most current theories no longer allow the ternary tree structure of (9a) and (9b), so the theme and the goal/recipient are seen in a hierarchical relationship within a [[Branching (linguistics)#Binary vs. n-ary branching|binary branching]] structure.<ref name=\"Bruening\">{{cite journal|last1=Bruening|first1=Benjamin|title=Ditransitive Asymmetries and a Theory of Idiom Formation|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=November 2010|volume=41|issue=4|pages=519\u2013562|doi=10.1162/LING_a_00012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing are examples of Larson's tests to show that the hierarchical (superior) order of any two objects aligns with a linear order, so that the second is governed (c-commanded) by the first.<ref name=\"Larson\"/> This is in keeping with X'Bar Theory of Phrase Structure Grammar, with Larson's tree structure using the empty Verb to which the V is raised.\n\nReflexives and reciprocals (anaphors) show this relationship in which they must be c-commanded by their antecedents, such that the (10a) is grammatical but (10b) is not:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (10) a. ''I showed Mary herself.<ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n     b. ''*I showed herself Mary.''\n|}\nA pronoun must have a quantifier as its antecedent:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (11) a. '' I gave every worker his paycheck.<ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n      b. ''*I gave its owner every paycheck.''\n|}\nQuestion words follow this order:\n{|\n|-\n| \n (12) a. ''Who did you give which paycheck? <ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n      b. ''*Which paycheck did you give who?''\n|}\n\nThe effect of negative polarity means that \"any\" must have a negative quantifier as an antecedent:\n[[File:Larsoncausative.png|thumb|General tree diagram for Larson's proposed underlying structure of a sentence with causative meaning]]\n{|\n|-\n| \n (13) a. ''I showed no one anything.<ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n      b. ''*I showed anyone nothing.''\n|}\nThese tests with ditransitive verbs that confirm c-command also confirm the presence of underlying or invisible causative verbs. In ditransitive verbs such as ''give someone something'', ''send someone something'', ''show someone something'' etc. there is an underlying causative meaning that is represented in the underlying structure. As seen in example in (9a) above, ''John sent Mary a package'', there is the underlying meaning that 'John \"caused\" Mary to have a package'.\n\nLarson proposed that both sentences in (9a) and (9b) share the same underlying structure and the difference on the surface lies in that the double object construction \"John sent Mary a package\" is derived by transformation from a NP plus PP construction \"John sent a package to Mary\".\n\n==== Beck & Johnson's 2004 double object construction ====\n\nBeck and Johnson, however, give evidence that the two underlying structures are not the same.<ref name=beck>{{cite journal|last1=Sigrid|first1=Beck|last2=Johnson|first2=Kyle|title=Double Objects Again|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|date=2004|volume=35|issue=1|pages=97\u2013124|url=http://people.umass.edu/partee/docs/Beck_and_Johnson_2004.pdf|doi=10.1162/002438904322793356}}</ref> In so doing, they also give further evidence of the presence of two VPs where the verb attaches to a causative verb. In examples (14a) and (b), each of the double object constructions are alternated with NP + PP constructions.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (14) a. ''Satoshi sent Tubingen the Damron Guide.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b. ''Satoshi sent the Damron Guide to T\u00fcbingen''.\n|}\nBeck and Johnson show that the object in (15a) has a different relation to the motion verb as it is not able to carry the meaning of HAVING which the possessor (9a) and (15a) can. In (15a), Satoshi is an animate possessor and so is caused to HAVE kisimen. The PP ''for Satoshi'' in (15b) is of a benefactive nature and does not necessarily carry this meaning of HAVE either.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (15) a. ''Thilo cooked Satoshi kisimen.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b. ''Thilo cooked kisimen for Satoshi''.\n|}\nThe underlying structures are therefore not the same. The differences lie in the semantics and the syntax of the sentences, in contrast to the transformational theory of Larson. Further evidence for the structural existence of VP shells with an invisible verbal unit is given in the application of the adjunct or modifier \"again\". Sentence (16) is ambiguous and looking into the two different meanings reveals a difference in structure.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (16) ''Sally opened the door again''.<ref name=\"beck\" />\n|}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| width = 150\n\n| image1 = Larson3.png\n|thumb\n| caption1 = Underlying tree structure for (17a)\n\n| image2 = Larson1.png\n|thumb\n| caption2 = Underlying tree structure for (17b)\n\n}}\nHowever, in (17a), it is clear that it was Sally who repeated the action of opening the door. In (17b), the event is in the door being opened and Sally may or may not have opened it previously. To render these two different meanings, \"again\" attaches to VPs in two different places, and thus describes two events with a purely structural change.\n{|\n|-\n| \n (17) a. ''Sally was so kind that she went out of her way to open the door''\n         ''once again.''<ref name=\"beck\" />\n      b.
