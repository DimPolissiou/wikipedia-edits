He is most noted as a ballet dancer, having been a [[principal dancer]] with both the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] and the [[Royal Ballet]] in London, as well as making guest appearances with other ballet companies. Following his departure from the Royal Ballet in 2013, he was the artistic director of the Romanian National Ballet Company until 2016.\n\n==Early life==\nJohan Kobborg was born in Odense, Denmark into an artistic family; his mother is a former showgirl and actress and his brother is an actor. From a young age, he trained as a tenor, but left singing to take up dancing.\n\n==Training==\nKobborg began his professional training at the late age of {{Age|1972|1|1|1988|1|1}}, attending the Royal Danish Ballet School, where he was tutored in the [[Bournonville method]] of classical dance. He graduated in 1991.\n\n==Professional career==\nAfter his graduation, Kobborg joined the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] and was promoted to the rank of principal dancer in 1994, following his debut in the role of James in ''[[La Sylphide]]''.

His guests appearances include dancing with the [[Mariinsky Ballet]], [[Bolshoi Ballet]], [[La Scala Ballet]], [[National Ballet of Canada]], [[Hamburg Ballet]], [[Stuttgart Ballet]], [[Vienna State Opera Ballet]] and [[Teatro San Carlo]], [[Naples]].\n\nOne of the highlights of his career is his partnership with Romanian ballerina, [[Alina Cojocaru]]. The partnership began in 2001 after the two danced in ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' together after Cojocaru filled in for an injured [[Miyako Yoshida]]. Since then, Kobborg and Cojocaru's partnership has been named one of the greatest of all time and has even been compared to the partnership of [[Margot Fonteyn]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]]. They have danced together not just at Covent Garden, but also worldwide due to international popularity.\n\nDespite media speculation that Kobborg would retire from the stage to replace [[Dame Monica Mason]] as Artistic Director of the Royal Ballet in 2012, it was later announced that [[Kevin O'Hare]] would be her successor.  Kobborg previously declined an invitation to bid for the directorship of the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], but in an article for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' he stated that he would definitely accept such invitation to run the Royal Ballet.

Currently, Jamaicans can be found in every major Canadian city and occupy a multitude of occupations.\n===Origins===\nThe first Jamaicans who moved to Canada were [[Caribbean|West Indian]] slaves imported into [[New France]] and [[Nova Scotia]] individually and in small numbers. In 1796, the Maroons ofnnvnnvnvvnvv  JOHN CENA GUHITVCYEYD%VYFGJH<JKL Jamaica entered [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] and were the first large group to enter [[British North America]] (''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', 2000). The name [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]] was used to describe slaves who ran away from their owners and created free communities away from the European settlements in Jamaica. A war between the Maroons and the British broke out on the island of Jamaica in 1795. The war ended when the British, realizing that they could not win, tricked the Maroons into laying down their arms and then carried them into exile in Nova Scotia (James & Walker, 1984).\n\nGovernor [[John Wentworth (governor)|John Wentworth]] settled the Maroons who numbered over 500 on the outskirts of Halifax and offered the men jobs to fortify the Citadel. Standing proud and still holding on to the memory of being betrayed by the British, the Maroons mounted a strong resistance and refused to be compliant Nova Scotian settlers. After numerous appeals to [[London]], the Maroons were allowed to return to [[Sierra Leone]] in West Africa in 1800. The \"Maroon Bastion\" stands on Citadel Hill as an example of their legacy and the sense of pride they contributed (James & Walker, 1984).\n\nBetween 1800 and 1920, small numbers of West Indians were brought from Jamaica as labourers for the Cape Breton mines and from [[Barbados]] to work in coal mines in Sydney and Nova Scotia. Migration from the West Indies almost virtually stopped after 1920. As a result, the West Indian population in 1941 was smaller than it was 20 years earlier. Even though pressure for migration in the West Indies mounted, the Canadian government refused to allow any more non-whites into the country (James & Walker, 1984) (James & Walker, 1984).\n\nIn 1908, [[Robert Borden]], the leader of the Conservative Party, stated \"The Conservative Party stands for a white Canada\". Not to lose face with voters, the Liberal government passed immigration that excluded non-whites, except when they were needed for cheap labour (James & Walker, 1984).\n\n[[Agnes Macdonald, 1st Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe|Agnes Macdonald]], the second wife of the first Prime Minister of Canada, [[John A. Macdonald]], was born in Jamaica. Her brother, [[Hewitt Bernard]], was the recording secretary at the [[Charlottetown Conference]] in 1864. After [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Bernard served as the [[Principal Secretary (Canada)|private secretary to the Prime Minister]] between 1867 and 1873.\n\n[[Michael Manley]], the future Prime Minister of Jamaica, served in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] during World War II.\n\n===After World War II===\nAfter [[World War II]], a great demand for unskilled workers resulted in the National Act of 1948. This Act was designed to attract cheap labourers from British colonies. This resulted in many West Indians, (including Jamaicans) coming to Canada. The Jamaicans who entered Canada after World War II did so because they still believed it was an opportunity to escape poverty and seek a new start in a world where personal advancement and success seemed to be encouraged. Wanting to stop the in-flow of black West Indians, the Walter Act of 1952 was passed to impose a \"severely restricted quota\" on black West Indians entering the country (James & Walker, 1984).\n\nIn 1955, Canada introduced the West Indian Domestic Scheme (Anderson, 1993). This Scheme allowed eligible black women who were between the age of 18 to 35, in good health, no family ties and a minimum of a grade eight education from mainly Jamaica and Barbados to enter Canada (James & Walker, 1984). After one year as a domestic servant, these women were given a landed immigrant status and were able to apply for citizenship after five years. Even though the Scheme originally allowed only 100 women per year, 2,690 women entered Canada from Jamaica and Barbados by 1965. In 1962, racial discrimination was taken out of the Canadian Immigration Act and the number of Jamaicans who moved to Canada dramatically increased (Lazar & Dauglas, 1992).\n\n===After the 1960s===\nBecause changes in the Immigration Act allowed non-whites to enter Canada without restrictions, many Jamaicans took advantage of the opportunity and entered Canada with the hopes of achieving their goals for a better life. After the purging of many racist immigration policies, a large number of Jamaicans started to enter Canada as tourists and many would later apply independently for landed immigrant status (Anderson, 1993). In the late 1960s, the Canadian government instituted the Family Reunification clause into its immigration policy, which made it even easier for Jamaicans and other groups to bring their loved ones to join them in Canada (Anderson, 1993). Thus, during the 1970s and '80s, many Jamaicans who entered Canada were children and husbands of the Jamaican women who moved to Canada between 1955 and 1965. According to Anderson (1993), Caribbean immigrants to Canada were more likely to settle in large cities and their provinces of choice were [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. The largest concentration of Jamaican immigrants can be found in the following areas of [[Greater Toronto Area|Greater Toronto]]: [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Old Toronto]], [[North York]], [[York, Toronto|York]], [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]], [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]], [[Mississauga]] and [[Brampton]]. Other cities include [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2000).\n\nIn 1989, 86.7% of Jamaican immigrants settled in Ontario, 7.4% settled in Quebec, 2.6% settled in Alberta, 1.7% settled in Manitoba, 1.1% settled in British Columbia and 0.6% settled in the rest of Canada. Jamaicans made up 27.5% of the total number of West Indian immigrants for that year (Anderson, 1993). Because of language concerns, most of the West Indian immigrants settle in Ontario as opposed to Quebec.\n\n==Demography==\n{{Historical populations\n| title = Population history\n|align       = right\n| state       = \n| percentages =\n|1996|188,770\n|2001|211,725\n|2006|231,110\n|2011|256,915 \n|2016|309,485\n| footnote = Sources:<ref name=\"2011 NHS Survey of Canada\">[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=01&Data=Count&SearchText=canada&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 NHS Profile, Canada, 2011], Statistics Canada.

Nevertheless, there was a decline during the early '80s, a recovery during 1986 and a decline again by 1989 (Anderson, 1993). According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, Jamaicans made up 40% of West Indian immigration in the early 1990s.\n\nIn a 1996 overview from Immigration Canada, Jamaica was ranked eighth in terms of the number of its citizens immigrating to Canada. Jamaica is preceded by countries such as [[China]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[Philippines]] in the number of its citizens that migrate to Canada. The number of Jamaicans immigrating to Canada declined in 1997 and again in 1998. Jamaican immigration to Canada is at an all-time low; it was ranked number 10 by Immigration Canada in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, 79,850 Jamaican Canadians lived in the City of Toronto, and 30,705 lived in the Toronto suburb of Brampton.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=CD&Code=3520&Data=Count&Table=2&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for census divisions - 20% sample data], Statistics Canada (2006).

Bill 101, which was introduced by Quebec's separatist government on August 26, 1977, introduced tighter restrictions on the use of English and access to [[English language|English]] schools. It became against the law to produce any commercial sign that was not exclusively in French, and the law aimed to make [[French language|French]] the language of the workplace (O\u2019Malley & Bowman, 2001).\n\nOf the total number of Jamaicans living in Quebec, only 20% can speak French and 86% practice [[Christianity]] as their religion. One percent of the populations have no schooling, 13% have a primary education, 45% have high school education, 25% have a college education, and 16% have a university education (Ministere des Affaires Internationales, de L\u2019Immigration et des Communautes Culturelle et la Ville de Montreal, 1995).\n\n===Population===\nAccording to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census]], 231,110 Canadians identified themselves as Jamaican Canadian.<ref name=jamaicans/> The actual number of Jamaican Canadians should be larger, given that many people identified themselves as \"Black\" \"West Indian\", or \"Caribbean\".<ref name=jamaicans/> In the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]], 256,915 Jamaican Canadians were counted, comprising an 11.2% increase since the previous census.<ref name=\"2011 NHS Survey of Canada\"/> A total population of 309,485 was tallied in the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]], an increase of 20.5%.<ref name=\"2016census\"/>\n\n==Material culture==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2010}}\n'''Food''': A spicy, colourful mix of cuisine includes ackee and saltfish, rice and peas, jerk chicken, fish and pork, [[curried goat]], pepperpot soup, roasted yams, banana fritters, patties, salads, fruits and exotic desserts. Beverages include carrot juice, ginger beer, almost all kinds of fruit juices, coconut water and sorrel.\n\n'''Arts and crafts''': Creations in straw, clay, fabric, shell, wood and semi-precious stone are on display in most Jamaican homes. African, Indian, European and Arawak cultures influence Jamaicans Arts and Crafts. Depicting life and landscape, Jamaican paintings feature bright colours and bold lines. No Jamaican kitchen is complete without a dutchy (a cast iron pot). Dutchys come in different sizes and it is said that, \"the blacker the dutchy, the sweeter it cooks\".\n\n'''Theater''': From the 19th-century Ward Theater to innovative little theaters and thriving centers for drama in Kingston, Jamaicans like a broad range of theatrical treats. Plays depict a variety of Jamaican experiences.\n\n'''Sports and games''': One could argue that the national game is domino followed by ludy. Sports of choice include cricket, football (soccer), bicycle racing, water-sports, horse racing, rafting, and track and field. Among youth however, [[basketball]] and [[Ice hockey|hockey]] are the most popular sports; Jamaican Canadians [[Tristan Thompson]] and [[Anthony Bennett (basketball)|Anthony Bennett]] play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and represent Canada internationally in FIBA, while [[PK Subban]] is playing for the Nashville Predator and was selected to Canada's Winter Olympic Team.\n\n==Notable Jamaican Canadians==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|*\n*[[Philip Akin]]\n*[[Samantha Albert]]\n*[[Lincoln Alexander]]\n*[[Lillian Allen]]\n*[[Trey Anthony]] \n*[[Bromley Armstrong]]\n*[[Donovan Bailey]]\n*[[Trevor Berbick]]\n*[[Hewitt Bernard]]\n*[[Margarett Best]]\n*[[Jully Black]]\n*[[Boi-1da]]\n*[[Michael Lee-Chin]]\n*[[Mark Boswell]]\n*[[Cindy Breakspeare]]\n*[[Divine Brown]]\n*[[Lascelles Brown]]\n*[[Rosemary Brown (politician)|Rosemary Brown]]\n*[[Shelley-Ann Brown]]\n*[[Quinton Byfield]]\n*[[Stewart Campbell (politician)|Stewart Campbell]]\n*[[Mary Anne Chambers]]\n*[[G.

Jamaican immigration to Canada is at an all-time low; it was ranked number 10 by Immigration Canada in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, 79,850 Jamaican Canadians lived in the City of Toronto, and 30,705 lived in the Toronto suburb of Brampton.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=CD&Code=3520&Data=Count&Table=2&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for census divisions - 20% sample data], Statistics Canada (2006).

By 2011, the Jamaican population nearly doubled to 12,730.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=24&Data=Count&SearchText=Quebec&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&GeoLevel=PR&GeoCode=24 NHS Profile, Quebec, 2011], Statistics Canada (2011). Retrieved on February 5, 2014.</ref> Between 1960 and 1970, 28% of immigrants in Quebec were Jamaicans, during 1971 to 1980 there was a sharp increase to 41%, there was a significant drop to 12% between 1981 and 1985 and between 1986 and 1991 the number went up to 20%.\n\nOne possible reason for this drop between 1982 and 1985 might have been the language law Bill 101. Bill 101, which was introduced by Quebec's separatist government on August 26, 1977, introduced tighter restrictions on the use of English and access to [[English language|English]] schools. It became against the law to produce any commercial sign that was not exclusively in French, and the law aimed to make [[French language|French]] the language of the workplace (O\u2019Malley & Bowman, 2001).\n\nOf the total number of Jamaicans living in Quebec, only 20% can speak French and 86% practice [[Christianity]] as their religion. One percent of the populations have no schooling, 13% have a primary education, 45% have high school education, 25% have a college education, and 16% have a university education (Ministere des Affaires Internationales, de L\u2019Immigration et des Communautes Culturelle et la Ville de Montreal, 1995).\n\n===Population===\nAccording to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census]], 231,110 Canadians identified themselves as Jamaican Canadian.<ref name=jamaicans/> The actual number of Jamaican Canadians should be larger, given that many people identified themselves as \"Black\" \"West Indian\", or \"Caribbean\".<ref name=jamaicans/> In the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]], 256,915 Jamaican Canadians were counted, comprising an 11.2% increase since the previous census.<ref name=\"2011 NHS Survey of Canada\"/> A total population of 309,485 was tallied in the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]], an increase of 20.5%.<ref name=\"2016census\"/>\n\n==Material culture==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2010}}\n'''Food''': A spicy, colourful mix of cuisine includes ackee and saltfish, rice and peas, jerk chicken, fish and pork, [[curried goat]], pepperpot soup, roasted yams, banana fritters, patties, salads, fruits and exotic desserts. Beverages include carrot juice, ginger beer, almost all kinds of fruit juices, coconut water and sorrel.\n\n'''Arts and crafts''': Creations in straw, clay, fabric, shell, wood and semi-precious stone are on display in most Jamaican homes. African, Indian, European and Arawak cultures influence Jamaicans Arts and Crafts. Depicting life and landscape, Jamaican paintings feature bright colours and bold lines. No Jamaican kitchen is complete without a dutchy (a cast iron pot). Dutchys come in different sizes and it is said that, \"the blacker the dutchy, the sweeter it cooks\".\n\n'''Theater''': From the 19th-century Ward Theater to innovative little theaters and thriving centers for drama in Kingston, Jamaicans like a broad range of theatrical treats. Plays depict a variety of Jamaican experiences.\n\n'''Sports and games''': One could argue that the national game is domino followed by ludy. Sports of choice include cricket, football (soccer), bicycle racing, water-sports, horse racing, rafting, and track and field. Among youth however, [[basketball]] and [[Ice hockey|hockey]] are the most popular sports; Jamaican Canadians [[Tristan Thompson]] and [[Anthony Bennett (basketball)|Anthony Bennett]] play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and represent Canada internationally in FIBA, while [[PK Subban]] is playing for the Nashville Predator and was selected to Canada's Winter Olympic Team.\n\n==Notable Jamaican Canadians==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|*\n*[[Philip Akin]]\n*[[Samantha Albert]]\n*[[Lincoln Alexander]]\n*[[Lillian Allen]]\n*[[Trey Anthony]] \n*[[Bromley Armstrong]]\n*[[Donovan Bailey]]\n*[[Trevor Berbick]]\n*[[Hewitt Bernard]]\n*[[Margarett Best]]\n*[[Jully Black]]\n*[[Boi-1da]]\n*[[Michael Lee-Chin]]\n*[[Mark Boswell]]\n*[[Cindy Breakspeare]]\n*[[Divine Brown]]\n*[[Lascelles Brown]]\n*[[Rosemary Brown (politician)|Rosemary Brown]]\n*[[Shelley-Ann Brown]]\n*[[Quinton Byfield]]\n*[[Stewart Campbell (politician)|Stewart Campbell]]\n*[[Mary Anne Chambers]]\n*[[G.
