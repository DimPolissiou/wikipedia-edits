It advocates a worker-oriented system of production and organization in the workplace that in some aspects radically departs from [[neoclassical economics]] in favor of democratic [[cooperative]]s or [[common ownership]] of the means of production ([[socialism]]).{{sfn|Brooks|1994|p=74}} They propose that this economic system be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the [[liberty]] of individuals and minimize [[Elite|concentration of power]] or authority ([[libertarianism]]). Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property and enterprise (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relation as a form of domination that is antagonistic to individual freedom.<ref>Paul, Ellen Frankel et al.

According to Hahnel, \"libertarian socialism was as powerful a force as [[social democracy]] and [[communism]]\" in the early 20th century. The [[Anarchist St. Imier International]], referred by Hahnel as the Libertarian International, was founded at the 1872 [[Congress of St. Imier]] a few days after the split between Marxist and libertarians at [[Hague Congress (1872)|The Hague Congress]] of the [[First International]], referred by Hahnel as the Socialist International. This Libertarian International \"competed successfully against social democrats and communists alike for the loyalty of anticapitalist activists, revolutionaries, workers, unions and political parties for over fifty years\". For Hahnel, libertarian socialists \"played a major role in the Russian revolutions of [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917]]. Libertarian socialists played a dominant role in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1911.

Libertarian socialism aims to distribute power more widely among members of society. Libertarian socialism and right-libertarian ideologies such as [[neoliberalism]] differ in that advocates of the former generally believe that one's degree of freedom is affected by one's economic and social status whereas advocates of the latter believe in the freedom of choice within a capitalist framework, specifically under capitalist private property.<ref>Vrousalis (2011) p. 212</ref> This is sometimes characterized as a desire to maximize free creativity in a society in preference to free enterprise.<ref>Chomsky (2003) pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nWithin anarchism, there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.</ref> where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.<ref>{{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |dictionary= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |dictionary= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref> It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person.

Most libertarian socialists believe that when power is exercised as exemplified by the economic, social, or physical dominance of one individual over another, the burden of proof is always on the authoritarian to justify their action as legitimate when taken against its effect of narrowing the scope of human freedom.<ref>Chomsky (2004) p. 775</ref> Libertarian socialists typically oppose rigid and stratified structures of authority, be they [[political power|political]], [[economic power|economic]], or social.<ref>Ed, Andrew. 'Closing the Iron Cage: The Scientific Management of Work and Leisure' Black Rose Books (1999) p. 116</ref>\n\nIn lieu of corporations and states, libertarian socialists seek to organize society into voluntary associations (usually [[collective]]s, [[intentional community|communes]], [[Municipality|municipalities]], [[cooperative]]s, [[commons]], or [[Syndicalism|syndicates]]) that use direct democracy or [[consensus]] for their decision-making process. Some libertarian socialists advocate combining these institutions using rotating, recallable [[Wiktionary:Delegate|delegates]] to higher-level federations.<ref>Bookchin, Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F06arcQyYEgC&printsec=frontcover ''Social Anarchism Or Lifestyle Anarchism''], AK Press (1995), pp. 71\u201372, {{ISBN|1-873176-83-X}}</ref> [[Spanish anarchism]] is a major example of such federations in practice.\n\nContemporary examples of libertarian socialist organizational and decision-making models in practice include a number of anti-capitalist and global justice movements<ref>Purkis, Jon. Bowen, James. 'Changing Anarchism' Manchester University Press (2004) pp. 165, 179</ref> including [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Councils of Good Government]] and the global [[Indymedia]] network (which covers 45 countries on six continents). There are also many examples of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies around the world whose political and economic systems can be accurately described as anarchist or libertarian socialist, each of which is uniquely suited to the culture that birthed it.<ref>Graeber, David. \"Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology\" Prickly Paradigm Press (2004) pp. 22\u201323, 26\u201329</ref> For libertarians, that diversity of practice within a framework of common principles is proof of the vitality of those principles and of their flexibility and strength.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, libertarian socialism has not traditionally been a [[utopia]]n movement, tending to avoid dense theoretical analysis or prediction of what a future society would or should look like. The tradition instead has been that such decisions cannot be made now and must be made through struggle and experimentation, so that the best solution can be arrived at democratically and organically; and to base the direction for struggle on established historical example. They point out that the success of the [[scientific method]] comes from its adherence to open rational exploration, not its conclusions, in sharp contrast to [[dogma]] and predetermined predictions. Noted anarchist [[Rudolf Rocker]] once stated: \"I am an anarchist not because I believe anarchism is the final goal, but because there is no such thing as a final goal\".<ref>''The London Years'', 1956</ref>\n\nBecause libertarian socialism encourages exploration and embraces a diversity of ideas rather than forming a compact movement, there have arisen inevitable controversies over individuals who describe themselves as libertarian socialists yet disagree with some of the core principles of libertarian socialism. For example, [[Peter Hain]] interprets libertarian socialism as minarchist rather than anarchist, favoring radical decentralization of power without going as far as the complete abolition of the state<ref>Hain, Peter \"Rediscovering our Libertarian Roots\" Chartist (August 2000)</ref> and libertarian socialist Noam Chomsky supports dismantling all forms of unjustified social or economic power while also emphasizing that state intervention should be supported as a temporary protection while oppressive structures remain in existence.\n\nProponents are known for opposing the existence of states or government and refusing to participate in coercive state institutions. In the past, many refused to swear oaths in court or to participate in trials, even when they faced imprisonment<ref>Bookchin, Murray.

Nevertheless, Left communists have often continued to organize themselves into party-like structures that undertake agitation, propaganda, education and other forms of political intervention. This is a vexed issue across Left communism and has resulted in a number of significant variations \u2013 from the absolute rejection of separate parties in favour of mere study or [[affinity groups]], to the critique of the naivety of pure spontaneism and an insistence on the necessary, though often modest, role of disciplined, self-critical and popularly connected communist organizations\".<ref>Chamsy el- Ojeili.

The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed in part from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others.

While libertarian socialism has roots in both socialism and liberalism, different forms have different levels of influence from the two traditions. For instance, [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] anarchism is more influenced by liberalism while communist and syndicalist anarchism are more influenced by socialism. However, mutualist anarchism has its origins in 18th- and 19th-century European socialism (such as Fourierian socialism)<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What is Mutualism?''.</ref><ref>\"[[Ricardian socialism]]\".

As such: \"The consequences of the growth of parliamentary action, ministerialism, and party life, charged the anarchists, would be de-radicalism and embourgeoisiement. Further, state politics would subvert both true individuality and true community. In response, many anarchists refused Marxist-type organisation, seeking to dissolve or undermine power and hierarchy by way of loose political-cultural groupings, or by championing organisation by a single, simultaneously economic and political administrative unit (Ruhle, [[syndicalism]]). The power of the intellectual and of science were also rejected by many anarchists: \"In conquering the state, in exalting the role of parties, they [intellectuals] reinforce the hierarchical principle embodied in political and administrative institutions\". Revolutions could only come through force of circumstances and/or the inherently rebellious instincts of the masses (the \"instinct for freedom\") (Bakunin, Chomsky), or in Bakunin's words: \"All that individuals can do is to clarify, propagate, and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\">{{cite journal |last=Ojeili |first=Chamsy |date= November 2001|title= The \"Advance Without Authority\": Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism, and Intellectuals |url=http://www.democracynature.org/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm |journal=Democracy & Nature |volume=7 |issue= 3|doi= 10.1080/10855660120092294|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages= 391\u2013413|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Marxism ====\n{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}\n{{see also|Anarchism and Marxism}}\n[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], early English [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]]]]\nMarxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. Chamsy Ojeili said: \"One does find early expressions of such perspectives in [[William Morris|[William] Morris]] and the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> Morris established the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] in December 1884, which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and [[Eleanor Marx]]. As the leading figure in the organization, Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League.<ref name=\"Beer, p. 256\">Beer, ''A History of British Socialism,'' vol. 2, p. 256.</ref> The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887, marked the change with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring: \"This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it\".<ref>''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48.'' New York: International Publishers, 2001; p. 538, fn. 95.</ref> Morris played peacemaker, but he sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner [[Edward Aveling]] to form the separate [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)#Anarchist control|Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].\n\n[[File:Zetkin luxemburg1910.jpg|thumb|left|[[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]\nHowever, \"the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers' councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses\". For these socialists, \"[t]he intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius\". [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period\u2014[[Antonie Pannekoek]], Roland Holst and [[Herman Gorter]] in the Netherlands, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci]] in Italy and [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was to be the dictatorship of a class, \"not of a party or of a clique\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> However, within this line of thought \"[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity. [...] The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and Lukacs. [...] The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/>\n\nIn the emerging [[Soviet Union]], there appeared [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolsheviks]] led or supported by left-wing groups including [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],<ref name=\"carr1985\">Carr, E.H. \u2013 The Bolshevik Revolution 1917\u20131923.

[[Blackwell Publishing]]</ref> Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force. ''[[\"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' is a work by [[Vladimir Lenin]] himself attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left.\n\nFor many Marxian libertarian socialists, \"the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigism|Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return \"behind Marx\" to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy. [...] [[Karl Korsch]] [...] remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of  practice in a theory's truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx's Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/>\n\nIn rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian Marxists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist [[representative democracy]] and to authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as [[autonomist Marxism]] and council communism have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time\u2014as in the [[Spanish Civil War]]\u2014though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and Leninist Marxists and their derivatives such as [[Maoism|Maoists]] on the other. In recent history, libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] groups for the purposes of protest against institutions they both reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the First International, a congress of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] workers, where Mikhail Bakunin, who was fairly representative of anarchist views; and [[Karl Marx]], whom anarchists accused of being an \"authoritarian\", came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of [[electoral politics]] was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call \"authoritarian communists\", or alternatively just \"authoritarians\". Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble [[syndicalism]] and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the council communism of Marxist [[Anton Pannekoek]]. In Chomsky's ''[[Notes on Anarchism]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|date=1970|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0-85345-128-1|chapter-url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|editor1-last=Gu\u00e9rin |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link= Daniel Gu\u00e9rin|accessdate=22 May 2014|chapter=Notes on Anarchism}}</ref> he suggests the possibility \"that some form of council communism is the natural form of [[revolutionary socialism]] in an [[industrialization|industrial]] society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a '[[Vanguard party|vanguard' party]], or a State bureaucracy\".\n\nIn the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with [[Trotskyism]] which presented itself as Leninist anti-Stalinism. As such, the French group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] emerged from the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu\u2013Montal tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\",<ref>{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 133</ref> leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German \"left\" of the 1920s\".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 134</ref> Also in the United Kingdom, the group [[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]]. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The intellectual leader of the group was [[Chris Pallis]], who wrote under the name Maurice Brinton.<ref>[[Chris Pallis|Brinton, Maurice]] (Goodway, David ed).

The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term \"ultra-left\" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further left than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as ultra-left the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. The term ultra-left refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and peasants<ref>Peasant (\u519c\u6c11) was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s.

Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however socialists a given bureaucrat's thought might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary ideas and habits among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to \"turn over a new leaf\" after they had undergone \"[[Mind control|thought reform]]\", the ultra-left argued that cultural revolution had to give way to political revolution \"in which one class overthrows another class\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm \"Whither China?\"] by Yang Xiguang.</ref><ref>The 70s Collective, ed. 1996.

Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul.

The most interesting of these, those that are relevant to my current purpose, have been those which insisted on the primacy of the self-activity and creativity of people in struggle against capitalism. Within the space of these tendencies there has developed a coherent critique of \"orthodox Marxism\" that includes not only a rejection of the concept of \"the transition\" but a reconceptualization of the process of transcending capitalism that has remarkable similarities to Kropotkin's thinking on this subject. ... Thus one of the earliest political tendencies within which this approach appeared after the Russian revolution of 1917 was that of \"[[Council Communism]]\" which saw the \"workers councils\" in Germany (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]), or the [[soviets]] in Russia, as new organizational forms constructed by the people. As with the anarchists, they too saw the Bolshevik take-over of the soviets (like that of the trade unions) as subverting the revolution and beginning the restoration of domination and exploitation. ... Over the years this emphasis on working class autonomy has resulted in a reinterpretation of Marxist theory that has brought out the two-sided character of the class struggle and shifted the focus from capital (the preoccupation of orthodox Marxism) to the workers. ... As a result, not only has there been a recognition that capitalism seeks to subordinate everyone's life (from the traditional factory proletariat to peasants, housewives and students) but that all those peoples' struggles involve both the resistance to this subordination and the effort to construct alternative ways of being.\"[[Harry Cleaver|Cleaver, Harry]].

Retrieved on 2011-12-28.</ref> Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchism|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Anton Pannekoek, [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[CLR James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].\n\n==== De Leonism ====\n{{main|De Leonism}}\nDe Leonism is a form of [[syndicalist]] Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]]. De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[industrial unions]] (specialized trade unions) are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. \n\nIndustrial unions serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in anarcho-syndicalism is that according to De Leonist thinking a revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the SLP whereas Leninism and its [[vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]''\n\nThe highly [[decentralized]] and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of Marxism\u2013Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other [[communist state]]s. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution.\n\n==== Council communism ====\n{{main|Council Communism}}\n<!-- [[File:Antonie Pannekoek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonie Pannekoek, one of the main theorists of council communism]] -->\nCouncil communism is a radical left-wing movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within Marxism and also within libertarian socialism. In contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist communism, the central argument of council communism is that [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of [[working class]] organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the reformist and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] stress on [[Vanguardism|vanguard parties]], parliaments, or the state. The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]], composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run bureaucratic socialism. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party [[dictatorship]]. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.\n\nThe Russian term for council is [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] and during the early years of the revolution worker's councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of workplace power that the word became used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] for various political organs. The name [[Supreme Soviet]], by which the parliament was called; and that of the Soviet Union itself make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any decentralization. Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the Bolshevik revolution in Russia became a \"[[bourgeois]] revolution\" when a party bureaucracy replaced the old [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]]. Although most felt the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] was working class in character, they believed that since capitalist relations still existed (because the workers had no say in running the economy), the Soviet Union ended up as a [[state capitalist]] country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Council communists support workers' revolutions, but they oppose one-party dictatorships. Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of [[agitprop|agitation]] and [[propaganda]], rejected all participation in elections or parliament and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions and form one big revolutionary union.\n\n==== Left communism ====\n{{main|Left communism}}\n{{left communism sidebar|expanded=related}}\nLeft communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress. Left communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as the \"left of capital\", not socialists), anarchists (some of whom they consider [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist socialists]]) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example, [[De Leonism|De Leonists]], who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances). Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, [[Herman Gorter]], Anton Pannekoek, [[Otto R\u00fchle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].\n\nProminent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Current]] and the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party. Different factions from the old Bordigist [[International Communist Party]] are also considered left communist organizations.\n\n==== Johnson\u2013Forest tendency ====\n{{main|Johnson\u2013Forest tendency}}\nThe Johnson\u2013Forest tendency is a radical left tendency in the United States associated with Marxist theorists [[C. L. R. James|C.L.R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], who used the pseudonyms J. R. Johnson and Freddie Forest respectively. They were joined by [[Grace Lee Boggs]], a Chinese American woman who was considered the third founder. After leaving the Trotskyist [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Johnson\u2013Forest founded their own organization for the first time, called Correspondence. This group changed its name to the [[Correspondence Publishing Committee]] the next year.  However, tensions that had surfaced earlier presaged a split, which took place in 1955. Through his theoretical and political work of the late 1940s, James had concluded that a vanguard party was no longer necessary because its teachings had been absorbed in the masses. In 1956, James would see the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] as confirmation of this. Those who endorsed the politics of James took the name [[Facing Reality]] after the 1958 book by James co-written with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu (a pseudonym for [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) on the Hungarian working class revolt of 1956.\n\n==== Socialisme ou Barbarie ====\n{{main|Socialisme ou Barbarie}}\n[[File:Cornelius Castoriadis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cornelius Castoriadis]], libertarian socialist theorist]]\nSocialisme ou Barbarie (Socialism or Barbarism) was a French-based radical libertarian socialist group of the post-[[World War II]] period (the name comes from a phrase Friedrich Engels used and was cited by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in the 1916 essay ''The Junius Pamphlet'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg: The Junius Pamphlet (Chap.1) |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2013-07-12}}</ref> It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dick Howard | title=Introduction to Castoriadis | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=118}}</ref> Because he explicitly both rejected Leninist vanguardism and criticised spontaneism, for Castoriadis \"the emancipation of the mass of people was the task of those people; however, the socialist thinker could not simply fold his or her arms\". Castoriadis argued that the special place accorded to the intellectual should belong to each autonomous citizen. However, he rejected ''attentisme'', maintaining that in the struggle for a new society intellectuals needed to \"place themselves at a distance from the everyday and from the real\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> Political philosopher [[Claude Lefort]] was impressed by Cornelius Castoriadis when he first met him. They published ''On the Regime and Against the Defence of the USSR'', a critique of both the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] supporters. They suggested that the Soviet Union was dominated by a social layer of bureaucrats and that it consisted of a new kind of society as aggressive as Western European societies. Later, he also published in ''Socialisme ou Barbarie''.\n\n==== Situationist International ====\n{{main|Situationist International}}\n{{Situationists|related}}\nThe Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957 and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]]. With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order, for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose, they suggested and experimented with the \"construction of situations\", namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. In this vein, a major theorectical work which emerged from this group was [[Raoul Vaneigem]]'s ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]''.<ref>[[Raoul Vaneigem]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/raoul-vaneigem-the-revolution-of-everyday-life ''The Revolution of Everyday Life''].</ref>\n\nThey fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their critical theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with direct democracy through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.\n\nAfter publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,<ref name=\"SI12BeginningOfAnEra\">''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969</ref> the Situationist International was dissolved in 1972.<ref>{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=1 June 2001 | accessdate=23 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509104610/http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | archive-date=9 May 2008 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Negri, main theorist of Italian [[autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism is a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency|Johnson\u2013Forest tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi]].\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory which draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working and socialization in the workplace.\n\nAll this influenced the German and Dutch autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]] and today is influential in Italy, France and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The autonomist Marxist and autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English-speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as autonomists. The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]]. Today, it is associated also with the publication ''[[Multitudes]]''.<ref>[http://multitudes.samizdat.net/ Webpage of ''[[Multitudes]]'']</ref>\n\n=== Other ===\nThis section is dedicated to post-classical anarchist tendencies as well as tendencies which cannot be easily classified within the anarchist/Marxist division presented before.\n\n==== Within the labour movement and parliamentary politics ====\n{{main|Libertarian possibilism}}\n[[File:Pi y margal 1869.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Francesc Pi i Margall]], Catalan follower and translator of Proudhon and libertarian socialist theorist who briefly became [[President of Spain]]]]\n[[File:Salvador Segui (CNT).JPG|thumb|[[Salvador Segu\u00ed]], Catalan libertarian socialist within the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]]]\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon ran for the French [[constituent assembly]] in April 1848, but he was not elected although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan\u00e7on and Lille.

Such an analysis follows Marx's theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. Within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods.

D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].\n\nGuild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of [[artisan|craftsmen]] and other skilled workers which had existed in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]]. In 1906, [[Arthur Penty]] published ''Restoration of the Gild System'' in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal ''[[The New Age]]'' became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty. The guild socialists \"stood for state ownership of industry, combined with \"workers' control\" through delegation of authority to national guilds organized internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers' guilds, consumers' organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures\".<ref name=\"britannica.com Guild Socialism\"/>\n\nIn 1914, [[Samuel George Hobson]], a leading contributor to ''The New Age'', published ''National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out''. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state-control of industry or conventional trade union activity. Unlike the existing trade unions, guilds would not confine their demands to matters of wages and conditions, but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society. The theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild socialism, including ''Self-Government in Industry'' (1917) and ''Guild Socialism Restated'' (1920). For scholar Charles Masquerade, \"[i]t is by meeting such a twofold requirement that the libertarian socialism of G.D.H. Cole could be said to offer timely and sustainable avenues for the institutionalization of the liberal value of autonomy...By setting out to 'destroy this predominance of economic factors' (Cole 1980, 180) through the re-organization of key spheres of life into forms of associative action and coordination capable of giving the 'fullest development of functional organisation'...Cole effectively sought to turn political representation into a system actually capable of giving direct recognition to the multiplicity of interests making up highly complex and differentiated societies\".<ref>Charles Masquelier.

It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]. [[Gandhian economics]] are the socio-economic principles expounded by Gandhi. It is largely characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent humanistic socialism, but with a rejection of violent [[class conflict|class war]] and promotion of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of [[materialism]]. The term Gandhian economics was coined by [[J. C.

In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish ''A Letter to a Hindu'' in Gujarati.

It comprises two related economic and political systems called [[participatory economics]] or \"parecon\" and [[participatory politics]] or \"parpolity\".\n\nParecon is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]], among others. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\" and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers. It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice and participatory planning. Under parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable \"credit\" which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.\n\nParpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany parecon. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and capitalism arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem, parpolity suggests a system of \"Nested Councils\", which would include every adult member of a given society. Under [[participism]], the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates which would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.\n\n==== Inclusive Democracy ====\n{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}\n[[File:Takis_Fotopoulos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Takis Fotopoulos]]]]\nInclusive Democracy is a political theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm) and [[ecological democracy]]. As distinguished from the political project which is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions, the theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] freely available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.\n\nAccording to [[Arran Gare]], ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' \"offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism\".<ref>Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 \"Beyond Social Democracy?

It is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small [[affinity group]]-based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]] and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.\n\nContemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-communism<ref>[http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php \"Say you want an insurrection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013152611/http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php |date=2016-10-13 }} by [[Crimethinc]]</ref> and [[illegalism]].

Since 1994, the group has been in a declared war \"against the Mexican state\", though this war has been primarily [[nonviolent]] and defensive against [[Military of Mexico|military]], [[paramilitary]] and [[Corporation|corporate]] incursions into Chiapas. Their social base is mostly rural [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]], but they have some supporters in urban areas and internationally. Their former spokesperson was [[Subcomandante Marcos]] (also known as Delegate Zero in relation to [[The Other Campaign]]). Unlike other Zapatist spokespeople, Marcos is not an indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. Since December 1994, the Zapatistas had been gradually forming several autonomous municipalities, called Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities (MAREZ). In these municipalities, an assembly of local representatives forms the ''Juntas de Buen Gobierno'' or [[Councils of Good Government]] (JBGs). These are not recognized by the federal or state governments and they oversee local community programs on food, health and education as well as taxation. The EZLN political formations have happened in two phases generally called ''Aquascalientes'' and ''Caracoles''.\n\nThe group takes its name from [[Emiliano Zapata]] (the agrarian reformer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |title=Zapata, Emiliano, 1879\u20131919 |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=11 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227033647/http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |archive-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and commander of the [[Liberation Army of the South]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]]) and sees itself as his ideological heir. ''Zapatista'' originally referred to a member of the revolutionary [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement founded about 1910 by Zapata. His Liberation Army of the South (''Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador del Sur'') fought during the Mexican Revolution for the [[Land reform|redistribution of agricultural land]]. Zapata and his army and allies, including [[Pancho Villa]], fought for agrarian reform in Mexico. Specifically, they wanted to establish [[communal]] [[land rights]] for Mexico's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population, which had mostly lost its land to the wealthy elite of European descent. Zapata was partly influenced by an anarchist from [[Oaxaca]] named [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]]. The influence of Flores Mag\u00f3n on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatist' [[Plan de Ayala]], but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata) ''Tierra y libertad'' or \"Land and liberty\", the title and maxim of Flores Mag\u00f3n's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via a local schoolteacher, Otilio Monta\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez\u2014later a general in Zapata's army, executed on 17 May 1917\u2014who exposed Zapata to the works of Peter Kropotkin and Flores Mag\u00f3n at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.\n\nIn reference to inspirational figures, in nearly all EZLN villages exist murals accompanying images of Zapata, [[Che Guevara]] and Subcomandante Marcos.<ref>Baspineiro, Alex Contreras (7 May 2004).

The 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' thus states: \"insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself\".<ref>[http://libcom.org/library/world-without-money-les-amis-de-4-millions-de-jeunes-travailleurs \"A World Without Money\"] by Les amis de 4 millions de jeunes travailleurs. (Quoted passage not included in this English extract.)</ref> The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauv\u00e9]] and ''Th\u00e9orie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency. In collaboration with other left communists such as Fran\u00e7ois Martin and Karl Nesic, Dauv\u00e9 has attempted to fuse, critique and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with Amadeo Bordiga (and its heretical journal ''[[Invariance (magazine)|Invariance]]''), German Dutch council communism and the French perspectives associated with [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] and the [[Situationist International]].<ref>\"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left.\"[http://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise Re-collecting our past \u2013 La Banquise]</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, a close yet not identical sense of communization was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with the revolution, considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities\u2014from squatting and setting up communes to simply sharing\u2014that would typically be understood as pre-revolutionary.<ref>\"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge.

It advocates a worker-oriented system of production and organization in the workplace that in some aspects radically departs from [[neoclassical economics]] in favor of democratic [[cooperative]]s or [[common ownership]] of the means of production ([[socialism]]).{{sfn|Brooks|1994|p=74}} They propose that this economic system be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the [[liberty]] of individuals and minimize [[Elite|concentration of power]] or authority ([[libertarianism]]). Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property and enterprise (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relation as a form of domination that is antagonistic to individual freedom.<ref>Paul, Ellen Frankel et al.

According to Hahnel, \"libertarian socialism was as powerful a force as [[social democracy]] and [[communism]]\" in the early 20th century. The [[Anarchist St. Imier International]], referred by Hahnel as the Libertarian International, was founded at the 1872 [[Congress of St. Imier]] a few days after the split between Marxist and libertarians at [[Hague Congress (1872)|The Hague Congress]] of the [[First International]], referred by Hahnel as the Socialist International. This Libertarian International \"competed successfully against social democrats and communists alike for the loyalty of anticapitalist activists, revolutionaries, workers, unions and political parties for over fifty years\". For Hahnel, libertarian socialists \"played a major role in the Russian revolutions of [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917]]. Libertarian socialists played a dominant role in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1911.

Libertarian socialism aims to distribute power more widely among members of society. Libertarian socialism and right-libertarian ideologies such as [[neoliberalism]] differ in that advocates of the former generally believe that one's degree of freedom is affected by one's economic and social status whereas advocates of the latter believe in the freedom of choice within a capitalist framework, specifically under capitalist private property.<ref>Vrousalis (2011) p. 212</ref> This is sometimes characterized as a desire to maximize free creativity in a society in preference to free enterprise.<ref>Chomsky (2003) pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nWithin anarchism, there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.</ref> where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.<ref>{{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |dictionary= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |dictionary= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref> It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person.

Most libertarian socialists believe that when power is exercised as exemplified by the economic, social, or physical dominance of one individual over another, the burden of proof is always on the authoritarian to justify their action as legitimate when taken against its effect of narrowing the scope of human freedom.<ref>Chomsky (2004) p. 775</ref> Libertarian socialists typically oppose rigid and stratified structures of authority, be they [[political power|political]], [[economic power|economic]], or social.<ref>Ed, Andrew. 'Closing the Iron Cage: The Scientific Management of Work and Leisure' Black Rose Books (1999) p. 116</ref>\n\nIn lieu of corporations and states, libertarian socialists seek to organize society into voluntary associations (usually [[collective]]s, [[intentional community|communes]], [[Municipality|municipalities]], [[cooperative]]s, [[commons]], or [[Syndicalism|syndicates]]) that use direct democracy or [[consensus]] for their decision-making process. Some libertarian socialists advocate combining these institutions using rotating, recallable [[Wiktionary:Delegate|delegates]] to higher-level federations.<ref>Bookchin, Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F06arcQyYEgC&printsec=frontcover ''Social Anarchism Or Lifestyle Anarchism''], AK Press (1995), pp. 71\u201372, {{ISBN|1-873176-83-X}}</ref> [[Spanish anarchism]] is a major example of such federations in practice.\n\nContemporary examples of libertarian socialist organizational and decision-making models in practice include a number of anti-capitalist and global justice movements<ref>Purkis, Jon. Bowen, James. 'Changing Anarchism' Manchester University Press (2004) pp. 165, 179</ref> including [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Councils of Good Government]] and the global [[Indymedia]] network (which covers 45 countries on six continents). There are also many examples of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies around the world whose political and economic systems can be accurately described as anarchist or libertarian socialist, each of which is uniquely suited to the culture that birthed it.<ref>Graeber, David. \"Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology\" Prickly Paradigm Press (2004) pp. 22\u201323, 26\u201329</ref> For libertarians, that diversity of practice within a framework of common principles is proof of the vitality of those principles and of their flexibility and strength.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, libertarian socialism has not traditionally been a [[utopia]]n movement, tending to avoid dense theoretical analysis or prediction of what a future society would or should look like. The tradition instead has been that such decisions cannot be made now and must be made through struggle and experimentation, so that the best solution can be arrived at democratically and organically; and to base the direction for struggle on established historical example. They point out that the success of the [[scientific method]] comes from its adherence to open rational exploration, not its conclusions, in sharp contrast to [[dogma]] and predetermined predictions. Noted anarchist [[Rudolf Rocker]] once stated: \"I am an anarchist not because I believe anarchism is the final goal, but because there is no such thing as a final goal\".<ref>''The London Years'', 1956</ref>\n\nBecause libertarian socialism encourages exploration and embraces a diversity of ideas rather than forming a compact movement, there have arisen inevitable controversies over individuals who describe themselves as libertarian socialists yet disagree with some of the core principles of libertarian socialism. For example, [[Peter Hain]] interprets libertarian socialism as minarchist rather than anarchist, favoring radical decentralization of power without going as far as the complete abolition of the state<ref>Hain, Peter \"Rediscovering our Libertarian Roots\" Chartist (August 2000)</ref> and libertarian socialist Noam Chomsky supports dismantling all forms of unjustified social or economic power while also emphasizing that state intervention should be supported as a temporary protection while oppressive structures remain in existence.\n\nProponents are known for opposing the existence of states or government and refusing to participate in coercive state institutions. In the past, many refused to swear oaths in court or to participate in trials, even when they faced imprisonment<ref>Bookchin, Murray.

Nevertheless, Left communists have often continued to organize themselves into party-like structures that undertake agitation, propaganda, education and other forms of political intervention. This is a vexed issue across Left communism and has resulted in a number of significant variations \u2013 from the absolute rejection of separate parties in favour of mere study or [[affinity groups]], to the critique of the naivety of pure spontaneism and an insistence on the necessary, though often modest, role of disciplined, self-critical and popularly connected communist organizations\".<ref>Chamsy el- Ojeili.

The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed in part from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others.

As such: \"The consequences of the growth of parliamentary action, ministerialism, and party life, charged the anarchists, would be de-radicalism and embourgeoisiement. Further, state politics would subvert both true individuality and true community. In response, many anarchists refused Marxist-type organisation, seeking to dissolve or undermine power and hierarchy by way of loose political-cultural groupings, or by championing organisation by a single, simultaneously economic and political administrative unit (Ruhle, [[syndicalism]]). The power of the intellectual and of science were also rejected by many anarchists: \"In conquering the state, in exalting the role of parties, they [intellectuals] reinforce the hierarchical principle embodied in political and administrative institutions\". Revolutions could only come through force of circumstances and/or the inherently rebellious instincts of the masses (the \"instinct for freedom\") (Bakunin, Chomsky), or in Bakunin's words: \"All that individuals can do is to clarify, propagate, and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\">{{cite journal |last=Ojeili |first=Chamsy |date= November 2001|title= The \"Advance Without Authority\": Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism, and Intellectuals |url=http://www.democracynature.org/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm |journal=Democracy & Nature |volume=7 |issue= 3|doi= 10.1080/10855660120092294|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages= 391\u2013413|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Marxism ====\n{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}\n{{see also|Anarchism and Marxism}}\n[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], early English [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]]]]\nMarxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. Chamsy Ojeili said: \"One does find early expressions of such perspectives in [[William Morris|[William] Morris]] and the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> Morris established the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] in December 1884, which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and [[Eleanor Marx]]. As the leading figure in the organization, Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League.<ref name=\"Beer, p. 256\">Beer, ''A History of British Socialism,'' vol. 2, p. 256.</ref> The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887, marked the change with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring: \"This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it\".<ref>''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48.'' New York: International Publishers, 2001; p. 538, fn. 95.</ref> Morris played peacemaker, but he sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner [[Edward Aveling]] to form the separate [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)#Anarchist control|Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].\n\n[[File:Zetkin luxemburg1910.jpg|thumb|left|[[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]\nHowever, \"the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers' councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses\". For these socialists, \"[t]he intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius\". [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period\u2014[[Antonie Pannekoek]], Roland Holst and [[Herman Gorter]] in the Netherlands, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci]] in Italy and [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was to be the dictatorship of a class, \"not of a party or of a clique\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> However, within this line of thought \"[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity. [...] The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and Lukacs. [...] The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/>\n\nIn the emerging [[Soviet Union]], there appeared [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolsheviks]] led or supported by left-wing groups including [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],<ref name=\"carr1985\">Carr, E.H. \u2013 The Bolshevik Revolution 1917\u20131923.

[[Blackwell Publishing]]</ref> Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force. ''[[\"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' is a work by [[Vladimir Lenin]] himself attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left.\n\nFor many Marxian libertarian socialists, \"the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigism|Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return \"behind Marx\" to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy. [...] [[Karl Korsch]] [...] remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of  practice in a theory's truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx's Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/>\n\nIn rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian Marxists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist [[representative democracy]] and to authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as [[autonomist Marxism]] and council communism have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time\u2014as in the [[Spanish Civil War]]\u2014though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and Leninist Marxists and their derivatives such as [[Maoism|Maoists]] on the other. In recent history, libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] groups for the purposes of protest against institutions they both reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the First International, a congress of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] workers, where Mikhail Bakunin, who was fairly representative of anarchist views; and [[Karl Marx]], whom anarchists accused of being an \"authoritarian\", came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of [[electoral politics]] was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call \"authoritarian communists\", or alternatively just \"authoritarians\". Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble [[syndicalism]] and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the council communism of Marxist [[Anton Pannekoek]]. In Chomsky's ''[[Notes on Anarchism]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|date=1970|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0-85345-128-1|chapter-url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|editor1-last=Gu\u00e9rin |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link= Daniel Gu\u00e9rin|accessdate=22 May 2014|chapter=Notes on Anarchism}}</ref> he suggests the possibility \"that some form of council communism is the natural form of [[revolutionary socialism]] in an [[industrialization|industrial]] society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a '[[Vanguard party|vanguard' party]], or a State bureaucracy\".\n\nIn the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with [[Trotskyism]] which presented itself as Leninist anti-Stalinism. As such, the French group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] emerged from the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu\u2013Montal tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\",<ref>{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 133</ref> leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German \"left\" of the 1920s\".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 134</ref> Also in the United Kingdom, the group [[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]]. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The intellectual leader of the group was [[Chris Pallis]], who wrote under the name Maurice Brinton.<ref>[[Chris Pallis|Brinton, Maurice]] (Goodway, David ed).

The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term \"ultra-left\" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further left than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as ultra-left the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. The term ultra-left refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and peasants<ref>Peasant (\u519c\u6c11) was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s. According to the ultra-left, both peasants and urban workers together composed a [[proletarian]] [[Social class|class]] divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution.</ref> conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however socialists a given bureaucrat's thought might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary ideas and habits among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to \"turn over a new leaf\" after they had undergone \"[[Mind control|thought reform]]\", the ultra-left argued that cultural revolution had to give way to political revolution \"in which one class overthrows another class\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm \"Whither China?\"] by Yang Xiguang.</ref><ref>The 70s Collective, ed. 1996.

Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul.

The most interesting of these, those that are relevant to my current purpose, have been those which insisted on the primacy of the self-activity and creativity of people in struggle against capitalism. Within the space of these tendencies there has developed a coherent critique of \"orthodox Marxism\" that includes not only a rejection of the concept of \"the transition\" but a reconceptualization of the process of transcending capitalism that has remarkable similarities to Kropotkin's thinking on this subject. ... Thus one of the earliest political tendencies within which this approach appeared after the Russian revolution of 1917 was that of \"[[Council Communism]]\" which saw the \"workers councils\" in Germany (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]), or the [[soviets]] in Russia, as new organizational forms constructed by the people. As with the anarchists, they too saw the Bolshevik take-over of the soviets (like that of the trade unions) as subverting the revolution and beginning the restoration of domination and exploitation. ... Over the years this emphasis on working class autonomy has resulted in a reinterpretation of Marxist theory that has brought out the two-sided character of the class struggle and shifted the focus from capital (the preoccupation of orthodox Marxism) to the workers. ... As a result, not only has there been a recognition that capitalism seeks to subordinate everyone's life (from the traditional factory proletariat to peasants, housewives and students) but that all those peoples' struggles involve both the resistance to this subordination and the effort to construct alternative ways of being.\"[[Harry Cleaver|Cleaver, Harry]].

Retrieved on 2011-12-28.</ref> Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchism|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Anton Pannekoek, [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[CLR James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].\n\n==== De Leonism ====\n{{main|De Leonism}}\nDe Leonism is a form of [[syndicalist]] Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]]. De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[industrial unions]] (specialized trade unions) are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. \n\nIndustrial unions serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in anarcho-syndicalism is that according to De Leonist thinking a revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the SLP whereas Leninism and its [[vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]''\n\nThe highly [[decentralized]] and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of Marxism\u2013Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other [[communist state]]s. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution.\n\n==== Council communism ====\n{{main|Council Communism}}\n<!-- [[File:Antonie Pannekoek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonie Pannekoek, one of the main theorists of council communism]] -->\nCouncil communism is a radical left-wing movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within Marxism and also within libertarian socialism. In contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist communism, the central argument of council communism is that [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of [[working class]] organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the reformist and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] stress on [[Vanguardism|vanguard parties]], parliaments, or the state. The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]], composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run bureaucratic socialism. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party [[dictatorship]]. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.\n\nThe Russian term for council is [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] and during the early years of the revolution worker's councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of workplace power that the word became used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] for various political organs. The name [[Supreme Soviet]], by which the parliament was called; and that of the Soviet Union itself make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any decentralization. Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the Bolshevik revolution in Russia became a \"[[bourgeois]] revolution\" when a party bureaucracy replaced the old [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]]. Although most felt the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] was working class in character, they believed that since capitalist relations still existed (because the workers had no say in running the economy), the Soviet Union ended up as a [[state capitalist]] country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Council communists support workers' revolutions, but they oppose one-party dictatorships. Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of [[agitprop|agitation]] and [[propaganda]], rejected all participation in elections or parliament and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions and form one big revolutionary union.\n\n==== Left communism ====\n{{main|Left communism}}\n{{left communism sidebar|expanded=related}}\nLeft communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress. Left communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as the \"left of capital\", not socialists), anarchists (some of whom they consider [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist socialists]]) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example, [[De Leonism|De Leonists]], who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances). Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, [[Herman Gorter]], Anton Pannekoek, [[Otto R\u00fchle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].\n\nProminent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Current]] and the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party. Different factions from the old Bordigist [[International Communist Party]] are also considered left communist organizations.\n\n==== Johnson\u2013Forest tendency ====\n{{main|Johnson\u2013Forest tendency}}\nThe Johnson\u2013Forest tendency is a radical left tendency in the United States associated with Marxist theorists [[C. L. R. James|C.L.R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], who used the pseudonyms J. R. Johnson and Freddie Forest respectively. They were joined by [[Grace Lee Boggs]], a Chinese American woman who was considered the third founder. After leaving the Trotskyist [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Johnson\u2013Forest founded their own organization for the first time, called Correspondence. This group changed its name to the [[Correspondence Publishing Committee]] the next year.  However, tensions that had surfaced earlier presaged a split, which took place in 1955. Through his theoretical and political work of the late 1940s, James had concluded that a vanguard party was no longer necessary because its teachings had been absorbed in the masses. In 1956, James would see the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] as confirmation of this. Those who endorsed the politics of James took the name [[Facing Reality]] after the 1958 book by James co-written with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu (a pseudonym for [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) on the Hungarian working class revolt of 1956.\n\n==== Socialisme ou Barbarie ====\n{{main|Socialisme ou Barbarie}}\n[[File:Cornelius Castoriadis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cornelius Castoriadis]], libertarian socialist theorist]]\nSocialisme ou Barbarie (Socialism or Barbarism) was a French-based radical libertarian socialist group of the post-[[World War II]] period (the name comes from a phrase Friedrich Engels used and was cited by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in the 1916 essay ''The Junius Pamphlet'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg: The Junius Pamphlet (Chap.1) |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2013-07-12}}</ref> It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dick Howard | title=Introduction to Castoriadis | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=118}}</ref> Because he explicitly both rejected Leninist vanguardism and criticised spontaneism, for Castoriadis \"the emancipation of the mass of people was the task of those people; however, the socialist thinker could not simply fold his or her arms\". Castoriadis argued that the special place accorded to the intellectual should belong to each autonomous citizen. However, he rejected ''attentisme'', maintaining that in the struggle for a new society intellectuals needed to \"place themselves at a distance from the everyday and from the real\".<ref name=\"Advance Without Authority\"/> Political philosopher [[Claude Lefort]] was impressed by Cornelius Castoriadis when he first met him. They published ''On the Regime and Against the Defence of the USSR'', a critique of both the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] supporters. They suggested that the Soviet Union was dominated by a social layer of bureaucrats and that it consisted of a new kind of society as aggressive as Western European societies. Later, he also published in ''Socialisme ou Barbarie''.\n\n==== Situationist International ====\n{{main|Situationist International}}\n{{Situationists|related}}\nThe Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957 and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]]. With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order, for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose, they suggested and experimented with the \"construction of situations\", namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. In this vein, a major theorectical work which emerged from this group was [[Raoul Vaneigem]]'s ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]''.<ref>[[Raoul Vaneigem]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/raoul-vaneigem-the-revolution-of-everyday-life ''The Revolution of Everyday Life''].</ref>\n\nThey fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their critical theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with direct democracy through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.\n\nAfter publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,<ref name=\"SI12BeginningOfAnEra\">''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969</ref> the Situationist International was dissolved in 1972.<ref>{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=1 June 2001 | accessdate=23 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509104610/http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | archive-date=9 May 2008 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Negri, main theorist of Italian [[autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism is a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency|Johnson\u2013Forest tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi]].\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory which draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working and socialization in the workplace.\n\nAll this influenced the German and Dutch autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]] and today is influential in Italy, France and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The autonomist Marxist and autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English-speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as autonomists. The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]]. Today, it is associated also with the publication ''[[Multitudes]]''.<ref>[http://multitudes.samizdat.net/ Webpage of ''[[Multitudes]]'']</ref>\n\n=== Other ===\nThis section is dedicated to post-classical anarchist tendencies as well as tendencies which cannot be easily classified within the anarchist/Marxist division presented before.\n\n==== Within the labour movement and parliamentary politics ====\n{{main|Libertarian possibilism}}\n[[File:Pi y margal 1869.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Francesc Pi i Margall]], Catalan follower and translator of Proudhon and libertarian socialist theorist who briefly became [[President of Spain]]]]\n[[File:Salvador Segui (CNT).JPG|thumb|[[Salvador Segu\u00ed]].]]\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon ran for the French [[constituent assembly]] in April 1848, but he was not elected although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan\u00e7on and Lille.

Such an analysis follows Marx's theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. Within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence are unrewarded while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.<ref name=Kovel/>\n\nGreen anarchism is a school of thought within anarchism which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]].<ref>David Pepper (1996).

D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].\n\nGuild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of [[artisan|craftsmen]] and other skilled workers which had existed in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]]. In 1906, [[Arthur Penty]] published ''Restoration of the Gild System'' in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal ''[[The New Age]]'' became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty. The guild socialists \"stood for state ownership of industry, combined with \"workers' control\" through delegation of authority to national guilds organized internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers' guilds, consumers' organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures\".<ref name=\"britannica.com Guild Socialism\"/>\n\nIn 1914, [[Samuel George Hobson]], a leading contributor to ''The New Age'', published ''National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out''. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state-control of industry or conventional trade union activity. Unlike the existing trade unions, guilds would not confine their demands to matters of wages and conditions, but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society. The theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D.

It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]. [[Gandhian economics]] are the socio-economic principles expounded by Gandhi. It is largely characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent humanistic socialism, but with a rejection of violent [[class conflict|class war]] and promotion of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of [[materialism]]. The term Gandhian economics was coined by [[J. C.

In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish ''A Letter to a Hindu'' in Gujarati.

It comprises two related economic and political systems called [[participatory economics]] or \"parecon\" and [[participatory politics]] or \"parpolity\".\n\nParecon is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]], among others. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as \"an anarchistic economic vision\" and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers. It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice and participatory planning. Under parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable \"credit\" which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.\n\nParpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany parecon. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and capitalism arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem, parpolity suggests a system of \"Nested Councils\", which would include every adult member of a given society. Under [[participism]], the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates which would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.\n\n==== Inclusive Democracy ====\n{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}\n[[File:Takis_Fotopoulos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Takis Fotopoulos]]]]\nInclusive Democracy is a political theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm) and [[ecological democracy]]. As distinguished from the political project which is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions, the theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] freely available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.\n\nAccording to [[Arran Gare]], ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' \"offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism\".<ref>Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 \"Beyond Social Democracy?

Since 1994, the group has been in a declared war \"against the Mexican state\", though this war has been primarily [[nonviolent]] and defensive against [[Military of Mexico|military]], [[paramilitary]] and [[Corporation|corporate]] incursions into Chiapas. Their social base is mostly rural [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]], but they have some supporters in urban areas and internationally. Their former spokesperson was [[Subcomandante Marcos]] (also known as Delegate Zero in relation to [[The Other Campaign]]). Unlike other Zapatist spokespeople, Marcos is not an indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. Since December 1994, the Zapatistas had been gradually forming several autonomous municipalities, called Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities (MAREZ). In these municipalities, an assembly of local representatives forms the ''Juntas de Buen Gobierno'' or [[Councils of Good Government]] (JBGs). These are not recognized by the federal or state governments and they oversee local community programs on food, health and education as well as taxation. The EZLN political formations have happened in two phases generally called ''Aquascalientes'' and ''Caracoles''.\n\nThe group takes its name from [[Emiliano Zapata]] (the agrarian reformer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |title=Zapata, Emiliano, 1879\u20131919 |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=11 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227033647/http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |archive-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and commander of the [[Liberation Army of the South]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]]) and sees itself as his ideological heir. ''Zapatista'' originally referred to a member of the revolutionary [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement founded about 1910 by Zapata. His Liberation Army of the South (''Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador del Sur'') fought during the Mexican Revolution for the [[Land reform|redistribution of agricultural land]]. Zapata and his army and allies, including [[Pancho Villa]], fought for agrarian reform in Mexico. Specifically, they wanted to establish [[communal]] [[land rights]] for Mexico's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population, which had mostly lost its land to the wealthy elite of European descent. Zapata was partly influenced by an anarchist from [[Oaxaca]] named [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]]. The influence of Flores Mag\u00f3n on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatist' [[Plan de Ayala]], but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata) ''Tierra y libertad'' or \"Land and liberty\", the title and maxim of Flores Mag\u00f3n's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via a local schoolteacher, Otilio Monta\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez\u2014later a general in Zapata's army, executed on 17 May 1917\u2014who exposed Zapata to the works of Peter Kropotkin and Flores Mag\u00f3n at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.\n\nIn reference to inspirational figures, in nearly all EZLN villages exist murals accompanying images of Zapata, [[Che Guevara]] and Subcomandante Marcos.<ref>Baspineiro, Alex Contreras (7 May 2004).

The 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' thus states: \"insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality.

In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with the revolution, considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities\u2014from squatting and setting up communes to simply sharing\u2014that would typically be understood as pre-revolutionary.<ref>\"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{Seealso|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''). <ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

The film plot involves Ilias ([[Andrea Occhipinti]]) a young man who  battles monsters and mutants on his journey to manhood. ''Conquest'' was reviewed by both [[AllMovie]] and the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', who noted the films low budget and derivative nature, while finding the film to be surprisingly entertaining despite its negative aspects.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn a mystical land, a handsome youth named Ilias (Andrea Occhipinti) embarks on a quest, leaving behind his family in his paradise home for a fog-shrouded wilderness. From his father he receives a magic bow to mark his passage into manhood. He enters a strange land where small tribes are terrorized by werewolf-like creatures, acting under orders of Ocron (Sabrina Siani), a nude masked female of great evil. While in a drugged state, Ocron sees a faceless youth with a magic bow who dares to attack her. Ocron sends her werewolf servants out to look for the youth.\n\nA little later, a gang of Ocron's marauders try to steal the bow and capture Ilias. But they are foiled when a rugged man dressed in animal skins leaps to his rescue, beating up the marauders and forcing them to flee. The man introduces himself as Mace (Jorge Rivero), a nomadic outlaw. After admiring the younger man's magic bow, Mace teams up with him on his quest to rid the land of evil. He affects a dismissal of human affairs, but soon the two are fast friends. Mace reveals that he has contempt for people, but cares for animals and has a bond with many species.\n\nNext, Ocron sends Fado, the leader of her brutal werewolves, to capture Ilias and the magic bow. Ilias and Mace stop for the night to rest and eat with a small tribe that live in caves, and offering the people a fresh animal kill as a gift. Ilias recognizes a young girl of the tribe seen earlier in the journey, and the two of them go off together. Suddenly, masked attackers kill the girl and abduct Ilias, stealing his bow. Mace tracks them down to a camp and in a long and bloody fight, rescues his young friend.\n\nBack at Ocron's lair, Fado is burned on a giant hot-plate as punishment for his failure to capture the magic bow. Ocron summons the Great Zora (Conrado San Martin), a spirit who resides in the body of a white wolf. She offers herself, body and soul, to Zora if he can kill Ilias.\n\nHaving found out the identity of the person responsible for all this, Ilias declares that he will punish Ocron for her evil crimes over the land and exhorts Mace to join him. Mace refuses, saying that he and Ocron stay clear of each other for she is too powerful to combat. Mace agrees to escort Ilias as far as the seashore, from where he must sail to Ocron's fortress. On the way, the two of them are assailed by hundreds of tiny arrows. Ilias is hit in the arm with one arrow, and soon breaks out in hideous boils. Mace sails with him along the coast to a place where a special plant grows that will cure his affliction from the [[poisoned arrow]]. Leaving his friend on the boat, Mace jumps ashore and soon does battle with grotesque zombies, and afterwards, does battle with a double of himself. Mace wins the fight and his double is revealed as Zora, who disappears after reverting to his humanoid form.\n\nThe special plant works and Ilias is restored to health. But Ilias has become disenchanted and decides to sail for home, pleading with Mace go with him. Mace refuses and also refuses to take ownership of the magic bow. No sooner they have parted when Mace is attacked by a band of strange, cobweb-covered creatures. They tie him to a wooden cross and interrogate him about the whereabouts of Ilias. Mace refuses to cooperate. Ilias appears and saves Mace from the creatures with his magic bow and arrows. But the captive Mace falls off a cliff and into the sea during the rescue. Super-intelligent dolphins bite at the ropes that tie Mace to the cross and he is washed ashore, barely conscious. Ilias arrives and tells Mace that he has had a change of heart and decided to return to be with his friend and defeat Orcon.\n\nThat night, Ilias is grabbed and sucked down into a lair inhabited by subterranean monsters. When Mace follows, he is forced to battle a few of them while chasing after Ilias. Venturing further into the caves, Mace finds Ilias, hanging upside down with his head cut off. Zora delivers the severed head of Ilias to Ocron as well as the magic bow. Mace lights a funeral pyre for his dead friend. Ilias' spirit speaks to Mace inside his mind and tells him to anoint himself with the ashes. This will pass along the power Cronos gave to Ilias and the magic bow will be Mace's.\n\nThe next morning, Mace confronts Ocron in her lair and the bow suddenly flies out of her hands, and into his. He takes on all of Ocron's surviving werewolves, shooting them with his magic arrows from the bow. Mace fires a magic arrow at Ocron which penetrates her mask, revealing the hideously ugly face of a ghoul atop her smooth, nubile body. As Ocron dies, her dead body transforms into a wolf, which runs off into the wilderness with the white wolf Zora. The final scene has Mace, alone once again, walking into the wilderness to continue Ilias's quest to rid the land of evil.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Andrea Occhipinti]] as Ilias\n*[[Jorge Rivero]] as Mace\n*[[Conrado San Mart\u00edn]] as Zora\n*[[Sabrina Siani]] as Ocron\n* Jos\u00e9 Gras Palau as Fado\n*[[Violeta Cela]] as a sacrificial victim\n* Gioia Maria Scola{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=279}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's original Italian shooting title was ''Mace, il fuorilegge'' ({{translation|Mace, the Outlaw}}).{{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=279}} The film was an Italian-Spanish-Mexican co-production filmed in Mexico{{sfn|Paul|2005|p=?}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}, [[Sardinia]] and Rome, Italy{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=?}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nFulci had signed a two-picture contract with the producer, Giovanni Di Clemente, but after the two had some disagreements during the making of ''Conquest'', Fulci left immediately after shooting the film and refused to complete the contract.
