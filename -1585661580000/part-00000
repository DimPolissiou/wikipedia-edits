{"title_page": "Longboard (skateboard)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Man riding a longboard.jpg|thumb|right|Longboarder cruising]]\nA '''longboard''' is a type of [[sports equipment]] similar to, but not the same as, a [[skateboard]]. It is often longer than a skateboard and has a wide variety of shapes. It tends to be  faster because of wheel size, construction materials and more precise hardware. Longboards are commonly used for cruising, travelling and downhill racing, known as [[longboarding]], rather than [[skateboarding]]. Longboard 'dancing' and 'freestyle' are also becoming more popular styles, in which the rider utilises skateboard-like motions and steps up and down the board, generally in a fluid manner.\n\n== History ==\nThe first longboards were made by Preston Nichols in the 1940s and 50s as an alternative to surfing when the waves were too dull. Early skaters built dangerous, improvised boards out of planks of wood and roller skates in a practice known as Sidewalk Surfing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/351382-the-history-of-longboarding/|title=The History of Longboarding|last=Tadlock|first=Lindsay|work=LIVESTRONG.COM|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}</ref> Manufactured longboards first became commercially available in 1959 when Makaha, Jack's, and Hobie became the first professional longboard distributors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://longboardskateboard.org/history-of-longboarding.php|title=History of Longboarding|website=longboardskateboard.org|access-date=2017-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429224819/http://longboardskateboard.org/history-of-longboarding.php|archive-date=2017-04-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> These early longboards were still relatively crude, as they still featured metal wheels, but later had clay wheels due to improved safety factors. Longboarding became a popular activity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its popularity had largely died by 1965. Longboarding made a comeback in 1972 when [[Frank Nasworthy]] and the Cadillac Wheel Company introduced the urethane longboard wheel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skateboardingmagazine.com/the-evolution-of-skateboarding-a-history-from-sidewalk-surfing-to-superstardom/|title=The Evolution Of Skateboarding \u2013 A History From Sidewalk Surfing To Superstardom|last=Tony|first=Owen|date=2013-03-05|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}</ref> Urethane wheels allowed skaters to reach very high downhill speeds which were not possible before. Standard vertical kingpin skate trucks at the time could not maintain stability at these speeds. In the 1990s, [[Sector 9]] developed the reverse kingpin skate truck. The reverse kingpin trucks' improved stability and suppleness helped downhill longboarding grow into a legitimate sport, with the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) as its governing body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/sport/more/skateboarding-longboard.htm|title=About Longboarding|website=www.topendsports.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> The 90's also saw the introduction of the cutout deck, which has sections cut out around the wheels to prevent the wheels from touching the board during hard turns. Longboard technology has evolved rapidly to accommodate unique modern skating disciplines including downhill, slalom, freeriding, dancing, and freestyle. Modern longboard decks can be made from a variety of materials including fiberglass composites, aluminum, and carbon fiber. Precision trucks, which are machined with cutting edge CNC technology instead of die casting with molds, offer more strength and maneuverability than cast trucks and have achieved popularity among professional skaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://longboardguide.wordpress.com/choosingaboard/choosing-trucks/|title=Choosing Trucks|date=2012-10-26|work=Longboarding|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}{{better source|date=June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Dimensions==\n\nMost boards measure {{convert|84|to|150|cm|in|sp=us}} in length while widths vary from {{convert|22.8|to|25.4|cm|in|abbr=on}}. There are several longboard shapes, such as pintails, swallowtails, flat-nose riders, drop-through decks, drop decks and boards with the same shape as a standard [[skateboard]]. Pintails permit looser [[Skateboard trucks|trucks]] and larger wheels which are better suited for carving or a \"smooth\" feel, whereas drop decks and drop throughs allow the rider to be closer to the ground, hence a lower center of gravity which increases stability and allows these boards to support more high speed downhill riding disciplines. Mid-length boards, {{convert|94|to|127|cm|in|abbr=on}} are the most versatile.

The longboard's design allows for big turns or quick short carves similar to the motions of surfers or snowboarders. Longboards have 3 axes: the tail axis (running from tail to tail), the central axis (running straight down through the center of the board), and the short axis (running from the width of the board and perpendicular to the tail axis).\n\n==Equipment & protection==\nThe \u2018helmet culture\u2019 is more prevalent in longboarding than in skateboarding.<ref name=\"Longboard equipment\">{{cite web|url=http://rideasf.com/longboard-gear/longboard-equipment-longboard-helmets-slide-gloves-pads/ |title=Longboard uquipment, helmets, slide gloves, pads |publisher=rideasf.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-31}}</ref> Most riders wear protective equipment in all disciplines, and nearly all professionals wear a helmet and gloves.

Additional protection includes: leathers, wrist guards, knee pads, elbow pads and sometimes spine protectors and padded shorts. Many professional longboarding teams and riders are required to wear and advocate all aspects of protection. In the sliding and downhill disciplines, riders wear \"slide gloves\" which are specialized gloves made out of a strong materials such as leather and synthetic fabrics, and have large discs called \"pucks\" attached to the palms. These are attached to protect the hands as the rider uses them to pivot during slides along the ground. The pucks are usually made of synthetic [[polymers]]: [[delrin]], [[ultra high molecular weight polyethylene|UHMW]], or [[corian]].\n\n==Components==\nLongboards are very similar to skateboards in terms of parts and general construction. Aside from the harder wheels of those made for sliding, they generally have larger dimensions, their trucks have tailored designs and proportions and their wheels are usually larger and softer. As a result, riding the specialized longboard feels quite different from the ubiquitous skateboard.\n\n===Decks===\n[[File:Gordon Smith Aloha Blue Pintail 44 inches Longboard.jpg|thumb|130px|A {{convert|44|in|cm|adj=on}} pintail shaped deck]]\n\nLongboard decks are typically made from plywood: anywhere from two to eleven layers, each of usually {{convert|2|mm|in|sp=us}} in thickness, composed of [[birch]], [[bamboo]], [[maple]], [[koa]], or [[oak wood]]. Longboards are commercially available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Each variety has certain advantages and disadvantages, which come into play depending on the technique or personal preferences of the rider.\n\nDecks intended for riding downhill are typically stiff and have a wheelbase of around 30\"-28\". Designers and manufacturers aim to make these boards as stiff and light as possible. The primary three designs of downhill boards are \"drop decks\", \"top mounts\" and \"drop throughs\". Each design has its own advantages.\n\nThe \"drop deck\" has a lowered foot platform that sits below the height of the trucks, as a result, there is a lower center of gravity which adds to stability but gives less traction and maneuverability. Wooden drop decks are concave and have foot pockets by the drops. However, some carbon fiber boards feature concavity by the drops instead of foot pockets giving more leverage while turning.\n\nThe \"drop through\" design has cutouts that allow the base-plate of the truck to protrude through the board, thus lowering the deck and providing more stability. In addition to this, drop through decks decrease grip, as the deck is closer to the axle and [[moment arm]] of the wheel. There is also less leverage on the truck, which makes turning negligibly more difficult.\n\n\"Top mount\" boards are the simplest design of the three. There are no dramatic bends aside from the foot concave. The board sits on top of the trucks as it would in a street skateboard. Advantages to this design include increased grip and ease of turning; disadvantages include a high center of gravity, which could contribute to a lack of stability.\n\nThere are many variations of the aforementioned designs, including a \"double-drop\" board, which incorporates both a drop through and drop down pattern. These are preferable for \"freeride\" as they are extremely low to the ground, which allows for ease of sliding. Footspace is important because there must be enough room on the board for the rider to form an aerodynamic \"tuck\". Downhill boards are made as stiff as possible to minimize the amount of energy stored in the deck in order to mitigate wobbling of the board at high speed (known as \"speed wobbles\").\n\nSome boards are designed to be flexible. Flexible boards are usually intended for lower speed riding because when going faster, a flexible board can have torsional flex which is one cause of speed wobbles. Fiberglass is used in many new flexible boards as it is light like carbon fiber but more pliable.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Nathan|title=Landyachtz Drop Speed Longboards|url=http://www.boardemporium.com/the-best-landyachtz-longboards/landyachtz-drop-speed-longboard-review/|publisher=Board Emporium|accessdate=7 April 2016|language=en-US|date=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Karen|first1=IAtkinson | title= Longboard decks|url=https://welongboards.com/size-skateboard-choose-read-guide-find/ |publisher=welongboards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}</ref> Longboard decks can be shaped in such a way that they bow up or down along the length of the board. They can also have a downward bend along the width of the board. Concave boards, which bend upward on the sides, give the rider more friction for their toe and heel, thus giving them more control. A camber board is a gradual upward arch along the length of the board. This sets the center of the board above the truck mounts. This is often used on flexible boards to prevent the board from sagging when it is being ridden. A \"rocker\" shape is the opposite of camber, which sets the center of the board below the truck mounts when it is being ridden. This lets the rider more easily perform tricks like sliding by locking their feet into the board.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Karen|title=how to stop on a longboard .|url=https://welongboards.com/how-to-stop-on-a-longboard-for-beginners/ |publisher=welongboards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\nDecks recently have been made using materials other than wood. The types and quality of woods have increased over time and now many other \"superior\" materials have come into use. Aluminum, carbon fiber and fiberglass are just some of the new materials. Carbon fiber and fiberglass are used to strengthen or completely replace wood in decks because of their better strength to weight ratios. Some boards are pure carbon fiber with a foam core, these can weigh much less than boards of equal size. Aluminum decks are CNC cut out of sheets of aluminum and incredible shapes can be made.\n\n====Fishtail====\nThe fishtail or pintail's shape is used to prevent the wheel from coming in contact with the board (called \"wheelbite\") while still providing ample footspace. Fishtails are most commonly used with top mounted trucks. They are also good cruising boards.\n\n====Drop-Through====\nDrop-Through boards, not to be confused with a double drop deck, have a cutout in the deck, allowing the baseplates of the trucks to be mounted through the deck. The lowered platform allows for greater stability at high speeds. Some examples of drop-through decks are the Landyachtz Drop Speed, Jaseboards Drop, Rayne Vendetta, Bustin Maestro, Original Freeride series, the Sector 9 Motha Star and the Loaded Tan Tien.\n\n====Hybrid====\nThese kind of longboards include wheel cutouts which provide room for the wheels to turn at sharper angles while avoiding wheelbite. Hybrids also tend to be shorter than other longboards, which allows the rider to be more stable.\n\n====Cruiser====\nA most common deck shape, these have a somewhat similar shape to normal skateboards, in that they have a \"kick-tail\" on the back. The main difference is it has trucks that are higher than standard skateboard truck also the wheels may be larger and are much softer than standard skateboard wheels. The bushings are much more flexible, giving the rider the ability to turn (carve) and maneuver more efficiently. These boards are more likely to cause \"wheel-bite\".\n\nSome of the high quality deck brands are Loaded, Bustin, Original, Sector 9, Arbor, Santa Cruz, and Landyachtz.\n\n===Trucks===\nLongboard trucks are metal pieces, shaped like a T, that mount onto the underside of the longboard deck and attach to the wheels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Longboard Trucks Buying Guide |url=https://prolongboarders.com/best-longboard-trucks/ |website=Pro Longboarders}}</ref> They come in a wide range of styles, with wider trucks meaning a wider turning circle. They use the motion of the rider's feet and body to turn the board by pivoting a joint in the middle of the truck. There are generally two types of trucks used on longboards: reverse kingpin trucks and conventional skateboard trucks (vertical kingpin). Conventional skateboard trucks have the kingpin on the inner side (towards the center of the board) of the axle, whereas reverse kingpin trucks have the kingpin on the outer side (towards the nose and tail) of the axle.<ref name=\"Warehouse Skateboards\">{{cite web|url=https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/skateboard-trucks#class=1T&pg=1&category=2270%7C2271%7C |title=Skateboard Trucks |publisher=warehouseskateboards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n\nPopular conventional skateboard trucks include Independent and Tracker. Popular reverse kingpin trucks include Randal and Paris. Reverse kingpin trucks were created with longboarding in mind. While they are usually considered to have more grip and stability (two important things in the downhill discipline), conventional trucks have a very different feel that is often preferred by many longboarders.\n\nThe angle of the baseplate can also greatly influence the turning and stability of a truck. As a general rule, as the degree gets smaller, the truck will be more stable, but turn less (its turn essentially becomes more vertically oriented rather than horizontally oriented). For example, trucks with 44 degree baseplates will generally be more stable (turn less) than trucks with 50 degree baseplates.<ref name=\"Warehouse Skateboards\" />\n\n===Bushings===\nBushings are perhaps the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a polyurethane material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two of the most standard bushing shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The type of washers used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While it depends on the size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.\nAnother aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.\n\n===Riser pads===\nRiser pads increase the distance between the wheels on a longboard and the deck in order to prevent wheel bite (when the deck scrapes the wheels, causing the wheels to stop turning). They also reduce the strain on the deck from the trucks being directly in contact with it and the vibration caused through riding. Riser pads are normally made of plastic. Shock pads, which are more rubbery than riser pads, serve the same function only with more emphasis on reducing strain and less on increasing the distance between the wheels and deck. Riser pads also come angled which can make the board turn more or less. Angled risers are usually used in [[long distance pumping]] to help aid the rider in propelling the board without pushing.\n\n===Bearings===\nLongboard bearings are all about reducing unnecessary friction to allow flawless stunt.<ref name=\"Longboard Bearings\">{{cite web|url=http://skateset.com/best-longboard-bearings/ |title=Longboard Bearings |publisher=skateset.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-24}}</ref> [[Bearing (mechanical)|Bearing]]s connect the wheel to turn smoothly. Bearings can be made of many materials, including [[steel]] (which is most prevalent), [[titanium]], or [[ceramic materials|ceramics]]. Ceramic bearings are the most expensive. Bearings are usually rated in the [[ABEC scale]]. The ratings run from 1\u20139, using only odd numbers. The higher the rating, the more precise tolerances the bearing has been machined to. However, ABEC rating is not compulsory and not all bearings use ABEC ratings. Some companies will use other methods to describe the bearings' resistance and durability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reviewlongboards.com/best-longboard-bearings/|title=Best Longboard Bearings of 2016 - Review Longboards|date=2015-12-04|website=Review Longboards|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> Optionally, longboarders add bearing spacers between the bearings in the wheels. This allows for the axle nut to be tightened all the way down eliminating the high frequency wobbles and increasing the lifetime of the bearings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPVBRc4-nTQ |title=Fastest Skateboard Wheels, Bearings and Bearing Spacers |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-02-04 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Grip tape ===\nGrip tape is a gritty material on the top of the board that provides traction so that shoes stay on the board.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/grip-tape-meaning-3002688|title=Why Is Grip Tape Used on Skateboards?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> The tape comes in rolls that have a strong adhesive on the bottom. They are applied to the top of the board and then cut to fit the shape. Black sheet is the most common, however they can come in many colors or even can come in the form of a clear spray on adhesive. Most black grip tape is made of silicon carbide which provides excellent grip and stays sharp for a long time. However, some black tape and most colored tape is made from aluminum oxide which is a cheaper material and will lose a lot of grip over time. The tape gets dirty after a lot of use, which is more apparent on the clear and lighter colors. It will lose a lot of the grip after using it for a while, but it is easily replaced by heating the board to loosen the adhesive on the bottom and using a razor blade to separate it from the board.\n\n===Wheels===\nAlmost all longboard wheels are made from [[Polyurethane|urethane]]. The performance of longboard wheels is determined by five characteristics: height, lip shape, contact patch, [[durometer]], and hub setting. Typical longboard wheels range from {{convert|65|to|107|mm|in|sp=us}} in diameter. A taller wheel will have slower acceleration but a faster rolling speed. Smaller wheels have the opposite effect. The durometer of a wheel is how hard the urethane is. A softer wheel will be ultimately slower than a harder wheel on smooth surface. When the road surface gets rougher a softer wheel provides a smoother, faster ride. The fastest duro for the normal road is around 80a. Softer wheels have more grip than harder wheels on any surface. The contact patch of a wheel is the width of the section of the wheel that makes contact with the road. Generally, the wider the wheel, the more traction it will have. Wheels can be anywhere from {{convert|50|to|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} in width, but most commonly between {{convert|60| and(-)|70|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The shape of the lip has a noticeable effect on traction. Rounded lips are made to break loose into a slide and square lips are made to grip. Square lipped wheels do break loose but the slide is not as smooth as that of a round lipped wheel. A wheel hub (or core) is the plastic (or sometimes aluminum) center of a wheel that holds the bearings. The position of the hub affects the properties of the wheel.\n\n====Centerset wheels====\nThe hubs in centerset wheels are set equidistant from each lip of the wheel. Centerset wheels tend to have the most grip, because they have large inner lips, and it is the inner lip of a longboard wheel that grips the most. Some longboarders prefer centerset wheels for sliding because they wear more evenly and when they become coned they can be flipped and still have the same feel. Centerset wheels are more difficult to break loose than other wheels, and more speed is lost during the slide, but the slide is more controlled because of the grip the wheel has.\n\n====Side-set wheels====\nSide-set have wheel hubs set flush with the inside edge of the wheel. Side-set wheels offer a smooth transition from grip to slide, the slide typically being longer than that of any other wheel. This type of wheel has by far the fastest and most uneven wear because the rider's weight is on the very inside of the wheel. Freeriding is typically the discipline that this particular kind of wheel is used for.\n\n====Offset wheels====\nThe hub of an offset wheel is between the center and the inside edge of the wheel. Offset wheels provide less grip than a centerset wheel, but more than a side-set wheel. Similarly, they break loose more easily than a centerset wheel, but less easily than a side-set wheel. These wheels usually feature square edges for more traction around corners or in carves. Off-set wheels are the most common wheel, typically used and designed for Downhill but they are used for all the other disciplines as well.\n\n==Additional equipment==\n\n===Slide gloves===\nA pair of slide gloves is an important piece of equipment for longboarding. Slide gloves are for control as much as for safety. They allow the rider to touch the road and lean on his or her hand(s) to slide to a stop, to pre-drift into a corner, to touch the road to regain balance if balance is lost, and to protect the hands and support the rider's body during a fall.\nThere are many style moves that also can slow the rider down that can be used called slides. There are various slides such as the K9, pendulum, coleman, and 1 footed stalefish. These type of gloves could be home made with just a thick plastic layer, and a glove.\n\n===Land paddle===\n{{see also|Longboarding#Land Paddling}}\n[[File:Land Paddling.jpg|thumb|Land paddling with the Kahuna Creations ''Kahuna Stick''.]]\nA land paddle is a large pole or stick, usually with rubber or a similar material on the end, which can be used as a form of [[Motion (physics)|locomotion]] derived by the rider's arms to propel the rider further without the use of the rider's legs, to maintain balance while riding, and as a brake. The material at the end of the stick may appear circular but does not turn while attached. The shape allows riders to manually remove, turn and replace the attachment to promote even wear and extend its useful life.\n\n==Type of Longboard==\n===Downhill===\nDownhill - Also referred to as Speedboarding. ... Drop-through, drop-platform, and top-mount longboards are common to downhill [https://bestskateboard.net/best-electric-skateboards/ skateboarding].

It is often longer than a skateboard and has a wide variety of shapes. It tends to be  faster because of wheel size, construction materials and more precise hardware. Longboards are commonly used for cruising, travelling and downhill racing, known as [[longboarding]], rather than [[skateboarding]]. Longboard 'dancing' and 'freestyle' are also becoming more popular styles, in which the rider utilises skateboard-like motions and steps up and down the board, generally in a fluid manner.\n\n== History ==\nThe first longboards were made by Preston Nichols in the 1940s and 50s as an alternative to surfing when the waves were too dull. Early skaters built dangerous, improvised boards out of planks of wood and roller skates in a practice known as Sidewalk Surfing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/351382-the-history-of-longboarding/|title=The History of Longboarding|last=Tadlock|first=Lindsay|work=LIVESTRONG.COM|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}</ref> Manufactured longboards first became commercially available in 1959 when Makaha, Jack's, and Hobie became the first professional longboard distributors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://longboardskateboard.org/history-of-longboarding.php|title=History of Longboarding|website=longboardskateboard.org|access-date=2017-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429224819/http://longboardskateboard.org/history-of-longboarding.php|archive-date=2017-04-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> These early longboards were still relatively crude, as they still featured metal wheels, but later had clay wheels due to improved safety factors. Longboarding became a popular activity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its popularity had largely died by 1965. Longboarding made a comeback in 1972 when [[Frank Nasworthy]] and the Cadillac Wheel Company introduced the urethane longboard wheel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skateboardingmagazine.com/the-evolution-of-skateboarding-a-history-from-sidewalk-surfing-to-superstardom/|title=The Evolution Of Skateboarding \u2013 A History From Sidewalk Surfing To Superstardom|last=Tony|first=Owen|date=2013-03-05|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}</ref> Urethane wheels allowed skaters to reach very high downhill speeds which were not possible before. Standard vertical kingpin skate trucks at the time could not maintain stability at these speeds. In the 1990s, [[Sector 9]] developed the reverse kingpin skate truck. The reverse kingpin trucks' improved stability and suppleness helped downhill longboarding grow into a legitimate sport, with the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) as its governing body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/sport/more/skateboarding-longboard.htm|title=About Longboarding|website=www.topendsports.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> The 90's also saw the introduction of the cutout deck, which has sections cut out around the wheels to prevent the wheels from touching the board during hard turns. Longboard technology has evolved rapidly to accommodate unique modern skating disciplines including downhill, slalom, freeriding, dancing, and freestyle. Modern longboard decks can be made from a variety of materials including fiberglass composites, aluminum, and carbon fiber.

Fiberglass is used in many new flexible boards as it is light like carbon fiber but more pliable.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Nathan|title=Landyachtz Drop Speed Longboards|url=http://www.boardemporium.com/the-best-landyachtz-longboards/landyachtz-drop-speed-longboard-review/|publisher=Board Emporium|accessdate=7 April 2016|language=en-US|date=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Karen|first1=IAtkinson | title= Longboard decks|url=https://welongboards.com/size-skateboard-choose-read-guide-find/ |publisher=welongboards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}</ref> Longboard decks can be shaped in such a way that they bow up or down along the length of the board. They can also have a downward bend along the width of the board. Concave boards, which bend upward on the sides, give the rider more friction for their toe and heel, thus giving them more control. A camber board is a gradual upward arch along the length of the board. This sets the center of the board above the truck mounts. This is often used on flexible boards to prevent the board from sagging when it is being ridden. A \"rocker\" shape is the opposite of camber, which sets the center of the board below the truck mounts when it is being ridden. This lets the rider more easily perform tricks like sliding by locking their feet into the board.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Karen|title=how to stop on a longboard .|url=https://welongboards.com/how-to-stop-on-a-longboard-for-beginners/ |publisher=welongboards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\nDecks recently have been made using materials other than wood. The types and quality of woods have increased over time and now many other \"superior\" materials have come into use. Aluminum, carbon fiber and fiberglass are just some of the new materials. Carbon fiber and fiberglass are used to strengthen or completely replace wood in decks because of their better strength to weight ratios. Some boards are pure carbon fiber with a foam core, these can weigh much less than boards of equal size. Aluminum decks are CNC cut out of sheets of aluminum and incredible shapes can be made.\n\n====Fishtail====\nThe fishtail or pintail's shape is used to prevent the wheel from coming in contact with the board (called \"wheelbite\") while still providing ample footspace. Fishtails are most commonly used with top mounted trucks. They are also good cruising boards.\n\n====Drop-Through====\nDrop-Through boards, not to be confused with a double drop deck, have a cutout in the deck, allowing the baseplates of the trucks to be mounted through the deck. The lowered platform allows for greater stability at high speeds. Some examples of drop-through decks are the Landyachtz Drop Speed, Jaseboards Drop, Rayne Vendetta, Bustin Maestro, Original Freeride series, the Sector 9 Motha Star and the Loaded Tan Tien.\n\n====Hybrid====\nThese kind of longboards include wheel cutouts which provide room for the wheels to turn at sharper angles while avoiding wheelbite. Hybrids also tend to be shorter than other longboards, which allows the rider to be more stable.\n\n====Cruiser====\nA most common deck shape, these have a somewhat similar shape to normal skateboards, in that they have a \"kick-tail\" on the back. The main difference is it has trucks that are higher than standard skateboard truck also the wheels may be larger and are much softer than standard skateboard wheels. The bushings are much more flexible, giving the rider the ability to turn (carve) and maneuver more efficiently. These boards are more likely to cause \"wheel-bite\".\n\nSome of the high quality deck brands are Loaded, Bustin, Original, Sector 9, Arbor, Santa Cruz, and Landyachtz.\n\n===Trucks===\nLongboard trucks are metal pieces, shaped like a T, that mount onto the underside of the longboard deck and attach to the wheels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Longboard Trucks Buying Guide |url=https://prolongboarders.com/best-longboard-trucks/ |website=Pro Longboarders}}</ref> They come in a wide range of styles, with wider trucks meaning a wider turning circle. They use the motion of the rider's feet and body to turn the board by pivoting a joint in the middle of the truck. There are generally two types of trucks used on longboards: reverse kingpin trucks and conventional skateboard trucks (vertical kingpin). Conventional skateboard trucks have the kingpin on the inner side (towards the center of the board) of the axle, whereas reverse kingpin trucks have the kingpin on the outer side (towards the nose and tail) of the axle.<ref name=\"Warehouse Skateboards\">{{cite web|url=https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/skateboard-trucks#class=1T&pg=1&category=2270%7C2271%7C |title=Skateboard Trucks |publisher=warehouseskateboards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n\nPopular conventional skateboard trucks include Independent and Tracker. Popular reverse kingpin trucks include Randal and Paris. Reverse kingpin trucks were created with longboarding in mind. While they are usually considered to have more grip and stability (two important things in the downhill discipline), conventional trucks have a very different feel that is often preferred by many longboarders.\n\nThe angle of the baseplate can also greatly influence the turning and stability of a truck. As a general rule, as the degree gets smaller, the truck will be more stable, but turn less (its turn essentially becomes more vertically oriented rather than horizontally oriented). For example, trucks with 44 degree baseplates will generally be more stable (turn less) than trucks with 50 degree baseplates.<ref name=\"Warehouse Skateboards\" />\n\n===Bushings===\nBushings are perhaps the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a polyurethane material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two of the most standard bushing shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The type of washers used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While it depends on the size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.\nAnother aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.\n\n===Riser pads===\nRiser pads increase the distance between the wheels on a longboard and the deck in order to prevent wheel bite (when the deck scrapes the wheels, causing the wheels to stop turning). They also reduce the strain on the deck from the trucks being directly in contact with it and the vibration caused through riding. Riser pads are normally made of plastic. Shock pads, which are more rubbery than riser pads, serve the same function only with more emphasis on reducing strain and less on increasing the distance between the wheels and deck. Riser pads also come angled which can make the board turn more or less. Angled risers are usually used in [[long distance pumping]] to help aid the rider in propelling the board without pushing.\n\n===Bearings===\nLongboard bearings are all about reducing unnecessary friction to allow flawless stunt.<ref name=\"Longboard Bearings\">{{cite web|url=http://skateset.com/best-longboard-bearings/ |title=Longboard Bearings |publisher=skateset.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-24}}</ref> [[Bearing (mechanical)|Bearing]]s connect the wheel to turn smoothly. Bearings can be made of many materials, including [[steel]] (which is most prevalent), [[titanium]], or [[ceramic materials|ceramics]]. Ceramic bearings are the most expensive. Bearings are usually rated in the [[ABEC scale]]. The ratings run from 1\u20139, using only odd numbers. The higher the rating, the more precise tolerances the bearing has been machined to. However, ABEC rating is not compulsory and not all bearings use ABEC ratings. Some companies will use other methods to describe the bearings' resistance and durability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reviewlongboards.com/best-longboard-bearings/|title=Best Longboard Bearings of 2016 - Review Longboards|date=2015-12-04|website=Review Longboards|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> Optionally, longboarders add bearing spacers between the bearings in the wheels. This allows for the axle nut to be tightened all the way down eliminating the high frequency wobbles and increasing the lifetime of the bearings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPVBRc4-nTQ |title=Fastest Skateboard Wheels, Bearings and Bearing Spacers |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-02-04 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Grip tape ===\nGrip tape is a gritty material on the top of the board that provides traction so that shoes stay on the board.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/grip-tape-meaning-3002688|title=Why Is Grip Tape Used on Skateboards?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> The tape comes in rolls that have a strong adhesive on the bottom. They are applied to the top of the board and then cut to fit the shape. Black sheet is the most common, however they can come in many colors or even can come in the form of a clear spray on adhesive. Most black grip tape is made of silicon carbide which provides excellent grip and stays sharp for a long time. However, some black tape and most colored tape is made from aluminum oxide which is a cheaper material and will lose a lot of grip over time. The tape gets dirty after a lot of use, which is more apparent on the clear and lighter colors. It will lose a lot of the grip after using it for a while, but it is easily replaced by heating the board to loosen the adhesive on the bottom and using a razor blade to separate it from the board.\n\n===Wheels===\nAlmost all longboard wheels are made from [[Polyurethane|urethane]]. The performance of longboard wheels is determined by five characteristics: height, lip shape, contact patch, [[durometer]], and hub setting. Typical longboard wheels range from {{convert|65|to|107|mm|in|sp=us}} in diameter. A taller wheel will have slower acceleration but a faster rolling speed. Smaller wheels have the opposite effect. The durometer of a wheel is how hard the urethane is. A softer wheel will be ultimately slower than a harder wheel on smooth surface. When the road surface gets rougher a softer wheel provides a smoother, faster ride. The fastest duro for the normal road is around 80a. Softer wheels have more grip than harder wheels on any surface. The contact patch of a wheel is the width of the section of the wheel that makes contact with the road. Generally, the wider the wheel, the more traction it will have. Wheels can be anywhere from {{convert|50|to|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} in width, but most commonly between {{convert|60| and(-)|70|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The shape of the lip has a noticeable effect on traction. Rounded lips are made to break loose into a slide and square lips are made to grip. Square lipped wheels do break loose but the slide is not as smooth as that of a round lipped wheel. A wheel hub (or core) is the plastic (or sometimes aluminum) center of a wheel that holds the bearings. The position of the hub affects the properties of the wheel.\n\n====Centerset wheels====\nThe hubs in centerset wheels are set equidistant from each lip of the wheel. Centerset wheels tend to have the most grip, because they have large inner lips, and it is the inner lip of a longboard wheel that grips the most. Some longboarders prefer centerset wheels for sliding because they wear more evenly and when they become coned they can be flipped and still have the same feel. Centerset wheels are more difficult to break loose than other wheels, and more speed is lost during the slide, but the slide is more controlled because of the grip the wheel has.\n\n====Side-set wheels====\nSide-set have wheel hubs set flush with the inside edge of the wheel. Side-set wheels offer a smooth transition from grip to slide, the slide typically being longer than that of any other wheel. This type of wheel has by far the fastest and most uneven wear because the rider's weight is on the very inside of the wheel. Freeriding is typically the discipline that this particular kind of wheel is used for.\n\n====Offset wheels====\nThe hub of an offset wheel is between the center and the inside edge of the wheel. Offset wheels provide less grip than a centerset wheel, but more than a side-set wheel. Similarly, they break loose more easily than a centerset wheel, but less easily than a side-set wheel. These wheels usually feature square edges for more traction around corners or in carves. Off-set wheels are the most common wheel, typically used and designed for Downhill but they are used for all the other disciplines as well.\n\n==Additional equipment==\n\n===Slide gloves===\nA pair of slide gloves is an important piece of equipment for longboarding. Slide gloves are for control as much as for safety. They allow the rider to touch the road and lean on his or her hand(s) to slide to a stop, to pre-drift into a corner, to touch the road to regain balance if balance is lost, and to protect the hands and support the rider's body during a fall.\nThere are many style moves that also can slow the rider down that can be used called slides. There are various slides such as the K9, pendulum, coleman, and 1 footed stalefish. These type of gloves could be home made with just a thick plastic layer, and a glove.\n\n===Land paddle===\n{{see also|Longboarding#Land Paddling}}\n[[File:Land Paddling.jpg|thumb|Land paddling with the Kahuna Creations ''Kahuna Stick''.]]\nA land paddle is a large pole or stick, usually with rubber or a similar material on the end, which can be used as a form of [[Motion (physics)|locomotion]] derived by the rider's arms to propel the rider further without the use of the rider's legs, to maintain balance while riding, and as a brake. The material at the end of the stick may appear circular but does not turn while attached. The shape allows riders to manually remove, turn and replace the attachment to promote even wear and extend its useful life.\n\n==Type of Longboard==\n===Downhill===\nDownhill - Also referred to as Speedboarding. ... Drop-through, drop-platform, and top-mount longboards are common to downhill skateboarding. Downhill decks are very stiff and usually have a small to medium wheelbase around 29-32\u201d.

The devil says he can be with her again if he brings the devil the souls of a thousand evil men and the man agrees to do it, and so the devil hands him a gun.

{"title_page": "Economy of the Empire of Japan", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2008}}\n{{grammar|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n\nIn the half century up to 1999, [[Japan]]'s [[export]]s grew from 144 million to 5,331 million [[yen]] (\u00a5). This amounted to a share of world trade of only 3.7%, compared with 13.7% for the [[United Kingdom]] or 11.8% for the [[United States]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s also resulted in imports exceeding exports by \u00a51,000 million.\n\nIn 1936, Japan had the third-largest commercial shipping fleet in the world, valued at $1,183,000,000, or $28.10 per person.\n\n==Government economic administration (Meiji through World War II)==\nThe official government entities who guided the Japanese national economy were the Economy and Finance Ministry, the [[Bank of Japan]], and the Industry and Commerce Ministry. For military spending there was the Marine and War Ministry<!-- Is this one ministry or is it two? -->, and other important government entities.\n\n==Investment in Korea (through World War II)==\nIn 1932, Japan invested $550,000,000 and similarly invested $320,000,000 in 1938. This investment produced a return of 400% in industrial monetary value.\n\nIn the fishing industry, Japan extracted a value of $20,000,000 annually. This is a high per capita statistic in fishing and comprised 15% of world fishing volumes.\n\nThe Noguchi Family put their principal investments in Banking commerce and Industry in this province. With their funds, the [[zaibatsu]] and the Japanese government founded the [[Bank of Chosen]], the central banking institution in the province, which stayed linked with the [[Central Bank of Manchou]], the Manchu central bank.\n\nOther significant industries were chemicals (30%) and Metal and machinery (10%) with a total 1,000,000 of workers in these areas, plus woodworking, textile, foods and handcrafts.\n\n==Fishing (World War II era)==\nThe important Okhotsk fisheries had a value of \u00a550 million. Other fisheries in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Karafuto]], [[South Mandate]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]] came to \u00a5122,000,000 and \u00a5358,000,000 from Japan proper, for a total of \u00a5480,000,000 (1938 figures). Secondary products from fishing had a value of \u00a5150 million to \u00a5200 million. (From another source, fishing values were of \u00a5235,000,000 and \u00a5275,000,000 during 1919 to 1913, more than the British.)\n\nCoastal fishing represented 61% of the total value, with a fleet of 364,260 small boats, of which 20% had engines; the rest were sailing boats. High seas fishing represented 28% of the industry, with [[whaling]], [[coral]] and [[pearl]] collecting and a little physiculture on land making up the rest. The high\nseas vessels operated in the [[North Pacific]] area ([[Alaska]] coasts), to the South Pacific. During Japanese administration the fishing in the [[Kwantung]] leased territory was 61,000 tonnes.\n\nIn 1938, the [[fish factory vessel]]s packed 204,000,000 packages of crab, and 370 packages of sea salmon. In the same year, four whale hunting vessels fished in the waters around the [[Antarctic]]. Factories were built in [[Chisima]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Karafuto]], [[Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]] and other coastal areas to process fish products.\n\n==Forestry products (World War II era)==\nLocal forestry represented a production of 14,000,000 meters of wood with a value of \u00a575,000,000, a total value of \u00a550,000,000 in cut wood, \u00a53,000,000 in [[bamboo]] and other secondary wood products for a total value of \u00a5100,000,000. The local forests covered 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 90,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> under State administration or Imperial Family reserves and taking part in scientific forest research during the latter years. Coal of wood was valued at 100,000,000 yen. The Sugi (Scryptomeria Japonica), representing a quarter of the total quantity, Pine more than 20%in quantity and value and the Hinoki (Chamaecypaaris Obtusa) only 1/4% of quantity, but more than 9% in value.\n\nDespite many forests and their importance, Japan continued to buy wood overseas. In accord with another dates, Japan had 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of forest, 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in private hands, the other 75,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in state control and 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> owned by the Imperial House. Wood exports were made to the rest of the Japanese empire and to foreign markets.\n\n==Paper and cellulose industry==\nSince ancient times, Japan has manufactured assorted paper types by hand. A modern mechanized industry appeared in 1872 and became one of the most important industries in the nation. The total production was about 1,000,000 [[ton]]nes of paper and cardboard.  [[Wood pulp|cellulose paste]], the principal prime material, was made in [[Shikoku]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and [[Karafuto]]. The [[Cellulose]] production resulted in 8% of U.S. manufacture; the Cellulose industry in Japan developed in [[Shikoku]], North [[Honsh\u016b]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Manchukuo]] and [[Karafuto]]. In Karafuto was the [[Shiretoru]] Cellulose Factory, the most advanced installation dedicated to the cellulose industry in all of [[East Asia]]. The first place where European-type paper was manufactured in Japan was in the city of [[Shikuka]]. Additionally, to complement this local production, these products were sold in [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]].\n\n==North Sakhalin and Japanese-Russian fishing convention==\nThe Japanese and Russian oil wells, in the same oil zone, were strictly controlled to ensure equitable exploitation. The pits stayed in direct connection with the Moskalvo port in the west coast of Ohka through a network of oil pipelines.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Government granted Japan petroliferous and carbonaceous concessions in North Sakhalin to Mitsubishi, Itoh-Korada, Mitsui and other Japanese Companies for a period of 45 years. By Protocols and agreements signed in Moscow in May 1944, these concessions expired 26 years before the accorded time in 1970, while a new Japanese-Russian accord over fishing conventions agreed to the formal retirement of some Japanese fisheries in the Far East to Japanese concessors, the right of Soviet Organizations to buy annually and for auction 10% of Japanese fish shares, and a supplementary payment in gold for Japanese owners.\n\nWhen modifying these fishing conventions in 1928, according to the activities of Soviet Fishing Organizations, citizens were subject to substantial reductions. The Japanese-Russian accord of March 1944 cancelled all restrictions previously observed.\n\nJapanese subjects and foreigners were banned from fishing in certain maritime zones in the Far East under an agreement with the Soviet Government made in July 1941. The Japanese Government also guaranteed that fishing rights on the East Coast of [[Kamchatka]] and [[Olyutorsk]] were not taken up by the Japanese.\n\n==Birth rates==\n\nSome dates and figures:\n\n*In 1914, the Japanese birth rate stood at 15%, close to that of [[Germany]] or [[Russia]], slightly lower than [[Java (island)|Java]] (Dutch Indies) at 22%. There was a reduction to 13.6% in 1924. For example, in Japan proper there were 157 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, and Hokkaido had 184 residents in per km<sup>2</sup> (cf. Java, which had 274).\n*In 1925, the population grew by 875,000 per year, in 1926 by 900,000, in 1927 this number grew to 1,000,000. In next last four years, the annual increase in population averaged 900,000, but in 1932-1940 the net growth was more than 1,000,000 per year, a rate which would double the population in 40 years. Japan imported 10% of the food for this population.\n*In 1936, Japan had 30.3 births per 1,000 residents and 17.5 deaths per 1,000. The net increase in population was 1,028,623 in 1935, but notably reduced to 653,000 in 1939 and 239,000 in 1940. Among the great countries, the birth average of Japan immediately followed British India (34.9) and was double that of the United States (16.7). This was accompanied by a growth in rice production between 1880-1940 of 60 million [[koku]] (300 million [[bushel]]s).\n*Japanese thinkers were preoccupied with demographics: to reduce of rate of deaths and increase that of births and comparing this with growth in China and Soviet Union. Army ideologists pondered the question and produced a [[eugenics]] law which ordered the sterilization or abortion of inferior or inadequate babies and ordered the increase of birth physically \"perfect\" future Samurai warriors. The Japanese government gave economic support to all mothers having many children. These experts planned a ten-year program to increase the number of soldiers to the number of 100,000,000. If needed for conquest purposes, Japanese mothers \"manufactured\" three million babies or, in other words, a sixfold increase in this \"production\" by all Japanese women.\n\nThese programs were guided by [[Katsuko Tojo]], [[General Tojo]]'s wife. She said wives should have seven children and suggested this should be the correct Japanese mother. This included participation by the central government, as she suggested creating one program for increasing the number of marriages.\n\n==Naval construction industry==\n\nIn 1893 naval construction was in the range 177,000 to 1,528,000 tonnes. In 1913 this increased to 3,565,000 tonnes. In 1924 with 237 500-tonnes vessels and 11 10,000-tonnes and reaching 4,140,000 tonnes in 1928. The Japanese Navy was third in the world behind British and American Navies and dominated the West Pacific area before the war. The first modern Shipyard was built in 1891, and since then naval construction rapidly advanced. Japanese boats of more than 100 tonnes represented a total registered tonnage of 5,007,000 tonnes out of 1,198,000 corresponding to naval construction of 1936-1938. This put Japan in third place between maritime powers, a notable realization in such short time. The old vessels were destroyed or disarmed which is why the regular fleet was efficient and modern. Without scarcity of Petrol, much of these modern vessels were designed for that energy source.\n\n==Military industry==\n\nThis sector was important from the [[First Chinese-Japanese war]] to the Pacific War.\n\nLarge industrial groups received large investment for making weapons for Japanese Army and Navy in national war efforts. In military aircraft industry exist the next names of important companies how:\n\nFor the Japanese Navy:\n*[[Aichi Kokuki|Aichi]] (1,643,913 weapons)\n*[[Kawanishi Aircraft Company|Kawanishi]] (1,036,435 weapons)\n*Showa/[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]\n*[[Nihon]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Yokosuka]] (980,136 weapons)\n*[[Watanabe]]\n*[[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] (218,102 weapons)\n*[[Kugisho]]\n*[[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]]\n*[[Funryu]]\nFor the Japanese Army:\n*[[Nikkoku]]\n*[[Yokoi]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kokukosho]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kogiken]]\n*[[Tachikawa]] (2,078,832 weapons)\n*[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] (2,172,875 weapons)\n*[[Kokusai]] (60,037 weapons)\n*[[Kayaba]]\nFor both armed branches:\n*[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] (2,052,157 (army) and 3,148,417 (navy) weapons)\n*[[Mitsubishi]] (2,503,194 (army) and 1,287,742 (navy) weapons)\nFor Manchukuo and the Japanese Army:\n*[[Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company|Mansh\u016b]] (125,379 weapons)\nand other related companies.\n\nIn other war material, the name of [[Nambu Company]] are charged for making hand weapons for both armed branches, the [[Mitsubishi]] heavy industries with subsidiaries ([[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] Company, [[Ikegai]] Iron Works, [[Sagami Arsenal]] (factory) and others) possess the contract to manufacture the second Tank Type in use for armed forces the Medium Tank Type 97 or Chi-Ha and Shinhoto-Chi-Ha with a total of 1,049 units made in 1938-1941.\n\n*The first prototypes of Type 97 Medium Tank are constructed for Tokyo Plant of Mitsubishi Heavy industries Ltd. and [[Osaka Arsenal]].

They fall into three sectors:\n\nDeposits of tungsten, tin and manganese, also.\n\n*[[Chekiang]]: coal reserves were 101 million tonnes and extraction 250,000 tonnes in 1934. There were certain soils rich in bauxite.\n\n====South China area====\n*[[Fujian|Fukien]]: coal reserves of 500 million tonnes in 1934.\n*[[Kwantung]] (Canton): 421 million tonnes of coal reserves, and production was 338,000 tonnes in 1934. Iron reserves in [[Hainan]], with 400 million tonnes of iron of high grade in 1934. A small tungsten production, also.\n*[[Kwangsi]]: coal reserves of 300 million tonnes, and production of 30,000 tonnes in 1940. There were some sources of tungsten, manganese (production of 1,246 tonnes in 1940) and a tin production of 417,000 tonnes too.\n*[[Hunan]]: coal reserves were 1,793 million tonnes and extraction of 1,050,000 tonnes in 1940. Some deposits of tungsten, mercury, antimony ([[Hsikwangshan]] mine), manganese and gold.\n*[[Kweichow]]: coal reserves were 1,549 million tonnes, and extraction 360,750 tonnes in 1940. Deposits of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[copper]], [[antimony]], and [[sulphur]] also.\n\n===South East Asia===\nThis zone when conquered by Japanese forces added further resources and strategic points. This had formed part of Japanese Navy plans to expand into the '[[South Sea lands]]'.\n\n*[[Burma]]: in the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy river]] zone, there were the [[Yenangyaung]] and [[Chauk]] oil fields, 300 miles (500&nbsp;km) north of [[Rangoon]]. These sources and other in [[Singu]] extracted 260,000,000 gallons in 1938, and there was an unexploited coal deposit. This nation had other minerals: [[amber]] and [[jade]] ([[nefrite]] stone), [[lapis lazuli]], [[lazurite]], [[rubies]], extraction {{convert|141490|carat|kg}}  in 1937, [[sapphire]]s, etc. in [[Shan Mesete]]. There was a major mine in [[Bawdwin]], producing silver, lead, zinc, nickel and copper. This deposit produced 72,000 tonnes of lead and ones 5,000,000 ounces in 1933, rock with content 20% of lead and zinc as a mineral. In [[Mergui]] and [[Tavoy]] ([[Tenasseri]]n area) mines produced tungsten and tin from 1910. Tin extraction rose to 6,623 tonnes in 1937.\n*[[Thailand]]: in its ranges were abundant sources of tin, which were extracted for mining, and from rivers. On the south coast [[guano]] was mined for [[fertilizer]] production.\n*[[French Indochina]]: in [[Honggay]] (near [[Haipong]]) extracted ones 2,308,000 tonnes of coal in 1937. Minerals included Tungsten, Chromium, Tin, antimony and manganese in the northern area and Phosphate rock in the southern area. These minerals were extracted to export in bulk for processing abroad.\n*[[Malacca]]: Tin extraction was in the hands of its Chinese citizens; production in 1939 was 55,950 tonnes or some 30% of world production. There were tin factories in [[Singapore]] and [[Penang]] for processing local extractions, and those of Thailand, Burma and Indochina. In the same area Japanese pre-war investment had related to bauxite, iron and manganese. The Kelantan, Trengganu and Johore iron mineral extractions represented 1,944,701 tonnes in 1939; the manganese was from [[Kelantan]] and [[Trengganu]] and Bauxite provided from Johore in the same year. Other Japanese mining investments were in the Dutch island of [[Bintang]] and existing coal deposits.\n*[[Dutch Indies]]: Its minerals were scarce but had important value. The oil in the [[Palembang]] ([[Sumatra]]), [[Djambi]], [[Medan]] and [[Borneo]] fields in [[Balikpapan]] and [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] produced 7,938,000 tonnes in 1940; perhaps a greater yield than California and Iran. Coal was in Sumatra and Borneo, with 1,456,647 tonnes mined in the same year. Additionally there were sulphur and manganese in Java, and nickel in [[Sulawesi|Celebes]]. Tin came from [[Bangka Island|Banka]] and the [[Billington Islands]], which extracted 43,900 tonnes in 1940. The Japanese mining business in the Bintang Island tin deposits produced 275,000 tonnes that year, supposedly one sixth of world production.\n*[[Philippines]]: Its mining industry had spectacularly developed during the U.S. administration. It produced more gold than Alaska, or any other American state apart from California. Gold extraction in 1941 represented 1,109,000 troy oz (34,500&nbsp;kg), five times more than in 1931, and silver associated with gold ore at the same level. These extractions proceeded mostly from the [[Benget]] district in [[Baguio Province]], [[Luzon]]. Iron deposits were rapidly developed and during 1941 1,191,641 tonnes was exported to Japan. Iron sources were located in [[North Camarines]] ([[Luzon]]), [[Samar (island)|Samar Island]] and [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]] in [[Mindanao island]]. In the last of these, the iron reserves were estimated as 500 million tonnes; [[Laterithic]] minerals with content of silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, and an iron content of 48% were of easy extraction from coastal areas. Chromium was not discovered until 1935, but the Philippines in 1939 produced 164,000 tonnes and had fifth place, or 11%, of world production. Sources were in [[Zambales]] (Luzon) with its extraction of 10 million tonnes, chrome oxide with a high 50% of chrome content. Manganese was abundant but of medium quality, and was sent to the USA from 1935; the local production was 58,038 tonnes in 1940. There were also copper, lead, zinc and coal.\n\n===Pacific Sea lands===\nIn total or partial control:\n*New Guinea: certain Gold deposits in Bulolo (East New Guinea) with other minerals in these islands.\n*Nauru: certain sources of phosphates.\n*Gilberts: are other deposits of phosphates.\n*Salomon: sources of gold, copper and phosphates.\n*Palau Islands: Source of bauxite\n\n===Summary===\nExcept for the transportation difficulties due to great distances, the frequent sinking of Japanese merchants vessels or downed transport aircraft, guerrilla and local resistance movements' strikes against the mines, centers or transport lines, aerial allied attacks against occupied areas and great colonial administrative difficulties to manage these great territories outside Japan, these active or potential resources could not be used or disposed in adequate form for the Japanese Empire and much of these potential mineral exports did not arrive in Japanese markets and industries for finishing the process during the Pacific war time.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in the Empire of Japan]]\n*[[Demographics of Imperial Japan]]\n*[[Japanese heavy industry during WW2 times]]\n*[[Japanese mining and energy resources (WWII)]]\n*[[Japanese exterior Commerce during WW2 Times]]\n*[[Japanese-German pre-WWII industrial co-operation]]\n*[[Japanese Nuclear Weapons Development]]\n*[[Empire of Japan (foreign commerce and shipping)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080312173606/http://www.users.bigpond.com/battleforAustralia/historicalbackground/JapMilaggro.html JAPAN'S MILITARY AGGRESSION IN EAST ASIA 1931-1937] at users.bigpond.com/battleforaustralia\n* [http://www.historyorb.com/asia/japan_economic_expansion.shtml Japan's Economic Expansion into Manchuria and China in World War Two] at historyorb.com Author: James Graham Published: May, 2004\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm Why Japan ''Really'' Lost The War]\n\n{{JapanEmpireNavbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Empire Of Japan, Economy Of the}}\n[[Category:Economic history of Japan]]\n[[Category:Economic history of World War II]]\n[[Category:Empire of Japan|Economy]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2008}}\n{{grammar|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n\nIn the half century up to 1999, [[Japan]]'s [[export]]s grew from 144 million to 5,331 million [[yen]] (\u00a5). This amounted to a share of world trade of only 3.7%, compared with 13.7% for the [[United Kingdom]] or 11.8% for the [[United States]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s also resulted in imports exceeding exports by \u00a51,000 million.\n\nIn 1936, Japan had the third-largest commercial shipping fleet in the world, valued at $1,183,000,000, or $28.10 per person.\n\n==Government economic administration (Meiji through World War II)==\nThe official government entities who guided the Japanese national economy were the Economy and Finance Ministry, the [[Bank of Japan]], and the Industry and Commerce Ministry. For military spending there was the Marine and War Ministry<!-- Is this one ministry or is it two? -->, and other important government entities.\n\n==Investment in Korea (through World War II)==\nIn 1932, Japan invested $550,000,000 and similarly invested $320,000,000 in 1938. This investment produced a return of 400% in industrial monetary value.\n\nIn the fishing industry, Japan extracted a value of $20,000,000 annually. This is a high per capita statistic in fishing and comprised 15% of world fishing volumes.\n\nThe Noguchi Family put their principal investments in Banking commerce and Industry in this province. With their funds, [[zaibatsu]] and the Japanese government founded the [[Bank of Chosen]], the central banking institution in the province, which stayed linked with the [[Central Bank of Manchou]], the Manchu central bank.\n\nOther significant industries were chemicals (30%) and Metal and machinery (10%) with a total 1,000,000 of workers in these areas, plus woodworking, textile, foods and handcrafts.\n\n==Fishing (World War II era)==\nThe important Okhotsk fisheries had a value of \u00a550 million. Other fisheries in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Karafuto]], [[South Mandate]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]] came to \u00a5122,000,000 and \u00a5358,000,000 from Japan proper, for a total of \u00a5480,000,000 (1938 figures). Secondary products from fishing had a value of \u00a5150 million to \u00a5200 million. (From another source, fishing values were of \u00a5235,000,000 and \u00a5275,000,000 during 1919 to 1913, more than the British.)\n\nCoastal fishing represented 61% of the total value, with a fleet of 364,260 small boats of which 20% had engines; the rest were sailing boats. High seas fishing represented 28% of the industry, with [[whaling]], [[coral]] and [[pearl]] collecting and a little physiculture on land making up the rest. The high\nseas vessels operated in the [[North Pacific]] area ([[Alaska]] coasts), to the South Pacific. During Japanese administration the fishing in the [[Kwantung]] leased territory was 61,000 tonnes.\n\nIn 1938, the [[fish factory vessel]]s packed 204,000,000 packages of crab, and 370 packages of sea salmon. In the same year, four whale hunting vessels fished in waters around the [[Antarctic]]. Factories were built in [[Chisima]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Karafuto]], [[Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]] and other coastal areas to process fish products.\n\n==Forestry products (World War II era)==\nLocal forestry represented a production of 14,000,000 meters of wood with a value of \u00a575,000,000, a total value of \u00a550,000,000 in cut wood, \u00a53,000,000 in [[bamboo]] and other secondary wood products for a total value of \u00a5100,000,000. The local forests covered 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 90,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> under State administration or Imperial Family reserves and taking part in scientific forest research during latter years. Coal of wood was valued at 100,000,000 yen. The Sugi (Scryptomeria Japonica), representing a quarter of the total quantity, Pine more than 20%in quantity and value and the Hinoki (Chamaecypaaris Obtusa) only 1/4% of quantity, but more than 9% in value.\n\nDespite many forests and their importance, Japan continued to buy wood overseas. In accord with another dates, Japan had 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of forest, 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in private hands, the other 75,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in state control and 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> owned by the Imperial House. Wood exports were made to the rest of the Japanese empire and to foreign markets.\n\n==Paper and cellulose industry==\nSince ancient times, Japan has manufactured assorted paper types by hand. A modern mechanized industry appeared in 1872 and became one of the most important industries in the nation. The total production was about 1,000,000 [[ton]]nes of paper and cardboard.  [[Wood pulp|cellulose paste]], the principal prime material, was made in [[Shikoku]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and [[Karafuto]]. The [[Cellulose]] production resulted in 8% of U.S. manufacture; the Cellulose industry in Japan developed in [[Shikoku]], North [[Honsh\u016b]], [[Hokkaid\u014d]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chosen]], [[Manchukuo]] and [[Karafuto]]. In Karafuto was the [[Shiretoru]] Cellulose Factory, the most advanced installation dedicated to the cellulose industry in all of [[East Asia]]. The first place where European-type paper was manufactured in Japan was in the city of [[Shikuka]]. Additionally, to complement this local production, these products were sold in [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]].\n\n==North Sakhalin and Japanese-Russian fishing convention==\nThe Japanese and Russian oil wells, in the same oil zone, were strictly controlled to ensure equitable exploitation. The pits stayed in direct connection with the Moskalvo port in the west coast of Ohka through a network of oil pipelines.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet Government granted Japan petroliferous and carbonaceous concessions in North Sakhalin to Mitsubishi, Itoh-Korada, Mitsui and other Japanese Companies for a period of 45 years. By Protocols and agreements signed in Moscow in May 1944, these concessions expired 26 years before the accorded time in 1970, while a new Japanese-Russian accord over fishing conventions agreed to the formal retirement of some Japanese fisheries in the Far East to Japanese concessors, the right of Soviet Organizations to buy annually and for auction 10% of Japanese fish shares, and a supplementary payment in gold for Japanese owners.\n\nWhen modifying these fishing conventions in 1928, according to the activities of Soviet Fishing Organizations, citizens were subject to substantial reductions. The Japanese-Russian accord of March 1944 cancelled all restrictions previously observed.\n\nJapanese subjects and foreigners were banned from fishing in certain maritime zones in the Far East under an agreement with the Soviet Government made in July 1941. The Japanese Government also guaranteed that fishing rights on the East Coast of [[Kamchatka]] and [[Olyutorsk]] were not taken up by the Japanese.\n\n==Birth rates==\n\nSome dates and figures:\n\n*In 1914, the Japanese birth rate stood at 15%, close to that of [[Germany]] or [[Russia]], slightly lower than [[Java (island)|Java]] (Dutch Indies) at 22%. There was a reduction to 13.6% in 1924. For example, in Japan proper there were 157 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, and Hokkaido had 184 residents in per km<sup>2</sup> (cf. Java, which had 274).\n*In 1925, the population grew by 875,000 per year, in 1926 by 900,000, in 1927 this number grew to 1,000,000. In next last four years, the annual increase in population averaged 900,000, but in 1932-1940 the net growth was more than 1,000,000 per year, a rate which would double the population in 40 years. Japan imported 10% of the food for this population.\n*In 1936, Japan had 30.3 births per 1,000 residents and 17.5 deaths per 1,000. The net increase in population was 1,028,623 in 1935, but notably reduced to 653,000 in 1939 and 239,000 in 1940. Among the great countries, the birth average of Japan immediately followed British India (34.9) and was double that of the United States (16.7). This was accompanied by a growth in rice production between 1880-1940 of 60 million [[koku]] (300 million [[bushel]]s).\n*Japanese thinkers were preoccupied with demographics: to reduce of rate of deaths and increase that of births and comparing this with growth in China and Soviet Union. Army ideologists pondered the question and produced a [[eugenics]] law which ordered the sterilization or abortion of inferior or inadequate babies and ordered the increase of birth physically \"perfect\" future Samurai warriors. The Japanese government gave economic support to all mothers having many children. These experts planned a ten-year program to increase the number of soldiers to the number of 100,000,000. If needed for conquest purposes, Japanese mothers \"manufactured\" three million babies or, in other words, a sixfold increase in this \"production\" by all Japanese women.\n\nThese programs were guided by [[Katsuko Tojo]], [[General Tojo]]'s wife. She said wives should have seven children and suggested this should be the correct Japanese mother. This included participation by the central government, as she suggested creating one program for increasing the number of marriages.\n\n==Naval construction industry==\n\nIn 1893 naval construction was in the range 177,000 to 1,528,000 tonnes. In 1913 this increased to 3,565,000 tonnes. In 1924 with 237 500-tonnes vessels and 11 10,000-tonnes and reaching 4,140,000 tonnes in 1928. The Japanese Navy was third in the world behind British and American Navies and dominated the West Pacific area before the war. The first modern Shipyard was built in 1891, and since then naval construction rapidly advanced. Japanese boats of more than 100 tonnes represented a total registered tonnage of 5,007,000 tonnes out of 1,198,000 corresponding to naval construction of 1936-1938. This put Japan in third place between maritime powers, a notable realization in such short time. The old vessels were destroyed or disarmed which is why the regular fleet was efficient and modern. Without scarcity of Petrol, much of these modern vessels were designed for that energy source.\n\n==Military industry==\n\nThis sector was important from the [[First Chinese-Japanese war]] to the Pacific War.\n\nLarge industrial groups received large investment for making weapons for Japanese Army and Navy in national war efforts. In military aircraft industry exist the next names of important companies how:\n\nFor the Japanese Navy:\n*[[Aichi Kokuki|Aichi]] (1,643,913 weapons)\n*[[Kawanishi Aircraft Company|Kawanishi]] (1,036,435 weapons)\n*Showa/[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]]\n*[[Nihon]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Yokosuka]] (980,136 weapons)\n*[[Watanabe]]\n*[[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] (218,102 weapons)\n*[[Kugisho]]\n*[[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]]\n*[[Funryu]]\nFor the Japanese Army:\n*[[Nikkoku]]\n*[[Yokoi]]\n*[[Maeda Corporation|Maeda]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kokukosho]]\n*[[Rikugun/Kogiken]]\n*[[Tachikawa]] (2,078,832 weapons)\n*[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] (2,172,875 weapons)\n*[[Kokusai]] (60,037 weapons)\n*[[Kayaba]]\nFor both armed branches:\n*[[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] (2,052,157 (army) and 3,148,417 (navy) weapons)\n*[[Mitsubishi]] (2,503,194 (army) and 1,287,742 (navy) weapons)\nFor Manchukuo and the Japanese Army:\n*[[Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company|Mansh\u016b]] (125,379 weapons)\nand other related companies.\n\nIn other war material, the name of [[Nambu Company]] are charged for making hand weapons for both armed branches, the [[Mitsubishi]] heavy industries with subsidiaries ([[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] Company, [[Ikegai]] Iron Works, [[Sagami Arsenal]] (factory) and others) possess the contract to manufacture the second Tank Type in use for armed forces the Medium Tank Type 97 or Chi-Ha and Shinhoto-Chi-Ha with a total of 1,049 units made in 1938-1941.\n\n*The first prototypes of Type 97 Medium Tank are constructed for Tokyo Plant of Mitsubishi Heavy industries Ltd. and [[Osaka Arsenal]].

Apart debt at agreements with Germany, theirs receiving much military technology and samples of weapons for develop in country or Japanese government buying any licenses to making and the prototypes for same purpose too.\n\nAdditionally Japanese before and during last times of war, developed some types of unusual military combat infantry techniques, artifacts, special weapons and certain weapons of mass destruction between other various bellicose equipment. Theirs are collectively named \"Japanese Secret and Special Weapons\".\n\nFor this, also see \"[[Japanese Secret and Special Weapons]]\".\n\n==Natural Resources in occupied areas after 1937==\n\n===Occupied Chinese Mainland===\nFrom 1937, during the Japanese military occupation of territories in [[China]], they\ncontrolled certain mineral deposits in those areas.

Sources were in [[Zambales]] (Luzon) with its extraction of 10 million tonnes, chrome oxide with a high 50% of chrome content. Manganese was abundant but of medium quality, and was sent to the USA from 1935; the local production was 58,038 tonnes in 1940. There were also copper, lead, zinc and coal.\n\n===Pacific Sea lands===\nIn total or partial control:\n*New Guinea: certain Gold deposits in Bulolo (East New Guinea) with other minerals in these islands.\n*Nauru: certain sources of phosphates.\n*Gilberts: are other deposits of phosphates.\n*Salomon: sources of gold, copper and phosphates.\n*Palau Islands: Source of bauxite\n\n===Summary===\nExcept for the transportation difficulties due to great distances, the frequent sinking of Japanese merchants vessels or downed transport aircraft, guerrilla and local resistance movements' strikes against the mines, centers or transport lines, aerial allied attacks against occupied areas and great colonial administrative difficulties to manage these great territories outside Japan, these active or potential resources could not be used or disposed in adequate form for the Japanese Empire and much of these potential mineral exports did not arrive in Japanese markets and industries for finishing the process during the Pacific war time.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in the Empire of Japan]]\n*[[Demographics of Imperial Japan]]\n*[[Japanese heavy industry during WW2 times]]\n*[[Japanese mining and energy resources (WWII)]]\n*[[Japanese exterior Commerce during WW2 Times]]\n*[[Japanese-German pre-WWII industrial co-operation]]\n*[[Japanese Nuclear Weapons Development]]\n*[[Empire of Japan (foreign commerce and shipping)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080312173606/http://www.users.bigpond.com/battleforAustralia/historicalbackground/JapMilaggro.html JAPAN'S MILITARY AGGRESSION IN EAST ASIA 1931-1937] at users.bigpond.com/battleforaustralia\n* [http://www.historyorb.com/asia/japan_economic_expansion.shtml Japan's Economic Expansion into Manchuria and China in World War Two] at historyorb.com Author: James Graham Published: May, 2004\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm Why Japan ''Really'' Lost The War]\n\n{{JapanEmpireNavbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Empire Of Japan, Economy Of the}}\n[[Category:Economic history of Japan]]\n[[Category:Economic history of World War II]]\n[[Category:Empire of Japan|Economy]]\n", "name_user": "Chirag.Saluja", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor punctuation & grammer", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Empire_of_Japan"}

They are usually made of a specially designed 7-ply [[maple]] [[plywood]] deck with a [[Varnish#Polyurethane|polyurethane coating]] for smoothness and durability and wheels attached to the underside.\n\nThe skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot with other foot balanced on the board, or by [[Pump (skateboarding)|pumping]] one's legs in structures such as a bowl or [[half pipe]]. A skateboard can also be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is their right foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|goofy]];\" if the rider's leading foot is their left foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|regular]].\" If the rider is normally regular but chooses to ride goofy, they are said to be riding in \"[[Footedness#Switch,_Fakie_and_Nollie|switch]],\" and vice versa. A skater is typically more comfortable pushing with their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is commonly referred to as riding \"mongo\", and has negative connotations of style and effectiveness in the skateboarding community.\n\nIn the early 2000s, [[electric skateboard]]s have also appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. \n\nThere is no governing body that declares any regulations on what constitutes a skateboard or the parts from which it is assembled. Historically, the skateboard has conformed both to contemporary trends and to the ever-evolving array of stunts performed by riders/users, who require a certain functionality from the board. The board shape depends largely upon its desired function. [[Longboard (skateboard)|Longboards]] are a type of skateboard with a longer [[wheelbase]] and larger, softer wheels. \n\nThe two main types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard must be concaved to perform tricks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |title=Skateboards: Fit & Types |publisher=LiveStrong |accessdate=June 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014011932/http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing,  while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks and riding in skateparks.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Skateboarding}}\nSkateboarding started in California in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |title=Skateboarding: From Wooden Box Boards to Commercial Mainstream |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414144506/https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |archive-date=April 14, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first skateboards were made from [[roller skates]] (attached to a board).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |title=Scholastic News: Skateboarding|website=teacher.scholastic.com |access-date=March 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403111056/http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |archive-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Skateboarding gained in popularity because of surfing: in fact, skateboarding was initially referred to as \"sidewalk surfing\". Initially, skateboards were handmade from wooden boxes and planks by individuals. Companies started manufacturing skateboards in 1959, as the sport became more popular.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27\u201377 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> In postwar America, society was carefree with children commonly playing in the streets.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27\u201377 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> Boards were also continuing to evolve as companies tried to make them lighter, stronger and improve their performance.\n\nSkateboarding is a very individual activity. Skateboarding still hasn't stopped evolving, and skaters are coming up with new tricks all the time. Since 2000, due to attention in the media and products like skateboarding video games, children's skateboards and commercialization, skateboarding has been pulled into the mainstream. As more interest and money has been invested into skateboarding, more skate parks, and better skateboards have become available. In addition, the continuing interest has motivated skateboarding companies have to keep innovating and inventing new things. In 2020, skateboarding will appear for the first time in the Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/08/03/skateboarding-olympics-2020-tokyo-games/| title=Skateboarding Will be in the 2020 Olympics| date=August 3, 2016| access-date=May 6, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507003554/https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/08/03/skateboarding-olympics-2020-tokyo-games/| archive-date=May 7, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Parts==\nThe following descriptions cover skateboard parts that are most prevalent in popular and modern forms of skateboarding. Many parts exist with exotic or alternative constructions. A traditional complete skateboard consists of the deck (often with griptape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), bushings, nuts and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Older decks also included plastic parts such as side, tail, and nose guards.\n\n===Deck===\n[[Image:Skateboard.JPG|thumb|The side of a skateboard]] Modern decks vary in size, but most are {{convert|7|to|10.5|in|cm}} wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when skateboarding. Standard skateboard decks are usually between {{convert|28|and|33|in|cm}} long. The underside of the deck can be printed with a design by the manufacturer, blank, or decorated by any other means.\n\n\"Long\" boards are usually over {{convert|36|in|cm}} long. Plastic [[Penny board|\"penny\"]] boards are typically about {{convert|22|in|cm}} long.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/arts-new-ideas/from-skateboard-and-longboard-to-penny-board-fall-2102 |title=From Skateboard and Longboard to Penny Board |date=February 2, 2010 |publisher=Historipedia |accessdate=December 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423012101/https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/arts-new-ideas/from-skateboard-and-longboard-to-penny-board-fall-2102 |archive-date=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }})</ref> Some larger penny boards over {{convert|27|in|cm}} long are called \"nickel\" boards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rideasf.com/lifestyle/penny-nickel-skateboard-review/ |title=Penny Nickel Skateboard Review |publisher=Ride as F*ck |accessdate=December 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213020301/http://rideasf.com/lifestyle/penny-nickel-skateboard-review/ |archive-date=December 13, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe longboard, a common variant of the skateboard, is used for higher speed and rough surface boarding, and they are much more expensive. \"Old school\" boards (those made in the 1970s\u201380s or modern boards that mimic their shape) are generally wider and often have only one kicktail. Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |title= SKATEBOARDS |accessdate= August 30, 2017|date= June 15, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010205/http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |archive-date= August 30, 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Grip tape===\nGrip tape is a sheet of paper or fabric with adhesive on one side and a surface similar to fine sandpaper on the other. Rubber grip tape is also available, which has gathered some popularity due to the lack of damage it causes to skate shoes. Grip tape is applied to the top surface of a board to allow the rider's feet to grip the surface and help the skater stay on the board while doing tricks. Grip tape is usually black, but is also available in many different colors such as pink, red, yellow, checkered, camo, and even clear. Often, they have designs die-cut to show the color of the board, or to display the board's company logo. Grip tape accumulates dirt and other substances that will inhibit grip, so use of a grip eraser or rubber eraser is necessary after riding through mud or with dirty shoes. \n\n===Trucks===\n[[File:Skateboard-truck.jpg|thumb|An [[Independent Truck Company|Independent]] brand skateboard truck]] \nAttached to the deck are two metal (usually made of [[aluminum alloy]]) trucks, which connect the wheels and bearings to the deck. The trucks are further composed of two parts.\n\nThe top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the ''baseplate'', and beneath it is the ''hanger''. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are ''[[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]]'', also ''rubbers'' or ''[[grommet]]s'', that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The ''bushings'' cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. Bushings come in varying shapes and urethane formulas as well as [[durometer]]s, which may affect turning, rebound and durability. A bolt called a ''[[Kingpin (mechanics)|kingpin]]'' holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be loosened for increased turning or tightened for more stability. The standard kingpin nut size is {{frac|3|8}} - [[Threads per inch|24]] [[Unified Thread Standard#Designation|UNF]].\nThe position of the hanger with respect to the baseplate is determined by the ''pivot'', a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a ''pivot cup'', a plastic part that takes most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assists in centering. The pivot cup should be periodically lubricated to ensure a smooth turn.\n\nIn general, an axle width should be chosen that is close to the width of the deck it will be used with.<ref>Has a guide to choosing the right size trucks for a skateboard deck http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426135324/http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck |date=April 26, 2010 }}</ref> For example, a {{convert|7.75|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between {{convert|7.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.0|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is {{frac|5|16}} - 24 UNF, and the thinner \"jam\" style with an optional nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels to get in the way when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small reduce stability and can cause wheel bite to occur more easily when turning.\n\nLongboard-specific trucks are a recent development. A longboard truck has the kingpin laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees<ref>Contains a list of dimensions for popular longboard truck manufacturer {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>) to the deck, giving a greater degree of turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard-specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.\n\n===Wheels===\nThe [[wheel]]s of a skateboard are usually made of [[polyurethane]], and come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger diameters ({{convert|55\u201385|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. Smaller diameters ({{convert|48\u201354|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}) keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity which allows for a better response time, but also make for a slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding. Wheels also are available in a variety of hardnesses usually measured on the [[Shore durometer]] \"A\" scale. Again like car tires, wheels range from the very soft (about Shore A 75) to the very hard (about Shore A 101). As the A scale stops at 100, any wheels labeled 101A or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the \"B\" or \"D\" scales, which have a larger and more accurate range of hardness. Modern street skaters prefer medium-sized wheels (usually {{convert|51\u201354|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as small wheels with lighter trucks can make [[Skateboarding trick|tricks]] like [[kickflip]]s and other flip tricks easier by keeping the center of gravity of the skateboard closer to the deck, thus making the deck easier to spin. Street wheels are harder (A 100/A 101). [[Vertical ramp]] or \"vert\" skating requires larger wheels (usually {{convert|55\u201365|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as it involves higher speeds. Vert wheels are also usually slightly softer (A 98/ A 99), allowing them to maintain high speed on ramps without sliding. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels ({{convert|60\u201375|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from {{convert|60 to 100|mm|in|2|abbr=in}}. These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard videographers as well, as they minimize noise and roll smoothly over most types of terrain.\n\n===Bearings===\n[[File:BallBearing.gif|thumb|An animation of the working principle for a [[ball bearing]]. ''N.B. The diagram shows an 8-balled-bearing whereas a skateboard bearing is typically 7-balled'']]\n\nEach skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two [[ball bearing]]s. With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard \"608\" size, with a bore of {{convert|8|mm|in|3|abbr=in}} (or {{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}} depending on the axle), an outer diameter of {{convert|22|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}, and a width of {{convert|7|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}. These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used. Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the [[ABEC scale]]. The starts with ABEC1 as the lowest, followed by 3, 5, 7, and 9. It is a common misconception that the higher ABECs are better for skateboarding, as the ABEC rating only measures [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], which do not necessarily apply to skateboards. Bearing performance is determined by how well maintained the bearings are. Maintenance on bearings includes periodically cleaning and lubricating them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance/ |title=Lubrication |access-date=June 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529023018/http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance |archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bearings that are kept unmaintained have their performance greatly lowered and will soon need to be replaced. Bearing cleaning kits are commonly available on the market. The ABEC rating does not determine the speed or durability of a skateboard bearing. In particular, the ABEC rating says nothing about how well a bearing handles axial (side-to-side) loads, which are severe in most skateboard applications. Many companies do not show the ABEC rating, such as [[Bones Bearings]], which makes bearings specifically for skateboarding, often marketed as \"Skate Rated\". Each bearing usually contains 7 steel or ceramic [[Ball (bearing)|bearing balls]], although other configurations are used as well.\n\n===Hardware===\nMounting hardware is a set of eight 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an [[Allen wrench|Allen]] or [[Phillips (screw head)|Phillips]] head, and matching nylon [[locknut]]s. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of risers) to the board. Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers.\n\n==Optional components==\n\n===Risers/wedges===\nRisers increase the space between the truck and the deck. This allows the truck to twist further without causing wheel bite (when the wheel touches the deck and stops rotating).\nWedges can be used to change the [[steering|turning]] characteristics of a truck.<ref>A guide describing turning characteristics of different Riser/Wedge types {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Shock Pads===\nShock pads are made of polyurethane and rubber. They are very similar to risers but vary in the fact that their sole purpose is to cushion the board from the trucks. Since the trucks are metal and the board wood, whenever the board hits the ground after doing a trick, the energy goes through the truck to the board\u200a\u2500\u200athis has caused boards to crack, split, or even break in half, and shock pads were created to prevent this.\n\n===Rails/ribs===\nRails (or ribs), are narrow strips of plastic or metal that are attached under the deck lengthwise along the edges. They are used for additional grip for grabs, and to enhance sliding while protecting the deck's graphics at the same time. Rails also provide a more consistent feel for slides, as the slide of a regular [https://bestskateboard.net/ skateboard] will suffer from the wear of the paint or varnish on the bottom of the board. Although rarely used anymore, they are useful for experienced skaters that are capable of grabs.\n\n===Sliptape===\nSliptape is a clear piece of self-adhesive plastic that sticks to the underside of a deck. It helps protect the board's graphics and allows the board to slide more easily. Another name for this is everslick.\n\n===Lapper===\nA lapper is a plastic cover that is fastened to the rear truck and serves to protect the kingpin when grinding. It also prevents hang-ups by providing a smoother transition for the truck when it hits an obstacle or a metal pipe or round bar.\n\n===Nose guard===\nA nose guard is a plastic bumper used to protect the front of a skateboard which was once popular but is now only commonly seen on older board models.\n\n===Tail guard (a.k.a. skid plate)===\nBolted onto the underside of the tail end of a skateboard, the tail guard (also known as a \"skid plate\") protected the tail end from skid stops and other maneuvers that would otherwise wear away the wood (commonly known as razor tail) and decrease the longevity of the tail. Typically made of plastic, these were widely popular in the '80s but their usage quickly diminished with the arrival of two-tail board designs, which became increasingly popular in the 1990s.\n\n===Tail Devil===\nA \"tail devil\" is a sparking device made of flint which is placed either on the tail or nose of the skateboard (or both) to create a sparking effect mainly visible after dark when the tail or nose of the boards scrapes against the ground.\n\n===Copers===\nPlastic half tubing that protected the axles of the trucks. In the 1980\u201385 period, shopping cart handles were cut by some to fit as a makeshift coper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Sublimated graphic===\n[[Sublimation (phase transition)]] is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic phase transition that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram.

They are usually made of a specially designed 7-ply [[maple]] [[plywood]] deck with a [[Varnish#Polyurethane|polyurethane coating]] for smoothness and durability and wheels attached to the underside.\n\nThe skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot with other foot balanced on the board, or by [[Pump (skateboarding)|pumping]] one's legs in structures such as a bowl or [[half pipe]]. A skateboard can also be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is their right foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|goofy]];\" if the rider's leading foot is their left foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|regular]].\" If the rider is normally regular but chooses to ride goofy, they are said to be riding in \"[[Footedness#Switch,_Fakie_and_Nollie|switch]],\" and vice versa. A skater is typically more comfortable pushing with their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is commonly referred to as riding \"mongo\", and has negative connotations of style and effectiveness in the skateboarding community.\n\nIn the early 2000s, [[electric skateboard]]s have also appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. \n\nThere is no governing body that declares any regulations on what constitutes a skateboard or the parts from which it is assembled. Historically, the skateboard has conformed both to contemporary trends and to the ever-evolving array of stunts performed by riders/users, who require a certain functionality from the board. The board shape depends largely upon its desired function. [[Longboard (skateboard)|Longboards]] are a type of skateboard with a longer [[wheelbase]] and larger, softer wheels. \n\nThe two main types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard must be concaved to perform tricks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |title=Skateboards: Fit & Types |publisher=LiveStrong |accessdate=June 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014011932/http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing,  while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks and riding in skateparks.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Skateboarding}}\nSkateboarding started in California in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |title=Skateboarding: From Wooden Box Boards to Commercial Mainstream |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414144506/https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |archive-date=April 14, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first skateboards were made from [[roller skates]] (attached to a board).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |title=Scholastic News: Skateboarding|website=teacher.scholastic.com |access-date=March 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403111056/http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |archive-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Skateboarding gained in popularity because of surfing: in fact, skateboarding was initially referred to as \"sidewalk surfing\". Initially, skateboards were handmade from wooden boxes and planks by individuals. Companies started manufacturing skateboards in 1959, as the sport became more popular.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27\u201377 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> In postwar America, society was carefree with children commonly playing in the streets.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27\u201377 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> Boards were also continuing to evolve as companies tried to make them lighter, stronger and improve their performance.\n\nSkateboarding is a very individual activity. Skateboarding still hasn't stopped evolving, and skaters are coming up with new tricks all the time. Since 2000, due to attention in the media and products like skateboarding video games, children's skateboards and commercialization, skateboarding has been pulled into the mainstream. As more interest and money has been invested into skateboarding, more skate parks, and better skateboards have become available. In addition, the continuing interest has motivated skateboarding companies have to keep innovating and inventing new things. In 2020, skateboarding will appear for the first time in the Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/08/03/skateboarding-olympics-2020-tokyo-games/| title=Skateboarding Will be in the 2020 Olympics| date=August 3, 2016| access-date=May 6, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507003554/https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/08/03/skateboarding-olympics-2020-tokyo-games/| archive-date=May 7, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Parts==\nThe following descriptions cover skateboard parts that are most prevalent in popular and modern forms of skateboarding. Many parts exist with exotic or alternative constructions. A traditional complete skateboard consists of the deck (often with griptape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), bushings, nuts and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Older decks also included plastic parts such as side, tail, and nose guards.\n\n===Deck===\n[[Image:Skateboard.JPG|thumb|The side of a skateboard]] Modern decks vary in size, but most are {{convert|7|to|10.5|in|cm}} wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when skateboarding. Standard skateboard decks are usually between {{convert|28|and|33|in|cm}} long. The underside of the deck can be printed with a design by the manufacturer, blank, or decorated by any other means.\n\n\"Long\" boards are usually over {{convert|36|in|cm}} long. Plastic [[Penny board|\"penny\"]] boards are typically about {{convert|22|in|cm}} long.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/arts-new-ideas/from-skateboard-and-longboard-to-penny-board-fall-2102 |title=From Skateboard and Longboard to Penny Board |date=February 2, 2010 |publisher=Historipedia |accessdate=December 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423012101/https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/arts-new-ideas/from-skateboard-and-longboard-to-penny-board-fall-2102 |archive-date=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }})</ref> Some larger penny boards over {{convert|27|in|cm}} long are called \"nickel\" boards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rideasf.com/lifestyle/penny-nickel-skateboard-review/ |title=Penny Nickel Skateboard Review |publisher=Ride as F*ck |accessdate=December 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213020301/http://rideasf.com/lifestyle/penny-nickel-skateboard-review/ |archive-date=December 13, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe longboard, a common variant of the skateboard, is used for higher speed and rough surface boarding, and they are much more expensive. \"Old school\" boards (those made in the 1970s\u201380s or modern boards that mimic their shape) are generally wider and often have only one kicktail. Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |title= SKATEBOARDS |accessdate= August 30, 2017|date= June 15, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010205/http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |archive-date= August 30, 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Grip tape===\nGrip tape is a sheet of paper or fabric with adhesive on one side and a surface similar to fine sandpaper on the other. Rubber grip tape is also available, which has gathered some popularity due to the lack of damage it causes to skate shoes. Grip tape is applied to the top surface of a board to allow the rider's feet to grip the surface and help the skater stay on the board while doing tricks. Grip tape is usually black, but is also available in many different colors such as pink, red, yellow, checkered, camo, and even clear. Often, they have designs die-cut to show the color of the board, or to display the board's company logo. Grip tape accumulates dirt and other substances that will inhibit grip, so use of a grip eraser or rubber eraser is necessary after riding through mud or with dirty shoes. \n\n===Trucks===\n[[File:Skateboard-truck.jpg|thumb|An [[Independent Truck Company|Independent]] brand skateboard truck]] \nAttached to the deck are two metal (usually made of [[aluminum alloy]]) trucks, which connect the wheels and bearings to the deck. The trucks are further composed of two parts.\n\nThe top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the ''baseplate'', and beneath it is the ''hanger''. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are ''[[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]]'', also ''rubbers'' or ''[[grommet]]s'', that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The ''bushings'' cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. Bushings come in varying shapes and urethane formulas as well as [[durometer]]s, which may affect turning, rebound and durability. A bolt called a ''[[Kingpin (mechanics)|kingpin]]'' holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be loosened for increased turning or tightened for more stability. The standard kingpin nut size is {{frac|3|8}} - [[Threads per inch|24]] [[Unified Thread Standard#Designation|UNF]].\nThe position of the hanger with respect to the baseplate is determined by the ''pivot'', a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a ''pivot cup'', a plastic part that takes most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assists in centering. The pivot cup should be periodically lubricated to ensure a smooth turn.\n\nIn general, an axle width should be chosen that is close to the width of the deck it will be used with.<ref>Has a guide to choosing the right size trucks for a skateboard deck http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426135324/http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck |date=April 26, 2010 }}</ref> For example, a {{convert|7.75|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between {{convert|7.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.0|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is {{frac|5|16}} - 24 UNF, and the thinner \"jam\" style with an optional nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels to get in the way when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small reduce stability and can cause wheel bite to occur more easily when turning.\n\nLongboard-specific trucks are a recent development. A longboard truck has the kingpin laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees<ref>Contains a list of dimensions for popular longboard truck manufacturer {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>) to the deck, giving a greater degree of turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard-specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.\n\n===Wheels===\nThe [[wheel]]s of a skateboard are usually made of [[polyurethane]], and come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger diameters ({{convert|55\u201385|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. Smaller diameters ({{convert|48\u201354|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}) keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity which allows for a better response time, but also make for a slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding. Wheels also are available in a variety of hardnesses usually measured on the [[Shore durometer]] \"A\" scale. Again like car tires, wheels range from the very soft (about Shore A 75) to the very hard (about Shore A 101). As the A scale stops at 100, any wheels labeled 101A or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the \"B\" or \"D\" scales, which have a larger and more accurate range of hardness. Modern street skaters prefer medium-sized wheels (usually {{convert|51\u201354|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as small wheels with lighter trucks can make [[Skateboarding trick|tricks]] like [[kickflip]]s and other flip tricks easier by keeping the center of gravity of the skateboard closer to the deck, thus making the deck easier to spin. Street wheels are harder (A 100/A 101). [[Vertical ramp]] or \"vert\" skating requires larger wheels (usually {{convert|55\u201365|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as it involves higher speeds. Vert wheels are also usually slightly softer (A 98/ A 99), allowing them to maintain high speed on ramps without sliding. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels ({{convert|60\u201375|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from {{convert|60 to 100|mm|in|2|abbr=in}}. These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard videographers as well, as they minimize noise and roll smoothly over most types of terrain.\n\n===Bearings===\n[[File:BallBearing.gif|thumb|An animation of the working principle for a [[ball bearing]]. ''N.B. The diagram shows an 8-balled-bearing whereas a skateboard bearing is typically 7-balled'']]\n\nEach skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two [[ball bearing]]s. With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard \"608\" size, with a bore of {{convert|8|mm|in|3|abbr=in}} (or {{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}} depending on the axle), an outer diameter of {{convert|22|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}, and a width of {{convert|7|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}. These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used. Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the [[ABEC scale]]. The starts with ABEC1 as the lowest, followed by 3, 5, 7, and 9. It is a common misconception that the higher ABECs are better for skateboarding, as the ABEC rating only measures [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], which do not necessarily apply to skateboards. Bearing performance is determined by how well maintained the bearings are. Maintenance on bearings includes periodically cleaning and lubricating them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance/ |title=Lubrication |access-date=June 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529023018/http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance |archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bearings that are kept unmaintained have their performance greatly lowered and will soon need to be replaced. Bearing cleaning kits are commonly available on the market. The ABEC rating does not determine the speed or durability of a skateboard bearing. In particular, the ABEC rating says nothing about how well a bearing handles axial (side-to-side) loads, which are severe in most skateboard applications. Many companies do not show the ABEC rating, such as [[Bones Bearings]], which makes bearings specifically for skateboarding, often marketed as \"Skate Rated\". Each bearing usually contains 7 steel or ceramic [[Ball (bearing)|bearing balls]], although other configurations are used as well.\n\n===Hardware===\nMounting hardware is a set of eight 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an [[Allen wrench|Allen]] or [[Phillips (screw head)|Phillips]] head, and matching nylon [[locknut]]s. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of risers) to the board. Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers.\n\n==Optional components==\n\n===Risers/wedges===\nRisers increase the space between the truck and the deck. This allows the truck to twist further without causing wheel bite (when the wheel touches the deck and stops rotating).\nWedges can be used to change the [[steering|turning]] characteristics of a truck.<ref>A guide describing turning characteristics of different Riser/Wedge types {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Shock Pads===\nShock pads are made of polyurethane and rubber. They are very similar to risers but vary in the fact that their sole purpose is to cushion the board from the trucks. Since the trucks are metal and the board wood, whenever the board hits the ground after doing a trick, the energy goes through the truck to the board\u200a\u2500\u200athis has caused boards to crack, split, or even break in half, and shock pads were created to prevent this.\n\n===Rails/ribs===\nRails (or ribs), are narrow strips of plastic or metal that are attached under the deck lengthwise along the edges. They are used for additional grip for grabs, and to enhance sliding while protecting the deck's graphics at the same time. Rails also provide a more consistent feel for slides, as the slide of a regular skateboard will suffer from the wear of the paint or varnish on the bottom of the board. Although rarely used anymore, they are useful for experienced skaters that are capable of grabs.\n\n===Sliptape===\nSliptape is a clear piece of self-adhesive plastic that sticks to the underside of a deck. It helps protect the board's graphics and allows the board to slide more easily. Another name for this is everslick.\n\n===Lapper===\nA lapper is a plastic cover that is fastened to the rear truck and serves to protect the kingpin when grinding. It also prevents hang-ups by providing a smoother transition for the truck when it hits an obstacle or a metal pipe or round bar.\n\n===Nose guard===\nA nose guard is a plastic bumper used to protect the front of a skateboard which was once popular but is now only commonly seen on older board models.\n\n===Tail guard (a.k.a. skid plate)===\nBolted onto the underside of the tail end of a skateboard, the tail guard (also known as a \"skid plate\") protected the tail end from skid stops and other maneuvers that would otherwise wear away the wood (commonly known as razor tail) and decrease the longevity of the tail. Typically made of plastic, these were widely popular in the '80s but their usage quickly diminished with the arrival of two-tail board designs, which became increasingly popular in the 1990s.\n\n===Tail Devil===\nA \"tail devil\" is a sparking device made of flint which is placed either on the tail or nose of the skateboard (or both) to create a sparking effect mainly visible after dark when the tail or nose of the boards scrapes against the ground.\n\n===Copers===\nPlastic half tubing that protected the axles of the trucks. In the 1980\u201385 period, shopping cart handles were cut by some to fit as a makeshift coper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Sublimated graphic===\n[[Sublimation (phase transition)]] is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic phase transition that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram. In this case, ink is transferred to a base layer, fibreglass for example, through heat and pressure, the result is a full color graphic that will not come off as easily as the more common heat transfers.
