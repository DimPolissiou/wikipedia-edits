For the race, ten [[Hurdling|hurdles]] of a height of {{convert|83.8|cm|in}} are placed along a straight course of {{convert|100|m|yds|2}}. The first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13 metres from the starting line. The next 9 hurdles are set at a distance of 8.5 metres from each other, and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 10.5 metres long. The hurdles are set up so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner, but weighted so this is disadvantageous. Fallen hurdles do not count against runners provided that they do not run into them on purpose. Like the [[100 metres]] sprint, the 100 m hurdles begins with athletes in [[starting blocks]].\n\nThe fastest 100 m hurdlers run the distance in a time of around 12.5 seconds. The [[world record]] set by [[Kendra Harrison]] stands at 12.20 seconds.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0531-035, Cornelia Oschkenat, Heike Thoelo, Kerstin Knabe.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Cornelia Oschkenat]] (nearest camera), [[Heike Theele]] and [[Kerstin Knabe]] (1986)]]\n\nThe [[Olympic Games]] had included the 80 m hurdles in the program from 1932 to 1968. Starting with the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] the women's race was lengthened to 100 m hurdles.\n\nThe hurdles sprint race has been run by women since the beginning of women's athletics, just after the end of World War I. The distances and hurdle heights varied widely in the beginning. While the men had zeroed in on the [[110 m hurdles]], the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive F\u00e9minine Internationale|International Women's Sport Federation]] had registered records for eight different disciplines by 1926 (60 [[yards]]/75&nbsp;cm height, 60 yards/61&nbsp;cm, 65 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 83 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 100 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 100 yards/61&nbsp;cm, 120 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 110 metres/75&nbsp;cm). At the first [[Women's World Games]] in 1922 a 100 m hurdles race was run.\n\nFrom 1926 until 1968 on only the 80 m distance was run. For the 80 m race women had to clear eight hurdles placed at a distance of 8 metres from each other and a height of 76.2&nbsp;cm.\n\nJust like with the men's races, until 1935 no more than three hurdles could be knocked over (or the runner was disqualified) and records were only officially registered if the runner had cleared all her hurdles clean. In 1935, this rule was abandoned, and L-shaped hurdles were introduced that fell over forward easily and greatly reduced the risk of injury to the runner.  Hurdles are weighted, so when properly set for the height (for women, closer to the fulcrum of the \"L\"), they serve as a consistent disadvantage to making contact with the barrier.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float: right; text-align:right\"\n|+ Comparison of 80&nbsp;m and 100&nbsp;m hurdles\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Distance\n! rowspan=2 | Number<br>of hurdles\n! rowspan=2 | Height\n! colspan=3 | Distance made up of\n|-\n!

Starting with 1949, the 80 m hurdles was one of the disciplines included in the [[women's pentathlon]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, some experimental races were run over a distance of 100 metres using hurdles with a height of 76.2&nbsp;cm. During the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], a decision was made to introduce the 100 m hurdles using hurdles with a height of 84&nbsp;cm. The first international event in the 100 m hurdles occurred at the European Athletics Championships, which were won by [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]]. The modern 100&nbsp;m race has an extra 2 hurdles compared to the 80&nbsp;m race, which are higher and spaced slightly further apart. The home stretch is shorter by 1.5&nbsp;m.\n\n==Masters athletics==\nA version of the 100 metres hurdles is also used for 50- to 59-year-old men in [[Masters athletics]]. They run the same spacing as women, which coordinates with existing markings on most tracks, but run over 36-inch (0.915 m) hurdles.  In the 60-69 age range, the spacings are changed. Women over age 40 and men over age 70 run 80 metre versions with different heights and spacings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trackinfo.org/hurdles101.html|title=Hurdles 101|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/files/laws_rules/Appendix-A-K.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122064124/http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/files/laws_rules/Appendix-A-K.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Milestones==\n100 m hurdles:\n*First official time registered with hurdles of reduced height (76.2&nbsp;cm): [[Pam Kilborn|Pamela Kilborn]], [[Australia|AUS]], November 26, 1961\n*First official time with hurdles of standard height (83.8&nbsp;cm): 15.1 seconds, [[Connie Pettersson]], USA, May 28, 1966\n*First official world record: 13.3 seconds, [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]], June 20, 1969\n*First runner under 13 seconds: 12.9 seconds, [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]], September 5, 1969\n*First runner under 12.5 seconds:\n**12.3 seconds, [[Annelie Ehrhardt]] [[East Germany|GDR]], July 20, 1973 (last hand timed world record; electronically timed at 12.68 seconds)\n**12.48 seconds, [[Gra\u017cyna Rabsztyn]], [[Poland|POL]], June 10, 1978\n*First runner under 12.3 seconds: 12.29 seconds, [[Yordanka Donkova]] [[Bulgaria|BUL]], August 17, 1986\n*First country to win gold, silver, and bronze in the women's 100 m hurdles in one Olympics: America ([[Brianna Rollins]], [[Nia Ali]] and [[Kristi Castlin]]), 2016; this was also the first time American women achieved such a sweep in any Olympic event<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37120618 |title=Rio Olympics 2016: US women sweep medals in 100m hurdles -

2013 - Kazan (RUS)]]\nThe '''100 metres hurdles''', or '''100-meter hurdles''', is a [[track and field]] event run mainly by women (the male counterpart is the [[110 metres hurdles]]). For the race, ten [[Hurdling|hurdles]] of a height of {{convert|83.8|cm|in}} are placed along a straight course of {{convert|100|m|yds|2}}. The first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13 metres from the starting line. The next 9 hurdles are set at a distance of 8.5 metres from each other, and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 10.5 metres long. The hurdles are set up so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner, but weighted so this is disadvantageous. Fallen hurdles do not count against runners provided that they do not run into them on purpose. Like the [[100 metres]] sprint, the 100 m hurdles begins with athletes in [[starting blocks]].\n\nThe fastest 100 m hurdlers run the distance in a time of around 12.5 seconds. The [[world record]] set by [[Kendra Harrison]] stands at 12.20 seconds.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0531-035, Cornelia Oschkenat, Heike Thoelo, Kerstin Knabe.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Cornelia Oschkenat]] (nearest camera), [[Heike Theele]] and [[Kerstin Knabe]] (1986)]]\n\nThe [[Olympic Games]] had included the 80 m hurdles in the program from 1932 to 1968. Starting with the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] the women's race was lengthened to 100 m hurdles.\n\nThe hurdles sprint race has been run by women since the beginning of women's athletics, just after the end of World War I. The distances and hurdle heights varied widely in the beginning. While the men had zeroed in on the [[110 m hurdles]], the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive F\u00e9minine Internationale|International Women's Sport Federation]] had registered records for eight different disciplines by 1926 (60 [[yards]]/75&nbsp;cm height, 60 yards/61&nbsp;cm, 65 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 83 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 100 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 100 yards/61&nbsp;cm, 120 yards/75&nbsp;cm, 110 metres/75&nbsp;cm). At the first [[Women's World Games]] in 1922 a 100 m hurdles race was run.\n\nFrom 1926 until 1968 on only the 80 m distance was run. For the 80 m race women had to clear eight hurdles placed at a distance of 8 metres from each other and a height of 76.2&nbsp;cm.\n\nJust like with the men's races, until 1935 no more than three hurdles could be knocked over (or the runner was disqualified) and records were only officially registered if the runner had cleared all her hurdles clean. In 1935, this rule was abandoned, and L-shaped hurdles were introduced that fell over forward easily and greatly reduced the risk of injury to the runner.  Hurdles are weighted, so when properly set for the height (for women, closer to the fulcrum of the \"L\"), they serve as a consistent disadvantage to making contact with the barrier.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float: right; text-align:right\"\n|+ Comparison of 80&nbsp;m and 100&nbsp;m hurdles\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Distance\n! rowspan=2 | Number<br>of hurdles\n! rowspan=2 | Height\n! colspan=3 | Distance made up of\n|-\n!

Starting with 1949, the 80 m hurdles was one of the disciplines included in the [[women's pentathlon]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, some experimental races were run over a distance of 100 metres using hurdles with a height of 76.2&nbsp;cm. During the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], a decision was made to introduce the 100 m hurdles using hurdles with a height of 84&nbsp;cm. The first international event in the 100 m hurdles occurred at the European Athletics Championships, which were won by [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]]. The modern 100&nbsp;m race has an extra 2 hurdles compared to the 80&nbsp;m race, which are higher and spaced slightly further apart. The home stretch is shorter by 1.5&nbsp;m.\n\n==Masters athletics==\nA version of the 100 metres hurdles is also used for 50- to 59-year-old men in [[Masters athletics]]. They run the same spacing as women, which coordinates with existing markings on most tracks, but run over 36-inch (0.915 m) hurdles.  In the 60-69 age range, the spacings are changed. Women over age 40 and men over age 70 run 80 metre versions with different heights and spacings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trackinfo.org/hurdles101.html|title=Hurdles 101|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/files/laws_rules/Appendix-A-K.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122064124/http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/files/laws_rules/Appendix-A-K.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Milestones==\n100 m hurdles:\n*First official time registered with hurdles of reduced height (76.2&nbsp;cm): [[Pam Kilborn|Pamela Kilborn]], [[Australia|AUS]], November 26, 1961\n*First official time with hurdles of standard height (83.8&nbsp;cm): 15.1 seconds, [[Connie Pettersson]], USA, May 28, 1966\n*First official world record: 13.3 seconds, [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]], June 20, 1969\n*First runner under 13 seconds: 12.9 seconds, [[Karin Balzer]], [[East Germany|GDR]], September 5, 1969\n*First runner under 12.5 seconds:\n**12.3 seconds, [[Annelie Ehrhardt]] [[East Germany|GDR]], July 20, 1973 (last hand timed world record; electronically timed at 12.68 seconds)\n**12.48 seconds, [[Gra\u017cyna Rabsztyn]], [[Poland|POL]], June 10, 1978\n*First runner under 12.3 seconds: 12.29 seconds, [[Yordanka Donkova]] [[Bulgaria|BUL]], August 17, 1986\n*First country to win gold, silver, and bronze in the women's 100 m hurdles in one Olympics: America ([[Brianna Rollins]], [[Nia Ali]] and [[Kristi Castlin]]), 2016; this was also the first time American women achieved such a sweep in any Olympic event<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37120618 |title=Rio Olympics 2016: US women sweep medals in 100m hurdles -

Vaihingen is situated on the river [[Enz]], and has a population of around 30,000. The former 'district-capital' is now part of the [[Ludwigsburg (district)|district of Ludwigsburg]] in the ''Land'' (state) of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. It is 25&nbsp;km northwest of [[Stuttgart]], and 15&nbsp;km west of [[Ludwigsburg]]. Not to be confused with [[Stuttgart-Vaihingen|Vaihingen]], a district of Stuttgart.\n\n==History==\nVaihingen may date back as far as 799 a.d., but the documents are not clear.  In 1252 documents refer directly to Vaihingen as a town, established by Count Gottfried von Vaihingen. The city changed hands several times.  In the sixteenth century it became a Protestant city.  During the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), Vaihingen was besieged by both the Protestant and Catholic warring factions. The consequences of the 1848 revolution caused harvest failures and inflation, and the city population diminished by a large emigration.  In the early 1900s, a connection to the railroad network brought more people and industries to Vaihingen. In 1938 Vaihingen became a regional center.\n\nVaihingen was the site of a concentration camp during World War II. See [[Vaihingen an der Enz concentration camp]].\n\n==Mayor==\nAt the top of the town is since 1256 the [[mayor]] and the court, consisting of twelve citizens, including four mayors. Chairman of the court was the official mayor. With the elevation to [[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]] on January 1, 1973, the mayor bears the official title Lord mayor. He is directly elected by the electorate every 8 years. He is chairman of the municipal council. His general deputy is the first councilor with the official title of mayor.\n\nMayors since 1893\n* 1893-1899: Karl Friedrich Richard Bohringer, Stadtschulthei\u00df,\n* 1900-1907: Ferdinand Bentel, Stadtschulthei\u00df,\n* 1907-1911: Christian Wilhelm Wischuf, Stadtschulthei\u00df\n* 1912-1923: Matthew H\u00e4selin, Stadtschulthei\u00df,\n* 1923-1926: vacant; the official duties were performed by several councilors as temporary administrators\n* 1926-1936: Hermann Linkenheil, mayor\n* 1936-1945: Karl Schmid, mayor\n* 1945-1954: Ludwig L\u00f6rcher, mayor\n* 1954-1981: Gerhard Palm, mayor, from 1973 lord mayor\n* 1982-2006: Heinz K\u00e4lberer, mayor\n* 2006-present: Gerd Maisch, mayor\n\nOn May 7, 2006, Gerd Maisch (previously mayor of [[Tamm]]), was elected as the new mayor of Vaihingen. He took office on September 1, 2006. Gerd Maisch won against Matthias Ehrlein ([[Stutensee]]), and Helga Eberle ([[Aurich]]) with 62% of the votes.\n\n==Things==\nVaihingen is located on the ''W\u00fcrttemberger Weinstra\u00dfe'' and on the southern route of the [[German Timber-Frame Road]], both routes pass many sights.\n[[FC G\u00fcndelbach]]\n\n==Museums==\nVaihingen has a municipal museum in the St. Peter's Kirche and a wine museum in the old winery in the district Horrheim.\n[[File:HorrheimRathaus.jpg|thumb|242px|Horrheim Town hall]]\n\n==KZ-memorial==\nThe memorial for the concentration camp Vaihingen in the Glattbachtal was opened on April 16,  2005. A twenty minute audiovisual presentation reminiscent of the events of the years 1944 and 1945.\n\n==Landmarks, Sights and Culture==\n\n===Sights===\n\n*'''Marketplace'''\nThe panoramic sight at the market place includes the city hall and the city church (alternative central/main church). Due to devastating fires in 1693 and 1784, housing facilities had to be rebuilt and their architecture dates back to then.\n\n*'''City Hall''' \n[[File:Vaihingen an der Enz-Rathaus-2006-04-08.jpg|thumb|Rathaus Vaihingen an der Enz]]\nA fire destroyed the old city hall building in 1693. It was rebuilt in the same location in 1720, following long years of controversy between the citizens of Vaihingen and the administration of W\u00fcrttemberg. Its paintings date back to 1901. The ground floor was originally used as a sales area for tradesmen.\n\n*'''The Town Wall'''\nThe former Town Wall is partly preserved in the Baedergasse. It is accessible by foot in the direction of the Klingengasse. A broad alley including a stone portraying the coat of arms was built in 1786. Small bridges connect the top level of the buildings and served as escape routes during high flood water.\n\n*'''The Peterskirche (St. Peter's Church)'''\nThe Peterskirche is the oldest church in Vaihingen and dates back to 1490 Roman architecture. Modifications were carried out several times. It remained Vaihingen's cemetery church until 1839. From 1871 onwards, it was used as a gym and was rebuilt again in 1980 according to the old style. The city museum can be found on the top floor of the building. Even today, old gravestones from the former cemetery can still be seen. The museum is open every first Sunday of the month from 2pm \u2013 4pm. Other viewing appointments can be arranged via phone at +497042/98100.\n\n*'''The Haspelturm (Tower of Pulley)'''\nThe Haspelturm, also called \"a thief's tower\" is the oldest tower in Vaihingen. An old roman ornament (\"Rundbogenfries\") indicates that it might have been built as early as the 13th century. The tower's six stories dominate the old town's silhouette. In the first floor the \"Haspel,\" a kind of pulley that was used to lower its prisoners into the dungeon, can be found.\n\n*'''The Pulvertum (lit. \"Powder Tower\")''' \n[[File:Vaihingen an der Enz-Pulverturm-2010-02-28.jpg|thumb|left|Pulverturm]]\nThe Pulverturm is a former prison with massive walls up to three meters thick. The former corner tower of the city's defense wall was built in 1492 and served among others as a prison, a home of homeless people and a slaughterhouse. Today the tower, with its historic atmosphere, can be used as an extraordinary place for special occasions, in particular art exhibitions.\n\n*'''The City Church'''\nThe City Church was built in 1513.  Its current appearance came to be after the fire of 1693. Before that fire, the church suffered from destructions because of the fires in 1617 and 1618. The tympanum over the south entrance (carrying the cross) is from 1521. In 1892-93 the inside of the church was rebuilt by the master-builder Dolmetsch. That is when the organ was put in the place where it still sits today. Moreover, galleries have been included. These galleries as well as the outside stairways at the south entrance were removed in the 1960s.\n\n*'''Kaltenstein Castle'''\nThis castle is Vaihingen's landmark. It was built on a rocket of Muschelkalk (Middle Trias). It was the former seat of the area's duke and was first mentioned in 1096 as ''castrum vehingen''. Duke Karl Alexander had it renovated in 1734 and later fortified. In the following years it was used as a garrison and a hospital, from 1842 onwards as a workhouse. Today, it is the seat of a social, Christian charity organisation (\"Christlichens Jugenddorf\").\n[[File:VaihingenBurg.jpg|thumb|right|Kaltenstein Castle]]\n\n===Culture===\n\n*'''May Festival'''\nThe May Festival Vaihingen Enz is one of the oldest children's festivals in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, first documented in 1687. Despite being held yearly on Pentecost (May or June), it is a non-religious festival. The highlight of the festival is a parade presenting several historic events as well as current sportsclubs and institutions of Vaihingen. Many people who moved away from Vaihingen take the opportunity to visit their hometown on this event.\n\n==People==\n\n* [[Johann Jacob Zimmermann]] (1644-1693), astronomer, mathematician and theologian\n* [[Jacob Friedrich von Abel]] (1751-1829), professor of philosophy, published his \"Introduction to the doctrine of spirituality\" (\"Einleitung in die Seelenlehre\") in Stuttgart, 1786.\n* [[Karl Friedrich Hensler]] (1759\u20131825), theater director and theater author\n* [[Karl Gerok]] (1815\u20131890), preacher and religious poet\n* [[Konstantin von Neurath]] (1873\u20131956), German diplomat remembered mostly for having served as Foreign minister of Germany between 1932 and 1938.\n* [[Friedrich Kellner]] (1885\u20131970) Chief Justice Inspector, diarist, his [[My Opposition|10-volume diary]] was exhibited at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in 2005 and is the subject of the Canadian documentary, [[My Opposition: the Diaries of Friedrich Kellner]].\n* [[Karl Blessing]] (1900-1971), President of the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] (1958-1969) \n* [[Hartwig Gauder]] (born 1954), athlete, Olympic champion and world champion in the 50-kilometer walk\n* Carolin Kl\u00f6ckner (*1995), [[German Wine Queen|German wine ambassador]]\n\n== Notes ==\n''Vaihingen an der Enz'' is located on the western periphery of the ''Middle Neckar region'', \"Region Mittlerer Neckar\", with its old name.\nSee also\n* [[Stuttgart Metropolitan Region]]\n\n== Literature ==\n* Aker, Gudrun and others: ''Die Stadtkirche in Vaihingen an der Enz.

Vaihingen is situated on the river [[Enz]], and has a population of around 30,000. The former 'district-capital' is now part of the [[Ludwigsburg (district)|district of Ludwigsburg]] in the ''Land'' (state) of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. It is 25&nbsp;km northwest of [[Stuttgart]], and 15&nbsp;km west of [[Ludwigsburg]]. Not to be confused with [[Vaihingen]], a district of Stuttgart.\n\n==History==\nVaihingen may date back as far as 799 a.d., but the documents are not clear.  In 1252 documents refer directly to Vaihingen as a town, established by Count Gottfried von Vaihingen. The city changed hands several times.  In the sixteenth century it became a Protestant city.  During the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), Vaihingen was besieged by both the Protestant and Catholic warring factions. The consequences of the 1848 revolution caused harvest failures and inflation, and the city population diminished by a large emigration.  In the early 1900s, a connection to the railroad network brought more people and industries to Vaihingen. In 1938 Vaihingen became a regional center.\n\nVaihingen was the site of a concentration camp during World War II. See [[Vaihingen an der Enz concentration camp]].\n\n==Mayor==\nAt the top of the town is since 1256 the [[mayor]] and the court, consisting of twelve citizens, including four mayors. Chairman of the court was the official mayor. With the elevation to [[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]] on January 1, 1973, the mayor bears the official title Lord mayor. He is directly elected by the electorate every 8 years. He is chairman of the municipal council. His general deputy is the first councilor with the official title of mayor.\n\nMayors since 1893\n* 1893-1899: Karl Friedrich Richard Bohringer, Stadtschulthei\u00df,\n* 1900-1907: Ferdinand Bentel, Stadtschulthei\u00df,\n* 1907-1911: Christian Wilhelm Wischuf, Stadtschulthei\u00df\n* 1912-1923: Matthew H\u00e4selin, Stadtschulthei\u00df,\n* 1923-1926: vacant; the official duties were performed by several councilors as temporary administrators\n* 1926-1936: Hermann Linkenheil, mayor\n* 1936-1945: Karl Schmid, mayor\n* 1945-1954: Ludwig L\u00f6rcher, mayor\n* 1954-1981: Gerhard Palm, mayor, from 1973 lord mayor\n* 1982-2006: Heinz K\u00e4lberer, mayor\n* 2006-present: Gerd Maisch, mayor\n\nOn May 7, 2006, Gerd Maisch (previously mayor of [[Tamm]]), was elected as the new mayor of Vaihingen. He took office on September 1, 2006. Gerd Maisch won against Matthias Ehrlein ([[Stutensee]]), and Helga Eberle ([[Aurich]]) with 62% of the votes.\n\n==Things==\nVaihingen is located on the ''W\u00fcrttemberger Weinstra\u00dfe'' and on the southern route of the [[German Timber-Frame Road]], both routes pass many sights.\n[[FC G\u00fcndelbach]]\n\n==Museums==\nVaihingen has a municipal museum in the St. Peter's Kirche and a wine museum in the old winery in the district Horrheim.\n[[File:HorrheimRathaus.jpg|thumb|242px|Horrheim Town hall]]\n\n==KZ-memorial==\nThe memorial for the concentration camp Vaihingen in the Glattbachtal was opened on April 16,  2005. A twenty minute audiovisual presentation reminiscent of the events of the years 1944 and 1945.\n\n==Landmarks, Sights and Culture==\n\n===Sights===\n\n*'''Marketplace'''\nThe panoramic sight at the market place includes the city hall and the city church (alternative central/main church). Due to devastating fires in 1693 and 1784, housing facilities had to be rebuilt and their architecture dates back to then.\n\n*'''City Hall''' \n[[File:Vaihingen an der Enz-Rathaus-2006-04-08.jpg|thumb|Rathaus Vaihingen an der Enz]]\nA fire destroyed the old city hall building in 1693. It was rebuilt in the same location in 1720, following long years of controversy between the citizens of Vaihingen and the administration of W\u00fcrttemberg. Its paintings date back to 1901. The ground floor was originally used as a sales area for tradesmen.\n\n*'''The Town Wall'''\nThe former Town Wall is partly preserved in the Baedergasse. It is accessible by foot in the direction of the Klingengasse. A broad alley including a stone portraying the coat of arms was built in 1786. Small bridges connect the top level of the buildings and served as escape routes during high flood water.\n\n*'''The Peterskirche (St. Peter's Church)'''\nThe Peterskirche is the oldest church in Vaihingen and dates back to 1490 Roman architecture. Modifications were carried out several times. It remained Vaihingen's cemetery church until 1839. From 1871 onwards, it was used as a gym and was rebuilt again in 1980 according to the old style. The city museum can be found on the top floor of the building. Even today, old gravestones from the former cemetery can still be seen. The museum is open every first Sunday of the month from 2pm \u2013 4pm. Other viewing appointments can be arranged via phone at +497042/98100.\n\n*'''The Haspelturm (Tower of Pulley)'''\nThe Haspelturm, also called \"a thief's tower\" is the oldest tower in Vaihingen. An old roman ornament (\"Rundbogenfries\") indicates that it might have been built as early as the 13th century. The tower's six stories dominate the old town's silhouette. In the first floor the \"Haspel,\" a kind of pulley that was used to lower its prisoners into the dungeon, can be found.\n\n*'''The Pulvertum (lit. \"Powder Tower\")''' \n[[File:Vaihingen an der Enz-Pulverturm-2010-02-28.jpg|thumb|left|Pulverturm]]\nThe Pulverturm is a former prison with massive walls up to three meters thick. The former corner tower of the city's defense wall was built in 1492 and served among others as a prison, a home of homeless people and a slaughterhouse. Today the tower, with its historic atmosphere, can be used as an extraordinary place for special occasions, in particular art exhibitions.\n\n*'''The City Church'''\nThe City Church was built in 1513.  Its current appearance came to be after the fire of 1693. Before that fire, the church suffered from destructions because of the fires in 1617 and 1618. The tympanum over the south entrance (carrying the cross) is from 1521. In 1892-93 the inside of the church was rebuilt by the master-builder Dolmetsch. That is when the organ was put in the place where it still sits today. Moreover, galleries have been included.

Launched on 26 December 1967 the operation ended on 2 January 1968. The Marines reported the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) lost 131+ killed, while US casualties were 48 killed.\n\n==Background==\nThe operational plan called for [[Special Landing Force]] (SLF) Bravo [[Ground combat element|Battalion Landing Team]] (BLT) [[3rd Battalion, 1st Marines]] to land one company by [[LVTP-5|LVT]] to secure Landing Zone Finch, 3&nbsp;km inland from the beach on the southern Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province border and the rest of the battalion would then land by helicopter. The objective area was the extreme west of the Street Without Joy and intelligence estimates placed as many as 1700 PAVN/[[Vietcong]] (VC) troops in the area. The BLT commander [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Max McQuown described the plans for the operation as \u201cThe scheme of maneuver called for a river crossing over the Song O Lau river once all the BLT task organisation had landed from [[Amphibious ready group|ARG]] shipping. After the river crossing the BLT was to conduct search and destroy operations through 14 towns and villages on a route running southwest from LZ Finch terminating at the town of Ap Phuoc Phu, 11km from LZ Finch. Initial fire support for the operation would be organic 81mm mortars, available on-call air support and naval gunfire support. Once the BLT had closed on the first intermediate objective, Thon Phu Kinh, 105mm howitzers from a platoon of the [[3rd Battalion, 12th Marines]] and a battery from the [[1st Battalion, 11th Marines]] would provide artillery support.\u201d<ref name=Telfer>{{cite book|last=Telfer|first=Gary I.|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: Fighting the North Vietnamese 1967|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|year=1984|url=https://archive.org/details/FightingTheNorthVietnamese|isbn=978-1482538878}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|176}}\n\nInformation relayed to the SLF by a US Army liaison officer with nearby [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) units changed the plan. After securing LZ Finch, the SLF directed the BLT to search new objectives consisting of the coastal villages of Thom Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea ({{Coord|16.7446|N|107.38|E|display=inline, title}}) and Tho Trung An. Intelligence officers suspected PAVN/VC forces were hiding there after evading ARVN operations to the north and west. Once the BLT cleared the two villages, the SLF would continue with the originally planned sweep to the southwest.<ref name=Telfer/>\n\n==Operation==\nThe operation started with Company L, 3/1 Marines landing on Green Beach at 11:00 on 26 December and proceeding to LZ Finch meeting minimal opposition. [[VMM-262|HMM-262]] landed the last elements of the battalion at LZ Finch at 14:15. The SLF commander accompanied by the US Army liaison officer to the ARVN arrived at the battalion command post with orders to change direction and sweep the coastal villages of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea and Trung An. Company L was assigned to sweep Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea with Company M in support. After moving to the edge of the village in LVTs, Company L advanced northwest into the built-up area. By 18:22 Company L had cleared the first village and was well into Trung An. The Marines killed 3 VC and detained 4 suspects, but found no evidence of larger PAVN/VC formations. By 19:40 both Companies established night defensive positions north and west of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea.<ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|176\u20138}}\n\nAt 07:00 on 27 December both companies moved out on another sweep of the two villages. Company M moved north on a line parallel to Trung An so it could begin its sweep of the village from north to south. Company L with the mission to sweep Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea initially moved out to the northeast. Leading eelments of Company L were almost into the south of Trung An when Company L\u2019s commander realised that his lead platoon had not turned south towards Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea. Company L then reversed direction and started towards Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea. As the lead platoon of Company L approached the edge of the village a concealed PAVN/VC force opened up with a devastating barrage of machine gun, rifle, [[Rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) and mortar fire inflicting numerous casualties. The Company commander Captain Thomas Hubbel decided to pull his company back and regroup for an attack. He requested supporting arms fire on Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea while his company prepared for an assault. After two airstrikes followed by naval gunfire Company L assaulted the village but were again met by heavy fire killing Captain Hubbel and his radio operator. Lt Col McQuown lost communications with the company until the acting company executive officer assumed command of the company. While out of radio contact McQuown ordered Company M to move east and south and join the fight on the left flank of Company L. Company M reached its attack position and immediately came under heavy fire. McQuown realised that the 2 companies were up against a major PAVN/VC force in well-prepared defensive positions. McQuown then ordered Company I to move to the south of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea, requested that the SLF land the tank platoon and instructed Company K to relieve the pressure on Companies L and M by attacking the south of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea.<ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|178}}\n\nAfter hitting the area with 81mm mortar fire Company K attacked the south of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea meeting strong resistance and were unable to make any progress until 2 tanks arrived at their position. The tanks\u2019 communication systems had suffered water damage to their communication systems and could only be instructed by voice. While the tanks did knock out some PAVN/VC positions with their 90mm gunfire, the inability to coordinated the tanks\u2019 fire with the Company K assault prevented them from making more than a limited penetration into Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea. All 3 companies continued fight until nightfall. McQuown expect that the PAVN/VC would escape under cover of darkness and so moved Company I to the right flank of Company K where it could control the beach side of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea, Company M to the north would cover part of the beach side by fire, while elements of Companies K and L were moved west of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea.<ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|179}}\n\nOn the morning of 28 December Companies K and I renewed their assault on Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea meeting initial heavy fire but they secured the village by midday. The Marines then conducted a thorough search of the village. McQuown described the search as follows: \u201cThis search revealed a village that was literally a defensive bastion. It was prepared for all-around defense in depth with a network of tunnels you could stand up in, running the full length of the village. Connecting tunnels ran east and west. This tunnel system supported ground level bunkers for machine guns, RPGs and small arms around the entire perimeter of the village. Thus the [PAVN] were able to defend, reinforce or withdraw in any direction. All defensive preparation had been artfully camouflaged with growing vegetation. Residents of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea, questioned after the fight, disclosed that the [PAVN] had been preparing the defense of this village for one year.\u201d The search uncovered numerous machine guns, RPGs, [[AK-47]] rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition which clearly indicated that a major PAVN force had defended the village, not local VC. A dying PAVN soldier confirmed that the force had been the PAVN 116th Battalion. ARVN forces operating northwest of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea found over 100 bodies from the 116th Battalion in sand dunes, the PAVN had apparently evacuated its casualties through the gap between Companies K and L during the night.<ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|179}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 18:00 on 31 December a New Year\u2019s truce went into effect and SLF Bravo began returning to its ships and by 11:30 on 2 January the BLT had left the operational area. Marine losses during the operation were 48 killed, while PAVN/VC losses were 131+ killed.<ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|179}}\n\nOn 30 December 1967 [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Jacob E.

Launched on 26 December 1967 the operation ended on 2 January 1968. The Marines reported the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) lost 131+ killed, while US casualties were 48 killed.\n\n==Background==\nThe operational plan called for [[Special Landing Force]] (SLF) Bravo [[Ground combat element|Battalion Landing Team]] (BLT) [[3rd Battalion, 1st Marines]] to land one company by [[LVTP-5|LVT]] to secure Landing Zone Finch, 3km inland from the beach on the southern Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province border and the rest of the battalion would then land by helicopter. The objective area was the extreme west of the Street Without Joy and intelligence estimates placed as many as 1700 PAVN/[[Vietcong]] (VC) troops in the area. The BLT commander [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Max McQuown described the plans for the operation as \u201cThe scheme of maneuver called for a river crossing over the Song O Lau river once all the BLT task organisation had landed from [[Amphibious ready group|ARG]] shipping. After the river crossing the BLT was to conduct search and destroy operations through 14 towns and villages on a route running southwest from LZ Finch terminating at the town of Ap Phuoc Phu, 11km from LZ Finch. Initial fire support for the operation would be organic 81mm mortars, available on-call air support and naval gunfire support. Once the BLT had closed on the first intermediate objective, Thon Phu Kinh, 105mm howitzers from a platoon of the [[3rd Battalion, 12th Marines]] and a battery from the [[1st Battalion, 11th Marines]] would provide artillery support.\u201d<ref name=Telfer>{{cite book|last=Telfer|first=Gary I.|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: Fighting the North Vietnamese 1967|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|year=1984|url=https://archive.org/details/FightingTheNorthVietnamese|isbn=978-1482538878}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|176}}\n\nInformation relayed to the SLF by a US Army liaison officer with nearby [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) units changed the plan. After securing LZ Finch, the SLF directed the BLT to search new objectives consisting of the coastal villages of Thom Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea ({{Coord|16.7446|N|107.38|E|display=inline, title}}) and Tho Trung An. Intelligence officers suspected PAVN/VC forces were hiding there after evading ARVN operations to the north and west. Once the BLT cleared the two villages, the SLF would continue with the originally planned sweep to the southwest.<ref name=Telfer/>\n\n==Operation==\nThe operation started with Company L, 3/1 Marines landing on Green Beach at 11:00 on 26 December and proceeding to LZ Finch meeting minimal opposition. [[VMM-262|HMM-262]] landed the last elements of the battalion at LZ Finch at 14:15. The SLF commander accompanied by the US Army liaison officer to the ARVN arrived at the battalion command post with orders to change direction and sweep the coastal villages of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea and Trung An. Company L was assigned to sweep Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea with Company M in support. After moving to the edge of the village in LVTs, Company L advanced northwest into the built-up area. By 18:22 Company L had cleared the first village and was well into Trung An. The Marines killed 3 VC and detained 4 suspects, but found no evidence of larger PAVN/VC formations. By 19:40 both Companies established night defensive positions north and west of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea.<ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|176-8}}\n\nAt 07:00 on 27 December both companies moved out on another sweep of the two villages. Company M moved north on a line parallel to Trung An so it could begin its sweep of the village from north to south. Company L with the mission to sweep Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea initially moved out to the northeast. Leading eelments of Company L were almost into the south of Trung An when Company L\u2019s commander realised that his lead platoon had not turned south towards Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea. Company L then reversed direction and started towards Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea. As the lead platoon of Company L approached the edge of the village a concealed PAVN/VC force opened up with a devastating barrage of machine gun, rifle, [[Rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) and mortar fire inflicting numerous casualties. The Company commander Captain Thomas Hubbel decided to pull his company back and regroup for an attack. He requested supporting arms fire on Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea while his company prepared for an assault. After two airstrikes followed by naval gunfire Company L assaulted the village but were again met by heavy fire killing Captain Hubbel and his radio operator. Lt Col McQuown lost communications with the company until the acting company executive officer assumed command of the company. While out of radio contact McQuown ordered Company M to move east and south and join the fight on the left flank of Company L. Company M reached its attack position and immediately came under heavy fire. McQuown realised that the 2 companies were up against a major PAVN/VC force in well-prepared defensive positions. McQuown then ordered Company I to move to the south of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea, requested that the SLF land the tank platoon and instructed Company K to relieve the pressure on Companies L and M by attacking the south of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea.<ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|178}}\n\nAfter hitting the area with 81mm mortar fire Company K attacked the south of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea meeting strong resistance and were unable to make any progress until 2 tanks arrived at their position. The tanks\u2019 communication systems had suffered water damage to their communication systems and could only be instructed by voice. While the tanks did knock out some PAVN/VC positions with their 90mm gunfire, the inability to coordinated the tanks\u2019 fire with the Company K assault prevented them from making more than a limited penetration into Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea. All 3 companies continued fight until nightfall. McQuown expect that the PAVN/VC would escape under cover of darkness and so moved Company I to the right flank of Company K where it could control the beach side of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea, Company M to the north would cover part of the beach side by fire, while elements of Companies K and L were moved west of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea.<ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|179}}\n\nOn the morning of 28 December Companies K and I renewed their assault on Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea meeting initial heavy fire but they secured the village by midday. The Marines then conducted a thorough search of the village. McQuown described the search as follows: \u201cThis search revealed a village that was literally a defensive bastion. It was prepared for all-around defense in depth with a network of tunnels you could stand up in, running the full length of the village. Connecting tunnels ran east and west. This tunnel system supported ground level bunkers for machine guns, RPGs and small arms around the entire perimeter of the village. Thus the [PAVN] were able to defend, reinforce or withdraw in any direction. All defensive preparation had been artfully camouflaged with growing vegetation. Residents of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea, questioned after the fight, disclosed that the [PAVN] had been preparing the defense of this village for one year.\u201d The search uncovered numerous machine guns, RPGs, [[AK-47]] rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition which clearly indicated that a major PAVN force had defended the village, not local VC. A dying PAVN soldier confirmed that the force had been the PAVN 116th Battalion. ARVN forces operating northwest of Th\u00e2m Kh\u00ea found over 100 bodies from the 116th Battalion in sand dunes, the PAVN had apparently evacuated its casualties through the gap between Companies K and L during the night. <ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|179}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 18:00 on 31 December a New Year\u2019s truce went into effect and SLF Bravo began returning to its ships and by 11:30 on 2 January the BLT had left the operational area. Marine losses during the operation were 48 killed, while PAVN/VC losses were 131+ killed. <ref name=Telfer/>{{rp|179}}\n\nOn 30 December 1967 [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Jacob E.

They discovered that, when an electron collided with a mercury atom, it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9 [[electron volt]]s) of its [[kinetic energy]] before flying away.<ref name=Pais2 /> This energy loss corresponds to decelerating the electron from a [[speed]] of about 1.3 million meters per second to zero.<ref name=Nuffield /> A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons merely bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.\n\nThese experimental results proved to be consistent with the [[Bohr model|Bohr model for atoms]] that had been proposed the previous year by [[Niels Bohr]]. The Bohr model was a precursor of [[quantum mechanics]] and of the [[electron shell model]] of atoms. Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom's \"quantum energy levels\".  Before the collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9 electron volts (eV) more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities in Bohr's quantum model. This feature was \"revolutionary\" because it was inconsistent with the expectation that an electron could be bound to an [[atomic nucleus|atom's nucleus]] by any amount of energy.<ref name=Pais2 /><ref name=Cohen />\n\nIn a second paper presented in May 1914, Franck and Hertz reported on the light emission by the mercury atoms that had absorbed energy from collisions.<ref name=FH2 /> They showed that the [[wavelength]] of this [[ultraviolet]] light corresponded exactly to the 4.9 eV of energy that the flying electron had lost.

This means that the direction in which the electron is moving is altered by the collision, but its speed is unchanged. An elastic collision is illustrated in the figure, where the length of the arrow indicates the electron's speed. The mercury atom is unaffected by the collision, mostly because it is about four hundred thousand times more massive than an electron.<ref name=Melissinos /><ref name=Demtroeder />\n\nWhen the speed of the electron exceeds about 1.3 million meters per second,<ref name=Nuffield /> collisions with a mercury atom become inelastic. This speed corresponds to a kinetic energy of 4.9 eV, which is deposited into the mercury atom. As shown in the figure, the electron's speed is reduced, and the mercury atom becomes \"excited\". A short time later, the 4.9 eV of energy that was deposited into the mercury atom is released as ultraviolet light that has a wavelength of precisely 254&nbsp;nm. Following light emission, the mercury atom returns to its original, unexcited state.<ref name=Melissinos /><ref name=Demtroeder />\n\nIf electrons emitted from the cathode flew freely until they arrived at the grid, they would acquire a kinetic energy that's proportional to the voltage applied to the grid. 1 eV of kinetic energy corresponds to a potential difference of 1 volt between the grid and the cathode.<ref name=Thornton /> Elastic collisions with the mercury atoms increase the time it takes for an electron to arrive at the grid, but the average kinetic energy of electrons arriving there isn't much affected.<ref name=Demtroeder />\n\nWhen the grid voltage reaches 4.9 V, electron collisions near the grid become inelastic, and the electrons are greatly slowed. The kinetic energy of a typical electron arriving at the grid is reduced so much that it cannot travel further to reach the anode, whose voltage is set to slightly repel electrons. The current of electrons reaching the anode falls, as seen in the graph. Further increases in the grid voltage restore enough energy to the electrons that suffered inelastic collisions that they can again reach the anode. The current rises again as the grid potential rises beyond 4.9 V.  At 9.8 V, the situation changes again.  Electrons that have traveled roughly halfway from the cathode to the grid have already acquired enough energy to suffer a first inelastic collision. As they continue slowly towards the grid from the midway point, their kinetic energy builds up again, but as they reach the grid they can suffer a second inelastic collision. Once again, the current to the anode drops.  At intervals of 4.9 volts this process will repeat; each time the electrons will undergo one additional inelastic collision.<ref name=Melissinos /><ref name=Demtroeder />\n\n==Early quantum theory==\n[[File:BohrLevels.svg|thumb|right |The Bohr model of the atom assumed that an electron could be bound to an atomic nucleus only with one of a series of specific energies corresponding to quantum energy levels.

These were usually observed in gas discharges, which emitted light at a series of wavelengths. Ordinary light sources like incandescent light bulbs emit light at all wavelengths. Bohr had calculated the wavelengths emitted by hydrogen very accurately.<ref name=Heilbron>{{cite book |last=Heilbron |first=John L. |authorlink=John L.

The atom can be [[ionization|ionized]] if a collision with another particle supplies at least this binding energy. This frees the electron from the atom, and leaves a positively charged ion behind. There is an analogy with satellites orbiting the earth. Every satellite has its own orbit, and practically any orbital distance, and any satellite binding energy, is possible. Since an electron is attracted to the positive charge of the atomic nucleus by a similar force, so-called \"classical\" calculations suggest that any binding energy should also be possible for electrons. However, Bohr assumed that only a specific series of binding energies occur, which correspond to the \"quantum energy levels\" for the electron. An electron is normally found in the lowest energy level, with the largest binding energy. Additional levels lie higher, with smaller binding energies. Intermediate binding energies lying between these levels are not permitted. This was a revolutionary assumption.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nFranck and Hertz had proposed that the 4.9 V characteristic of their experiments was due to ionization of mercury atoms by collisions with the flying electrons emitted at the cathode. In 1915 Bohr published a paper noting that the measurements of Franck and Hertz were more consistent with the assumption of quantum levels in his own model for atoms.<ref name=Kragh>{{cite book |title=Niels Bohr and the Quantum Atom: The Bohr Model of Atomic Structure 1913-1925 |first=Helge |last=Kragh |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780191630460 |page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVyrkndSrkQC&pg=PA144}} Kragh quotes a sentence from one of Bohr's 1915 papers in which he discusses the 1914 papers by Franck and Hertz: \"It seems that their experiment may possibly be consistent with the assumption that this voltage (4.9 V) corresponds only to the transition from the normal state to some other stationary state of the neutral atom.\"</ref> In the Bohr model, the collision excited an internal electron within the atom from its lowest level to the first quantum level above it. The Bohr model also predicted that light would be emitted as the internal electron returned from its excited quantum level to the lowest one; its wavelength corresponded to the energy difference of the atom's internal levels, which has been called the Bohr relation.<ref name=Pais2 /> Franck and Hertz's observation of emission from their tube at 254&nbsp;nm was also consistent with Bohr's perspective. Writing following the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, Franck and Hertz had largely adopted the Bohr perspective for interpreting their experiment, which has become one of the experimental pillars of quantum mechanics.<ref name=Rice /><ref name=Lemmerich /> As Abraham Pais described it, \"Now the beauty of Franck and Hertz's work lies not only in the measurement of the energy loss ''E''<sub>2</sub>-''E''<sub>1</sub> of the impinging electron, but they also observed that, when the energy of that electron exceeds 4.9 eV, mercury begins to emit ultraviolet light of a definite frequency ''\u03bd'' as defined in the above formula. Thereby they gave (unwittingly at first) the first direct experimental proof of the Bohr relation!\"<ref name=Pais2 /> Franck himself emphasized the importance of the ultraviolet emission experiment in an epilogue to the 1960 [[Physical Science Study Committee]] (PSSC) film about the Franck\u2013Hertz experiment.<ref name=Franck60 />\n\n== Experiment with neon==\n[[File:Franck-Hertz-Neon-3.png|thumb|Franck-Hertz experiment with neon gas: 3 glowing regions]]\nIn instructional laboratories, the Franck\u2013Hertz experiment is often done using [[neon|neon gas]], which shows the onset of inelastic collisions with a visible orange glow in the vacuum tube, and which also is non-toxic, should the tube be broken. With mercury tubes, the model for elastic and inelastic collisions predicts that there should be narrow bands between the anode and the grid where the mercury emits light, but the light is ultraviolet and invisible. With neon, the Franck\u2013Hertz voltage interval is 18.7 volts, and an orange glow appears near the grid when 18.7 volts is applied.  This glow will move closer to the cathode with increasing accelerating potential, and indicates the locations where electrons have acquired the 18.7 eV required to excite a neon atom. At 37.4 volts two distinct glows will be visible: one midway between the cathode and grid, and one right at the accelerating grid. Higher potentials, spaced at 18.7 volt intervals, will result in additional glowing regions in the tube.\n\nAn additional advantage of neon for instructional laboratories is that the tube can be used at room temperature. However, the wavelength of the visible emission is much longer than predicted by the Bohr relation and the 18.7 V interval. A partial explanation for the orange light involves two atomic levels lying 16.6 eV and 18.7 eV above the lowest level. Electrons excited to the 18.7 eV level fall to the 16.6 eV level, with concomitant orange light emission.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Light Sources and Lasers |pages=31\u201336 |chapter=2.6 The Franck\u2013Hertz Experiment |first=Mark |last=Csele |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2011 |isbn=9780471675228 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQfKWwvH42kC&pg=PA31}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |refs=\n<ref name=Brandt>{{cite book |title=The harvest of a century : discoveries of modern physics in 100 episodes |first=Siegmund |last=Brandt |chapter=25.

They discovered that, when an electron collided with a mercury atom, it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9 [[electron volt]]s) of its [[kinetic energy]] before flying away.<ref name=Pais2 /> This energy loss corresponds to decelerating the electron from a [[speed]] of about 1.3 million meters per second to zero.<ref name=Nuffield /> A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons merely bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.\n\nThese experimental results proved to be consistent with the [[Bohr model|Bohr model for atoms]] that had been proposed the previous year by [[Niels Bohr]]. The Bohr model was a precursor of [[quantum mechanics]] and of the [[electron shell model]] of atoms. Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom's \"quantum energy levels\".  Before the collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9 electron volts (eV) more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities in Bohr's quantum model. This feature was \"revolutionary\" because it was inconsistent with the expectation that an electron could be bound to an [[atomic nucleus|atom's nucleus]] by any amount of energy.<ref name=Pais2 /><ref name=Cohen />\n\nIn a second paper presented in May 1914, Franck and Hertz reported on the light emission by the mercury atoms that had absorbed energy from collisions.<ref name=FH2 /> They showed that the [[wavelength]] of this [[ultraviolet]] light corresponded exactly to the 4.9 eV of energy that the flying electron had lost.

This behavior is typical of true vacuum tubes that don't contain mercury vapor; larger voltages lead to larger \"[[space-charge limited current]]\".\n*At 4.9 volts the current drops sharply, almost back to zero.\n*The current then increases steadily once again as the voltage is increased further, until 9.8 volts is reached (exactly 4.9+4.9 volts).\n*At 9.8 volts a similar sharp drop is observed.\n*While it isn't evident in the original measurements of the figure, this series of dips in current at approximately 4.9 volt increments continues to potentials of at least 70 volts.<ref name=Thornton2 />\n\nFranck and Hertz noted in their first paper that the 4.9 eV characteristic energy of their experiment corresponded well to one of the wavelengths of light emitted by mercury atoms in [[Electric discharge in gases|gas discharges]]. They were using a quantum relationship between the energy of excitation and the corresponding [[wavelength]] of light, which they broadly attributed to [[Johannes Stark]] and to [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]; it predicts that 4.9 eV corresponds to light with a 254&nbsp;nm wavelength.<ref name=FH1 /> The same relationship was also incorporated in Einstein's 1905 photon theory of the [[photoelectric effect]].<ref name=Pais /> In a second paper, Franck and Hertz reported the optical emission from their tubes, which emitted light with a single prominent wavelength 254&nbsp;nm.<ref name=FH2 /> The figure at the right shows the spectrum of a Franck\u2013Hertz tube; nearly all of the light emitted has a single wavelength. For reference, the figure also shows the spectrum for a mercury gas discharge light, which emits light at several wavelengths besides 254&nbsp;nm.

The middle circle is labeled \"inelastic collision\", and has a longer arrow pointing towards it, and a shorter arrow leading away. The lowest circle is labeled \"light emission\", and is next to a squiggly arrow that points away.]]\nFranck and Hertz explained their experiment in terms of [[elastic collision|elastic]] and [[inelastic collision]]s between the electrons and the mercury atoms.<ref name=FH1 /><ref name=Lemmerich /> Slowly moving electrons collide elastically with the mercury atoms. This means that the direction in which the electron is moving is altered by the collision, but its speed is unchanged. An elastic collision is illustrated in the figure, where the length of the arrow indicates the electron's speed. The mercury atom is unaffected by the collision, mostly because it is about four hundred thousand times more massive than an electron.<ref name=Melissinos /><ref name=Demtroeder />\n\nWhen the speed of the electron exceeds about 1.3 million meters per second,<ref name=Nuffield /> collisions with a mercury atom become inelastic. This speed corresponds to a kinetic energy of 4.9 eV, which is deposited into the mercury atom. As shown in the figure, the electron's speed is reduced, and the mercury atom becomes \"excited\". A short time later, the 4.9 eV of energy that was deposited into the mercury atom is released as ultraviolet light that has a wavelength of precisely 254&nbsp;nm. Following light emission, the mercury atom returns to its original, unexcited state.<ref name=Melissinos /><ref name=Demtroeder />\n\nIf electrons emitted from the cathode flew freely until they arrived at the grid, they would acquire a kinetic energy that's proportional to the voltage applied to the grid. 1 eV of kinetic energy corresponds to a potential difference of 1 volt between the grid and the cathode.<ref name=Thornton /> Elastic collisions with the mercury atoms increase the time it takes for an electron to arrive at the grid, but the average kinetic energy of electrons arriving there isn't much affected.<ref name=Demtroeder />\n\nWhen the grid voltage reaches 4.9 V, electron collisions near the grid become inelastic, and the electrons are greatly slowed. The kinetic energy of a typical electron arriving at the grid is reduced so much that it cannot travel further to reach the anode, whose voltage is set to slightly repel electrons. The current of electrons reaching the anode falls, as seen in the graph. Further increases in the grid voltage restore enough energy to the electrons that suffered inelastic collisions that they can again reach the anode. The current rises again as the grid potential rises beyond 4.9 V.  At 9.8 V, the situation changes again.  Electrons that have traveled roughly halfway from the cathode to the grid have already acquired enough energy to suffer a first inelastic collision. As they continue slowly towards the grid from the midway point, their kinetic energy builds up again, but as they reach the grid they can suffer a second inelastic collision. Once again, the current to the anode drops.  At intervals of 4.9 volts this process will repeat; each time the electrons will undergo one additional inelastic collision.<ref name=Melissinos /><ref name=Demtroeder />\n\n==Early quantum theory==\n[[File:BohrLevels.svg|thumb|right |The Bohr model of the atom assumed that an electron could be bound to an atomic nucleus only with one of a series of specific energies corresponding to quantum energy levels.

These were usually observed in gas discharges, which emitted light at a series of wavelengths. Ordinary light sources like incandescent light bulbs emit light at all wavelengths. Bohr had calculated the wavelengths emitted by hydrogen very accurately.<ref name=Heilbron>{{cite book |last=Heilbron |first=John L. |authorlink=John L.

The atom can be [[ionization|ionized]] if a collision with another particle supplies at least this binding energy. This frees the electron from the atom, and leaves a positively charged ion behind. There is an analogy with satellites orbiting the earth. Every satellite has its own orbit, and practically any orbital distance, and any satellite binding energy, is possible. Since an electron is attracted to the positive charge of the atomic nucleus by a similar force, so-called \"classical\" calculations suggest that any binding energy should also be possible for electrons. However, Bohr assumed that only a specific series of binding energies occur, which correspond to the \"quantum energy levels\" for the electron. An electron is normally found in the lowest energy level, with the largest binding energy. Additional levels lie higher, with smaller binding energies. Intermediate binding energies lying between these levels are not permitted. This was a revolutionary assumption.<ref name=Cohen />\n\nFranck and Hertz had proposed that the 4.9 V characteristic of their experiments was due to ionization of mercury atoms by collisions with the flying electrons emitted at the cathode. In 1915 Bohr published a paper noting that the measurements of Franck and Hertz were more consistent with the assumption of quantum levels in his own model for atoms.<ref name=Kragh>{{cite book |title=Niels Bohr and the Quantum Atom: The Bohr Model of Atomic Structure 1913-1925 |first=Helge |last=Kragh |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780191630460 |page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVyrkndSrkQC&pg=PA144}} Kragh quotes a sentence from one of Bohr's 1915 papers in which he discusses the 1914 papers by Franck and Hertz: \"It seems that their experiment may possibly be consistent with the assumption that this voltage (4.9 V) corresponds only to the transition from the normal state to some other stationary state of the neutral atom.\"</ref> In the Bohr model, the collision excited an internal electron within the atom from its lowest level to the first quantum level above it. The Bohr model also predicted that light would be emitted as the internal electron returned from its excited quantum level to the lowest one; its wavelength corresponded to the energy difference of the atom's internal levels, which has been called the Bohr relation.<ref name=Pais2 /> Franck and Hertz's observation of emission from their tube at 254&nbsp;nm was also consistent with Bohr's perspective. Writing following the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, Franck and Hertz had largely adopted the Bohr perspective for interpreting their experiment, which has become one of the experimental pillars of quantum mechanics.<ref name=Rice /><ref name=Lemmerich /> As Abraham Pais described it, \"Now the beauty of Franck and Hertz's work lies not only in the measurement of the energy loss ''E''<sub>2</sub>-''E''<sub>1</sub> of the impinging electron, but they also observed that, when the energy of that electron exceeds 4.9 eV, mercury begins to emit ultraviolet light of a definite frequency ''\u03bd'' as defined in the above formula. Thereby they gave (unwittingly at first) the first direct experimental proof of the Bohr relation!\"<ref name=Pais2 /> Franck himself emphasized the importance of the ultraviolet emission experiment in an epilogue to the 1960 [[Physical Science Study Committee]] (PSSC) film about the Franck\u2013Hertz experiment.<ref name=Franck60 />\n\n== Experiment with neon==\n[[File:Franck-Hertz-Neon-3.png|thumb|Franck-Hertz experiment with neon gas: 3 glowing regions]]\nIn instructional laboratories, the Franck\u2013Hertz experiment is often done using [[neon|neon gas]], which shows the onset of inelastic collisions with a visible orange glow in the vacuum tube, and which also is non-toxic, should the tube be broken. With mercury tubes, the model for elastic and inelastic collisions predicts that there should be narrow bands between the anode and the grid where the mercury emits light, but the light is ultraviolet and invisible. With neon, the Franck\u2013Hertz voltage interval is 18.7 volts, and an orange glow appears near the grid when 18.7 volts is applied.  This glow will move closer to the cathode with increasing accelerating potential, and indicates the locations where electrons have acquired the 18.7 eV required to excite a neon atom. At 37.4 volts two distinct glows will be visible: one midway between the cathode and grid, and one right at the accelerating grid. Higher potentials, spaced at 18.7 volt intervals, will result in additional glowing regions in the tube.\n\nAn additional advantage of neon for instructional laboratories is that the tube can be used at room temperature. However, the wavelength of the visible emission is much longer than predicted by the Bohr relation and the 18.7 V interval. A partial explanation for the orange light involves two atomic levels lying 16.6 eV and 18.7 eV above the lowest level. Electrons excited to the 18.7 eV level fall to the 16.6 eV level, with concomitant orange light emission.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Light Sources and Lasers |pages=31\u201336 |chapter=2.6 The Franck\u2013Hertz Experiment |first=Mark |last=Csele |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2011 |isbn=9780471675228 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQfKWwvH42kC&pg=PA31}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |refs=\n<ref name=Brandt>{{cite book |title=The harvest of a century : discoveries of modern physics in 100 episodes |first=Siegmund |last=Brandt |chapter=25.

''The Carol Burnett Show'' debuted the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" wouldn't air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.

In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| Season 7 \n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip Harper\n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Eunice, Ed and Mama come back from church.\n|  \n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack Harper\n|-  \n| Season 8 \n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

''The Carol Burnett Show'' debuted the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" wouldn't air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs.

Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip.

Directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], the film is a dramatization of the story of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] from his birth and ministry to his [[crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], with much [[dramatic license]].\n\nIn November 1958, the idea for ''King of Kings'' began as a proposed film project based on the life of Jesus between [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[John Farrow]] following their collaboration on ''[[John Paul Jones (film)|John Paul Jones]]'' (1959). However, by the next year, Farrow left the project due to creative differences, and Nicholas Ray was shortly after hired as director. Ray then hired screenwriter [[Philip Yordan]] to write a new script. Prominent actors were considered to portray multiple roles. Filming commenced in April 1960, and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in October 1960. Financing of the film was initially provided by [[du Pont family|Pierre S. du Pont III]], but Bronston appealed for more funding from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who was interested in the film following their success with ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). With MGM involved, mandatory rewrites and additional scenes were added to the film. Reshoots were shot in December 1960 and again in May 1961. \n\nThe film premiered at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on October 11, 1961. It received mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. \n\n==Plot==\nIn 63 BC, [[Pompey]] conquered [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|city was sacked]]. He entered [[Temple in Jerusalem|the Temple]] to seize the treasure of [[Solomon]] and massacred the priests there. He discovered that the treasure is only a collection of scrolls of the [[Torah]]. These Pompey held over a fire until an old priest reached for them imploringly. Pompey relented and handed them to the old man and left to carry out massacres of enemy villages and towns.\n\nMany years later, a series of rebellions break out against the authority of Rome, so the Romans [[Crucifixion|crucify]] many of the leaders and place [[Herod the Great]] on [[Judea]]'s throne.\n\nA carpenter named [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and his wife [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], who is about to give birth, arrive in [[Bethlehem]] for the [[census]]. Not having found accommodation for the night, they take refuge in a stable, where the child, Jesus, is born. The shepherds, who have followed [[Biblical Magi|the Magi]] from the East, gather to worship him. However, Herod, informed of the birth of a child-king, orders the centurion Lucius to take his men to Bethlehem and kill all the newborn male children.\n\nMary and Joseph flee to [[Egypt]] with the child. The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] occurs, Herod dies, killed in his death throes by his son [[Herod Antipas]], who then takes power. In [[Nazareth]], Jesus, who is now twelve years old, is working with Joseph when soldiers arrive under the command of Lucius, who realizes that Jesus escaped the [[Massacre of the Innocents|massacre of the infants]]. But Lucius does nothing and only asks that Mary and Joseph register their son's birth before the year's end.\n\nYears pass and Jewish rebels led by [[Barabbas]] and [[Judas Iscariot]] prepare to attack a caravan carrying the next [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers#The Administration of Judaea .28AD 6.E2.80.93135.29|governor of Judea]], [[Pontius Pilate]] and his wife [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Claudia]]. The ambush fails, partly due to the diligence of Lucius, and Barabbas and Judas flee for their lives.\n\nPilate and Herod Antipas meet on the banks of the [[River Jordan]], where [[John the Baptist]] preaches to the crowds. Jesus arrives here, now 30 years of age. He is [[baptism|baptized]] by John, who recognizes that he is the [[Messiah]]. Jesus goes into the desert, where he is [[temptations of Christ|tempted]] by [[Satan]]. After forty days, Jesus travels to [[Galilee]], where he recruits his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s.\n\nIn [[Jerusalem]], Herod Antipas arrests John the Baptist, who is visited by Jesus in prison. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] leaves the rebel [[Barabbas]] and joins the Apostles. Jesus begins to preach and gather crowds, among which are Claudia, Pilate's wife, and Lucius. Herod reluctantly beheads John on a whim of his stepdaughter, [[Salome]], who despises him.\n\nHerod, Pilate and the High Priest [[Caiaphas]] are terrorized by the works and miracles of Jesus. Barabbas plots a revolt in Jerusalem during [[Passover]], during which time Jesus enters the holy city in triumph and goes to the Temple to preach. The rebels storm the [[Antonia Fortress]], but the [[Roman legion|legions]] of Pilate, having learned of the plot, ambush and crush the revolt, massacring the rebels. Barabbas ends up arrested.\n\nJesus meets the disciples on the evening of Thursday, having [[Last Supper|supper]] one last time with them and afterwards goes to pray at [[Gethsemane]]. In the meantime, Judas wants Jesus to free [[Judea]] from the Romans, and, to force his hand, Judas delivers him to the Jewish authorities. Jesus is brought before [[Caiaphas]] and then brought before   Pilate. Pilate starts the trial, but sensing that the issue is one of Jewish sensibilities, sends him to Herod Antipas, who, in turn, sends him back.\n\nPilate is infuriated by Antipas' returning of Jesus and commands his soldiers to scourge Jesus. The people demand the release of [[Barabbas]], and Pilate bows to their pressure and sentences Jesus to be [[crucifixion|crucified]]. Jesus, wearing a [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]] on his head, carries his cross to [[Golgotha]] where he is crucified with two thieves, one of them being the [[penitent thief]] [[Dismas]].\n\nDesperate because he has betrayed Jesus to his death, Judas hangs himself and his body is found by Barabbas. Jesus dies in front of his mother, the apostle [[John the Apostle|John]], a few soldiers, Claudia (Pilate's wife), and Lucius (who utters the fateful words: \"He is truly the Christ\"). His body is taken down from the cross and is carried to a rock tomb. Two days later, [[Mary Magdalene]] finds the tomb empty, and encounters the Risen Jesus.\n\nThe film ends on the shores of [[Lake Tiberias]] when Jesus appears to the Apostles for \"a final time\" according to the narration, and tells them to bring his message to the ends of the world. Only his shadow is visible, forming the shape of a cross where it falls on the stretched-out fishing nets. The apostles then leave, and, as the shadow of Jesus falls across the screen, it could be assumed that he is ascending to [[Heaven]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Siobh\u00e1n McKenna]] as  [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]\n* [[Robert Ryan]]  as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Ron Randell]] as Lucius\n* [[Hurd Hatfield]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Viveca Lindfors]] as Claudia\n* [[Rita Gam]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Frank Thring]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Royal Dano]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n* [[Rip Torn]]  as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Harry Guardino]] as [[Barabbas]]\n* [[Carmen Sevilla]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Brigid Bazlen]] as [[Salome|Salom\u00e9]]\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Aslan]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Tichy]] as [[Joseph]]\n* [[Luis Prendes]] as the [[Penitent thief]]\n* Barry Keegan as [[Gestas]], the [[Impenitent thief]]\n* [[Orson Welles]] (uncredited) as the [[Narrator]]\n* [[Ray Milland]] (uncredited) as [[Satan]] (voice) \n{{div col end}}\nWith the death of Rip Torn on July 9, 2019, [[Carmen Sevilla]] is the last surviving primary cast member.\n\n==Development==\nIn November 1958, it was reported that [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[John Farrow]] were collaborating on a film project based on the life of Jesus, with Farrow's script being titled ''Son of Man''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pryor|first=Thomas M.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/11/04/archives/film-to-be-made-on-life-of-christ-son-of-man-is-planned-by-farrow.html|title=Film To Be Made on Life of Christ|newspaper=The New York Times|page=30|date=November 4, 1958|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/variety212-1958-11/page/n93/mode/2up/|title=New York Sound Track|magazine=Variety|page=6|date=November 12, 1958|accessdate=March 3, 2020|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> In May 1959, it was reported that [[Sonya Levien]] was hired to do a script polish.<ref>{{cite news|title=Of Local Origins|newspaper=The New York Times|page=24|date=May 15, 1959}}</ref> However, by October 1959, Farrow had left the project over creative differences.

Ray also explained, \"I asked for him and made concessions to have him. They had asked me to write it. I didn't feel up to the responsibility; I am as impatient with the other writer on my own screenplay as with others.\"<ref>Scheuer, Philip K (December 21, 1960). \"[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/381206640/ Ray Tells Directing of 'King of Kings']\".

The picture was called ''Son of Man''. Terrible title, and someone had taken chapters of the Bible and sort of tried to make it play.\" He then recommended re-titling the script to ''King of Kings''.{{sfn|Eisenschitz|1993|p=362}} Yordan wrote a new script in six weeks which Bronston liked so much that he encouraged him to stay in Madrid, in which Yordan later went to co-write the script for ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961). Throughout the writing process, Yordan felt he did not find writing the movie to be difficult, in which he argued that \"Christ was a loner. He's not much different than my usual character.

Directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], the film is a dramatization of the story of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] from his birth and ministry to his [[crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], with much [[dramatic license]].\n\nIn November 1958, the idea for ''King of Kings'' began as a proposed film project based on the life of Jesus between [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[John Farrow]] following their collaboration on ''[[John Paul Jones (film)|John Paul Jones]]'' (1959). However, by the next year, Farrow left the project due to creative differences, and Nicholas Ray was shortly after hired as director. Ray then hired screenwriter [[Philip Yordan]] to write a new script. Prominent actors were considered to portray multiple roles. Filming commenced in April 1960, and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in October 1960. Financing of the film was initially provided by [[du Pont family|Pierre S. du Pont III]], but Bronston appealed for more funding from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who was interested in the film following their success with ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). With MGM involved, mandatory rewrites and additional scenes were added to the film. Reshoots were shot in December 1960 and again in May 1961. \n\nThe film premiered at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on October 11, 1961. It received mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. \n\n==Plot==\nIn 63 BC, [[Pompey]] conquered [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|city was sacked]]. He entered [[Temple in Jerusalem|the Temple]] to seize the treasure of [[Solomon]] and massacred the priests there. He discovered that the treasure is only a collection of scrolls of the [[Torah]]. These Pompey held over a fire until an old priest reached for them imploringly. Pompey relented and handed them to the old man and left to carry out massacres of enemy villages and towns.\n\nMany years later, a series of rebellions break out against the authority of Rome, so the Romans [[Crucifixion|crucify]] many of the leaders and place [[Herod the Great]] on [[Judea]]'s throne.\n\nA carpenter named [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and his wife [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], who is about to give birth, arrive in [[Bethlehem]] for the [[census]]. Not having found accommodation for the night, they take refuge in a stable, where the child, Jesus, is born. The shepherds, who have followed [[Biblical Magi|the Magi]] from the East, gather to worship him. However, Herod, informed of the birth of a child-king, orders the centurion Lucius to take his men to Bethlehem and kill all the newborn male children.\n\nMary and Joseph flee to [[Egypt]] with the child. The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] occurs, Herod dies, killed in his death throes by his son [[Herod Antipas]], who then takes power. In [[Nazareth]], Jesus, who is now twelve years old, is working with Joseph when soldiers arrive under the command of Lucius, who realizes that Jesus escaped the [[Massacre of the Innocents|massacre of the infants]]. But Lucius does nothing and only asks that Mary and Joseph register their son's birth before the year's end.\n\nYears pass and Jewish rebels led by [[Barabbas]] and [[Judas Iscariot]] prepare to attack a caravan carrying the next [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers#The Administration of Judaea .28AD 6.E2.80.93135.29|governor of Judea]], [[Pontius Pilate]] and his wife [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Claudia]]. The ambush fails, partly due to the diligence of Lucius, and Barabbas and Judas flee for their lives.\n\nPilate and Herod Antipas meet on the banks of the [[River Jordan]], where [[John the Baptist]] preaches to the crowds. Jesus arrives here, now 30 years of age. He is [[baptism|baptized]] by John, who recognizes that he is the [[Messiah]]. Jesus goes into the desert, where he is [[temptations of Christ|tempted]] by [[Satan]]. After forty days, Jesus travels to [[Galilee]], where he recruits his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s.\n\nIn [[Jerusalem]], Herod Antipas arrests John the Baptist, who is visited by Jesus in prison. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] leaves the rebel [[Barabbas]] and joins the Apostles. Jesus begins to preach and gather crowds, among which are Claudia, Pilate's wife, and Lucius. Herod reluctantly beheads John on a whim of his stepdaughter, [[Salome]], who despises him.\n\nHerod, Pilate and the High Priest [[Caiaphas]] are terrorized by the works and miracles of Jesus. Barabbas plots a revolt in Jerusalem during [[Passover]], during which time Jesus enters the holy city in triumph and goes to the Temple to preach. The rebels storm the [[Antonia Fortress]], but the [[Roman legion|legions]] of Pilate, having learned of the plot, ambush and crush the revolt, massacring the rebels. Barabbas ends up arrested.\n\nJesus meets the disciples on the evening of Thursday, having [[Last Supper|supper]] one last time with them and afterwards goes to pray at [[Gethsemane]]. In the meantime, Judas wants Jesus to free [[Judea]] from the Romans, and, to force his hand, Judas delivers him to the Jewish authorities. Jesus is brought before [[Caiaphas]] and then brought before   Pilate. Pilate starts the trial, but sensing that the issue is one of Jewish sensibilities, sends him to Herod Antipas, who, in turn, sends him back.\n\nPilate is infuriated by Antipas' returning of Jesus and commands his soldiers to scourge Jesus. The people demand the release of [[Barabbas]], and Pilate bows to their pressure and sentences Jesus to be [[crucifixion|crucified]]. Jesus, wearing a [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]] on his head, carries his cross to [[Golgotha]] where he is crucified with two thieves, one of them being the [[penitent thief]] [[Dismas]].\n\nDesperate because he has betrayed Jesus to his death, Judas hangs himself and his body is found by Barabbas. Jesus dies in front of his mother, the apostle [[John the Apostle|John]], a few soldiers, Claudia (Pilate's wife), and Lucius (who utters the fateful words: \"He is truly the Christ\"). His body is taken down from the cross and is carried to a rock tomb. Two days later, [[Mary Magdalene]] finds the tomb empty, and encounters the Risen Jesus.\n\nThe film ends on the shores of [[Lake Tiberias]] when Jesus appears to the Apostles for \"a final time\" according to the narration, and tells them to bring his message to the ends of the world. Only his shadow is visible, forming the shape of a cross where it falls on the stretched-out fishing nets. The apostles then leave, and, as the shadow of Jesus falls across the screen, it could be assumed that he is ascending to [[Heaven]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Siobh\u00e1n McKenna]] as  [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]\n* [[Robert Ryan]]  as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Ron Randell]] as Lucius\n* [[Hurd Hatfield]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Viveca Lindfors]] as Claudia\n* [[Rita Gam]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Frank Thring]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Royal Dano]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n* [[Rip Torn]]  as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Harry Guardino]] as [[Barabbas]]\n* [[Carmen Sevilla]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Brigid Bazlen]] as [[Salome|Salom\u00e9]]\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Aslan]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Tichy]] as [[Joseph]]\n* [[Luis Prendes]] as the [[Penitent thief]]\n* Barry Keegan as [[Gestas]], the [[Impenitent thief]]\n* [[Orson Welles]] (uncredited) as the [[Narrator]]\n* [[Ray Milland]] (uncredited) as [[Satan]] (voice) \n{{div col end}}\nWith the death of Rip Torn on July 9, 2019, [[Carmen Sevilla]] is the last surviving primary cast member.\n\n==Development==\nIn November 1958, it was reported that [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[John Farrow]] were collaborating on a film project based on the life of Jesus, with Farrow's script being titled ''Son of Man''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pryor|first=Thomas M.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/11/04/archives/film-to-be-made-on-life-of-christ-son-of-man-is-planned-by-farrow.html|title=Film To Be Made on Life of Christ|newspaper=The New York Times|page=30|date=November 4, 1958|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/variety212-1958-11/page/n93/mode/2up/|title=New York Sound Track|magazine=Variety|page=6|date=November 12, 1958|accessdate=March 3, 2020|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> In May 1959, it was reported that [[Sonya Levien]] was hired to do a script polish.<ref>{{cite news|title=Of Local Origins|newspaper=The New York Times|page=24|date=May 15, 1959}}</ref> However, by October 1959, Farrow had left the project over creative differences.

In the episode, titular character [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack Horseman]] is arrested and sentenced to prison for breaking and entering, but is granted a furlough to attend the wedding of his ex-girlfriend, Princess Carolyn. The episode was widely praised as a poignant ending to the series.\n__TOC__\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter the events of \"[[The View From Halfway Down]]\", a montage shows that BoJack was saved from drowning by the occupants of his former house. BoJack is convicted of [[Burglary|breaking and entering]] and is sentenced to 14 months in a [[maximum security prison]].\n\nA year later, BoJack is granted [[furlough]] and is picked up by Mr. Peanutbutter to go to Princess Carolyn and Judah's wedding. Mr. Peanutbutter takes BoJack to [[Griffith Observatory]], where he officially gives back the 'D' to the [[Hollywood sign|Hollywoo sign]] in a celebration of the success of his show \"Birthday Dad\". Due to a misunderstanding, he commissioned a 'B' instead, so that \"Hollywoo\" is renamed to \"Hollywoob\".\n\nAt the wedding, Todd finds Bojack and asks him for help to go to the beach. The two watch the [[fireworks]] for Princess Carolyn and Judah. BoJack tells Todd that he is comfortable being in jail; he stays out of trouble and is beating his [[sobriety]] record. Todd convinces him that once he completes his sentence, he just has to set a new record every day.\n\nLater, BoJack meets with Princess Carolyn, and congratulates her on the wedding reception. Princess Carolyn tells BoJack that Hollywoob is waiting for his comeback with \"Horniest Unicorn\", and assures him people may forget all his bad deeds. BoJack asks Princess Carolyn to dance, and he tells her he fantasized about convincing her to go through with the wedding. Princess Carolyn assures him she does not need that, and she is happy with the decision she made. Bojack tells her that she deserves to be happy, and asks her to represent him once he is released.\n\nBoJack climbs onto the roof and finds Diane smoking. Bojack tells her he misses her, and she reminds him of the [[voicemail]] he left when he broke into his old house and nearly drowned. She tells him she thought he was dead for seven hours, and how she hates herself for feeling guilty about not taking care of him. BoJack apologizes. Diane reveals that she is happily married to her husband Guy, and they have moved to [[Houston]] together. She advises him that there are people who help you become who you are, but they are not meant to stay in your life forever. BoJack jokes about how funny it would be if this was the last time they ever talked, and tells her the story of how a gang leader in prison forced them to only watch [[The Family Stone]] on movie night. Diane says it is a nice night, and BoJack agrees. They look at the sky in silence.\n\n==Critical response==\n\"Nice While it Lasted\" has received widespread critical acclaim. ''[[The A.V.

This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air. A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their air pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.

(Iron lungs must move larger quantities of air for every breath, because they must change the pressure of the air in the entire vessel, not just inflate the lungs).\n* Electrical power failure can result in prompt patient death. (Most iron lungs and similar devices lack backup power supplies. Manual power is an option on some units, but require multiple attendants, working alternately, to provide direct, continuous physical pumping of the iron lung's pump or diaphragm.)\n* Physical hazard to people and things in the immediate vicinity, because of exposed moving parts (Not true of all iron lungs).\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Both respirator===\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

(Iron lungs must move larger quantities of air for every breath, because they must change the pressure of the air in the entire vessel, not just inflate the lungs).\n* Electrical power failure can result in prompt patient death. (Most iron lungs and similar devices lack backup power supplies. Manual power is an option on some units, but require multiple attendants, working alternately, to provide direct, continuous physical pumping of the iron lung's pump or diaphragm.)\n* Physical hazard to people and things in the immediate vicinity, because of exposed moving parts (Not true of all iron lungs).\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

Positive pressure ventilators work by blowing air into the patient's lungs via [[intubation]] through the airway; they were used for the first time in [[Blegdams Hospital]], [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, during a polio outbreak in 1952.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=Reisner2009>{{cite web|author=Louise Reisner-S\u00e9n\u00e9lar|title=The Danish anaesthesiologist Bj\u00f6rn Ibsen a pioneer of long-term ventilation on the upper airways|year=2009|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B7CdB217pf6yN2QxOGI5NTUtZWIzYS00N2NhLWFhODQtOGZjMjdhZTlkZGE5&hl=de|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref><ref name=Wackers1994>{{cite book|last=Wackers|first=Ger|chapter=Chapter 4: |title=Theaters of truth and competence.

Nowadays, [[Respiratory therapist|respiratory therapists]] and [[doctors]] help most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.\n\n=== Continued use ===\nDespite the advantages of positive ventilation systems, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing, and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions,<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /> such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nThere are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/60-years-iron-lung-us-polio-survivor-worries-about-new-2D11641456|title=60 years in an iron lung: US polio survivor worries about new global threat|publisher=}}</ref> Joan Headley of [[Post-Polio Health International]] said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Woman dies after life spent in iron lung |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022162511/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> That figure may be inaccurately low; [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.<ref name=Neergaard2009>{{cite news|author=Lauran Neergaard|title=Emergency officials struggle to find those on life-support during power outages|date=2009-01-13|url=http://www.ems1.com/survivability/articles/447100-Emergency-officials-struggle-to-find-those-on-life-support-during-power-outages|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> [[Martha Mason (writer)|Martha Mason]] of [[Lattimore, North Carolina]], died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.<ref name=Fox2009>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|work=The New York Times|date=2009-05-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=iron%20lung&st=cse|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2009, [[June Middleton]] of [[Melbourne, Australia]], who had been entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.<ref name=Sydney2009>{{cite news|author=|title=Dead after 60 years in iron lung|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-11-01|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-after-60-years-in-iron-lung-20091101-hqyy.html?autostart=1|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI) organizations estimated that there were only six to eight iron lung users in the United States; as of 2017 its executive director knew of none.
