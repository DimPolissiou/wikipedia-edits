All but one of the miniatures are by one artist, known (from this book) as the \"Hoo Master\", of which about half are devotional scenes and half narrative subjects. They include patron images (identifiable by heraldry): Lord Hoo prays to the Holy Trinity, a little preceding a scene of the disembowelling of [[Erasmus of Formia|St Erasmus]], suggesting that he may have suffered from intestinal troubles. Dame Eleanor prays to the Virgin and Child, and wears a high butterfly headdress, and the arms of Hoo impaling Welles upon her kirtle: just after this, images of [[Leonard of Noblac|St Leonard]] and St Hildevert ([[Roman Catholic Diocese of Meaux|Bishop of Meaux]], died c. 680) are inserted, suggesting that she may have been afflicted by mental weakness or epilepsy.<ref>L.L.

Both artists (of whom the \"Hoo Master\" was notably more sophisticated in technique) were probably miniaturists of the Parisian school who had moved to work at Rouen.

Described by Chauncy, ''Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire'', p. 511. Chauncy's identification of the marriages of Lord Hoo's parents and grandparents is correct, but the punctuation of his original edition, in describing the different coats in the Keate MS, may have given rise to confusions. It is more clearly printed in the 1826 edition, Vol. II, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TBUHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA405#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 405-06] (Google).</ref><ref>Two seals are engraved in Cooper, 'Families of Braose and Hoo': others are shown in the Medieval Genealogy website, including a charter of 1366 with seals of Sir William de Hoo and Dame Alicia (St Omer) de Hoo [http://www.medievalgenealogy.org.uk/families/hoo.shtml], and a grant of 1372 [http://www.medievalgenealogy.org.uk/sources/charters/battle.shtml Huntington Library, San Marino BA v.48/1464] with seals of Sir Thomas de Hoo and Isabella (St Leger) de Hoo.</ref>\n\nThe heraldry worn by the figures of the tomb was interpreted lastly by [[Wilfrid Scott-Giles]], [[Fitzalan Pursuivant Extraordinary]]. The tabard of Lord Hoo and Hastings shows ''quarterly sable and argent'' (for Hoo), quartered with ''azure, a fess between six cross-crosslets or'' (for St Omer), with, on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon of pretence]], ''azure, fretty argent, a chief gules'' (for St Ledger). (This is the same as in the patron image in the \"Hours of Lord Hoo\".) \n\nThe tabard of the younger Thomas Hoo shows the arms of Hoo quartered with a bearing depicting a lion rampant, with a [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]], with the arms of St Omer on the escutcheon of pretence. This lion was formerly taken to be the arms of Welles (''or a lion rampant double queued sable''):<ref>Ray, 'The parish church of All Saints, Herstmonceux, and the Dacre tomb', pp. 36-55. See Chauncy, ''Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire'', p. 511.</ref> which, however, if so, should have lions with two tails, and would allude to the marriage of the elder brother, not relevant to the younger Thomas Hoo. \n\nThe learned Herald suggests instead, that the Lord Hoo may have quartered his arms with those of an extinct family of Hastange or Hastings (''azure, a chief gules, over all a lion rampant or'') when becoming Lord Hoo and Hastings, and that this coat, with an escutcheon of pretence for St Omer, was depicted for the younger Thomas Hoo on this monument to denote his association with the Lordship of Hastings. The monument has been repainted to represent this interpretation.<ref>Elliott, 'A monumental palimpsest', p. 139.</ref> \n\nHowever this problem is older than the riddle of the tomb figures. The lion rampant, with a single tail but ''without'' the chief, is quartered with Hoo, with escutcheon of pretence for St Omer, in the original seal of Thomas Hoo the younger attached to his feoffment of 1481, and also recorded as having been appended to his own testification of his pedigree.<ref>Cooper, 'Families of Braose and Hoo', [http://www.archive.org/stream/sussexarchaeolo34socigoog#page/n158/mode/2up pp. 126-27] (Internet Archive).</ref> In the same way, the armorial roll seen by Sir Henry Chauncy before 1700, which had descended in the Carew family, concluded in its third membrane with the arms of Hoo impaled with Welles, \"but\" (wrote Sir Henry), \"the Coat is mistaken, for the Lyon should be with a double Tayl\".<ref>Chauncy, ''Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=99MqAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA404#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 404-06] (Google).</ref> \n\nA canopied tomb at [[Horsham]] is also claimed to represent a member of the Hoo family.\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nThomas Hoo married (1st) before 1 July 1428, Elizabeth Wychingham, daughter of Nicholas Wychingham, esquire, of Witchingham, [[Norfolk]], by whom he had a daughter: \n*Anne Hoo (born c.1424), who married [[Geoffrey Boleyn|Sir Geoffrey Boleyn]], [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|mercer]] and [[List of Lord Mayors of London|Lord Mayor of London]]:<ref>A.B.

All but one of the miniatures are by one artist, known (from this book) as the \"Hoo Master\", of which about half are devotional scenes and half narrative subjects. They include patron images (identifiable by heraldry): Lord Hoo prays to the Holy Trinity, a little preceding a scene of the disembowelling of [[Erasmus of Formia|St Erasmus]], suggesting that he may have suffered from intestinal troubles. Dame Eleanor prays to the Virgin and Child, and wears a high butterfly headdress, and the arms of Hoo impaling Welles upon her kirtle: just after this, images of [[Leonard of Noblac|St Leonard]] and St Hildevert ([[Roman Catholic Diocese of Meaux|Bishop of Meaux]], died c. 680) are inserted, suggesting that she may have been afflicted by mental weakness or epilepsy.<ref>L.L.

Both artists (of whom the \"Hoo Master\" was notably more sophisticated in technique) were probably miniaturists of the Parisian school who had moved to work at Rouen.

Chauncy's identification of the marriages of Lord Hoo's parents and grandparents is correct, but the punctuation of his original edition, in describing the different coats in the Keate MS, may have given rise to confusions.

The tabard of Lord Hoo and Hastings shows ''quarterly sable and argent'' (for Hoo), quartered with ''azure, a fess between six cross-crosslets or'' (for St Omer), with, on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon of pretence]], ''azure, fretty argent, a chief gules'' (for St Ledger). (This is the same as in the patron image in the \"Hours of Lord Hoo\".) \n\nThe tabard of the younger Thomas Hoo shows the arms of Hoo quartered with a bearing depicting a lion rampant, with a [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]], with the arms of St Omer on the escutcheon of pretence. This lion was formerly taken to be the arms of Welles (''or a lion rampant double queued sable''):<ref>Ray, 'The parish church of All Saints, Herstmonceux, and the Dacre tomb', pp. 36-55. See Chauncy, ''Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire'', p. 511.</ref> which, however, if so, should have lions with two tails, and would allude to the marriage of the elder brother, not relevant to the younger Thomas Hoo. \n\nThe learned Herald suggests instead, that the Lord Hoo may have quartered his arms with those of an extinct family of Hastange or Hastings (''azure, a chief gules, over all a lion rampant or'') when becoming Lord Hoo and Hastings, and that this coat, with an escutcheon of pretence for St Omer, was depicted for the younger Thomas Hoo on this monument to denote his association with the Lordship of Hastings. The monument has been repainted to represent this interpretation.<ref>Elliott, 'A monumental palimpsest', p. 139.</ref> \n\nHowever this problem is older than the riddle of the tomb figures. The lion rampant, with a single tail but ''without'' the chief, is quartered with Hoo, with escutcheon of pretence for St Omer, in the original seal of Thomas Hoo the younger attached to his feoffment of 1481, and also recorded as having been appended to his own testification of his pedigree.<ref>Cooper, 'Families of Braose and Hoo', [http://www.archive.org/stream/sussexarchaeolo34socigoog#page/n158/mode/2up pp. 126-27] (Internet Archive).</ref> In the same way, the armorial roll seen by Sir Henry Chauncy before 1700, which had descended in the Carew family, concluded in its third membrane with the arms of Hoo impaled with Welles, \"but\" (wrote Sir Henry), \"the Coat is mistaken, for the Lyon should be with a double Tayl\".<ref>Chauncy, ''Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=99MqAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA404#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 404-06] (Google).</ref> \n\nA canopied tomb at [[Horsham]] is also claimed to represent a member of the Hoo family.\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nThomas Hoo married (1st) before 1 July 1428, Elizabeth Wychingham, daughter of Nicholas Wychingham, esquire, of Witchingham, [[Norfolk]], by whom he had a daughter: \n*Anne Hoo (born c.1424), who married [[Geoffrey Boleyn|Sir Geoffrey Boleyn]], [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|mercer]] and [[List of Lord Mayors of London|Lord Mayor of London]]:<ref>A.B.

It was constructed from a section of the former [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], built by the Midland Railway in 1863 to link Manchester with London, which closed in 1968. The Monsal Trail is about 8.5 miles in length and opened in 1981. It starts at the Topley Pike junction in Wye Dale, three miles East of [[Buxton]], and runs to Coombs Viaduct, one mile South-East of [[Bakewell]]. It follows the valley of the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]]. The trail passes through [[Blackwell Mill]], [[Chee Dale]], [[Millers Dale]], [[Cressbrook]], [[Monsal Dale]], [[Great Longstone]], [[Hassop]] and [[Bakewell]]. The trail has numerous landmarks including Headstone Viaduct, Cressbrook Mill, Litton Mill and [[Hassop railway station]], and passes through six tunnels.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hassop station up empties approaching (remains of) geograph-2791559-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The former railway line near Hassop Railway Station]]\nThe Monsall Trail follows a section of the former [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], built by the [[Midland Railway]] in 1863 to link Manchester with London. The line was closed in 1968 by the Labour Minister for Transport [[Barbara Castle]], not by the [[Beeching Axe]], and remained unused for twelve years before being taken over by the [[Peak District National Park]]. \n\nThe route through the Wye valley was necessitated by the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]'s objection to the railway passing through his land (which included not only [[Chatsworth House]], but extensive grounds north of [[Rowsley]]). The route meant that the line had to pass above the town of Bakewell, rather than through it. The [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Duke of Rutland]], of [[Haddon Hall]], insisted on the construction of [[Haddon Tunnel]] to hide it from his view, but he used Bakewell railway station, which was built to a grander design than normal, and carried his coat of arms. The Duke of Devonshire later realised the value of the railway, and his offer for the Midland Railway to run through Chatsworth came too late. He was the force behind the construction of [[Hassop railway station]], which, although nearer to Bakewell than Hassop village, meant he did not have to share a railway station with his neighbour.<ref>{{cite book |title=Railways in the Peak District: A History |first1=Christopher P. |last1=Nicholson |first2=Peter M. |last2=Barnes |publisher=Dalesman Books |date=1971 |isbn=978-0852061183}}</ref> Great Longstone (Longstone before 1913) served [[Thornbridge Hall]], and the railway station design, with leaded glass windows, reflected the architecture of the hall.\n\nFor many years the trail could not follow the trackbed through the tunnels at Monsal Head and Cressbrook which been closed for safety reasons and the trail was diverted to avoid them.

It was constructed from a section of the former [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], built by the Midland Railway in 1863 to link Manchester with London, which closed in 1968. The Monsal Trail is about 8.5 miles in length and opened in 1981. It starts at the Topley Pike junction in Wye Dale, three miles East of [[Buxton]], and runs to Coombs Viaduct, one mile South-East of [[Bakewell]]. It follows the valley of the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]]. The trail passes through [[Blackwell Mill]], [[Chee Dale]], [[Millers Dale]], [[Cressbrook]], [[Monsal Dale]], [[Great Longstone]], [[Hassop]] and [[Bakewell]]. The trail has numerous landmarks including Headstone Viaduct, Cressbrook Mill, Litton Mill and [[Hassop railway station]], and passes through six tunnels.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hassop station up empties approaching (remains of) geograph-2791559-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The former railway line near Hassop Railway Station]]\nThe Monsall Trail follows a section of the former [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], built by the [[Midland Railway]] in 1863 to link Manchester with London. The line was closed in 1968 by the Labour Minister for Transport [[Barbara Castle]], not by the [[Beeching Axe]], and remained unused for twelve years before being taken over by the [[Peak District National Park]]. \n\nThe route through the Wye valley was necessitated by the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]'s objection to the railway passing through his land (which included not only [[Chatsworth House]], but extensive grounds north of [[Rowsley]]). The route meant that the line had to pass above the town of Bakewell, rather than through it. The [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Duke of Rutland]], of [[Haddon Hall]], insisted on the construction of [[Haddon Tunnel]] to hide it from his view, but he used Bakewell railway station, which was built to a grander design than normal, and carried his coat of arms. The Duke of Devonshire later realised the value of the railway, and his offer for the Midland Railway to run through Chatsworth came too late. He was the force behind the construction of [[Hassop railway station]], which, although nearer to Bakewell than Hassop village, meant he did not have to share a railway station with his neighbour.<ref>{{cite book |title=Railways in the Peak District: A History |first1=Christopher P. |last1=Nicholson |first2=Peter M. |last2=Barnes |publisher=Dalesman Books |date=1971 |isbn=978-0852061183}}</ref> Great Longstone (Longstone before 1913) served [[Thornbridge Hall]], and the railway station design, with leaded glass windows, reflected the architecture of the hall.\n\nFor many years the trail could not follow the trackbed through the tunnels at Monsal Head and Cressbrook which been closed for safety reasons and the trail was diverted to avoid them. The tunnels were walked by [[Julia Bradbury]] in BBC TV's ''Railway Walks: The Peak Express''.<ref>{{cite episode |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dtp4b|title=The Peak Express |series=Railway Walks with Julia Bradbury |number=1 |date=2008 |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Many access points and diversion paths were unsuitable for cyclists, wheelchairs or people with walking difficulties because of steep uneven stone steps or narrow paths.

Typically the graves that utilized inhumation or vaulting contained bodies in wooden coffins, which were more valuable than their clay counterparts as well as items of wealth and even human sacrifices. Clay coffins are often associated with the poorest graves in Egyptian society, though not always in [[Levant]].<ref>[Perry, W.J. \"Sumer and Egypt.\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 29\u201330.]</ref> Notably, Egypt continued to develop new methods of burial whereas Sumer ''stagnated.''<ref>[Perry, W.J. \"Sumer and Egypt.\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 31.]</ref>\n\nIn 1929 [[George Horsfield]], who was the Director of Antiquities for [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], was made aware of a tomb near the city of [[Sahab, Jordan|Sahab]].

These disturbed coffins, even though looted of their valuable objects, still hold a great deal of importance. Examining the coffins themselves proves to be of great value.[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/clay_coffin.aspx] In earlier times, at the end of the [[Pre-Dynastic]] Period and during the First Dynasty of Sumer and Egypt, clay coffins were imitations of ornamental wooden ones.<ref>[Perry, W.J. \"Sumer and Egypt.\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 28\u201333.]</ref> Although most commonly found in single graves, at [[Tell el-Yahudiyeh]] there were many coffins placed next to one another in rows.

Due to the large length, girth, and the weight it seems ideal for the construction to take place near. Moving them long distances wouldn\u2019t have been feasible as the heavy clay would have been fragile. The material makeup of the clay has many impurities; rocks, sand, pot shards, and straw can be found in the shards.<ref>[Dothan, Trude. \u2018\u2019Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 99]</ref> The inconsistencies in the property of the clay would not have been detrimental to the coffin\u2019s stability, it would in fact have helped the structure. Rocks, sand, grit, and broken shards in the clay would have allowed for less stress on the form while it was drying. This stronger clay would have made the surface require more smoothing attention.\n\n===Construction, Building Technique===\n:The coffins where coil built, this technique is done with large amounts of clay formed into coils and then layered upon one another with water or slip to act as a binder between layers.<ref>[Ibid]</ref>  Whinding and forming the structure, large objects can be built in stages this way as a result of the lower sections being allowed to dry to support the continued addition of clay.

More durable ceramic pieces have been fired to a higher temperature, allowing the clay to dehydrate and burn off all of the water that was mixed into it to create a malleable material to craft and mold with. With the smaller face masks, where more time was devoted to sculpting, molding, and carving the features, more care has then been taken to ensure that they would last. \u201cThe coffins were fired in an open fire at a low temperature, which would account for the sometimes crumbly and mottled material.\u201d<ref>[Dothan, Trude. \u2018\u2019Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019.

The groups are:\n\n==== Group A ====\n::This style is the dominant shape at [[Deir el-Balah]], it is mummy shaped with delineated head and shoulders in various proportions and silhouettes. The shape follows he traditional concept of [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] anthropoid coffins.\n\n==== Group B ====\n::Cylindrical Coffins, or Group B, have a head and shoulders that are not delineated. There is sometimes a round opening at the top of the head with a molded [[pithos]] like rim, this can appear like the opening of a vase. This style can also have a round opening in the base. The bottoms of both the feet are outlined. The lid is small in proportion to the coffin.<ref>[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019.

Many of the excavated anthropoid ceramic coffins from [[Deir el-Balah]] were buried in similar ritual contexts dating from the 14th-11th centuries BCE. The coffins were cut into a foundation of Kurkar (sandstone) or hamrah (red sand) and lined with rough stones and oriented to the west.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 1]</ref>  The coffins at [[Deir el-Balah]] were marked with large [[pithoi]] at the head of the burial with dipper jugs inside and bowls on top serving as lids, these deposits served as the grave markers. At [[Deir el-Balah]] the coffins typically contained more than one individual and contained up to four people in some cases. At [[Beth Shean]] the coffins were placed into rock cut tombs also facing the west from the same time period as [[Deir el-Balah]].<ref>[The Northern Cemetery at Beth Shean, p. 91 ]</ref> The northern cemetery at [[Beth Shean]] contained roughly fifty coffins with surviving face lids.<ref>[Ibid]</ref> These graves had been disturbed in antiquity and the amount of information left was sparse. The coffins from [[Beth Shean]] were unique and were adorned with headdresses, which some have suggested to mean they are of [[Philistine]] origin.<ref>[Biblical Archaeology Review]</ref> At [[Lachish]] and [[Tell el-Far\u2019ah]] the several rock cut tombs found there containing anthropoid ceramic coffins date from a later period, 12th\u201310th centuries BCE, and are mostly associated with [[Philistine]] offerings.<ref>[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 283]</ref>\n\n==Offerings==\n[[File:Anthropoid Clay Coffin3.jpg|thumb|border|right|top|upright=1.5|Interior of an Anthropoid Clay Coffin, ceramic vessels.]]\nThese burials were typically associated with a large variety of expensive grave offerings. The offerings consist of [[ceramics]], [[Bronze|bronzes]], and [[jewelry]] of precious metals and stones. Wide ranges of ceramic offerings are found with the burials such as [[Cyprus|Cypriot]], [[Canaan]]ite, [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]], [[Mycenae]]an, and [[Philistine]] pottery.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 3 ]</ref> The pottery can be separated into two categories, that which is found ''within the coffin'' and that which is found ''outside of the coffin''. The pottery found outside of the coffin is typically larger and of a more utilitarian variety, such as storage jars, [[pithoi]], stirrup jars, and cooking pots. The pottery found inside the coffins is smaller and of a higher quality, including Cypriots milk bowls, Egyptian alabaster cups, pilgrim flasks, and juglets. The earlier burials (14th\u201312th centuries BCE) were associated with more Egyptian influenced pottery and finds, whereas the later burials (12th\u201310th centuries BCE) were associated with the [[Philistine]] culture.\n\nBronze tools and implements were another common burial offering associated with anthropoid ceramic coffins. The bronze items are usually Egyptian in style and consist of bowls, pitchers, knives, and in one case a wine set. The wine set consisted of a bronze pitcher and a strainer and is one of only a few complete sets found.<ref>[Anthropoid Clay Coffins from a Late Bronze Age Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, p. 10]</ref> In a rich coffin of a woman at Deir el-Balah an [[Egyptian New Kingdom]] style bronze mirror was found. Bronze was not the only type metal artifact found; in one of the tombs at Tell el-Far\u2019ah one of oldest pieces of ''Iron'' in the [[Levant]] was found.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 103]</ref>\n\nThese anthropoid ceramic coffins appear to have been associated with wealthier individuals and consequently have a trove of expensive small finds. Many beads from necklaces and bracelets made of expensive materials were found inside the coffins.<ref>[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 298]</ref> Golden beads in the shapes of [[palmettes]] and lotus blossoms were common and showed the incorporation of Egyptian and [[Near Eastern]] art motifs in the funerary adornment. Many of the beads found were made out of a semi-precious stone, carnelian.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 27 ]</ref> Another interesting find associated with one of the coffins at Deir el-Balah was a makeup spoon in the shape of a diving woman.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 48]</ref> This is a common motif found in Egyptian art of the New Kingdom period. One of the more important small finds associated with the coffins from all sites they were found at are [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]]. Scarabs bearing imagery and the [[cartouches]] of New Kingdom Pharaohs, including one of [[Rameses II]], have been found in context with most of the coffins and suggest that the people buried in the coffins were possibly Egyptian officials.<ref>[Life in Judah from the Perspective of the Dead, p. 125]</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\nMost of the information known about these burials has been taken from the associated finds due to the lack of written evidence. Only on two occasions was there writing associated with the burials; one, a badly preserved funerary stele lining a grave at Deir el-Balah and two, a coffin lid from Lachish that had poorly written and preserved hieroglyphs on it.<ref>[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 285 ]</ref> There are still some mysteries associated with these burials, one being sets of ''stone'' and ''bone pellets'' found inside many of the coffins.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 98]</ref> The use of the pellets has yet to be discovered. The biggest unknown still surrounding these coffins, that the offerings have helped to unravel, is who were the coffins made for. Scholars have suggested they are for Egyptians, Canaanites imitating the Egyptians, and the Philistines.<ref>[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 327]</ref> From the dates associated with the finds, it appears that the coffins originated with Egyptians and Egyptian influence in Canaan and then was adopted by the Philistines later.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bronze Age]]\n[[Category:Burials]]\n[[Category:Canaan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe '''anthropoid ceramic coffins''' of the Late [[Bronze Age]] [[Levant]] are a unique burial practice that is a synthesis of [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] and [[Near Eastern]] ideologies.

Items found here can be said to have arrived from a variety of sources. However, there is evidence of strong Egyptian influence on local items as well as items imported from Egypt.<ref>[Dothan, Trude. \u2018\u2019Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019.

Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 3]</ref> In antiquity many coffins had fallen prey to grave robbers. These disturbed coffins, even though looted of their valuable objects, still hold a great deal of importance. Examining the coffins themselves proves to be of great value.[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/clay_coffin.aspx] In earlier times, at the end of the [[Pre-Dynastic]] Period and during the First Dynasty of Sumer and Egypt, clay coffins were imitations of ornamental wooden ones.<ref>[Perry, W.J. \"Sumer and Egypt.\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 28\u201333.]</ref> Although most commonly found in single graves, at [[Tell el-Yahudiyeh]] there were many coffins placed next to one another in rows. These coffins were painted and plain, painted coffins are not commonly mentioned.<ref>[Albright, W.

Due to the large length, girth, and the weight it seems ideal for the construction to take place near. Moving them long distances wouldn\u2019t have been feasible as the heavy clay would have been fragile. The material makeup of the clay has many impurities; rocks, sand, pot shards, and straw can be found in the shards.<ref>[Dothan, Trude. \u2018\u2019Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 99]</ref> The inconsistencies in the property of the clay would not have been detrimental to the coffin\u2019s stability, it would in fact have helped the structure. Rocks, sand, grit, and broken shards in the clay would have allowed for less stress on the form while it was drying. This stronger clay would have made the surface require more smoothing attention.\n\n===Construction, Building Technique===\n:The coffins where coil built, this technique is done with large amounts of clay formed into coils and then layered upon one another with water or slip to act as a binder between layers.<ref>[Ibid]</ref>  Whinding and forming the structure, large objects can be built in stages this way as a result of the lower sections being allowed to dry to support the continued addition of clay. Tapered at one or both ends.<ref>[Bloch-Smith, Elizabeth. \u201cLife in Judah from the Perspective of the Dead.\u201d Near Eastern Archaeology, Vol. 65, No. 2, The Archaeology of the Death (Jun., 2002), 135.]</ref> There is evidence that the lids were cut out of the forms after the initial building to be reworked and molded, this would have been done at the [[leather hard]] stage when the clay was firm but still mailable.<ref>[Ibid]</ref> The facial features tend to be formed by molding with the clay that is part of the formed lid, though with lids of the grotesque style applying more clay to the surface.<ref>[Albright, W. F. \"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.-Sep.,1932), 295\u2013306.]</ref> Attention was paid most notably to the face lids, secondly to the exterior of the coffin, which was smoothed down and compressed back into itself. And lastly the interior was left rough and undefined with coils still notable.<ref>[Albright, W. F. \"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.-Sep.,1932), 295\u2013306.]</ref> Some times handles can be found along the sides of the coffins, used for carrying as well as adapted and molded into representing the facial features on the lids.<ref>[Ibid.]</ref> Handles seem to be one of the local variations that coffin sport; they are found in Transjordan and Beth-shan. The formations of the arms sculpted thinly along the edge of the lid are a conceptual representation and on a majority of the coffins they are not overly defined.<ref>[Albright, W. F. \"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.\u2013Sep.,1932), 295\u2013306.]</ref> There are instances of painted or scribed hieroglyphs on the exteriors of the coffins, though they are usually crudely rendered.<ref>[Ibid]</ref>\n\n===Completing and Firing===\n:The lids of the coffins are more often in better shape then the main bodies. The coffins found in Tomb 116 at [[Deir el-Balah]] have the lids close to intact while the body of the coffin, being fragile, broke easily upon excavation.<ref>[Dothan, Trude. \u2018\u2019Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 30]</ref> The stability of the clay is determined by how it was treated and how it has been fired. More durable ceramic pieces have been fired to a higher temperature, allowing the clay to dehydrate and burn off all of the water that was mixed into it to create a malleable material to craft and mold with. With the smaller face masks, where more time was devoted to sculpting, molding, and carving the features, more care has then been taken to ensure that they would last. \u201cThe coffins were fired in an open fire at a low temperature, which would account for the sometimes crumbly and mottled material.\u201d<ref>[Dothan, Trude. \u2018\u2019Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 90]</ref>\n\n===Face lids===\nFace Lids fall into two categories, naturalistic or grotesque.\n\n==== Natural ====\n:[[Realism (arts)|Naturalistic]] Coffin Lids have a clearly shown face. [[File:Anthropid Clay Coffin2.jpg|thumb|border|right|top|upright=1|Anthropoid Clay Coffin with face lid and crossed arms. An example of a naturalistic face lid.]]\n\n::Naturalistic style coffins have well defined heads and facial features. These coffins are often molded in relief and have large Egyptian features, i.e. almond shaped eyes, arched eyebrows, straight noses, and full lips. The hair or wigs tend to be molded less sharply.<ref>[Dothan, Trude. \u2018\u2019Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 10]</ref> The face lid of the coffins are molded separately and then later replaced upon the larger coffin, the shape of the lid hole also took into consideration the interning of bodies and is large enough for its purpose.<ref>[Dothan, Trude. \u2018\u2019Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019.

An example of a grotesque face lid.]]\n\n::Grotesque style coffins have eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, ears, and beard that have been applied separately to the leather hard clay. This can be done with a [[slipping and scoring]] that joins two separate pieces of clay together. \"The fact that the lid ''is'' the face gives a bizarre somewhat caricature-like effect.\"<ref>[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 30.]</ref> The grotesque lids are associated with the later coffins of the 11th-10th centuries BCE and the construction practices of the Philistines.\n\n===Coffin Type===\n:Typologically the coffins have been divided into two groups according to the outline of the lids and coffins. The groups are:\n\n==== Group A ====\n::This style is the dominant shape at [[Deir el-Balah]], it is mummy shaped with delineated head and shoulders in various proportions and silhouettes. The shape follows he traditional concept of [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] anthropoid coffins.\n\n==== Group B ====\n::Cylindrical Coffins, or Group B, have a head and shoulders that are not delineated. There is sometimes a round opening at the top of the head with a molded [[pithos]] like rim, this can appear like the opening of a vase. This style can also have a round opening in the base. The bottoms of both the feet are outlined. The lid is small in proportion to the coffin.<ref>[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah\u2019\u2019.

F. \"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.\u2013Sep.,1932), 295\u2013306.]</ref>\n\n==Burials==\n\nThere were burials containing anthropoid ceramic coffins excavated at the sites of [[Deir el-Balah]] and [[Beth Shean]] predominantly, however there were coffins found in smaller numbers at [[Lachish]], [[Tell el-Far\u2019ah]], [[Sahab, Jordan|Sahab]], and the [[Jezreel Valley]]. Many of the excavated anthropoid ceramic coffins from [[Deir el-Balah]] were buried in similar ritual contexts dating from the 14th-11th centuries BCE. The coffins were cut into a foundation of Kurkar (sandstone) or hamrah (red sand) and lined with rough stones and oriented to the west.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 1]</ref>  The coffins at [[Deir el-Balah]] were marked with large [[pithoi]] at the head of the burial with dipper jugs inside and bowls on top serving as lids, these deposits served as the grave markers. At [[Deir el-Balah]] the coffins typically contained more than one individual and contained up to four people in some cases. At [[Beth Shean]] the coffins were placed into rock cut tombs also facing the west from the same time period as [[Deir el-Balah]].<ref>[The Northern Cemetery at Beth Shean, p. 91 ]</ref> The northern cemetery at [[Beth Shean]] contained roughly fifty coffins with surviving face lids.<ref>[Ibid]</ref> These graves had been disturbed in antiquity and the amount of information left was sparse. The coffins from [[Beth Shean]] were unique and were adorned with headdresses, which some have suggested to mean they are of [[Philistine]] origin.<ref>[Biblical Archaeology Review]</ref> At [[Lachish]] and [[Tell el-Far\u2019ah]] the several rock cut tombs found there containing anthropoid ceramic coffins date from a later period, 12th\u201310th centuries BCE, and are mostly associated with [[Philistine]] offerings.<ref>[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 283]</ref>\n\n==Offerings==\n[[File:Anthropoid Clay Coffin3.jpg|thumb|border|right|top|upright=1.5|Interior of an Anthropoid Clay Coffin, ceramic vessels.]]\nThese burials were typically associated with a large variety of expensive grave offerings. The offerings consist of [[ceramics]], [[Bronze|bronzes]], and [[jewelry]] of precious metals and stones. Wide ranges of ceramic offerings are found with the burials such as [[Cyprus|Cypriot]], [[Canaan]]ite, [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]], [[Mycenae]]an, and [[Philistine]] pottery.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 3 ]</ref> The pottery can be separated into two categories, that which is found ''within the coffin'' and that which is found ''outside of the coffin''. The pottery found outside of the coffin is typically larger and of a more utilitarian variety, such as storage jars, [[pithoi]], stirrup jars, and cooking pots. The pottery found inside the coffins is smaller and of a higher quality, including Cypriots milk bowls, Egyptian alabaster cups, pilgrim flasks, and juglets. The earlier burials (14th\u201312th centuries BCE) were associated with more Egyptian influenced pottery and finds, whereas the later burials (12th\u201310th centuries BCE) were associated with the [[Philistine]] culture.\n\nBronze tools and implements were another common burial offering associated with anthropoid ceramic coffins. The bronze items are usually Egyptian in style and consist of bowls, pitchers, knives, and in one case a wine set. The wine set consisted of a bronze pitcher and a strainer and is one of only a few complete sets found.<ref>[Anthropoid Clay Coffins from a Late Bronze Age Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, p. 10]</ref> In a rich coffin of a woman at Deir el-Balah an [[Egyptian New Kingdom]] style bronze mirror was found. Bronze was not the only type metal artifact found; in one of the tombs at Tell el-Far\u2019ah one of oldest pieces of ''Iron'' in the [[Levant]] was found.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 103]</ref>\n\nThese anthropoid ceramic coffins appear to have been associated with wealthier individuals and consequently have a trove of expensive small finds. Many beads from necklaces and bracelets made of expensive materials were found inside the coffins.<ref>[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 298]</ref> Golden beads in the shapes of [[palmettes]] and lotus blossoms were common and showed the incorporation of Egyptian and [[Near Eastern]] art motifs in the funerary adornment. Many of the beads found were made out of a semi-precious stone, carnelian.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 27 ]</ref> Another interesting find associated with one of the coffins at Deir el-Balah was a makeup spoon in the shape of a diving woman.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 48]</ref> This is a common motif found in Egyptian art of the New Kingdom period. One of the more important small finds associated with the coffins from all sites they were found at are [[scarabs]]. Scarabs bearing imagery and the [[cartouches]] of New Kingdom Pharaohs, including one of [[Rameses II]], have been found in context with most of the coffins and suggest that the people buried in the coffins were possibly Egyptian officials.<ref>[Life in Judah from the Perspective of the Dead, p. 125]</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\nMost of the information known about these burials has been taken from the associated finds due to the lack of written evidence. Only on two occasions was there writing associated with the burials; one, a badly preserved funerary stele lining a grave at Deir el-Balah and two, a coffin lid from Lachish that had poorly written and preserved hieroglyphs on it.<ref>[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 285 ]</ref> There are still some mysteries associated with these burials, one being sets of ''stone'' and ''bone pellets'' found inside many of the coffins.<ref>[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 98]</ref> The use of the pellets has yet to be discovered. The biggest unknown still surrounding these coffins, that the offerings have helped to unravel, is who were the coffins made for. Scholars have suggested they are for Egyptians, Canaanites imitating the Egyptians, and the Philistines.<ref>[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 327]</ref> From the dates associated with the finds, it appears that the coffins originated with Egyptians and Egyptian influence in Canaan and then was adopted by the Philistines later.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bronze Age]]\n[[Category:Burials]]\n[[Category:Canaan]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toScarab(link changed toScarab (artifact)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropoid_ceramic_coffins"}

Over 60 of these objects are now held by the [[British Museum]], with others scattered across a range of museums around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=34996&plaA=34996-3-1|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for|work=British Museum}}</ref></blockquote><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/gypsum-statue-of-woman/BAEXWYi1AZfSZg|title=British Museum - The 'Isis Tomb', Polledrara Cemetery, Vulci|work=britishmuseum.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Discovery==\nThe tomb was located on land that belonged to [[Lucien Bonaparte]], Prince of Canino and brother of [[Napoleon]]. In 1839, Prince Lucien opened up a large 6th century tomb at the Polledrara Cemetery near Vulci. Many objects were found but only those considered valuable were retained - much ceramic [[pottery]], for example was lost. In 1844, the Prince's widow [[Alexandrine de Bleschamp]] sold about sixty objects from the tomb to Dr [[August Emil Braun|Emil Braun]] of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] at Rome. These were later sold by Braun to the British Museum.\n\n==Description of Objects==\nAll the items found in the tomb date between 625 and 550 BC. The burial chamber is known as the 'Isis Tomb'  because it was once thought that a bronze bust found in the tomb represented the Egyptian deity [[Isis]].  However the sculpture is more likely to depict a native fertility goddess or priestess. There were many objects from the Isis Tomb that were clearly imported from [[Egypt]] or elsewhere in the [[Middle East]]. These included blue [[faience]] flasks and [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]] with hieroglyphic inscriptions. Four ostrich eggs were probably decorated by [[Phoenicia]]n artists in Lebanon. There were also a large number of bronze vessels interred in the tomb, including cups, bowls, tripod-bowls, a cauldron, a lamp-stand, an amphora, a [[brazier]] and a cinerary urn. Ceramic objects included a [[hydria]], a large [[amphora]] and a [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], and there was also a range of gold jewellery included a [[diadem]]. Perhaps the most important objects buried in the tomb were a number of bronze and gypsum sculptures, including a half-life size statue of a noble lady, perhaps a depiction of the original occupant of the burial chamber. She is shown wearing a [[cloak]] and long [[tunic]] with traces of paint.\n\n==Occupants of the Tomb==\nThe exact location of the [[tomb]] is currently unknown as, once all materials from the chamber had been removed, it was filled in and abandoned. The names of the original occupants remain obscure, although [[archaeologists]] have suggested, based on the range and style of objects found, that a [[married couple]] was probably buried in the chamber, along with other members of their family. They must have come from a very affluent and prestigious Etruscan [[dynasty]] in [[Vulci]], given the luxurious items they chose to be buried with, many of which must have been imported from abroad at great expense.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Isistomb-BM.JPG|Bronze [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] from the tomb that was originally thought to represent the goddess Isis\nImage:Isis Tomb (8).JPG|Two flasks with Egyptian [[hieroglyphic]] inscriptions\nImage:IsisTomb-BM.JPG|Ornamented and painted [[ostrich]] eggs from the tomb\nImage:Isis Tomb (2).JPG|Two bronze vessels from the tomb \nImage:Isis Tomb (3).JPG|Gold diadem with [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossed]] decoration of cables, palmettes, chimeras and lions\nImage:Isis Tomb (4).JPG|Part of an iron [[brazier]]: two bronze wheels and two bronze horses' heads\nImage:Isis Tomb (5).JPG|Bronze [[tripod]] stand with a hammered ring and cast feet\nImage:Isis Tomb (6).JPG|Ancient Egyptian [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]] found in the Isis Tomb\nImage:Isis Tomb (7).JPG|Bronze four-nozzled lamp-stand\nImage:Isis Tomb (9).JPG|Large storage-jar or [[amphora]] with painted decoration and a bronze biconical cinerary [[urn]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*L.

Over 60 of these objects are now held by the [[British Museum]], with others scattered across a range of museums around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=34996&plaA=34996-3-1|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for|work=British Museum}}</ref></blockquote><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/gypsum-statue-of-woman/BAEXWYi1AZfSZg|title=British Museum - The 'Isis Tomb', Polledrara Cemetery, Vulci|work=britishmuseum.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Discovery==\nThe tomb was located on land that belonged to [[Lucien Bonaparte]], Prince of Canino and brother of [[Napoleon]]. In 1839, Prince Lucien opened up a large 6th century tomb at the Polledrara Cemetery near Vulci. Many objects were found but only those considered valuable were retained - much ceramic [[pottery]], for example was lost. In 1844, the Prince's widow [[Alexandrine de Bleschamp]] sold about sixty objects from the tomb to Dr [[August Emil Braun|Emil Braun]] of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] at Rome. These were later sold by Braun to the British Museum.\n\n==Description of Objects==\nAll the items found in the tomb date between 625 and 550 BC. The burial chamber is known as the 'Isis Tomb'  because it was once thought that a bronze bust found in the tomb represented the Egyptian deity [[Isis]].  However the sculpture is more likely to depict a native fertility goddess or priestess. There were many objects from the Isis Tomb that were clearly imported from [[Egypt]] or elsewhere in the [[Middle East]]. These included blue [[faience]] flasks and [[scarabs]] with hieroglyphic inscriptions. Four ostrich eggs were probably decorated by [[Phoenicia]]n artists in Lebanon. There were also a large number of bronze vessels interred in the tomb, including cups, bowls, tripod-bowls, a cauldron, a lamp-stand, an amphora, a [[brazier]] and a cinerary urn. Ceramic objects included a [[hydria]], a large [[amphora]] and a [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], and there was also a range of gold jewellery included a [[diadem]]. Perhaps the most important objects buried in the tomb were a number of bronze and gypsum sculptures, including a half-life size statue of a noble lady, perhaps a depiction of the original occupant of the burial chamber. She is shown wearing a [[cloak]] and long [[tunic]] with traces of paint.\n\n==Occupants of the Tomb==\nThe exact location of the [[tomb]] is currently unknown as, once all materials from the chamber had been removed, it was filled in and abandoned. The names of the original occupants remain obscure, although [[archaeologists]] have suggested, based on the range and style of objects found, that a [[married couple]] was probably buried in the chamber, along with other members of their family. They must have come from a very affluent and prestigious Etruscan [[dynasty]] in [[Vulci]], given the luxurious items they chose to be buried with, many of which must have been imported from abroad at great expense.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Isistomb-BM.JPG|Bronze [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] from the tomb that was originally thought to represent the goddess Isis\nImage:Isis Tomb (8).JPG|Two flasks with Egyptian [[hieroglyphic]] inscriptions\nImage:IsisTomb-BM.JPG|Ornamented and painted [[ostrich]] eggs from the tomb\nImage:Isis Tomb (2).JPG|Two bronze vessels from the tomb \nImage:Isis Tomb (3).JPG|Gold diadem with [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossed]] decoration of cables, palmettes, chimeras and lions\nImage:Isis Tomb (4).JPG|Part of an iron [[brazier]]: two bronze wheels and two bronze horses' heads\nImage:Isis Tomb (5).JPG|Bronze [[tripod]] stand with a hammered ring and cast feet\nImage:Isis Tomb (6).JPG|Ancient Egyptian [[scarabs]] found in the Isis Tomb\nImage:Isis Tomb (7).JPG|Bronze four-nozzled lamp-stand\nImage:Isis Tomb (9).JPG|Large storage-jar or [[amphora]] with painted decoration and a bronze biconical cinerary [[urn]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*L.
