On 14 April, a debate article was sent to Swedish newspapers signed by 22 academics, claiming that the strategy of the Swedish public health agency will lead to \"chaos in the healthcare system\". Moreover, they claimed that there is no transparency regarding the data used in the models made by the agency. [[Anders Tegnell]] from the public health agency responded to the criticism by saying that there is no lack in transparency in the agency's work and that all data is available to be downloaded by the public as an excel-file on their website. <ref>{{cite web |title=Ann Linde: \u201dForskare om Sveriges strategi: \u201dKommer att bli kaos\u201d\u201d |url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=7451820 |website=www.sverigesradio.se |accessdate=14 April 2020 |language=sv}}</ref>  Additionally Tegnell stated that the numbers of deaths presented in the published article are wrong, especially regarding the specific number of deaths per day. Another claim in the article saying that Sweden's statistics are closing in on to the ones of Italy was countered by Anders Tegnell saying that unlike Sweden, Italy and many other countries only report on deaths in hospitals, making it hard to compare the numbers of the different countries. <ref>{{cite web |title=\"Tegnells svar p\u00e5 skarpa kritiken i DN-debatt: Grundl\u00e4ggande felaktigheter\" |url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/forskare-kritiska-til-fhm-lat-politikerna-ta-over |website=www.svt.se |accessdate=14 April 2020 |language=sv}}</ref>\n\nAccording to surveys carried out in late March and early April , three out of four Swedes (71-76%) trusted the Public Health Agency, and nearly half of the people surveyed (47%) said they had 'very high trust' in the agency.

{"title_page": "Siege of Ramsej", "text_new": "\n\n\nSiege of Ramsej(1682-1688) was a series of military confrontations between Maratha empire headed by Sambhaji and Mughal empire led by Aurangzeb regarding the control of [[Ramsej|Ramsej fort]] in the Nashik region. Aurangzeb arrived in Deccan in late 1681 with a 5,00,000 strong army to destroy the Maratha Empire and the Deccan Sultanates of Adilshahi and Qutubshahi. He wanted to capture the forts held by the Marathas in Nashik and Baglana region. Hence he decided to begin his Deccan campaign with an attack on Ramsej fort which is near Nashik.\n\n== Before the Siege ==\nShivaji's general Moropant Pingle had captured Ramsej in the year 1671-72. Since then it became a part of Maratha Empire. Ramsej was fort lying in open lands without excessive forest cover. Aurangzeb thought that it will be a good idea to capture an easy fort like Ramsej right at the beginning so as to increase the morale of his troops. \n\n== Battles ==\n\n\nRamsej fort saw the war against [[Mughal Empire]] for six and a half years. The first killedar (fort commander) was Suryaji Jadhav, but after five and a half years he was transferred and a new killedar was appointed as per the rotation of posts policy of Maratha empire. In 1682 [[Aurangzeb]] sent Sahabuddin Khan to conquer the fort. Shahbuddin Khan had vowed to capture the fort with his 40,000 army and strong artillery within a few hours. But the 600 Maratha soldiers on the fort kept his forces at bay for many months by fierce array of slingshots, lit haystack and huge stones even though they did not have cannons on the fort. Once the Mughal artillery managed to break the fort walls in the evening and they assumed that the fort will be captured easily. But all 600 Marathas on the fort worked for a full night and rebuilt the entire broken section of the wall, much to the despair and awe of the Mughals. Such fierce resistance made the Mughal soldiers believe that the Marathas on the fort knew black magic. The inability of Mughal Sardar to capture the fort started frustrating Aurangzeb. He raised a wooden platform to storm the fort. Marathas were very smart in the fact that Shivaji and his son Sambhaji had a policy of keeping enough ammunition even on the forts having no cannons or guns. Ramshej was no exception and even though it did not have cannons it had sufficient ammunition. The fort commander had an idea and utilised amply available animal skin and wood on the fort to make wooden cannons. Coupled with the ammunition already present on the fort these wooden cannons started inflicting heavy losses on mughal army. The retaliation from the Marathas was so strong that he left the responsibility to Bahadurkhan and went to Junnar. Bahadurkhan also tried to capture the fort by fooling Marathas into believing that the Mughals were preparing for a full fledged frontal assault. While his real plan was send 200 of his best troops from the rear side of the fort by climbing the steep cliff. The Maratha commander was aware of the fact and allowed these 200 soldiers to climb the rope. Once they had climbed up the rope, he cut the rope as a result of which 200 of the best mughal soldiers fell and died in the valley. Bahadurkhan was distraught and found that Marathas were receiving secret supplies from the nearby forts. He carefully blocked all the paths to nearby Maratha forts. There was dire shortage of food on the fort. Seeing this situation Maratha King Sambhaji acted quickly by sending his sardars Rupaji Bhosle and Manaji More with an 8,000 strong army and supplies. They tried to break through the Mughal line but we're unable to supply the fort. Sambhaji was in great worry that his fiercely brave warriors were fighting without food. But the luck supported the Marathas and due to severe bad weather Bahadurkhan relaxed his encirclement for one day enabling Rupaji and Manaji to supply the fort with supplies enough for 6 more months. Bahadurkhan then tried to win the fort with the help of a 'mantrik' as he believed that the Marathas had ghosts under their control. The Marathas again fooled him as the mantrik was himself a maratha soldier in disguise who led the Mughal army in a deadly ambush of the marathas. Bahadurkhan and Mughals fled the deadly ambush and several Mughals were killed in this surprise attack. Bahadurkhan was also unable to siege the fort, finally, he burnt the wooden platform and left the battle. [[Aurangzeb]] sent Kasim Khan Kirmani to lead the battle and it is said that the Mughals conquered Ramshej Fort by paying [[Bribery|bribe]] to the new killedar. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Indrajit|title=Marathyanche Swatantrayuddha Bhag - 1 Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Shivaji|title=Chhava|publisher=Continental Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe resistance of barely 600 Marathas to such a strong Mughal army of 40,000 consistently for six years is considered to be a folklore in Maratha culture.

Whether you are a heathen or a Christian, one who does not believe in [[Christ]] or a backslider, you will see yourself as [[God]] sees you. \u201cMan looks at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7). God sees us as we really are.\n\n[[Satan]] is the father of all lies. He is the prince of darkness and god of this world, who disguises himself as an angel of light to lead men and women the wrong way. In these days, as in times past, there are many false [[apostles]] who disguise themselves, pretending to be apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed (disguised) into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:13,14). Satan, the god of this world, keeps people in the dark so that they cannot see that God loves them or that Jesus died to save them (2 Cor. 4:4). All sinners and those who do not believe are spiritually dead and blind concerning God. They are ruled by the evil of this world (Eph. 2:1-2). Unless their eyes are opened in some way to their lost condition, they are heading for eternal destruction. The person who says, \u201cI have never sinned\u201d is deceiving himself. For \u201cThe Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the devil had done.\u201d (1 John 3:8). \u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come near to God, and He will come near to you.\u201d (James 4:7,8)\n\nAs you read this book and study its pictures, you will be able to see your own heart. Allow God\u2019s searchlight to show you the condition of your heart. Acknowledge your sins and do not deny their existence, for God\u2019s Word tells us that \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. But if we confess our sins to God, He will keep His promise and do what is right: He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.\u201d (1 John 1:1-10). \u201cThe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin\u201d.\n\nYou are ruled either by Satan or by God; you are a slave to sin or a servant of God. If sin controls your life, do not deny it, but cry out to God. He will set you free through Jesus Christ who came to this world to save sinners, to break the power of Satan and sin over us. He is our Saviour. You are in the presence of a holy God who knows all the secrets, the hidden thoughts and actions of your life. It is impossible to hide yourself and actions from God, for \u201cGod made our ears \u2013 can\u2019t He hear? He made our eyes \u2013 can\u2019t He see?\u201d (Ps. 94:9).\n\nThe Lord keeps close watch over the whole world to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to Him.\u201d (2 Chron.16:9).\n\nHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God.\u201d (Job 34:21,22).\n\nBut [[Jesus]] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all.\u201d (John 2:24).\n\nTherefore \u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit.\u201d (Ps. 32:1-2).\n\n== THE SINNERS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners heart P1.jpg|alt=This picture shows the heart of a wordly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.|thumb|The Sinners Heart]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a worldly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.'''\nBelow the head in this picture, the heart of man can be seen occupied by various animals which speak of the many different sins in the human heart, as the heart is the centre and breeding place of our sins. God tells us by the mouth of His prophet Jeremiah, that \u201cNobody can understand the human heart. There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed.\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nJesus Himself confirms this by saying, \u201cFor from the inside, from a person\u2019s heart, come the evil ideas which lead him to do immoral things; to rob, kill, commit adultery, be greedy, and do all sorts of evil things; deceit, indecency, jealousy, slander, pride, and folly \u2013 all these evil things come from inside a person and make him unclean\u201d (Mark 7:21-23)\n\nThe bleary, red eyes speak of drunkenness.  \u201cDon\u2019t let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, though it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. The next morning you will feel as if you have been bitten by a poisonous snake.\u201d (Proverbs 23:31-32)\n\nDifferent animals and signs used in the pictures reminds us of the following sins:\n\n=== The [[Peacock]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nWhile the beauty of the peacock is admired by everybody, here in the heart of man, it speaks of the sin of pride.\n\n=== The [[goat]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe goat represents bodily desires, immorality, adultery.\n\n=== The [[pig]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe pig speaks of the sins of drunkenness and gluttony. It is a dirty animal eagerly swallowing up everything in its way, clean or dirty, and in the same way a sinful heart devours every immoral suggestion, expression, picture, literature, etc.\n\n=== The [[tortoise]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe tortoise speaks of laziness, sluggishness to obey and witchcraft. \u201cA lazy man who refuses to work is only killing himself, all he does is think about what he would like to have.\u201d  (Prov. 21:25,26).\n\n=== The [[leopard]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe leopard is a very savage and cruel beast. Hatred, anger and a bad temper often rule the heart of man and many times lead to murder. \u201cKeep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbour a grudge.\u201d (Eccl. 7:9)\n\n=== The [[snake]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe snake represents the devil who is very deceitful, clever and misleading, and does everything possible to destroy our relationship with God.\n\n=== The [[frog]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe frog speaks here of the sins of greediness and the love of money which is the source of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Certain frogs in the Congo have been seen eating ants by the hundreds until they burst and died.\n\n=== [[Satan]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nSatan is the father of all lies, and is the one who persuades us to sin, and then he rules our hearts.\n\n=== The [[star]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe star speaks of the conscience in the heart of every man. Even in the bad heart the conscience is still there, but is being ignored, and cannot therefore help this person.\n\n=== The eye of [[God]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe eye of God sees everything that goes on in the heart. Nothing can be hidden from His flaming eye, and therefore He knows and sees all the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart. Whether you do your evil deeds in the darkest night, in the thickest forest, in the deepest ditch or wherever it may be, God sees it.\n\n=== The little tongues of fire[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe little tongues of fire round about the heart show the love of God surrounding the sinful heart. While God hates sin He loves man and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he should turn away from his sins and live. Jesus came to save sinners. There is great joy in heaven over one sinner that repents (Luke 15:7). The little tongues also speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d (John 1:29).\n\n=== The [[angel]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe angel represents the Word of God. God wants to speak to those who have been deceived and are carrying heavy loads of sin, so that they may turn from their sinful ways and let the light and love of God come into their hearts.\n\n=== The [[dove]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe dove is a sign of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who reveals the truth about God, about sin and what is right, and about God\u2019s judgement (John 15:26).\n\n== THE HEART CONVINCED OF SIN[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The heart convinced of sin P2.jpg|alt=The Heart convinced of sin|center|thumb|The Heart convinced of sin]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a man who is sorry for his sins and is beginning to look for God.'''\n\nHere we see the sinner beginning to take notice of the message of God and to open his heart to the love of God. The Holy Spirit begins to shine into the dark and sinful heart. The light of God comes into his heart to drive all darkness away. When God\u2019s light comes in, darkness has to go. Sin, described here by all the various animals, has to go. Therefore, dear reader, allow Jesus, the Light of the world, to come into your heart, and darkness and the evil actions of darkness must leave the heart, as shown in this picture.\n\nJesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.\u201d (John 8:12).\n\nYour heart is intended to be God\u2019s house, God\u2019s temple. He wants to live in it, make it beautiful, fill it with light, love and joy. Jesus not only came to forgive us our sins, but He came to deliver us and set us free from the power and domination of sin.\n\n\u201cIf the Son ([[Jesus]]) sets you free, then you will be really free.\u201d (John 8:36).\n\n== THE REPENTING HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The repenting heart P3.jpg|alt=The repenting heart|center|thumb|The repenting heart]]\n'''This picture shows us the heart of someone who is really serious about finding the right relationship with God.'''\n\nAs he sees the cross which the angel, the Word of God, shows to him, it breaks his now sorry heart, and he is moved with deep, heartfelt regret and sorrow over his many sins. As he sees the great love of God expressed in Christ Jesus, this love melts his heart, especially as he begins to realise that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to take away his many sins, as He was willing to die in his place on the cross.\n\nThe love and peace of God enter his heart as he begins to realise that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin.\u201d (1 John 1:7).\n\n\u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10).\n\nAgain God\u2019s Word says, \u201cI am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.\u201d (Isa. 66:2).\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes the words of Jesus clear to him, \u201cCourage, my son (daughter)! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d (Matt. 9:2).\n\n== DYING WITH CHRIST[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:Dying with Christ P4.jpg|alt=Dying with Christ|center|thumb|Dying with Christ]]\n'''This picture speaks of a Christian who has found perfect peace and eternal salvation through the death of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.'''\n\nThis person boasts in nothing else except \u201conly about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of His cross the world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world.\u201d (Gal. 6:14). Jesus died on the cross so that we too, might \u201cdie to sin and live for righteousness\u201d (1 Peter 2:24); a Christian dead to the world. We are commanded to \u201clet the Spirit direct our lives, and we will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.\u201d (Gal. 5:16,25).\n\nDo you declare openly that you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, by what you say and do? Or are you ashamed to let others know? Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone declares publicly that he belongs to me, I will do the same for him before my Father in heaven. But if anyone rejects me publicly, I will reject him before my Father in heaven.\u201d(Matt. 10:32,33). Jesus also said, \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow in my steps is not fit to be my disciple.\u201d (Matt. 10:38). Happy are those who find protection in the Rock, Jesus Christ!\n\n== THE TEMPLE OF GOD[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The Temple of God P5.jpg|alt=The temple of God|center|thumb|The temple of God]]\n'''This picture shows the clean and purified heart of the sinner who has been saved by God\u2019s grace and mercy.'''\n\nThe heart has now become a true temple of God. Sin has been driven out. Instead of the various animals controlled by Satan, the father of lies, we see the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, living in the heart. Instead of being the breeding place of sin, the heart has become a beautiful, fruit-bearing tree or garden, bearing the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, humility, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self control and others which are acceptable and pleasing to God and man (Gal. 5:22-23). He has now become a fruit- bearing branch of the real vine \u2013 our Lord Jesus Christ. The secret of this fruit-bearing is that he remains united with Christ, and Christ and His words remain in him (John 15:1-10).\n\n\u201cHappy are the pure in heart; they will see God!\u201d (Matt.5:8). King David knew that the greatest battle was taking place in his own heart and recognizing his deep spiritual need, prayed, \u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10). Nobody is able to purify his own heart, or to create a clean heart, unless through truly repenting he comes to God as David did, asking God to create a pure heart in him.\n\n== THE TEMPTED AND DEVIDED HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The tempted and devided heart P6.jpg|alt=The tempted and divided heart|center|thumb|The tempted and divided heart]]\n'''This is the sad picture of one who has fallen back into his old ways. One eye is starting to close, showing that he is beginning to grow cold and sleepy in his relationship with God.'''\n\nThe light inside has grown dim, and the pictures in his heart, showing his readiness to suffer with Christ, have fallen and are no longer upright. He is surrounded by temptations to which he is slowly giving in instead of resisting them. Instead of listening to God\u2019s voice he now begins to listen to the devil\u2019s cunning suggestions and false promises. Although he may still be a church-goer, hiding his desires for the things of the world under a form of religion, the love for God has grown cold in his heart. Obey the warnings of our Lord Jesus when He says, \u201cKeep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d (Matt. 26:41). \u201cWhoever thinks he is standing firm had better be careful that he does not fall.\u201d (1Cor.10:12). We must put on all the armour that God gives us, so that we will be able to stand up against the devil\u2019s evil tricks. (Eph. 6:11-18).\n\n== THE FALLEN OR STUBBORN HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The fallen or stubborn heart P7.jpg|alt=The fallen or stubborn heart|center|thumb|The fallen or stubborn heart]]\n'''This picture reveals the condition of the person who has fallen completely into his old ways again, in spite of what God did for him.'''\n\nAfter this person was once in God\u2019s light and had tasted heaven\u2019s gift and received his share of the Holy Spirit, he has abandoned his faith. (Heb. 6:4). Jesus Himself described the backsliders\u2019 condition when He said, \u201cWhen an evil spirit goes out of a person, it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest. If it can\u2019t find one, it says to itself, \u2018I will go back to my house.\u2019 So it goes back and finds the house clean and tidy. Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself, and they come and live there. So when it is all over, that person is in a worse state than he was at the beginning.\u201d (Luke 11:24-26).\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them shows that the proverbs are true; \u2018A dog goes back to what it has vomited\u2019 and \u2018A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud.\u2019 \u201d (2 Peter 2:22). If you continue to be stubborn, and love darkness rather than light, there is no hope, no help, because you are choosing death instead of life \u2013 \u201csin pays its wage - death.\u201d (Rom. 6:23).\n\n== THE SINNERS JUDGEMENT[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners judgement P8.jpg|alt=The sinners judgement|center|thumb|The sinners judgement]]\n'''Here we find the stubborn sinner who did not want to open his heart to God again.'''\n\nThe false pleasures of sin have disappeared, and the awful reality of the high and dreadful cost of sin now has to be faced. The agonies of hell are becoming real to him. Although he now longs to pray, he finds he cannot communicate with God whose love he has rejected for so long. His friends are afraid to stand at his bedside, and their empty words of comfort cannot help him now. His riches can neither lengthen his life, nor save his soul, nor reduce the agony of his soul.\n\nHe begins to realise that \u201cit is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\u201d (Heb. 10:31). He had hoped to give his life to God when it suited him. This dying sinner who rejected the forgiveness and love of God during his lifetime now has to hear the voice of his Judge, the Saviour whom he rejected saying: \u201cAway from me, you that are under God\u2019s curse! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels!\u201d (Matt. 25:41).\n\n\u201cEveryone must die once, and after that be judged by God.\u201d (Heb. 9:27).\n\n== THE VICTORIOUS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The victorious heart P9.jpg|alt=The victorious heart|center|thumb|The victorious heart]]\n'''This picture shows a Christian who remains faithful and wins the victory over painful tests and temptations.'''\n\nWhile he is tempted on all sides, he remains firm and holds out to the end, being victorious through Jesus Christ. He has not only entered the Christian race, but he is continuing in it, running with determination, \u201ckeeping his eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end.\u201d (Heb. 12:1,2). He remembers the words of Jesus. \u201cHappy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:11,12).\n\nThis person is ready to meet God, and is like a tree that grows beside a stream; that bears fruit at the right time (Ps. 1:3); like a branch of the real vine, bearing much fruit. He does not know the fear of death, for the perfect love of God, which he has received through the Holy Spirit, has filled his heart.\n\n== THE GLORIOUS HOMEGOING[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The glorious homegoing P10.jpg|alt=The glorious homegoing|center|thumb|The glorious homegoing]]\n'''Jesus said, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.

He will not be judged, but has already passed from death to life.\u201d (John 5:24). Death holds neither fear nor punishment for the Christian. \u201cDeath is destroyed; victory is complete! Where death is your victory? Where death is your power to hurt?\u2026 Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\u201d(1 Cor. 15:54-57)\n\nA person who has lived and walked with God is not afraid of death. When the time comes for him to die, he will go gladly, as the Apostle Paul puts it, \u201cI want very much to leave this life and to be with Christ, which is a far better thing.\u201d (Phil. 1:23)\n\n\u201cThen I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u2018Write this: Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!\u2019 \u2018Yes indeed!\u2019 answers the Spirit. \u2018They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them.\u201d (Rev. 14:13).\n\n== Prayer[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n''\u201cHe watches every step men take.

Whether you are a heathen or a Christian, one who does not believe in [[Christ]] or a backslider, you will see yourself as [[God]] sees you. \u201cMan looks at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.\u201d (1 Sam. 16:7). God sees us as we really are.\n\n[[Satan]] is the father of all lies. He is the prince of darkness and god of this world, who disguises himself as an angel of light to lead men and women the wrong way. In these days, as in times past, there are many false [[apostles]] who disguise themselves, pretending to be apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed (disguised) into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:13,14). Satan, the god of this world, keeps people in the dark so that they cannot see that God loves them or that Jesus died to save them (2 Cor. 4:4). All sinners and those who do not believe are spiritually dead and blind concerning God. They are ruled by the evil of this world (Eph. 2:1-2). Unless their eyes are opened in some way to their lost condition, they are heading for eternal destruction. The person who says, \u201cI have never sinned\u201d is deceiving himself. For \u201cThe Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the devil had done.\u201d (1 John 3:8). \u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come near to God, and He will come near to you.\u201d (James 4:7,8)\n\nAs you read this book and study its pictures, you will be able to see your own heart. Allow God\u2019s searchlight to show you the condition of your heart. Acknowledge your sins and do not deny their existence, for God\u2019s Word tells us that \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. But if we confess our sins to God, He will keep His promise and do what is right: He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing.\u201d (1 John 1:1-10). \u201cThe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin\u201d.\n\nYou are ruled either by Satan or by God; you are a slave to sin or a servant of God. If sin controls your life, do not deny it, but cry out to God. He will set you free through Jesus Christ who came to this world to save sinners, to break the power of Satan and sin over us. He is our Saviour. You are in the presence of a holy God who knows all the secrets, the hidden thoughts and actions of your life. It is impossible to hide yourself and actions from God, for \u201cGod made our ears \u2013 can\u2019t He hear? He made our eyes \u2013 can\u2019t He see?\u201d (Ps. 94:9).\n\nThe Lord keeps close watch over the whole world to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to Him.\u201d (2 Chron.16:9).\n\nHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God.\u201d (Job 34:21,22).\n\nBut [[Jesus]] did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all.\u201d (John 2:24).\n\nTherefore \u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit.\u201d (Ps. 32:1-2).\n\n== THE SINNERS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners heart P1.jpg|alt=This picture shows the heart of a wordly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.|thumb|The Sinners Heart]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a worldly sinful man or woman, described in the Bible as a sinner.'''\nBelow the head in this picture, the heart of man can be seen occupied by various animals which speak of the many different sins in the human heart, as the heart is the centre and breeding place of our sins. God tells us by the mouth of His prophet Jeremiah, that \u201cNobody can understand the human heart. There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed.\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nJesus Himself confirms this by saying, \u201cFor from the inside, from a person\u2019s heart, come the evil ideas which lead him to do immoral things; to rob, kill, commit adultery, be greedy, and do all sorts of evil things; deceit, indecency, jealousy, slander, pride, and folly \u2013 all these evil things come from inside a person and make him unclean\u201d (Mark 7:21-23)\n\nThe bleary, red eyes speak of drunkenness.  \u201cDon\u2019t let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, though it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. The next morning you will feel as if you have been bitten by a poisonous snake.\u201d (Proverbs 23:31-32)\n\nDifferent animals and signs used in the pictures reminds us of the following sins:\n\n=== The [[Peacock]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nWhile the beauty of the peacock is admired by everybody, here in the heart of man, it speaks of the sin of pride.\n\n=== The [[goat]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe goat represents bodily desires, immorality, adultery.\n\n=== The [[pig]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe pig speaks of the sins of drunkenness and gluttony. It is a dirty animal eagerly swallowing up everything in its way, clean or dirty, and in the same way a sinful heart devours every immoral suggestion, expression, picture, literature, etc.\n\n=== The [[tortoise]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe tortoise speaks of laziness, sluggishness to obey and witchcraft. \u201cA lazy man who refuses to work is only killing himself, all he does is think about what he would like to have.\u201d  (Prov. 21:25,26).\n\n=== The [[leopard]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe leopard is a very savage and cruel beast. Hatred, anger and a bad temper often rule the heart of man and many times lead to murder. \u201cKeep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbour a grudge.\u201d (Eccl. 7:9)\n\n=== The [[snake]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe snake represents the devil who is very deceitful, clever and misleading, and does everything possible to destroy our relationship with God.\n\n=== The [[frog]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe frog speaks here of the sins of greediness and the love of money which is the source of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Certain frogs in the Congo have been seen eating ants by the hundreds until they burst and died.\n\n=== [[Satan]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nSatan is the father of all lies, and is the one who persuades us to sin, and then he rules our hearts.\n\n=== The [[star]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe star speaks of the conscience in the heart of every man. Even in the bad heart the conscience is still there, but is being ignored, and cannot therefore help this person.\n\n=== The eye of [[God]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe eye of God sees everything that goes on in the heart. Nothing can be hidden from His flaming eye, and therefore He knows and sees all the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart. Whether you do your evil deeds in the darkest night, in the thickest forest, in the deepest ditch or wherever it may be, God sees it.\n\n=== The little tongues of fire[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe little tongues of fire round about the heart show the love of God surrounding the sinful heart. While God hates sin He loves man and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he should turn away from his sins and live. Jesus came to save sinners. There is great joy in heaven over one sinner that repents (Luke 15:7). The little tongues also speak of the blood of Jesus Christ, \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d (John 1:29).\n\n=== The [[angel]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe angel represents the Word of God. God wants to speak to those who have been deceived and are carrying heavy loads of sin, so that they may turn from their sinful ways and let the light and love of God come into their hearts.\n\n=== The [[dove]][<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ===\nThe dove is a sign of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who reveals the truth about God, about sin and what is right, and about God\u2019s judgement (John 15:26).\n\n== THE HEART CONVINCED OF SIN[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The heart convinced of sin P2.jpg|alt=The Heart convinced of sin|center|thumb|The Heart convinced of sin]]\n'''This picture shows the heart of a man who is sorry for his sins and is beginning to look for God.'''\n\nHere we see the sinner beginning to take notice of the message of God and to open his heart to the love of God. The Holy Spirit begins to shine into the dark and sinful heart. The light of God comes into his heart to drive all darkness away. When God\u2019s light comes in, darkness has to go. Sin, described here by all the various animals, has to go. Therefore, dear reader, allow Jesus, the Light of the world, to come into your heart, and darkness and the evil actions of darkness must leave the heart, as shown in this picture.\n\nJesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.\u201d (John 8:12).\n\nYour heart is intended to be God\u2019s house, God\u2019s temple. He wants to live in it, make it beautiful, fill it with light, love and joy. Jesus not only came to forgive us our sins, but He came to deliver us and set us free from the power and domination of sin.\n\n\u201cIf the Son ([[Jesus]]) sets you free, then you will be really free.\u201d (John 8:36).\n\n== THE REPENTING HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The repenting heart P3.jpg|alt=The repenting heart|center|thumb|The repenting heart]]\n'''This picture shows us the heart of someone who is really serious about finding the right relationship with God.'''\n\nAs he sees the cross which the angel, the Word of God, shows to him, it breaks his now sorry heart, and he is moved with deep, heartfelt regret and sorrow over his many sins. As he sees the great love of God expressed in Christ Jesus, this love melts his heart, especially as he begins to realise that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to take away his many sins, as He was willing to die in his place on the cross.\n\nThe love and peace of God enter his heart as he begins to realise that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from every sin.\u201d (1 John 1:7).\n\n\u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10).\n\nAgain God\u2019s Word says, \u201cI am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me.\u201d (Isa. 66:2).\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes the words of Jesus clear to him, \u201cCourage, my son (daughter)! Your sins are forgiven.\u201d (Matt. 9:2).\n\n== DYING WITH CHRIST[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:Dying with Christ P4.jpg|alt=Dying with Christ|center|thumb|Dying with Christ]]\n'''This picture speaks of a Christian who has found perfect peace and eternal salvation through the death of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.'''\n\nThis person boasts in nothing else except \u201conly about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of His cross the world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world.\u201d (Gal. 6:14). Jesus died on the cross so that we too, might \u201cdie to sin and live for righteousness\u201d (1 Peter 2:24); a Christian dead to the world. We are commanded to \u201clet the Spirit direct our lives, and we will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.\u201d (Gal. 5:16,25).\n\nDo you declare openly that you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, by what you say and do? Or are you ashamed to let others know? Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone declares publicly that he belongs to me, I will do the same for him before my Father in heaven. But if anyone rejects me publicly, I will reject him before my Father in heaven.\u201d(Matt. 10:32,33). Jesus also said, \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow in my steps is not fit to be my disciple.\u201d (Matt. 10:38). Happy are those who find protection in the Rock, Jesus Christ!\n\n== THE TEMPLE OF GOD[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The Temple of God P5.jpg|alt=The temple of God|center|thumb|The temple of God]]\n'''This picture shows the clean and purified heart of the sinner who has been saved by God\u2019s grace and mercy.'''\n\nThe heart has now become a true temple of God. Sin has been driven out. Instead of the various animals controlled by Satan, the father of lies, we see the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, living in the heart. Instead of being the breeding place of sin, the heart has become a beautiful, fruit-bearing tree or garden, bearing the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, humility, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self control and others which are acceptable and pleasing to God and man (Gal. 5:22-23). He has now become a fruit- bearing branch of the real vine \u2013 our Lord Jesus Christ. The secret of this fruit-bearing is that he remains united with Christ, and Christ and His words remain in him (John 15:1-10).\n\n\u201cHappy are the pure in heart; they will see God!\u201d (Matt.5:8). King David knew that the greatest battle was taking place in his own heart and recognizing his deep spiritual need, prayed, \u201cCreate a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.\u201d (Psalm 51:10). Nobody is able to purify his own heart, or to create a clean heart, unless through truly repenting he comes to God as David did, asking God to create a pure heart in him.\n\n== THE TEMPTED AND DEVIDED HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The tempted and devided heart P6.jpg|alt=The tempted and divided heart|center|thumb|The tempted and divided heart]]\n'''This is the sad picture of one who has fallen back into his old ways. One eye is starting to close, showing that he is beginning to grow cold and sleepy in his relationship with God.'''\n\nThe light inside has grown dim, and the pictures in his heart, showing his readiness to suffer with Christ, have fallen and are no longer upright. He is surrounded by temptations to which he is slowly giving in instead of resisting them. Instead of listening to God\u2019s voice he now begins to listen to the devil\u2019s cunning suggestions and false promises. Although he may still be a church-goer, hiding his desires for the things of the world under a form of religion, the love for God has grown cold in his heart. Obey the warnings of our Lord Jesus when He says, \u201cKeep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation.\u201d (Matt. 26:41). \u201cWhoever thinks he is standing firm had better be careful that he does not fall.\u201d (1Cor.10:12). We must put on all the armour that God gives us, so that we will be able to stand up against the devil\u2019s evil tricks. (Eph. 6:11-18).\n\n== THE FALLEN OR STUBBORN HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The fallen or stubborn heart P7.jpg|alt=The fallen or stubborn heart|center|thumb|The fallen or stubborn heart]]\n'''This picture reveals the condition of the person who has fallen completely into his old ways again, in spite of what God did for him.'''\n\nAfter this person was once in God\u2019s light and had tasted heaven\u2019s gift and received his share of the Holy Spirit, he has abandoned his faith. (Heb. 6:4). Jesus Himself described the backsliders\u2019 condition when He said, \u201cWhen an evil spirit goes out of a person, it travels over dry country looking for a place to rest. If it can\u2019t find one, it says to itself, \u2018I will go back to my house.\u2019 So it goes back and finds the house clean and tidy. Then it goes out and brings seven other spirits even worse than itself, and they come and live there. So when it is all over, that person is in a worse state than he was at the beginning.\u201d (Luke 11:24-26).\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them shows that the proverbs are true; \u2018A dog goes back to what it has vomited\u2019 and \u2018A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud.\u2019 \u201d (2 Peter 2:22). If you continue to be stubborn, and love darkness rather than light, there is no hope, no help, because you are choosing death instead of life \u2013 \u201csin pays its wage - death.\u201d (Rom. 6:23).\n\n== THE SINNERS JUDGEMENT[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The sinners judgement P8.jpg|alt=The sinners judgement|center|thumb|The sinners judgement]]\n'''Here we find the stubborn sinner who did not want to open his heart to God again.'''\n\nThe false pleasures of sin have disappeared, and the awful reality of the high and dreadful cost of sin now has to be faced. The agonies of hell are becoming real to him. Although he now longs to pray, he finds he cannot communicate with God whose love he has rejected for so long. His friends are afraid to stand at his bedside, and their empty words of comfort cannot help him now. His riches can neither lengthen his life, nor save his soul, nor reduce the agony of his soul.\n\nHe begins to realise that \u201cit is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\u201d (Heb. 10:31). He had hoped to give his life to God when it suited him. This dying sinner who rejected the forgiveness and love of God during his lifetime now has to hear the voice of his Judge, the Saviour whom he rejected saying: \u201cAway from me, you that are under God\u2019s curse! Away to the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels!\u201d (Matt. 25:41).\n\n\u201cEveryone must die once, and after that be judged by God.\u201d (Heb. 9:27).\n\n== THE VICTORIOUS HEART[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The victorious heart P9.jpg|alt=The victorious heart|center|thumb|The victorious heart]]\n'''This picture shows a Christian who remains faithful and wins the victory over painful tests and temptations.'''\n\nWhile he is tempted on all sides, he remains firm and holds out to the end, being victorious through Jesus Christ. He has not only entered the Christian race, but he is continuing in it, running with determination, \u201ckeeping his eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end.\u201d (Heb. 12:1,2). He remembers the words of Jesus. \u201cHappy are you when people insult you and persecute you and tell all kinds of evil lies against you because you are my followers. Be happy and glad, for a great reward is kept for you in heaven.\u201d (Matt. 5:11,12).\n\nThis person is ready to meet God, and is like a tree that grows beside a stream; that bears fruit at the right time (Ps. 1:3); like a branch of the real vine, bearing much fruit. He does not know the fear of death, for the perfect love of God, which he has received through the Holy Spirit, has filled his heart.\n\n== THE GLORIOUS HOMEGOING[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n[[File:The glorious homegoing P10.jpg|alt=The glorious homegoing|center|thumb|The glorious homegoing]]\n'''Jesus said, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.\u201d (John 1:25,26).'''\n\n\u201cWhoever hears my words and believes in Him who sent me has eternal life. He will not be judged, but has already passed from death to life.\u201d (John 5:24). Death holds neither fear nor punishment for the Christian. \u201cDeath is destroyed; victory is complete! Where death is your victory? Where death is your power to hurt?\u2026 Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\u201d(1 Cor. 15:54-57)\n\nA person who has lived and walked with God is not afraid of death. When the time comes for him to die, he will go gladly, as the Apostle Paul puts it, \u201cI want very much to leave this life and to be with Christ, which is a far better thing.\u201d (Phil. 1:23)\n\n\u201cThen I heard a voice from heaven saying, \u2018Write this: Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!\u2019 \u2018Yes indeed!\u2019 answers the Spirit. \u2018They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them.\u201d (Rev. 14:13).\n\n== Prayer[<nowiki/>[[User:ChristoDorfling/sandbox|edit]]] ==\n''\u201cHe watches every step men take. There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God\u201d Job 34:21-22''\n\n''\u201cSo then, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. Come close to God, and He will come near you.\u201d James 4:7-8''\n\n''\u201cFor this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16''\n\n'''Let us pray:''' \n\n'''My father in heaven, I am really sorry for the sins in my heart. I want your light to shine into my heart, to remove all the bad things that are ruining my life. Please give me a new heart, and fill my heart with your own presence. Please help me to live a life that will be pleasing to you, and that will help me to be the person I should be. I ask this in the Name of Jesus. AMEN'''\n\n''\u201chappy are those whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Happy is the man whom the Lord does not accuse of doing wrong and who is free from all deceit\u201d Ps. 32:1-2''\u2003\n", "name_user": "ChristoDorfling", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Book_(All_Nations_Gospel_Publishers)"}

That was the case for \u2018Chocolate\u2019 as well. For me, the word \"chocolate\" feels like a word full of desire. It\u2019s not always necessary in a dessert, but if it\u2019s there, you find yourself getting addicted and eating it. I wanted to compare chocolate to the desire of wanting to meet someone you\u2019re attracted to.

Although the Church of Scotland had major competition in Abernethy in the form of the Free Church and United Presbyterian Church, Scott nevertheless persuaded the Church of Scotland to fund a new [[manse]] for his use during what was to be his brief tenure.\n\nMeanwhile in [[Glasgow]] a group of businessmen (including [[Sir John Maxwell, 8th Baronet|Sir John Maxwell]] of [[Pollok House|Pollok]], in discussion with Rev [[Matthew Leishman]] of [[Govan]] Old Parish Church, were planning a new church to serve the [[Kinning Park]] district of Glasgow, as a [[Quoad sacra]] church.

Soon after construction, and [[John Cunningham (moderator)|Rev John Cunningham's]] critical \"Crieff Organ Case\" was decided in court, Scott organised the insertion of a church organ (not previously encouraged by the Church of Scotland).<ref>Children of the Fasti by Brian Orr</ref>\n\nHe remained in Glasgow at the Maxwell Church for four years.

Here he succeeded his friend, Rev [[Donald Macleod (moderator)|Donald Macleod]] who later was also his immediate predecessor as Moderator (1895).
