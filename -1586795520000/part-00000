First shown on [[public-access television|public-access]] [[cable TV]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], the series expanded to multiple cable systems before becoming the first television series distributed on the internet in April 1995. Though an underground production with virtually no budget, the show has generated significant controversy and garnered major media coverage, as well as scholarly attention, especially during its earliest years.\n\n==Background and original concept==\n\nIn the fall of 1989, Bart Everson was arrested for public indecency ([[streaking]]) and assigned to community service at Community Access Television Services (then Bloomington Community Access Television) in Bloomington, Indiana.

However, the show quickly mutated in both style and substance as the producers moved to new housing and employed different production techniques.\n\n==Production and distribution==\n\nEverson and bartender Joe Nickell produced three seasons of television from 1992 to 1995. Each season consisted of 26 (or more) weekly program of approximately half an hour in length.\n\nAs the producers became more ambitious, the program expanded to public access cable stations in other cities through the laborious process of sending individual tapes through the mail.\n\nIn April 1995, ten years before the launch of YouTube, ''Rox'' began distributing via the web. The debut internet episode, \"Global Village Idiots,\" was produced in segmented fashion and encoded as a series of short QuickTime videos for download from the show's website at rox.com.

First shown on [[public-access television|public-access]] [[cable TV]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], the series expanded to multiple cable systems before becoming the first television series distributed on the internet in April 1995. Though an underground production with virtually no budget, the show has generated significant controversy and garnered major media coverage, as well as scholarly attention, especially during its earliest years.\n\n==Background and original concept==\n\nIn the fall of 1989, Bart Everson was arrested for public indecency ([[streaking]]) and assigned to community service at Community Access Television Services (then Bloomington Community Access Television) in Bloomington, Indiana. It was here that Everson learned how to produce videos for local cablecast, which a number of writers have suggested was key to the development of the series.<ref name=\"uncensored\">{{Cite news|title=In the realm of the uncensored|last=Hall|first=Steve|date=1995-05-20|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star}}</ref><ref name=\"wired\">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/1995/12/the-real-real-world/|title=The Real Real World|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|date=1995-12-01|magazine=Wired|quote=Everson learned how to produce a TV show after being arrested for streaking across the university campus.

Each season consisted of 26 (or more) weekly program of approximately half an hour in length.\n\nAs the producers became more ambitious, the program expanded to public access cable stations in other cities through the laborious process of sending individual tapes through the mail.\n\nIn April 1995, ten years before the launch of YouTube, ''Rox'' began distributing via the web. The debut internet episode, \"Global Village Idiots,\" was produced in segmented fashion and encoded as a series of short QuickTime videos for download from the show's website at rox.com.

These differ from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential primaries and caucuses in that they do not appoint delegates to represent a candidate at the party's convention to select the party's presidential nominee. The party's nominee will be chosen directly by registered delegates at the [[2020 Libertarian National Convention]] from May 21\u201325, 2020 in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[2020 United States Presidential election]] will be the thirteenth contested presidential election that the Libertarian Party will participate in. The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] saw the highest vote total and percentage of votes for a Libertarian presidential ticket ever, with former [[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico governor]] [[Gary Johnson]] and his [[running mate]], former [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts governor]] [[Bill Weld]], receiving over four million votes and 3.28% of the total vote. During [[Gary Johnson 2016 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] in 2016, Johnson often stated that it would be his last run for the presidency.<ref>{{cite web

These differ from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential primaries and caucuses in that they do not appoint delegates to represent a candidate at the party's convention to select the party's presidential nominee. The party's nominee will be chosen directly by registered delegates at the [[2020 Libertarian National Convention]] from May 21\u201325, 2020 in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[2020 United States Presidential election]] will be the thirteenth contested presidential election that the Libertarian Party will participate in. The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] saw the highest vote total and percentage of votes for a Libertarian presidential ticket ever, with former [[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico governor]] [[Gary Johnson]] and his [[running mate]], former [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts governor]] [[Bill Weld]], receiving over four million votes and 3.28% of the total vote. During [[Gary Johnson 2016 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] in 2016, Johnson often stated that it would be his last run for the presidency.<ref>{{cite web

It was named in 1995 for Carol K. and [[Carl Howard Pforzheimer Jr]], major University and Radcliffe College benefactors, and their family.\n\nLocated in [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|the Radcliffe Quadrangle]], PfoHo comprises Ada Louise Comstock, Daniel Henry Holmes, Mary Buckminster Moors, and Wolbach Halls, in addition to Faculty Row and the Jordan North and South buildings.\n\nPfoHo's shield features black and crimson squares on a crimson and black field; its mascots are the [[polar bear]] and the ''Pf'' [[bigram]]. The current Faculty Deans are Anne Harrington and her husband, John Durant.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[Radcliffe College]] students first took up residence on campus in 1901, and the oldest parts of PfoHo date to that year.\n\nMoors opened in time for the 1949-1950 academic year, the year plans for Holmes were first drawn up.  Construction of Comstock began in 1957.\n\n[[File:Jordan North and Jordan South, Radcliffe Quadrangle - IMG 1675.jpg|thumbnail|Jordan North and Jordan South]]\nThe Jordans, two separate buildings located at the corner of Walker and Shepard Streets, began as an experiment in cooperative living in 1961. They gradually became used as overflow housing in 1985, although one building persisted as a co-op until at least until 1997.\n\nWolbach, formerly an apartment building, was purchased by Radcliffe in 1964.\n\n===North House===\n\nThe name \"North House\" first appeared in 1961 and consisted of Comstock, Moors, and Holmes.  Wolbach did not yet belong to Radcliffe at this point.  The Jordans were initially assigned to the no-longer-extant East House.\n\nIn the fall of 1970 Professor [[Edward L. Keenan]] and his wife Joan became the first masters of North house. They moved into the newly constructed masters residence at 46 Linnaean Street. The townhouses of Faculty Row along Linnaean were also completed in 1970 and were affiliated with the House.\n\nMale students were first assigned to North House in the fall of 1970, when Harvard and Radcliffe entered an agreement allowing students from the respective colleges to live in dormitories at the other institution.\n\nHouse Master and Co-Master [[Woody Hastings|Woody]] and Hanna Hastings began their term in 1975.\n\n===Major renovations of 1986, 1988, and 2002===\nThey attempted to cultivate house spirit by integrating and interconnecting the buildings.  Woody Hastings remarked, \"Any student in North House ought to be able to get from any place in the House to any other place in the House in his [[Pajamas|PJs]] - or less.\"\n\nAccordingly, when plans were drawn up for a major renovation in the mid-1980s, the Hastings rejected an early proposal that would have segmented the house into disconnected vertical \"entryways\", opting instead for a plan that connected \"the bricks\" to one another more closely and in the process allowed the construction of the Holmes junior common room, the PfoHo Grille, the Comstock Library, and the centralized balconied dining hall.  The duplex suites on the top floors of \"the bricks\" were also created during this renovation.\n\nUntil a major renovation in 2002, Wolbach Hall consisted of one and two bedroom apartments, complete with kitchens. Renovations to Wolbach were done in order to increase the number of students housed in the dorm and to provide suites on campus accessible and appropriate to disabled persons.\n\nA breezeway connecting Wolbach to Moors, long advocated by Hastings, was constructed in 2002.\n\n===Renamed as Pforzheimer===\n\nIn 1995, North House was renamed Pforzheimer House. A ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' columnist referred to this as \"the Pforzheimer House flap,\" saying that \"Harvard renamed the Radcliffe-owned house after a loyal donor without consulting [Radcliffe President Linda] Wilson & Co.\"<ref>Beam, Alex (1997), \"The Last Days of Radcliffe?\", ''The Boston Globe,'' September 19, 1997, Living, p.

The letters ''f'' or ''ph'' were replaced by ''pF'' in House-related words, hence ''Pformal'', ''PfoHo Pfora'', and ''Pfreshman Welcome''.  (Notable exceptions: ''Faculty Row'', ''Thursdayfest''.)\n\nIn 1996, the House welcomed new Masters, the McCarthys, to go with its new name.  A central common room in Moors was named for the Hastings upon their retirement. That same year, ''The New York Times'' noted that, \"many black and Hispanic students lived in the Radcliffe quadrangle, in the Pforzheimer House\",<ref>Rimer, Sara (2003), \"Blacks' Guide to Harvard Covers History and Tips,\" ''The New York Times,'' February 1, 2003, p.

Pforzheimer III (AB '58, MBA '63) serving as president <ref>there is no chairman of the HAA</ref> of the HAA (Harvard Alumni Association), and, along with Carol Koehler Pforzheimer (AB '31) and Nancy Pforzheimer Aronson (AB '56), they worked on numerous graduate school and Radcliffe committees.

Adams House residents, often unable to find a seat at lunch, enacted a series of measures designed to keep members of other houses out. The most infamous of these actions was \"The No Interhouse Gong Show\" wherein members of the Adams community sat by the ID swipe station and rang the gong when nonresidents came in. A running tally of the number of nonresidents attempting to eat in Adams was kept on a large chalkboard.\n\nPforzheimer, isolated to the Quadrangle and not suffering from the same dining hall ills, responded by attempting to pass in House Committee a tongue-in-cheek, non-binding measure (proposed by Rick Wedell '01) denying Adams house residents access to the Pforzheimer dining hall. However, there was no real support for the measure and it didn't pass, though the attempt was reported in the Crimson. Adams House residents discovered the proposal when the minutes of the meeting were sent to the Pforzheimer House mailing list, then retaliated by declaring war in their House Committee.  The initial suggestion was raised by Senior Colin Wood, and formally proposed by Jessamyn Conrad, and seconded by Sophomore Kyle Gilman. That night, the Declaration and Articles of War were written, sent to the Pfoho list, and the War was officially on.\n\nAdams House gained the element of surprise when students blanketed \"O-Ho\" with the Declaration of War overnight. Adams House declared that it was in possession of the Pforzheimer \"Pf\", and would henceforth be known as Pfadams House. The \"Adams House\" sign above C-Entry was actually changed at this time. The next day, when Pforzheimer students awoke, they discovered that every \"Pf\" in their dormitory had been \"stolen\" (covered with masking tape). A week of pranks followed, the most extensive of which occurred when Pforzheimer residents forged notices from the Freshman dorms, informing all freshmen that Annenberg Hall was closed, and to go to the Adams dining hall for Sunday brunch.<ref>{{cite web|author=Resnick, Scott A|date=1999-10-19|title=First-Years Casualties in Pfoho-Adams War|publisher=The Harvard Crimson\"|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=98054|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> Enterprising people from Pfoho (Andy and Aric) then made a bold, daytime raid, stealing the gong that had begun the whole affair in a covertable, and cleverly closed the gates of C-Entry (which contains the dining hall at the center of the controversy) with a bike lock at lunch hour one day, creating chaos. Adams residents, including both Masters, took to reading the declaration of war over the \"Orzheimer\" call boxes, which someone managed to get the number to, during lunch and dinner.\n\nTo settle this war, Adams and Pforzheimer House agreed to a binding field day competition, including a football game, a tug-of-war, and a fifteen-minute musical theatre competition.  A Pfoho win would result in a return to \"Adams\" from \"Pfadams\", the return of the gong, and would grant Pfoho residents dining hall privileges at Adams House.  An Adams win would result in a return of the gong, continued use of \"Pfadams House\" with Pfoho becoming \"Orzheimer House\", though Adams generously offered to supply the rival library with a copy of \"Hooked on Phonics.\" An Adams win would also grant the Pfoho \"colonists\" dining hall privileges at Adams House.  Led by Masters McCarthy, presiding over the event in full academic regalia, Pforzheimer House secured a resounding victory (trouncing Adams in the football and tug-of-war and putting up a brave but wholly inadequate showing in the musico-theatrical segment) and Adams accordingly agreed to provide its residents with ID stickers granting them access to the Adams dining hall, an arrangement that stands to this day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Resnick, Scott A|date=1999-10-18|title=Spirit Unleashed As House War Ends|publisher=The Harvard Crimson|url=http://thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=98041|accessdate=2006-10-09}}</ref>\n\nFor several years, a \"War Memorial\" stood in Adams House, commemorating the event.\n\n==Administration==\n\nAs with all houses at Harvard College, Pforzheimer House consists of two classes of members/residents: the [[Senior Common Room]] (SCR) and the [[Junior Common Room]] (JCR).  The official university administration of the house consists of the resident members of the Senior Common Room, such as the House co-Masters, Allston Burr Resident Dean, Senior Resident Tutors, and the Resident Tutors.  There is also often a non-academic house administrator and a building manager.\n\nJohn Durant and Anne Harrington are the current Faculty Deans.<ref>[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/05/new-masters-for-pforzheimer-house/ New masters for Pforzheimer House | Harvard Gazette].

Members of the [[Senior Common Room]] may attend HoCo meetings as non-voting participants. The committee operates separately from the [[Harvard Undergraduate Council]], to organize student events and manage funding. The HoCo, as with the other student government organizations in the Houses, are funded by the UC.\n\n==The Belltower Suite==\n\nThe Belltower suite is one of several specially named suites at Harvard College, including [[Eliot House]]'s Ground Zero, [[Cabot House]]'s Library Suite, [[Quincy House (Harvard)|Quincy House]]'s Terrace (formerly known as the Balcony Suite), and [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]]'s Ten-Man Suite.  It is named for its access to the Pforzheimer belltower.\n\nThe core '''Belltower Suite''' is Moors Hall #410, which connects by internal fire-escape passageways to Moors #403 and #404.  The Belltower suite also connects to the belltower itself, which is not used for housing.  Frequently, a single group of friends shares Moors #410 and #403 or, more rarely, all three of the suites; in this case, the entire area occupied by the friends becomes \"the Belltower suite\" / \"the Belltower\".\n\nOne of the largest housing arrangements on the Harvard campus, it can comfortably house twelve students with individual bedrooms, four bathrooms (three full and one half), and three common rooms.\n\nThe Belltower itself faces out over the [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Quadrangle]] and is accessed by a ladder and trap door.  Access to the tower begins in the passageway that connects Moors Hall #410 and #403. A first ladder leads through a ceiling trapdoor to the carpeted mezzanine level (the \"chill pad\").  A second, longer ladder leads via a small hatch to the lantern of the tower called the \"[[crow's nest]]\".  Expansive windows on all four sides of the lantern allow for a majestic view of the greater [[Boston]] area.  An access door located halfway between the mezzanine and the lantern provides access to an outdoor inter-level [[widow's walk]].\n\n==Notable residents==\nFrom the Pforzheimer House website:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfoho.harvard.edu/pfamous-alumni|accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Sheryl Sandberg]], tech executive\n* [[Mo Rocca]], comedian and journalist\n* [[Eden Riegel]], actress\n* [[Jillian Dempsey]], ice hockey player\n* [[Mark Takano]], U.S. Congressman from the California 41st district\n* [[Cameron Winklevoss]]\n* [[Tyler Winklevoss]]\n* [[Kyle Juszczyk]], NFL Player\n\n==References==\n*(Dec. 10, 1949).  \"Moors Will Speak At Hall Inaugural\".

It was named in 1995 for Carol K. and [[Carl Howard Pforzheimer Jr]], major University and Radcliffe College benefactors, and their family.\n\nLocated in [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|the Radcliffe Quadrangle]], PfoHo comprises Ada Louise Comstock, Daniel Henry Holmes, Mary Buckminster Moors, and Wolbach Halls, in addition to Faculty Row and the Jordan North and South buildings.\n\nPfoHo's shield features black and crimson squares on a crimson and black field; its mascots are the [[polar bear]] and the ''Pf'' [[bigram]]. The current Faculty Deans are Anne Harrington and her husband, John Durant.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[Radcliffe College]] students first took up residence on campus in 1901, and the oldest parts of PfoHo date to that year.\n\nMoors opened in time for the 1949-1950 academic year, the year plans for Holmes were first drawn up.  Construction of Comstock began in 1957.\n\n[[File:Jordan North and Jordan South, Radcliffe Quadrangle - IMG 1675.jpg|thumbnail|Jordan North and Jordan South]]\nThe Jordans, two separate buildings located at the corner of Walker and Shepard Streets, began as an experiment in cooperative living in 1961. They gradually became used as overflow housing in 1985, although one building persisted as a co-op until at least until 1997.\n\nWolbach, formerly an apartment building, was purchased by Radcliffe in 1964.\n\n===North House===\n\nThe name \"North House\" first appeared in 1961 and consisted of Comstock, Moors, and Holmes.  Wolbach did not yet belong to Radcliffe at this point.  The Jordans were initially assigned to the no-longer-extant East House.\n\nIn the fall of 1970 Professor [[Edward L. Keenan]] and his wife Joan became the first masters of North house. They moved into the newly constructed masters residence at 46 Linnaean Street. The townhouses of Faculty Row along Linnaean were also completed in 1970 and were affiliated with the House.\n\nMale students were first assigned to North House in the fall of 1970, when Harvard and Radcliffe entered an agreement allowing students from the respective colleges to live in dormitories at the other institution.\n\nHouse Master and Co-Master [[Woody Hastings|Woody]] and Hanna Hastings began their term in 1975.\n\n===Major renovations of 1986, 1988, and 2002===\nThey attempted to cultivate house spirit by integrating and interconnecting the buildings.  Woody Hastings remarked, \"Any student in North House ought to be able to get from any place in the House to any other place in the House in his [[Pajamas|PJs]] - or less.\"\n\nAccordingly, when plans were drawn up for a major renovation in the mid-1980s, the Hastings rejected an early proposal that would have segmented the house into disconnected vertical \"entryways\", opting instead for a plan that connected \"the bricks\" to one another more closely and in the process allowed the construction of the Holmes junior common room, the PfoHo Grille, the Comstock Library, and the centralized balconied dining hall.  The duplex suites on the top floors of \"the bricks\" were also created during this renovation.\n\nUntil a major renovation in 2002, Wolbach Hall consisted of one and two bedroom apartments, complete with kitchens. Renovations to Wolbach were done in order to increase the number of students housed in the dorm and to provide suites on campus accessible and appropriate to disabled persons.\n\nA breezeway connecting Wolbach to Moors, long advocated by Hastings, was constructed in 2002.\n\n===Renamed as Pforzheimer===\n\nIn 1995, North House was renamed Pforzheimer House. A ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' columnist referred to this as \"the Pforzheimer House flap,\" saying that \"Harvard renamed the Radcliffe-owned house after a loyal donor without consulting [Radcliffe President Linda] Wilson & Co.\"<ref>Beam, Alex (1997), \"The Last Days of Radcliffe?\", ''The Boston Globe,'' September 19, 1997, Living, p.

The letters ''f'' or ''ph'' were replaced by ''pF'' in House-related words, hence ''Pformal'', ''PfoHo Pfora'', and ''Pfreshman Welcome''.  (Notable exceptions: ''Faculty Row'', ''Thursdayfest''.)\n\nIn 1996, the House welcomed new Masters, the McCarthys, to go with its new name.  A central common room in Moors was named for the Hastings upon their retirement. That same year, ''The New York Times'' noted that, \"many black and Hispanic students lived in the Radcliffe quadrangle, in the Pforzheimer House\",<ref>Rimer, Sara (2003), \"Blacks' Guide to Harvard Covers History and Tips,\" ''The New York Times,'' February 1, 2003, p.

In addition, the Pforzheimers were the first Harvard\u2013Radcliffe couple to win [https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190509/http://alumni.harvard.edu/volunteer/recognition/harvard-medal Harvard Medals] for their service to the University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radcliffe.edu/schles/readingroom.aspx|title=Reading Room Named in Honor of Carol K.

Adams House residents, often unable to find a seat at lunch, enacted a series of measures designed to keep members of other houses out. The most infamous of these actions was \"The No Interhouse Gong Show\" wherein members of the Adams community sat by the ID swipe station and rang the gong when nonresidents came in. A running tally of the number of nonresidents attempting to eat in Adams was kept on a large chalkboard.\n\nPforzheimer, isolated to the Quadrangle and not suffering from the same dining hall ills, responded by attempting to pass in House Committee a tongue-in-cheek, non-binding measure (proposed by Rick Wedell '01) denying Adams house residents access to the Pforzheimer dining hall. However, there was no real support for the measure and it didn't pass, though the attempt was reported in the Crimson. Adams House residents discovered the proposal when the minutes of the meeting were sent to the Pforzheimer House mailing list, then retaliated by declaring war in their House Committee.  The initial suggestion was raised by Senior Colin Wood, and formally proposed by Jessamyn Conrad, and seconded by Sophomore Kyle Gilman. That night, the Declaration and Articles of War were written, sent to the Pfoho list, and the War was officially on.\n\nAdams House gained the element of surprise when students blanketed \"O-Ho\" with the Declaration of War overnight. Adams House declared that it was in possession of the Pforzheimer \"Pf\", and would henceforth be known as Pfadams House. The \"Adams House\" sign above C-Entry was actually changed at this time. The next day, when Pforzheimer students awoke, they discovered that every \"Pf\" in their dormitory had been \"stolen\" (covered with masking tape). A week of pranks followed, the most extensive of which occurred when Pforzheimer residents forged notices from the Freshman dorms, informing all freshmen that Annenberg Hall was closed, and to go to the Adams dining hall for Sunday brunch.<ref>{{cite web|author=Resnick, Scott A|date=1999-10-19|title=First-Years Casualties in Pfoho-Adams War|publisher=The Harvard Crimson\"|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=98054|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> Enterprising people from Pfoho (Andy and Aric) then made a bold, daytime raid, stealing the gong that had begun the whole affair in a covertable, and cleverly closed the gates of C-Entry (which contains the dining hall at the center of the controversy) with a bike lock at lunch hour one day, creating chaos. Adams residents, including both Masters, took to reading the declaration of war over the \"Orzheimer\" call boxes, which someone managed to get the number to, during lunch and dinner.\n\nTo settle this war, Adams and Pforzheimer House agreed to a binding field day competition, including a football game, a tug-of-war, and a fifteen-minute musical theatre competition.  A Pfoho win would result in a return to \"Adams\" from \"Pfadams\", the return of the gong, and would grant Pfoho residents dining hall privileges at Adams House.  An Adams win would result in a return of the gong, continued use of \"Pfadams House\" with Pfoho becoming \"Orzheimer House\", though Adams generously offered to supply the rival library with a copy of \"Hooked on Phonics.\" An Adams win would also grant the Pfoho \"colonists\" dining hall privileges at Adams House.  Led by Masters McCarthy, presiding over the event in full academic regalia, Pforzheimer House secured a resounding victory (trouncing Adams in the football and tug-of-war and putting up a brave but wholly inadequate showing in the musico-theatrical segment) and Adams accordingly agreed to provide its residents with ID stickers granting them access to the Adams dining hall, an arrangement that stands to this day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Resnick, Scott A|date=1999-10-18|title=Spirit Unleashed As House War Ends|publisher=The Harvard Crimson|url=http://thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=98041|accessdate=2006-10-09}}</ref>\n\nFor several years, a \"War Memorial\" stood in Adams House, commemorating the event.\n\n==Administration==\n\nAs with all houses at Harvard College, Pforzheimer House consists of two classes of members/residents: the [[Senior Common Room]] (SCR) and the [[Junior Common Room]] (JCR).  The official university administration of the house consists of the resident members of the Senior Common Room, such as the House co-Masters, Allston Burr Resident Dean, Senior Resident Tutors, and the Resident Tutors.  There is also often a non-academic house administrator and a building manager.\n\nJohn Durant and Anne Harrington are the current Faculty Deans.<ref>[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/05/new-masters-for-pforzheimer-house/ New masters for Pforzheimer House | Harvard Gazette].

Roy |url=https://pfoho.harvard.edu/people/monique-roy |website=Pforzheimer House |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==House Committee==\n\n[[File:Pfohoteeshirt.JPG|thumb|A classic Pforzheimer House T-shirt design]]\n\nStudent life and house events are administered by the House Committee, or HoCo, whose voting members must be from the [[Junior Common Room]], i.e. the undergraduate student body of the house. Members of the [[Senior Common Room]] may attend HoCo meetings as non-voting participants. The committee operates separately from the [[Harvard Undergraduate Council]], to organize student events and manage funding. The HoCo, as with the other student government organizations in the Houses, are funded by the UC.\n\n==The Belltower Suite==\n\nThe Belltower suite is one of several specially named suites at Harvard College, including [[Eliot House]]'s Ground Zero, [[Cabot House]]'s Library Suite, [[Quincy House (Harvard)|Quincy House]]'s Terrace (formerly known as the Balcony Suite), and [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]]'s Ten-Man Suite.  It is named for its access to the Pforzheimer belltower.\n\nThe core '''Belltower Suite''' is Moors Hall #410, which connects by internal fire-escape passageways to Moors #403 and #404.  The Belltower suite also connects to the belltower itself, which is not used for housing.  Frequently, a single group of friends shares Moors #410 and #403 or, more rarely, all three of the suites; in this case, the entire area occupied by the friends becomes \"the Belltower suite\" / \"the Belltower\".\n\nOne of the largest housing arrangements on the Harvard campus, it can comfortably house twelve students with individual bedrooms, four bathrooms (three full and one half), and three common rooms.\n\nThe Belltower itself faces out over the [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Quadrangle]] and is accessed by a ladder and trap door.  Access to the tower begins in the passageway that connects Moors Hall #410 and #403. A first ladder leads through a ceiling trapdoor to the carpeted mezzanine level (the \"chill pad\").  A second, longer ladder leads via a small hatch to the lantern of the tower called the \"[[crow's nest]]\".  Expansive windows on all four sides of the lantern allow for a majestic view of the greater [[Boston]] area.  An access door located halfway between the mezzanine and the lantern provides access to an outdoor inter-level [[widow's walk]].\n\n==Notable residents==\nFrom the Pforzheimer House Website:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfoho.harvard.edu/pfamous-alumni|accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Sheryl Sandberg]], tech executive\n* [[Mo Rocca]], comedian and journalist\n* [[Eden Riegel]], actress\n* [[Jillian Dempsey]], ice hockey player\n* [[Mark Takano]], U.S. Congressman from the California 41st district\n* [[Cameron Winklevoss]]\n* [[Tyler Winklevoss]]\n* [[Kyle Juszczyk]], NFL Player\n\n==References==\n*(Dec. 10, 1949).  \"Moors Will Speak At Hall Inaugural\".

This had direct consequence to Chetnik-Partisan cooperation at Novi Pazar where Partisan forces left their positions to fill the gap at Kraljevo.{{Sfn|\u0106ukovi\u0107|1964|p=172<!-- |ps=\"\u0428\u0442\u0430\u0431 \u041a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043e\u0442\u0442\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430, \u0443\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0446\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0433\u0446\u0430\u2014\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0435\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0408\u0448\u043e\u0433 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0428\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0435\u043c. \u041e\u0431\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443 \u041a\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435\u2014\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0411\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e.... \u0417\u0431\u043e\u0433 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0458\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430. \u0428\u0442\u0430\u0431 \u041a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043b\u0443\u043a\u0443 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0447\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0458\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0443 \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435, \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0443 \u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u045b \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0430.-->}}\n\nChetniks attacked the town on 4 November at 4 a.m. They managed to advance toward the town until 7 a.m. when the rear flanks of one Chetnik unit were attacked by Muslim forces under command of [[Biko Dre\u0161ovi\u0107]], [[D\u017eemail Koni\u010danin]] and [[Mullah Jakup]]. This caused dismay of this Chetnik unit which retreated from already captured positions. Muslim forces regrouped and pushed back the Chetnik forces who advanced on another part of front (Petrova Crkva \u2014 \u0110ur\u0111evi Stupovi \u2014 Parni\u010dko brdo \u2014 Vidovo).

Within a couple of days additional forces came to Novi Pazar, mostly from Kosovo, so the total number of armed men in Novi Pazar on 10 November 1941 was around 3,150. A number of guns, machine guns and ammunition was also brought into the town. This encouraged Had\u017eiahmetovi\u0107 to try to expand borders of the Greater Albania by capturing Chetnik controlled [[Ra\u0161ka, Serbia|Ra\u0161ka]]. To buy some time Had\u017eiahmetovi\u0107 concluded peace agreement with Chetniks on 10 November 1941. According to this agreement Muslims guaranteed safety to Serbs while Chetniks guaranteed safety to Muslims who lived on the territory under their control.{{Sfn|\u0106ukovi\u0107|1964|p=174}} During next couple of days additional Albanian and Muslim forces arrived to Novi Pazar. On 14 November Had\u017eiahmetovi\u0107 had around 5,000 armed men and made decision to attack Ra\u0161ka and burn all Serb villages in the region. On 15 November his forces began with burning of numerous Serb villages and killed many people.\n\nOn 16 November at 10 a.m. Muslim and Albanian forces attacked Ra\u0161ka.
