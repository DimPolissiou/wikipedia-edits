Unseptunium has an atomic mass of 500. Unseptunium and Usu are the systematic name and symbol which are used until the element is discovered. Then a permanent name is decided apon. Unseptunium is expected to show some similarities to the halogens, having an oxidation state ranging from -1 to +7, although its physical properties are expected to be closer to that of a metal, so for now it is considered a metaloid. The Usu- ion is expected to form compounds with the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals. Unseptunide ions might be essential to life like chloride, bromide, and iodide.\n", "text_old": "#REDIRECT [[Extended periodic table#Elements 167 to 172]]\n\n{{rcat shell|\n{{R with possibilities}}\n{{R from subtopic}}\n{{R printworthy}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hypothetical chemical elements]]\n", "name_user": "2606:a000:121c:44d:8d7d:42cc:5406:9781", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I made a new article about unseptunium)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unseptunium&redirect=no"}

Self-destructive and [[antisocial behavior]] may also be triggered.<ref name=\"Spitzer\" /> Symptoms can vary depending on several factors, such as trauma severity, the amount of social support, and additional life stresses.<ref name=\"De Boer\" />\n\n==Causes==\nA critical incident that occurs to an individual is the starting point for incident stress if the individual is unable to cope. Critical incidents are defined as sudden, unexpected events that have an emotional impact sufficient to overwhelm the usually effective [[coping skill]]s of an individual and cause significant [[psychological trauma|psychological damage]].<ref name=\"De Boer\" />\n\nHealthy [[attachment theory|attachment]] among adults is key to managing critical incident stress. Adults have four [[wikt:attachment|attachment]] styles: 1) fearful avoidant, 2) anxious-preoccupied, 3) dismissive avoidant, and 4) secure. ''Fearful avoidant'' adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, because they want emotional connections but are very reluctant to allow them. ''Anxious-preoccupied'' adults tend to deal with their stress by distancing themselves from the reality of the situation to avoid the emotional burden. They also tend to see themselves negatively and doubt their worth in relationships frequently. ''Dismissive avoidant'' adults view themselves as self-sufficient, and in no need of emotional connectedness. ''Secure'' adults have positive views about themselves, and feel comfortable with independence and intimacy. Secure adults typically cope better with critical incident stress, as opposed to non-secure adults, because they develop less stress by nature. Secure adults are also less likely to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]].<ref name=\"Bogaerts\" />[[File:Medical emergency.jpg|thumb|Emergency workers must respond quickly to incidents. Incident stress can occur immediately while a worker is still on the scene, or manifest at a later time.]]People exhibiting signs of incident stress require professional help to avoid the more serious condition of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].<ref name=\"First Aid\" /> The [[DSM IV-TR]] describes [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]] as having three distinct symptom clusters: 1) re-experiencing the event, 2) avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and numbing of general responsiveness, and 3) increased arousal. The first symptom cluster, ''re-experiencing the event'', is a mixture of physical and psychological reactions someone goes through after the critical event has occurred. Those includes [[nightmare]]s, reoccurring thoughts/[[flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, or [[panic attack]]s. The second symptom cluster, ''avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and numbing of general responsiveness'', occurs when someone avoids anything that could possibly trigger memories of the critical event. This includes thoughts and feelings associated with the event, and even physical stimuli such as people and places having to do with the event. The third symptom cluster, ''increased arousal'', produces anxiety-driven responses, such as trouble sleeping, excessive anger and irritability, [[hypervigilance]], poor concentration, and exaggerated [[startle response]]. When these symptoms persist for more than 2 weeks, a diagnosis of [[acute stress disorder]] may be appropriate.<ref name=\"Bogaerts\" /> Factors, such as family psychiatric history, or childhood abuse may mediate the relationship between critical incidents and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]].<ref name=\"De Boer\" />\n==Management==\n\nCritical incident-stress debriefings (CISDs) have proven to be a successful coping method over the past 15 years for individuals in high-stress, [[emergency response]] professions.<ref name=\"Van Patten\" /> Nearly 300 CISD teams exist in the United States, offering intervention to fire, paramedic, police, and other emergency personnel. These debriefings are designed to offer emotional reassurance, time for ventilation of feelings, education about stress management, and consultation.<ref name=\"Spitzer\" /> This technique was first implemented by Jeff Mitchell, of the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation, in 1983 to treat emergency care workers in the [[mental health profession]]. These debriefings were created to prevent worsening of the stress and also promote recovery. Judith Herman, author of ''Trauma & Recovery'', identified three critical conditions that must be satisfied in order to progress toward recovery: 1) safety, 2) remembrance and mourning, and 3) reconnection. ''Safety'' is achieved when victims learn to feel relaxed and trust in the recovery process by recognizing there are disturbed emotions. \"Remembrance and mourning\" of the critical incident is necessary in order for the victim to move toward recovery. \"Reconnection\" occurs when the victim feels they are emotionally stable enough to pursue [[stress management]] and recovery.<ref name=\"Rich\" />\n\nProblem-solving appraisals were tested as another possible method for coping with critical incident stress. The first successful testing of this technique was done by Sarah Baker and Karen Williams in the United Kingdom, using a testing group of stressed firefighters. These firefighters filled out anonymous self-report questionnaires that gauged their level of stress. The research results supported the hypothesis that problem-solving appraisals serve a moderating function between [[work stress]] and psychological distress.<ref name=\"Baker\" />\n\nA study published in 2008<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Janice|last2=Gurevich|first2=Maria|last3=Schwartz|first3=Brian|last4=Brazeau|first4=Paulette|date=2009|title=Interventions for critical incident stress in emergency medical services: a qualitative study|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.1230|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=139\u2013149|doi=10.1002/smi.1230|issn=1532-2998}}</ref>, suggests dealing with the traumatic event immediately after it occurring proved beneficial in [[Emergency medical technician|Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs)]]. The intervention methods that were the most important to these [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] participants were supervisor support and a timeout period. A supportive supervisor was looked at with appreciation while a non-supportive supervisor was looked at as critical. A timeout period is defined as 1/2-1 hour of time that the [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] halts working. This time can be spent alone but more frequently with peers. This time gives the [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] the opportunity to talk about the incident casually before having to do the paperwork, or talk about unrelated things to relax and decompress. The participants of this study described education, addressing barriers to support and improving chronic workplace stressors as suggestions and recommendations on what they thought helped the most when dealing with critical incidents.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Prevention ==\nNo evidence has been shown to completely prevent incident stress. There have been studies showing there are ways to greatly reduce the impact front line workers experience. Responders must take care of themselves for their own safety and to maintain the safety of others. Monitoring by conversations or observations could identify early signs for responders. Maintaining health on-site and following the incident are key.

''Anxious-preoccupied'' adults tend to deal with their stress by distancing themselves from the reality of the situation to avoid the emotional burden. They also tend to see themselves negatively and doubt their worth in relationships frequently. ''Dismissive avoidant'' adults view themselves as self-sufficient, and in no need of emotional connectedness. ''Secure'' adults have positive views about themselves, and feel comfortable with independence and intimacy. Secure adults typically cope better with critical incident stress, as opposed to non-secure adults, because they develop less stress by nature. Secure adults are also less likely to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]].<ref name=\"Bogaerts\" />[[File:Medical emergency.jpg|thumb|Emergency workers must respond quickly to incidents. Incident stress can occur immediately while a worker is still on the scene, or manifest at a later time.]]People exhibiting signs of incident stress require professional help to avoid the more serious condition of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].<ref name=\"First Aid\" /> The [[DSM IV-TR]] describes [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]] as having three distinct symptom clusters: 1) re-experiencing the event, 2) avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and numbing of general responsiveness, and 3) increased arousal. The first symptom cluster, ''re-experiencing the event'', is a mixture of physical and psychological reactions someone goes through after the critical event has occurred. Those includes [[nightmare]]s, reoccurring thoughts/[[flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, or [[panic attack]]s. The second symptom cluster, ''avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and numbing of general responsiveness'', occurs when someone avoids anything that could possibly trigger memories of the critical event. This includes thoughts and feelings associated with the event, and even physical stimuli such as people and places having to do with the event. The third symptom cluster, ''increased arousal'', produces anxiety-driven responses, such as trouble sleeping, excessive anger and irritability, [[hypervigilance]], poor concentration, and exaggerated [[startle response]]. When these symptoms persist for more than 2 weeks, a diagnosis of [[acute stress disorder]] may be appropriate.<ref name=\"Bogaerts\" /> Factors, such as family psychiatric history, or childhood abuse may mediate the relationship between critical incidents and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]].<ref name=\"De Boer\" />\n==Management==\n\nCritical incident-stress debriefings (CISDs) have proven to be a successful coping method over the past 15 years for individuals in high-stress, [[emergency response]] professions.<ref name=\"Van Patten\" /> Nearly 300 CISD teams exist in the United States, offering intervention to fire, paramedic, police, and other emergency personnel. These debriefings are designed to offer emotional reassurance, time for ventilation of feelings, education about stress management, and consultation.<ref name=\"Spitzer\" /> This technique was first implemented by Jeff Mitchell, of the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation, in 1983 to treat emergency care workers in the [[mental health profession]]. These debriefings were created to prevent worsening of the stress and also promote recovery. Judith Herman, author of ''Trauma & Recovery'', identified three critical conditions that must be satisfied in order to progress toward recovery: 1) safety, 2) remembrance and mourning, and 3) reconnection. ''Safety'' is achieved when victims learn to feel relaxed and trust in the recovery process by recognizing there are disturbed emotions. \"Remembrance and mourning\" of the critical incident is necessary in order for the victim to move toward recovery. \"Reconnection\" occurs when the victim feels they are emotionally stable enough to pursue [[stress management]] and recovery.<ref name=\"Rich\" />\n\nProblem-solving appraisals were tested as another possible method for coping with critical incident stress. The first successful testing of this technique was done by Sarah Baker and Karen Williams in the United Kingdom, using a testing group of stressed firefighters. These firefighters filled out anonymous self-report questionnaires that gauged their level of stress. The research results supported the hypothesis that problem-solving appraisals serve a moderating function between [[work stress]] and psychological distress.<ref name=\"Baker\" />\n\nA study published in 2008<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Janice|last2=Gurevich|first2=Maria|last3=Schwartz|first3=Brian|last4=Brazeau|first4=Paulette|date=2009|title=Interventions for critical incident stress in emergency medical services: a qualitative study|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.1230|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=139\u2013149|doi=10.1002/smi.1230|issn=1532-2998}}</ref>, suggests dealing with the traumatic event immediately after it occurring proved beneficial in [[Emergency medical technician|Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs)]]. The intervention methods that were the most important to these [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] participants were supervisor support and a timeout period. A supportive supervisor was looked at with appreciation while a non-supportive supervisor was looked at as critical. A timeout period is defined as 1/2-1 hour of time that the [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] halts working. This time can be spent alone but more frequently with peers. This time gives the [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] the opportunity to talk about the incident casually before having to do the paperwork, or talk about unrelated things to relax and decompress. The participants of this study described education, addressing barriers to support and improving chronic workplace stressors as suggestions and recommendations on what they thought helped the most when dealing with critical incidents.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Prevention ==\nNo evidence has been shown to completely prevent incident stress. There have been studies showing there are ways to greatly reduce the impact front line workers experience. Responders must take care of themselves for their own safety and to maintain the safety of others. Monitoring by conversations or observations could identify early signs for responders. Maintaining health on-site and following the incident are key.

The total cost of the project is about PKR 34 billion. Gulpur Hydropower Project is part of the least-cost energy generation plan of the [[Government of Pakistan]]. It is being executed on priority basis to harness indigenous hydropower resources to improve the ratio of hydel electricity in the national grid and help provide relief to the consumers.\n\nOn its completion, Gulpur Hydropower project will generate about 465 Gwh of inexpensive electricity annually to earn revenue of about Rs 1 billion. Being an environment friendly hydropower project, it will help reduce dependence on expensive thermal power, thereby saving foreign exchange amounting to $36 million (equivalent to Rs 3 billion) to the country. According to estimation, Gulpur hydropower project will add about Rs 10 billion per annum to the national economy through socio-economic uplift in the country caused by the project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing the loan to Mira Power, run by three Korean companies, which will build and operate a 102MW hydropower plant.\n\n==Salient Features==\n\n'''Basin and Reservoir'''<br>\n\u25e6 Catchment Area 3,625\u33a2 <br>\n\u25e6 NHWL EL.540.0m <br>\n\u25e6 L.W.L EL.538.0m <br>\n\u25e6 100yr frequency flood 13,340\u33a5/s <br>\n\u25e6 PMF 21,640\u33a5/s <br>\n\u25e6 Reservoir Capacity(NHWL) 21.893 million\u33a5\n\n'''Main Dam'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type CGD <br>\n\u25e6 Design Flood 21,640\u33a5/s(PMF)<br> \n\u25e6 Height 35.0m <br>\n\u25e6 Crest EL.545.0m <br>\n\u25e6 Length 238.0m\n\n'''Spillway'''<br>\n\u25e6 Radial Gate Size W10.0m\u00d77Gates (EL.518.0m) <br>\n\u25e6 Under Sluice Gate Size W10.0m\u00d74Gates (EL.515.0m) <br>\n\u25e6 Energy Dissipation Submerged Bucket\n\n'''River Diversion'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Partial cofferdam(1st) + Sheet File(2nd)<br> \n\u25e6 Design Flood 2,517\u33a5/s (25yr frequency)\n\n'''Intake Weir'''<br>\n\u25e6 Gate Nos. 2 EA <br>\n\u25e6 Gate Size 10.0 \u00d7 12.0m\n\n'''Headrace Tunnel'''<br>\n\u25e6 Size D=7.75m <br>\n\u25e6 Type Modified horseshoe(Concrete lined) <br>\n\u25e6 Length 3,063.5m\n\n'''Surge Tank'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Simple Type <br>\n\u25e6 Size D=29.0m(Circular) <br>\n\u25e6 Height 54.0m <br>\n\u25e6 Max Upsurging Level EL.556.523m <br>\n\u25e6 Max Downsurging Level EL.525.986m\n\n'''Vertical Pressure Tunnel'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Circular (Concrete Lined)<br> \n\u25e6 Length 44.6m\n\n'''Horizontal Pressure Tunnel'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Circular (Concrete Lined) <br>\n\u25e6 Length 71.7m\n\n'''Steel Penstock'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Circular (Steel Lined) <br>\n\u25e6 Length 11.2m \u00d7 1EA 28.9m \u00d7 3EA\n\n'''Powerhouse'''<br>\n\u25e6 Size W74.0m \u00d7 L31.5m <br>\n\u25e6 Turbine Type Francis <br>\n\u25e6 Installed Net Capacity 100 MW <br>\n\u25e6 Annual Generation 465 GWh <br>\n\u25e6 Plant Discharge 194\u33a5/s <br>\n\u25e6 Gross head 57.45 m\n\n'''Tailrace Channel'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Open Channel<br> \n\u25e6 Length 50.0m <br>\n\u25e6 Width 45.0m<ref>http://www.mira-power.com/our-project/salient-technical-features/</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Pakistan|Water|Renewable energy}}}}\n* [[List of dams and reservoirs in Pakistan]]\n* [[List of power stations in Pakistan]]\n* [[Satpara Dam]]\n* [[Allai Khwar Hydropower Project]]\n* [[Gomal Zam Dam]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Dams in Pakistan}}\n\n[[Category:Dams in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Run-of-the-river power stations]]\n[[Category:Dams in the Indus River basin]]\n[[Category:Dams under construction]]\n[[Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Roller-compacted concrete dams]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox dam\n| name = Gulpur Hydropower Plant\n| image = \n| name_official = Gulpur Hydropower Plant\n| location_map = Pakistan\n| location_map_size = \n| location_map_caption = \n| coordinates = {{coord|33|27|19|N|73|51|45|E|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| dam_crosses = [[Poonch River]], a tributary of [[Jhelum River]]\n| location = [[Gulpur]], [[Kotli District]], [[Kotli]] Town of [[Azad Kashmir|AJK]], [[Pakistan]]\n| dam_type = Gravity, [[roller-compacted concrete]]\n| dam_length = {{convert|238|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n| dam_height = {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n| dam_width_base = \n| construction_began = January 2014\n| opening = February 2020\n| status = Under construction\n| owner = [[Water and Power Development Authority]] (WAPDA)\n| res_name = \n| res_capacity_total = {{Convert|21893000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}\n| res_capacity_active = \n| res_capacity_inactive = \n| res_catchment = {{Convert|3625|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}\n| res_surface = \n| res_max_length = \n| res_max_width = \n| res_max_depth = \n| res_elevation = \n| res_tidal_range = \n| plant_name = Gulpur Hydroelectric Plant\n| plant_coordinates = \n| plant_operator = [[Korea South-East Power Company (KOSEP)]]\n| plant_commission = February 2020\n| plant_decommission = \n| plant_type = \n| plant_turbines = 2 x 51 MW [[Kaplan-type]]\n| plant_capacity = 102 MW gross\n| plant_annual_gen = 465 GWh\n| extra = \n}}\n'''Gulpur Hydropower Plant (GHPP)''' is an under construction, [[run-of-the-river]] [[hydroelectric]] generation project located on [[Poonch River]], a major tributary of [[Jhelum River]] near [[Gulpur]] in [[Kotli District]] of [[Azad Kashmir]], [[Pakistan]].

The project has the capability of generating an average annual energy of 465 GWh.<ref>http://www.mira-power.com/our-project/project-description/</ref>\n\n==Background and construction==\nGulpur Hydropower Project is the third independent hydropower project in [[Pakistan]]. Korean company has also been awarded other contracts to build hydropower plants in the country on BOOT basis i.e. under construction 150 MW [[Patrind Hydropower Plant]] and 100MW [[Kotli Hydropower Project]].\n\nThe sponsor of the project is [[Korean South East Power Company]] along with [[Daelim Industrial Co., Ltd.]] and [[Lotte Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd.]]. The Construction of the Project has been awarded to a joint venture between Daelim and Lotte.\n\nConstruction of Gulpur Hydropower Plant commenced in September 2014 and the project is expected to be completed in early 2020<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppib.gov.pk/N_upcoming_ipps.htm|title=PRIVATE POWER & INFRASTRUCTURE BOARD -  Upcoming IPPs|last=|first=|date=12 December 2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>. The total cost of the project is about PKR 34 billion. Gulpur Hydropower Project is part of the least-cost energy generation plan of the [[Government of Pakistan]]. It is being executed on priority basis to harness indigenous hydropower resources to improve the ratio of hydel electricity in the national grid and help provide relief to the consumers.\n\nOn its completion, Gulpur Hydropower project will generate about 465 Gwh of inexpensive electricity annually to earn revenue of about Rs 1 billion. Being an environment friendly hydropower project, it will help reduce dependence on expensive thermal power, thereby saving foreign exchange amounting to $36 million (equivalent to Rs 3 billion) to the country. According to estimation, Gulpur hydropower project will add about Rs 10 billion per annum to the national economy through socio-economic uplift in the country caused by the project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing the loan to Mira Power, run by three Korean companies, which will build and operate a 102MW hydropower plant.\n\n==Salient Features==\n\n'''Basin and Reservoir'''<br>\n\u25e6 Catchment Area 3,625\u33a2 <br>\n\u25e6 NHWL EL.540.0m <br>\n\u25e6 L.W.L EL.538.0m <br>\n\u25e6 100yr frequency flood 13,340\u33a5/s <br>\n\u25e6 PMF 21,640\u33a5/s <br>\n\u25e6 Reservoir Capacity(NHWL) 21.893 million\u33a5\n\n'''Main Dam'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type CGD <br>\n\u25e6 Design Flood 21,640\u33a5/s(PMF)<br> \n\u25e6 Height 35.0m <br>\n\u25e6 Crest EL.545.0m <br>\n\u25e6 Length 238.0m\n\n'''Spillway'''<br>\n\u25e6 Radial Gate Size W10.0m\u00d77Gates (EL.518.0m) <br>\n\u25e6 Under Sluice Gate Size W10.0m\u00d74Gates (EL.515.0m) <br>\n\u25e6 Energy Dissipation Submerged Bucket\n\n'''River Diversion'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Partial cofferdam(1st) + Sheet File(2nd)<br> \n\u25e6 Design Flood 2,517\u33a5/s (25yr frequency)\n\n'''Intake Weir'''<br>\n\u25e6 Gate Nos. 2 EA <br>\n\u25e6 Gate Size 10.0 \u00d7 12.0m\n\n'''Headrace Tunnel'''<br>\n\u25e6 Size D=7.75m <br>\n\u25e6 Type Modified horseshoe(Concrete lined) <br>\n\u25e6 Length 3,063.5m\n\n'''Surge Tank'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Simple Type <br>\n\u25e6 Size D=29.0m(Circular) <br>\n\u25e6 Height 54.0m <br>\n\u25e6 Max Upsurging Level EL.556.523m <br>\n\u25e6 Max Downsurging Level EL.525.986m\n\n'''Vertical Pressure Tunnel'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Circular (Concrete Lined)<br> \n\u25e6 Length 44.6m\n\n'''Horizontal Pressure Tunnel'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Circular (Concrete Lined) <br>\n\u25e6 Length 71.7m\n\n'''Steel Penstock'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Circular (Steel Lined) <br>\n\u25e6 Length 11.2m \u00d7 1EA 28.9m \u00d7 3EA\n\n'''Powerhouse'''<br>\n\u25e6 Size W74.0m \u00d7 L31.5m <br>\n\u25e6 Turbine Type Francis <br>\n\u25e6 Installed Net Capacity 100 MW <br>\n\u25e6 Annual Generation 465 GWh <br>\n\u25e6 Plant Discharge 194\u33a5/s <br>\n\u25e6 Gross head 57.45 m\n\n'''Tailrace Channel'''<br>\n\u25e6 Type Open Channel<br> \n\u25e6 Length 50.0m <br>\n\u25e6 Width 45.0m<ref>http://www.mira-power.com/our-project/salient-technical-features/</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Pakistan|Water|Renewable energy}}}}\n* [[List of dams and reservoirs in Pakistan]]\n* [[List of power stations in Pakistan]]\n* [[Satpara Dam]]\n* [[Allai Khwar Hydropower Project]]\n* [[Gomal Zam Dam]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Dams in Pakistan}}\n\n[[Category:Dams in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Run-of-the-river power stations]]\n[[Category:Dams in the Indus River basin]]\n[[Category:Dams under construction]]\n[[Category:Energy infrastructure under construction]]\n[[Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Roller-compacted concrete dams]]\n", "name_user": "Macquaria", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed from category \"Energy infrastructure under construction\" since it is already part of a subcategory.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulpur_Hydropower_Project"}
