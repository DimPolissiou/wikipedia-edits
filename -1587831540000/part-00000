Your change WILL be reverted if you change it without discussion. ---> written and directed by [[Wes Anderson]], which explores tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty. [[Ralph Fiennes]] leads a seventeen-actor [[ensemble cast]] as Monsieur Gustave H, famed [[concierge]] of a mountainside resort in the Republic of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy [[dowager]] ([[Tilda Swinton]]), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero ([[Tony Revolori]]) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting against the backdrop of encroaching pandemonium. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with [[Studio Babelsberg]] and [[Indian Paintbrush (production company)|Indian Paintbrush]]'s [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Steven Rales]], and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] handled its commercial distribution. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was financed by Indian Paintbrush and a German government-funded rebate program.\n\nAnderson and longtime collaborator [[Hugo Guinness]] conceived ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a mutual friend. They initially struggled to develop their idea further, but the experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist [[Stefan Zweig]] shaped their ambitions for the film. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[photocrom]] print collection of alpine resorts. [[Principal photography]] took place in eastern [[Germany]] over a ten-week period from January to March 2013. French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] crafted the symphonic, [[Russian folk music|Russian folk]]-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson.\n\n''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' premiered in competition at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release preceded the film's global rollout on February 26, followed by releases in Germany, North America and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. It was well received by the media, though the film's approach to the subject matter, fragmented storytelling, and characterization drew occasional criticism. [[BBC]] chose ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century]]. The film earned $173&nbsp;million in box office revenue worldwide, bolstered by fatiguing interest in resurgent studio films hoping to capitalize on the prestige of their accolades and crossover appeal to young, casual moviegoers. It led the [[87th Academy Awards]] season with nine nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won several other honors chiefly for writing and technical achievement.\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl visits the shrine of a renowned writer, known simply as \"Author\", carrying a copy of his most-cherished novel: ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''. The author begins narrating as the film explores his history, prefacing with a 1985 excerpt reading before flashing back to his 1968 stay at the once-grand, now-drab hotel. There he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who invites him to dinner to hear his [[rags to riches]] story.\n\nIn 1932, Zero is the newly-hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients\u2014among them the 84-year-old [[dowager]] Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly-two-decade affair.\n\nShortly after her last visit, Gustave learns from Zero that Madame has mysteriously died. He and Zero visit Schloss Lutz, her estate, to pay their respects and encounter her surviving relatives hearing the reading of her will by her attorney, Kovacs. Kovacs announces a recent [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to the will which bequeathes ''[[Boy with Apple]]'', a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting, to Gustave. Madame's son, Dmitri, is outraged and demands Gustave's arrest. Gustave and Zero leave, absconding with the painting for safekeeping.\n\nAt the Grand Budapest, Gustave is arrested for Madame's murder. He befriends a gang during his imprisonment, and the men plot their escape. Gustave has Zero place digging tools inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice baker at Mendl's and Zero's girlfriend. Gustave and the others dig their way out and disperse. When they are reunited, Zero and Gustave set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges: the Society of the Crossed Keys. They learn that Madame had a missing second will which would only take effect if she was murdered.\n\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha arrive back at the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a military headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve ''Boy with Apple'' to sell; as she tries to leave, Dmitri enters the hotel and spots her with the painting. Gustave and Zero rush to save Agatha from harm as she escapes from Dmitri. He opens fire on them, initiating an intense (but confusing) shootout with Zubrowkan troops. Agatha's attempt to escape leaves her and Zero hanging from a balcony before they fall, safely, into a van of pastries.\n\nMadame's second will, with Gustave the beneficiary of her fortune, is found attached to the back of ''Boy with Apple''; he succeeds her as owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in Zubrowka. While traveling by train, he, Zero, and Agatha encounter soldiers who destroy Zero's refugee documents. Gustave tries to fend off the soldiers, and is later shot dead. Zero, Gustave's sole heir, inherits his fortune; he retains the now-decrepit Grand Budapest in memory of Agatha, who died of illness with their infant son. The experiences are incorporated into the author's celebrated book, and the film ends with the young girl reading ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' next to his memorial.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as M.

Thus they used a towercam, a telescoping camera platform, to traverse between floors, sometimes in lieu of a [[crane shot|camera crane]].

He and the producers referred to the work of [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and other directors of the period to acclimate to the compositions produced from said format.<ref name=asc /> Filmmakers formatted modern scenes in standard 1.85:1 ratio, and the 1968 scenes were captured in widescreen 2.40:1 ratio with [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]]'s Technovision series of [[zoom lens|zoom]] and [[prime lens|prime anamorphic lenses]]. The Cooke lenses produced a soft, but diffuse composition, one that lacked the sharpness of [[Panavision]] lenses.<ref name=asc />\n\nYeoman lit interior shots with tungsten incandescent fixtures and [[DMX512|DMX]]-dimmer-controlled lighting. The crew made the Warenhaus ceiling from stretched [[muslin]] rigged with twenty 4K [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] lamps, an arrangement wherein the reflected light penetrated the [[skylight]], accentuating the set's daylighting. Yeoman was pleased with the lighting choice because the warm tungsten fixtures contrasted with the coolish daylight.<ref name=asc /> When shooting deliberately less inviting hotel sets, such as Zero and Gustave's small bedrooms and the Grand Budapest's [[servants' quarters]], the filmmakers combined [[fluorescent lighting]], [[paper lantern]]s and bare [[incandescent lights]] for historical accuracy.<ref name=asc />\n\nThe [[Stuttgart]]-based LUXX Studios and [[Look Effects]]' German branch (also in Stuttgart) managed most of ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''{{'s}} visual effects, under the supervision of Gabriel Sanchez.<ref name=asc /><ref name=cgs /> Their work for the film comprised 300 shots, created by a small cadre of specialized artists.<ref name=\"cgs\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/grand_budapest_hotel3 |title=The Grand Budapest Hotel |last=CGSociety staff |date=March 13, 2014 |website=CGSociety |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509113357/http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/grand_budapest_hotel3 |archive-date=May 9, 2017 |access-date=November 24, 2019}}</ref> The development of the film's effects team was swift, yet at times difficult. As Look Effects opened their Stuttgart headquarters after ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' filming wrapped, Sanchez was only able to reference his prior experience with Anderson, and the California-based artist became homesick working his first international assignment.<ref name=cgs /> Only four artists from the newly-assembled team had the expertise working on a multi-million dollar studio set, but their eagerness to master the nuance of said task resulted in constructive problem solving and camaraderie.<ref name=cgs />\n\nCreation of the effects was daunting because of their technical demands. The filmmakers camouflaged some of the [[stop motion animation|stop-motion]] and matte effects in the forest set chase scene to convey the desired intensity, and enhancing the snowscape with particle effects posed another challenge.<ref name=cgs /> Sanchez cites the observatory and hotel shots as work that best demonstrate his special effects team's ingenuity. To achieve the aging brutalist design of the 1968 Grand Budapest, they generated computer models supplemented with detailed lighting, matte effects and shadowy expanses.<ref name=cgs /> The crew used a similar technique in developing digital shots of the observatory; unlike the hotel, however, the observatory's base miniature was presented in pieces.

Your change WILL be reverted if you change it without discussion. ---> written and directed by [[Wes Anderson]], which explores tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty. [[Ralph Fiennes]] leads a seventeen-actor [[ensemble cast]] as Monsieur Gustave H, famed [[concierge]] of a mountainside resort in the Republic of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy [[dowager]] ([[Tilda Swinton]]), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero ([[Tony Revolori]]) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting against the backdrop of encroaching pandemonium. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with [[Studio Babelsberg]] and [[Indian Paintbrush (production company)|Indian Paintbrush]]'s [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Steven Rales]], and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] handled its commercial distribution. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was financed by Indian Paintbrush and a German government-funded rebate program.\n\nAnderson and longtime collaborator [[Hugo Guinness]] conceived ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a mutual friend. They initially struggled to develop their idea further, but the experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist [[Stefan Zweig]] shaped their ambitions for the film. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[photocrom]] print collection of alpine resorts. [[Principal photography]] took place in eastern [[Germany]] over a ten-week period from January to March 2013. French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] crafted the symphonic, [[Russian folk music|Russian folk]]-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson.\n\n''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' premiered in competition at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release preceded the film's global rollout on February 26, followed by releases in Germany, North America and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. It was well received by the media, though the film's approach to the subject matter, fragmented storytelling, and characterization drew occasional criticism. [[BBC]] chose ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century]]. The film earned $173&nbsp;million in box office revenue worldwide, bolstered by fatiguing interest in resurgent studio films hoping to capitalize on the prestige of their accolades and crossover appeal to young, casual moviegoers. It led the [[87th Academy Awards]] season with nine nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won several other honors chiefly for writing and technical achievement.\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl visits the shrine of a renowned writer, known simply as \"Author\", carrying a copy of his most-cherished novel: ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''. The author begins narrating as the film explores his history, prefacing with a 1985 excerpt reading before flashing back to his 1968 stay at the once-grand, now-drab hotel. There he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who invites him to dinner to hear his [[rags to riches]] story.\n\nIn 1932, Zero is the newly-hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients\u2014among them the 84-year-old [[dowager]] Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly-two-decade affair.\n\nShortly after her last visit, Gustave learns from Zero that Madame has mysteriously died. He and Zero visit Schloss Lutz, her estate, to pay their respects and encounter her surviving relatives hearing the reading of her will by her attorney, Kovacs. Kovacs announces a recent [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to the will which bequeathes ''[[Boy with Apple]]'', a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting, to Gustave. Madame's son, Dmitri, is outraged and demands Gustave's arrest. Gustave and Zero leave, absconding with the painting for safekeeping.\n\nAt the Grand Budapest, Gustave is arrested for Madame's murder. He befriends a gang during his imprisonment, and the men plot their escape. Gustave has Zero place digging tools inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice baker at Mendl's and Zero's girlfriend. Gustave and the others dig their way out and disperse. When they are reunited, Zero and Gustave set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges: the Society of the Crossed Keys. They learn that Madame had a missing second will which would only take effect if she was murdered.\n\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha arrive back at the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a military headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve ''Boy with Apple'' to sell; as she tries to leave, Dmitri enters the hotel and spots her with the painting. Gustave and Zero rush to save Agatha from harm as she escapes from Dmitri. He opens fire on them, initiating an intense (but confusing) shootout with Zubrowkan troops. Agatha's attempt to escape leaves her and Zero hanging from a balcony before they fall, safely, into a van of pastries.\n\nMadame's second will, with Gustave the beneficiary of her fortune, is found attached to the back of ''Boy with Apple''; he succeeds her as owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in Zubrowka. While traveling by train, he, Zero, and Agatha encounter soldiers who destroy Zero's refugee documents. Gustave tries to fend off the soldiers, and is later shot dead. Zero, Gustave's sole heir, inherits his fortune; he retains the now-decrepit Grand Budapest in memory of Agatha, who died of illness with their infant son. The experiences are incorporated into the author's celebrated book, and the film ends with the young girl reading ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' next to his memorial.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as M.

Thus they used a towercam, a telescoping camera platform, to traverse between floors, sometimes in lieu of a [[crane shot|camera crane]].

He and the producers referred to the work of [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and other directors of the period to acclimate to the compositions produced from said format.<ref name=asc /> Filmmakers formatted modern scenes in standard 1.85:1 ratio, and the 1968 scenes were captured in widescreen 2.40:1 ratio with [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]]'s Technovision series of [[zoom lens|zoom]] and [[prime lens|prime anamorphic lenses]]. The Cooke lenses produced a soft, but diffuse composition, one that lacked the sharpness of [[Panavision]] lenses.<ref name=asc />\n\nYeoman lit interior shots with tungsten incandescent fixtures and [[DMX512|DMX]]-dimmer-controlled lighting. The crew made the Warenhaus ceiling from stretched [[muslin]] rigged with twenty 4K [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] lamps, an arrangement wherein the reflected light penetrated the [[skylight]], accentuating the set's daylighting. Yeoman was pleased with the lighting choice because the warm tungsten fixtures contrasted with the coolish daylight.<ref name=asc /> When shooting deliberately less inviting hotel sets, such as Zero and Gustave's small bedrooms and the Grand Budapest's [[servants' quarters]], the filmmakers combined [[fluorescent lighting]], [[paper lantern]]s and bare [[incandescent lights]] for historical accuracy.<ref name=asc />\n\nThe [[Stuttgart]]-based LUXX Studios and [[Look Effects]]' German branch (also in Stuttgart) managed most of ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''{{'s}} visual effects, under the supervision of Gabriel Sanchez.<ref name=asc /><ref name=cgs /> Their work for the film comprised 300 shots, created by a small cadre of specialized artists.<ref name=\"cgs\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/grand_budapest_hotel3 |title=The Grand Budapest Hotel |last=CGSociety staff |date=March 13, 2014 |website=CGSociety |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509113357/http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/grand_budapest_hotel3 |archive-date=May 9, 2017 |access-date=November 24, 2019}}</ref> The development of the film's effects team was swift, yet at times difficult. As Look Effects opened their Stuttgart headquarters after ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' filming wrapped, Sanchez was only able to reference his prior experience with Anderson, and the California-based artist became homesick working his first international assignment.<ref name=cgs /> Only four artists from the newly-assembled team had the expertise working on a multi-million dollar studio set, but their eagerness to master the nuance of said task resulted in constructive problem solving and camaraderie.<ref name=cgs />\n\nCreation of the effects was daunting because of their technical demands. The filmmakers camouflaged some of the [[stop motion animation|stop-motion]] and matte effects in the forest set chase scene to convey the desired intensity, and enhancing the snowscape with particle effects posed another challenge.<ref name=cgs /> Sanchez cites the observatory and hotel shots as work that best demonstrate his special effects team's ingenuity.

His father, Imam Mahmud al-Hasani, was a scholar and teacher at [[al-Azhar]] University, and taught him the basics of Islamic knowledge, including the [[Quran]] and related sciences. Then at age 15, he performed his [[Hajj]] for the first time, and at 17, he obtained several diplomas and awards in the areas of [[tajwid]], [[tafsir]], [[hadith]] and [[Maliki]] [[fiqh]], and wrote several epistles on these subjects. At 18 years old, he saw the Prophet in a dream who ordered him to join the Tijani tariqa, then again at the age of 20, to build a [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiyya]] that would enable everyone to learn and practice Islam peacefully. The latter is built in the district of [[Imbaba]] near [[Cairo]], and has an open access library for which Shaykh Salah El Din Al Tijany has striven to identify the great classics of literature, in order to share them with anyone who wishes, making a point that Muslim(s) are reclaiming the knowledge of their religion.

His father, Imam Mahmud al-Hasani, was a scholar and teacher at [[al-Azhar]] University, and taught him the basics of Islamic knowledge, including the [[Quran]] and related sciences. Then at age 15, he performed his [[Hajj]] for the first time, and at 17, he obtained several diplomas and awards in the areas of [[tajwid]], [[tafsir]], [[hadith]] and [[Maliki]] [[fiqh]], and wrote several epistles on these subjects. At 18 years old, he saw the Prophet in a dream who ordered him to join the Tijani tariqa, then again at the age of 20, to build a [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiyya]] that would enable everyone to learn and practice Islam peacefully. The latter is built in the district of [[Imbaba]] near [[Cairo]], and has an open access library for which Shaykh Salah El Din Al Tijany has striven to identify the great classics of literature, in order to share them with anyone who wishes, making a point that Muslim(s) are reclaiming the knowledge of their religion. It was officially opened on 1 Muharram 1400.\n\nOver the years, he became a master of Sunni jurisprudence in the [[Maliki]], [[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] [[madhhab|madhhabs]] as well as mastering the legal opinions of the defunct madhabs, like that of [[Thawri|al-Thawri]], [[Awza'i|al-Awza'i]] and [[Zahiri|al-Zahiri]].

Barnes research spans 4 decades aiming to better understand the aging of the brain in relation to cognitive diseases. Her research is conducted by utilizing animal models such as primates and rats to explore and understand how memory is impacted in the normal aging process of the brain through means of neurobiological mechanisms that are involved. The use of animal models in Barnes research is translated into treatments used for abnormal functioning of the brain aimed at prolonging the cognitive lifespan of older individuals. The nature of Barnes research entails the use of behavioral, anatomical, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and molecular techniques\u00a0 to further examine the implications of normal aging on the brain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychology.arizona.edu/users/carol-barnes|title=Carol Barnes {{!}} Department of Psychology|website=psychology.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Most areas of her research involves examining and observing the [[hippocampus]] structure in the brains of rats and monkeys, observing and recording\u00a0synaptic transmission in cell to cell signaling, and genomic sequencing.\n\n=== [[Barnes maze|Barnes Maze]] ===\nTo study spatial learning and memory, Carol Barnes created her own maze to test whether rodents, specifically mice, could remember the location of an escape box on a platform. This test has become a standard method of memory testing in laboratories. Designed in 1979, Barnes' maze was an alternative to study memory without the use of external reward or punishment, while also reducing the stress put on the animal throughout the process.\n[[File:Barnes_maze.jpg|thumb|The Barnes maze]]\nThe original study consisted of a platform (122&nbsp;cm diameter) raised 91&nbsp;cm above the floor with 18 circular holes (9.5&nbsp;cm diameters) spaced evenly around the perimeter. Under one of the holes is a black escape box, or any dark color in contrast to the color of the platform; the rest of the holes lead to false escape boxes. The study consisted of 3 variations of the experiment. First, the mouse simply had to find the escape chamber that was placed under one of the holes. Second, the escape chamber was moved to a hole rotated 120-140 degrees from the original hole; the original hole was covered. Third, the same method as the second variation was used except the original hole was not covered. Barnes and her team found that overall, male mice performed better in all variations of the experiment. Further, they found younger mice also performed better in all variations, while older mice demonstrated notable difficulties in variations 2 and 3. This showed aging impairment in [[spatial memory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawel|first=Kinga|last2=Gibula|first2=Ewa|last3=Marszalek-Grabska|first3=Marta|last4=Filarowska|first4=Joanna|last5=Kotlinska|first5=Jolanta H.|date=2019-01-01|title=Assessment of spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in rodents\u2014methodological consideration|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=392|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|issn=1432-1912|pmc=6311199|pmid=30470917}}</ref>\n[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]\nSpatial memory corresponds to the functioning of the [[hippocampus]], while route learning involves the [[Striatum|striatal]] systems. Overall, rodents of various ages learned T-mazes within the same number of trials, but the strategies used to learn and remember mazes differed with age. Young rats predominately utilized \u201cplace\u201d strategies which rely upon [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] functioning, while older rats relied upon \u201cresponse\u201d strategies. Using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] imaging techniques, Barnes and her team were able to see that in normally aged brains of rodents, the size of the [[hippocampus]] did not change while the volume of [[Grey matter|cortical grey matter]] did. This animal model allowed an understanding of what the brain looks like during normal human functioning to compare it to brains that have been degenerated due to [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer\u2019s disease]] (rodents do not exhibit AD). These findings demonstrate that while during normal aging the [[hippocampus]] remains the same size, its function may decrease in comparison to functions of other areas of the brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samson|first=Rachel D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2013|title=Impact of Aging Brain Circuits on Cognition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694726/|journal=The European journal of neuroscience|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1903\u20131915|doi=10.1111/ejn.12183|issn=0953-816X|pmc=3694726|pmid=23773059|via=}}</ref>\n\nLooking deeper into the tissue affected, single-cell imaging showed there were 3 main types of cells that make up the [[hippocampus]]. When observing cell activity and the number of cells of the hippocampus of rats, it was found that the [[CA1 neuron|CA1]] and [[CA3 region|CA3]] [[pyramidal cell]]s continued to be active and of the same volume. However, the number of [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]] continuously decreased with age; the function of these cells also declined leading Carol and her team to conclude these gyrus cells are the weak link of the hippocampal circuit involved in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Carol A.|date=2011-10-03|title=Secrets of aging: What does a normally aging brain look like?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186042/|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=3|doi=10.3410/B3-22|issn=1757-594X|pmc=3186042|pmid=22003369}}</ref>\n\nA few of Barnes\u2019s latest research publication was published in 2017 are:\u00a0 \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281630420X Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in the macaque monkeys]\u201d, \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174334 Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus]\u201d, and \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305615 The aging navigational system]\u201d.\n\n=== Primate Research ===\n[[File:Brain_regions_involved_in_memory_formation.jpg|thumb|Brain regions involved in memory formation]]\nIn addition to work on rodent models, Dr. Barnes has helped advance the field of normative aging research using nonhuman primate models, specifically [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]].\u00a0 Primarily, Barnes\u2019 early work in macaques helped to tie together neurobiological data collected from rodents and functional imaging data from older humans. In the paper \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848213/ Memory impairment in aged primates is associated with region-specific network dysfunction]\u201d Barnes and her team showed that older monkeys had significant impairment on object recognition. In addition, older monkeys displayed a lower density of inhibitory somatostatin positive [[interneuron]]s in the [[CA3 region|CA3]] sub-region of the [[hippocampus]]. These [[interneuron]]s are responsible for regulating the activity of excitatory neurons in the [[hippocampus]]. With less [[interneuron]] density, the baseline firing rate of [[CA3 region|CA3]] excitatory neurons was elevated. This finding relates to the increased hippocampal activity shown in imaging studies of older human adults. Both a decrease in [[interneuron]] density and increase baseline firing rates in the [[hippocampus]] have been associated with poor cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2019-12-26|title=Experiments in macaque monkeys provide critical insights into age-associated changes in cognitive and sensory function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936691/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=116|issue=52|pages=26247\u201326254|doi=10.1073/pnas.1902279116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6936691|pmid=31871147}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the paper \u201cEvidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus\u201d Dr. Barnes and her team found evidence that all mammals require the same quantity of neurons in the hippocampus to encode memory of a single experience. This finding suggests that tall mammals use a stable amount of neurons to encode a similar virtual reality experience. However, due to variable hippocampus size, the proportion of neurons used for the encoding of experience differ. Rodents have the smallest [[hippocampus]] and thus use 40% of their [[hippocampus]] neurons for encoding, nonhuman primates have larger hippocampus and use 4%, and finally humans have the largest [[hippocampus]] and use an estimated 2.5% for experiential encoding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wixted|first=John T.|last2=Goldinger|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Squire|first3=Larry R.|last4=Kuhn|first4=Joel R.|last5=Papesh|first5=Megan H.|last6=Smith|first6=Kris A.|last7=Treiman|first7=David M.|last8=Steinmetz|first8=Peter N.|date=2018-01-30|title=Coding of episodic memory in the human hippocampus|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1093|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1093\u20131098|doi=10.1073/pnas.1716443115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=29339476|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nDr. Barnes has also done research to see how executive function changes with normative aging. [[Executive functions]] are the higher order process humans take part in such as attention, decision making, impulse control, and emotional control. These functions are mediated by the activity of the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]]. Once again studying [[macaque]]s, Barnes and her team focused on two aspects of executive function, attentional monitoring and updating as well as [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]]. Attentional monitoring and updating allow for behavior changes with corresponding rule changes. For example, when two options are presented one is the correct choice initially; however, when the correct choice changes to the second option, attentional monitoring and updating help correct for the rule change and alter behavior in order to choose correctly. The change in behavior is mediated through a process of trial and error, which helps associate the right choice with certain behaviors. Barnes and her team found that older monkeys needed a greater number of trials to accurately account for a rule change. Suggesting, the executive system behind attentional monitoring and updating is impaired with aging. Secondly, [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]] is the ability to unconsciously shift attention between tasks while maintaining accuracy. In her research, Barnes presented macaque monkeys with an object recognition test of previously learned objects. She then presented interfering objects which required shifts between the object choice and evaluation of novel objects. Her results showed that older monkeys performed better on object recognition with this interference than younger monkeys. Thus set shifting abilities seem to be maintained if not enhanced with aging. The most important discovery out of these studies, however, is that the two aspects of executive function, monitoring and updating and set shifting, were shown to be independent systems that are affected differently with age. Thus, Barnes and her team suggest that changes in the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]] can result from aging but different sub-regions within it show different patterns of aging.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Smith|first2=Anne C.|last3=Burke|first3=Sara N.|last4=Gazzaley|first4=Adam|last5=Barnes|first5=Carol A.|date=2017-03-30|title=Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in macaque monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493156/|journal=Behavioural brain research|volume=322|issue=Pt B|pages=329\u2013338|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.056|issn=0166-4328|pmc=5493156|pmid=27368416}}</ref>\n\nA final research contribution of Carol A Barnes involves the study of spatial networks and spatial memories in aging [[macaque]]s. Barnes and her team studied brain activity in four different conditions for movement: cages, sitting, walking on a treadmill, and freely walking in space. The study found that younger macaques have distinct spatial networks for all four distinct conditions. However, older monkeys displayed less discrete activity of spatial networks. Meaning, all conditions evoked activation of the same undifferentiated network. This finding suggests dynamic network changes as a possible explanation for spatial cognition deficits. In other words, the spatial processing networks become less precise with age and may contribute to spatial memory loss or confusion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engle|first=James R.|last2=Machado|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Permenter|first3=Michele R.|last4=Vogt|first4=Julie A.|last5=Maurer|first5=Andrew P.|last6=Bulleri|first6=Alicia M.|last7=Barnes|first7=Carol A.|date=2016-11-30|title=Network Patterns Associated with Navigation Behaviors Are Altered in Aged Nonhuman Primates|url=https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/48/12217|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=36|issue=48|pages=12217\u201312227|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4116-15.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=27903730|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nBarnes interest of normative aging in the brain stems from her grandfather when she and her family noticed that his memory was declining.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sherva|first=Kara|date=2015|title=Carol Barnes: A Prominent Voice in the Neuroscience of Aging, and a Proponent of Women in Neuroscience|url=https://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=soundneuroscience|journal=Sound Neuroscience: An Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, Barnes is included in the [https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=547 Neuroscience Academic Family Tree] .

Barnes research spans 4 decades aiming to better understand the aging of the brain in relation to cognitive diseases. Her research is conducted by utilizing animal models such as primates and rats to explore and understand how memory is impacted in the normal aging process of the brain through means of neurobiological mechanisms that are involved. The use of animal models in Barnes research is translated into treatments used for abnormal functioning of the brain aimed at prolonging the cognitive lifespan of older individuals. The nature of Barnes research entails the use of behavioral, anatomical, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and molecular techniques\u00a0 to further examine the implications of normal aging on the brain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychology.arizona.edu/users/carol-barnes|title=Carol Barnes {{!}} Department of Psychology|website=psychology.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Most areas of her research involves examining and observing the [[hippocampus]] structure in the brains of rats and monkeys, observing and recording\u00a0synaptic transmission in cell to cell signaling, and genomic sequencing.\n\n=== [[Barnes maze|Barnes Maze]] ===\nTo study spatial learning and memory, Carol Barnes created her own maze to test whether rodents, specifically mice, could remember the location of an escape box on a platform. This test has become a standard method of memory testing in laboratories. Designed in 1979, Barnes' maze was an alternative to study memory without the use of external reward or punishment, while also reducing the stress put on the animal throughout the process.\n[[File:Barnes_maze.jpg|thumb|The Barnes maze]]\nThe original study consisted of a platform (122&nbsp;cm diameter) raised 91&nbsp;cm above the floor with 18 circular holes (9.5&nbsp;cm diameters) spaced evenly around the perimeter. Under one of the holes is a black escape box, or any dark color in contrast to the color of the platform; the rest of the holes lead to false escape boxes. The study consisted of 3 variations of the experiment. First, the mouse simply had to find the escape chamber that was placed under one of the holes. Second, the escape chamber was moved to a hole rotated 120-140 degrees from the original hole; the original hole was covered. Third, the same method as the second variation was used except the original hole was not covered. Barnes and her team found that overall, male mice performed better in all variations of the experiment. Further, they found younger mice also performed better in all variations, while older mice demonstrated notable difficulties in variations 2 and 3. This showed aging impairment in [[spatial memory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawel|first=Kinga|last2=Gibula|first2=Ewa|last3=Marszalek-Grabska|first3=Marta|last4=Filarowska|first4=Joanna|last5=Kotlinska|first5=Jolanta H.|date=2019-01-01|title=Assessment of spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in rodents\u2014methodological consideration|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=392|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|issn=1432-1912|pmc=6311199|pmid=30470917}}</ref>\n[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]\nSpatial memory corresponds to the functioning of the [[hippocampus]], while route learning involves the [[Striatum|striatal]] systems. Overall, rodents of various ages learned T-mazes within the same number of trials, but the strategies used to learn and remember mazes differed with age. Young rats predominately utilized \u201cplace\u201d strategies which rely upon [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] functioning, while older rats relied upon \u201cresponse\u201d strategies. Using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] imaging techniques, Barnes and her team were able to see that in normally aged brains of rodents, the size of the [[hippocampus]] did not change while the volume of [[Grey matter|cortical grey matter]] did. This animal model allowed an understanding of what the brain looks like during normal human functioning to compare it to brains that have been degenerated due to [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer\u2019s disease]] (rodents do not exhibit AD). These findings demonstrate that while during normal aging the [[hippocampus]] remains the same size, its function may decrease in comparison to functions of other areas of the brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samson|first=Rachel D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2013|title=Impact of Aging Brain Circuits on Cognition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694726/|journal=The European journal of neuroscience|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1903\u20131915|doi=10.1111/ejn.12183|issn=0953-816X|pmc=3694726|pmid=23773059|via=}}</ref>\n\nLooking deeper into the tissue affected, single-cell imaging showed there were 3 main types of cells that make up the [[hippocampus]]. When observing cell activity and the number of cells of the hippocampus of rats, it was found that the [[CA1 neuron|CA1]] and [[CA3 region|CA3]] [[pyramidal cell]]s continued to be active and of the same volume. However, the number of [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]] continuously decreased with age; the function of these cells also declined leading Carol and her team to conclude these gyrus cells are the weak link of the hippocampal circuit involved in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Carol A.|date=2011-10-03|title=Secrets of aging: What does a normally aging brain look like?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186042/|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=3|doi=10.3410/B3-22|issn=1757-594X|pmc=3186042|pmid=22003369}}</ref>\n\nA few of Barnes\u2019s latest research publication was published in 2017 are:\u00a0 \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281630420X Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in the macaque monkeys]\u201d, \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174334 Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus]\u201d, and \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305615 The aging navigational system]\u201d.\n\n=== Primate Research ===\n[[File:Brain_regions_involved_in_memory_formation.jpg|thumb|Brain regions involved in memory formation]]\nIn addition to work on rodent models, Dr. Barnes has helped advance the field of normative aging research using nonhuman primate models, specifically [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]].\u00a0 Primarily, Barnes\u2019 early work in macaques helped to tie together neurobiological data collected from rodents and functional imaging data from older humans. In the paper \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848213/ Memory impairment in aged primates is associated with region-specific network dysfunction]\u201d Barnes and her team showed that older monkeys had significant impairment on object recognition. In addition, older monkeys displayed a lower density of inhibitory somatostatin positive [[interneuron]]s in the [[CA3 region|CA3]] sub-region of the [[hippocampus]]. These [[interneuron]]s are responsible for regulating the activity of excitatory neurons in the [[hippocampus]]. With less [[interneuron]] density, the baseline firing rate of [[CA3 region|CA3]] excitatory neurons was elevated. This finding relates to the increased hippocampal activity shown in imaging studies of older human adults. Both a decrease in [[interneuron]] density and increase baseline firing rates in the [[hippocampus]] have been associated with poor cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2019-12-26|title=Experiments in macaque monkeys provide critical insights into age-associated changes in cognitive and sensory function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936691/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=116|issue=52|pages=26247\u201326254|doi=10.1073/pnas.1902279116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6936691|pmid=31871147}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the paper \u201cEvidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus\u201d Dr. Barnes and her team found evidence that all mammals require the same quantity of neurons in the hippocampus to encode memory of a single experience. This finding suggests that tall mammals use a stable amount of neurons to encode a similar virtual reality experience. However, due to variable hippocampus size, the proportion of neurons used for the encoding of experience differ. Rodents have the smallest [[hippocampus]] and thus use 40% of their [[hippocampus]] neurons for encoding, nonhuman primates have larger hippocampus and use 4%, and finally humans have the largest [[hippocampus]] and use an estimated 2.5% for experiential encoding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wixted|first=John T.|last2=Goldinger|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Squire|first3=Larry R.|last4=Kuhn|first4=Joel R.|last5=Papesh|first5=Megan H.|last6=Smith|first6=Kris A.|last7=Treiman|first7=David M.|last8=Steinmetz|first8=Peter N.|date=2018-01-30|title=Coding of episodic memory in the human hippocampus|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1093|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1093\u20131098|doi=10.1073/pnas.1716443115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=29339476|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nDr. Barnes has also done research to see how executive function changes with normative aging. [[Executive functions]] are the higher order process humans take part in such as attention, decision making, impulse control, and emotional control. These functions are mediated by the activity of the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]]. Once again studying [[macaque]]s, Barnes and her team focused on two aspects of executive function, attentional monitoring and updating as well as [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]]. Attentional monitoring and updating allow for behavior changes with corresponding rule changes. For example, when two options are presented one is the correct choice initially; however, when the correct choice changes to the second option, attentional monitoring and updating help correct for the rule change and alter behavior in order to choose correctly. The change in behavior is mediated through a process of trial and error, which helps associate the right choice with certain behaviors. Barnes and her team found that older monkeys needed a greater number of trials to accurately account for a rule change. Suggesting, the executive system behind attentional monitoring and updating is impaired with aging. Secondly, [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]] is the ability to unconsciously shift attention between tasks while maintaining accuracy. In her research, Barnes presented macaque monkeys with an object recognition test of previously learned objects. She then presented interfering objects which required shifts between the object choice and evaluation of novel objects. Her results showed that older monkeys performed better on object recognition with this interference than younger monkeys. Thus set shifting abilities seem to be maintained if not enhanced with aging. The most important discovery out of these studies, however, is that the two aspects of executive function, monitoring and updating and set shifting, were shown to be independent systems that are affected differently with age. Thus, Barnes and her team suggest that changes in the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]] can result from aging but different sub-regions within it show different patterns of aging.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Smith|first2=Anne C.|last3=Burke|first3=Sara N.|last4=Gazzaley|first4=Adam|last5=Barnes|first5=Carol A.|date=2017-03-30|title=Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in macaque monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493156/|journal=Behavioural brain research|volume=322|issue=Pt B|pages=329\u2013338|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.056|issn=0166-4328|pmc=5493156|pmid=27368416}}</ref>\n\nA final research contribution of Carol A Barnes involves the study of spatial networks and spatial memories in aging [[macaque]]s. Barnes and her team studied brain activity in four different conditions for movement: cages, sitting, walking on a treadmill, and freely walking in space. The study found that younger macaques have distinct spatial networks for all four distinct conditions. However, older monkeys displayed less discrete activity of spatial networks. Meaning, all conditions evoked activation of the same undifferentiated network. This finding suggests dynamic network changes as a possible explanation for spatial cognition deficits. In other words, the spatial processing networks become less precise with age and may contribute to spatial memory loss or confusion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engle|first=James R.|last2=Machado|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Permenter|first3=Michele R.|last4=Vogt|first4=Julie A.|last5=Maurer|first5=Andrew P.|last6=Bulleri|first6=Alicia M.|last7=Barnes|first7=Carol A.|date=2016-11-30|title=Network Patterns Associated with Navigation Behaviors Are Altered in Aged Nonhuman Primates|url=https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/48/12217|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=36|issue=48|pages=12217\u201312227|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4116-15.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=27903730|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nBarnes interest of normative aging in the brain stems from her grandfather when she and her family noticed that his memory was declining.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sherva|first=Kara|date=2015|title=Carol Barnes: A Prominent Voice in the Neuroscience of Aging, and a Proponent of Women in Neuroscience|url=https://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=soundneuroscience|journal=Sound Neuroscience: An Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, Barnes is included in the [https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=547 Neuroscience Academic Family Tree] .

It's history dates back to 2nd Century BCE when it was the [[capital]] of [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana Dynasty]] ([[Andhras]]), one of the earliest greatest kings of [[India]] and the [[Ancestor|ancestral]] [[dynasty]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] are most respected and viewed as very prominent and greatest rulers in [[Andhra Pradesh]] [[History of Andhra Pradesh|history]] as they were the reason for the origin of [[Telugu New Year]], [[Ugadi]] from this region. Their language was [[Prakrit]] of [[Brahmi script|Brahmi Script]], which served as the base for the [[script]] of [[Telugu language|Telugu Language]]. They issued many [[Gautamiputra Satakarni|coins]] with this [[Prakrit]] language which can be found in many insciptions in this region today. They even started the [[Shaka Calendar|Satavahana Calendar Era]], The first Indian National Calendar from this region. The city was also once the [[Holy place|holy site]] of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. It was also the center of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Culture of Buddhism|learning]] and [[Buddhist art|art]] which can be seen from the [[Amaravati Stupa]], many [[Inscriptions|Buddhist inscriptions]], [[Sculpture|sculptures]] and [[Dhyana Buddha statue|Gautam Buddha Statue]] in the city. Many other ancient [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati Buddhist Marbels]] and Buddhist [[remains]] from the region were unfortunately destroyed over the time and some of them were exported to Chennai Museum and [[British Museum]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]] which can be seen there today.

The airborne operation was personally ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]], planned and executed by Mors, and approved by General [[Kurt Student]].\n\n== Overview ==\nOn the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombing of Rome]], the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] voted a [[motion of no confidence]] against Mussolini.

He ordered the ''Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Skorzeny]] to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.\n\nMussolini was being secluded around [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] islands by his captors&nbsp;\u2013 first to [[Ponza]], then to [[La Maddalena]], where Skorzeny's men were almost attempting an operation. Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit notes with a face value of \u00a3100,000 forged under [[Operation Bernhard]] were used to help obtain information) of ''SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer'' [[Herbert Kappler]] to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned in [[Gran Sasso]] massif, a remote and defendable mountain plateau, on which was built a [[Hotel Campo Imperatore|hotel]] linked with a [[Aerial lift|cable car]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-567-1503A-05, Gran Sasso, Hotel Campo Imperatore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hotel Campo Imperatore]] in 1943]]\nOn 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten [[DFS 230]] gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by [[Henschel Hs 126]] planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the [[Pratica di Mare Air Base]] near Rome.\n\nThe leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-[[Oberleutnant]] Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, entered the first glider, while Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close-by [[Alban Hills]], the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skorzeny's two units arrived first over the target.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez\">{{cite book|author=\u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez|title=Fallschirmj\u00e4ger at the Gran Sasso|publisher=AF Editores |place=Valladolid |year=2007 |isbn=978-84-96935-00-6}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05, the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; one crashed, causing injuries.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-567-1503C-04, Gran Sasso, Fieseler Fi 156 \u00bbStorch\u00ab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fieseler Fi 156]] used to rescue Mussolini]]\n\nThe ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors\u2014200 well-equipped ''[[Carabinieri]]'' guards\u2014without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General Fernando Soleti of the [[Italian African Police]], who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45, Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini.\n\nSubsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a [[Fieseler Fi 156]] [[STOL]] plane that had arrived in the meanwhile. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted on accompanying Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful take-off, they flew to [[Pratica di Mare Air Base|Pratica di Mare]]. There they continued immediately, flying in a [[Heinkel He 111]] to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the [[Hotel Imperial]]. The next day he was flown to [[Munich]] and on September 14, he met Hitler at [[F\u00fchrer Headquarters]] [[Wolf's Lair]] in near Rastenburg.<ref name=\"Kuby\">[[Erich Kuby]]: ''Verrat auf deutsch.

The airborne operation was personally ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]], planned and executed by Mors, and approved by General [[Kurt Student]].\n\n== Overview ==\nOn the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombing of Rome]], the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] voted a [[motion of no confidence]] against Mussolini. On the same day, [[Victor Emmanuel III|the king]] replaced him with Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]]<ref name=\"fital\">{{cite book | last= Whittam| first= John |title =Fascist Italy| publisher= [[Manchester University Press]]| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hHgMm6APG_0C&dq=%22Vatican+Radio%22+%22Radio+London%22+fascist&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0 | isbn= 0-7190-4004-3 | year= 2005}}</ref> and had him arrested.<ref name=\"prisonrescue\">{{cite book |last= Annussek |first=Greg |title=Hitler's Raid to Save Mussolini |publisher=Da Capo Press |url= https://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Raid-Save-Mussolini-Operation/dp/0306813963|isbn=978-0-306-81396-2 |year=2005}}</ref>\n\nHitler's common procedure was to give similar orders to competing German military organizations. He ordered the ''Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Skorzeny]] to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.\n\nMussolini was being secluded around [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] islands by his captors&nbsp;\u2013 first to [[Ponza]], then to [[La Maddalena]], where Skorzeny's men were almost attempting an operation. Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit notes with a face value of \u00a3100,000 forged under [[Operation Bernhard]] were used to help obtain information) of ''SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer'' [[Herbert Kappler]] to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned in [[Gran Sasso]] massif, a remote and defendable mountain plateau, in which was build a [[Hotel Campo Imperatore|hotel]] linked with a [[Aerial lift|cable car]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-567-1503A-05, Gran Sasso, Hotel Campo Imperatore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hotel Campo Imperatore]] in 1943]]\nOn 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten [[DFS 230]] gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by [[Henschel Hs 126]] planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the [[Pratica di Mare Air Base]] near Rome.\n\nThe leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-[[Oberleutnant]] Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, entered the first glider, while Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close-by [[Alban Hills]], the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skorzeny's two units arrived first over the target.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez\">{{cite book|author=\u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez|title=Fallschirmj\u00e4ger at the Gran Sasso|publisher=AF Editores |place=Valladolid |year=2007 |isbn=978-84-96935-00-6}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05, the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; one crashed, causing injuries.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-567-1503C-04, Gran Sasso, Fieseler Fi 156 \u00bbStorch\u00ab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fieseler Fi 156]] used to rescue Mussolini]]\n\nThe ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors\u2014200 well-equipped ''[[Carabinieri]]'' guards\u2014without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General Fernando Soleti of the [[Italian African Police]], who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45, Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini.\n\nSubsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a [[Fieseler Fi 156]] [[STOL]] plane that had arrived in the meanwhile. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted on accompanying Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful take-off, they flew to [[Pratica di Mare Air Base|Pratica di Mare]]. There they continued immediately, flying in a [[Heinkel He 111]] to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the [[Hotel Imperial]]. The next day he was flown to [[Munich]] and on September 14, he met Hitler at [[F\u00fchrer Headquarters]] [[Wolf's Lair]] in near Rastenburg.<ref name=\"Kuby\">[[Erich Kuby]]: ''Verrat auf deutsch.

While it is independent, it has usually supported the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. From 2009 to 2018, it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' in late 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n''Tribune'' was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] and [[George Strauss]], to back the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)#The Unity Campaign|Unity Campaign]], an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement [[United Front]] between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left.<ref name=redpepper-20181223>{{cite news |url=https://www.redpepper.org.uk/critical-tradition-tribune-then-and-now/ |title=Critical tradition: Tribune then and now |last=Wainwright |first=Hilary |website=red pepper |date=23 December 2018 |access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref> The latter included Cripps's (Labour-affiliated) [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB).\n\nThe paper's first editor was [[William Mellor (journalist)|William Mellor]]. Among its journalists were [[Michael Foot]] and Barbara Betts (later [[Barbara Castle]]), while the board included the Labour MPs [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Ellen Wilkinson]], [[Harold Laski]] of the [[Left Book Club]] and the veteran left-wing journalist and former ILP member [[H. N. Brailsford]].\n\nMellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CPGB policy\u2014supported by Cripps\u2014of backing a [[Popular Front]], including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by H. J. Hartshorn, a secret member of the CPGBP. Meanwhile [[Victor Gollancz]], the Left Book Club's publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.\n\n===1940s===\nWith the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]] and the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, ''Tribune'' initially adopted the CPGB's position of denouncing the British and French declarations of war on Germany as imperialist. After the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn's unrelenting [[Stalinism]]. Strauss fired Hartshorn in February 1940, replacing him as editor with [[Raymond Postgate]]. Under Postgate's editorship, the Soviet [[fellow travellers]] at ''Tribune'' were either dismissed, or in Postgate's words, \"left soon after in dislike of me\".<ref>Bill Jones, ''The Russia Complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977,  {{ISBN|0719006961}}), pp. 48-49</ref> From then on, the paper became the voice of the pro-war democratic left in the Labour Party, taking a position similar to that adopted by Gollancz in the volume ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' he edited attacking the communists for backing the Nazi-Soviet pact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n[[Image:Tribune flier 1941.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Early 1941 ''Tribune'' flier]]\nBevan ousted Postgate after a series of personality clashes in 1941, assuming the role of editor himself, although the day-to-day running of the paper was done by [[Jon Kimche]]. The Bevan-Kimche ''Tribune'' is revered as one of the greatest left-wing papers in British history{{By whom|date=April 2020}}. It campaigned vigorously for the opening of a second front against [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany, was consistently critical of the [[Winston Churchill]] government's failings, and argued that only a democratic socialist post-war settlement in Britain and Europe as a whole was viable.\n\n[[George Orwell]] was hired in 1943 as literary editor. In this role, as well as commissioning and writing reviews, he wrote a series of columns, most of them under the title \"[[As I Please]]\", that have become touchstones of the opinion journalist's craft. Orwell left the ''Tribune'' staff in early 1945 to become a war correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]'', to be replaced as literary editor by his friend [[Tosco Fyvel]], but he remained a regular contributor until March 1947.\n\nOrwell's most famous contributions to ''Tribune'' as a columnist include \"You and the atom bomb\", \"The sporting spirit\", \"Books v cigarettes\", \"[[Decline of the English Murder]]\" and \"[[Some Thoughts on the Common Toad]]\", all of which have since appeared in dozens of anthologies.\n\nOther writers who contributed to ''Tribune'' in the 1940s include [[Naomi Mitchison]], [[Stevie Smith]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]], [[Julian Symons]], [[Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)|Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], Daniel George, [[Inez Holden]], and [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Lizabeth |last=Paravisini-Gebert |title=Phyllis Shand Allfrey: A Caribbean Life |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-8135-2265-X |page=61 }}</ref>\n\nKimche left ''Tribune'' to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by [[Frederic Mullally]]. After the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|Labour landslide election victory of 1945]], Bevan joined [[Clement Attlee]]'s government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and [[Evelyn Anderson]] as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, ''Tribune'' was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally's departure to the [[Sunday Pictorial]]) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\n\nIn the first few years of the Attlee administration, ''Tribune'' became the focus for the Labour left's attempts to persuade [[Ernest Bevin]], the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a \"third force\" democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the United States and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'' (which was published by the rival ''[[New Statesman]]'').\n\nAfter the Soviet rejection of [[Marshall Aid]] and the communist takeover of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948, ''Tribune'' endorsed the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and took a strongly anti-communist line, with its editor declaring in November 1948: \"The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy. It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another\".\n\n=== Bevanism and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ===\nFoot remained in the editorial chair until 1952 when [[Bob Edwards (British journalist)|Bob Edwards]] took over, but he returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, ''Tribune'' became the organ of the [[Bevanite]] left opposition to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership, turning against the United States over its handling of the Korean War, then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. However, ''Tribune'' remained critical of the Soviet Union as it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953 and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the British government's [[Suez]] adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his \"naked into the conference chamber\" speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference. For the next five years, ''Tribune'' was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, \"the official weekly of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\" (CND) as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND's general secretary [[Peggy Duff]] had been ''Tribune'' general manager. Among journalists on ''Tribune'' in the 1950s were [[Richard Clements (journalist)|Richard Clements]], [[Ian Aitken (journalist)|Ian Aitken]] and [[Mervyn Jones (UK journalist)|Mervyn Jones]], who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography ''Chances''.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nAfter Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan's old seat of [[Ebbw Vale]], Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nAs such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964\u2014\"Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet\", exclaimed a headline\u2014the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government's timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the [[European Communities]] (EC) and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the [[Vietnam War]]. It also backed the unions' campaigns against the government's prices-and-incomes policies and against ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', Barbara Castle's 1969 package of trade union law reforms.\n\nThe paper continued in the same vein after [[Edward Heath]] won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government's trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath's negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, ''Tribune'' played a central part in the \"no\" campaign in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum on British EEC membership]].\n\nHowever, ''Tribune'' in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper's reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but it was in fact much less.\n\n===Brief support of Tony Benn===\nClements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot (by now Labour leader), a role he continued under Foot's successor as Labour leader, [[Neil Kinnock]]. Clements was succeeded in the ''Tribune'' chair by [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]], who steered the paper into supporting [[Tony Benn]] (then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left) and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them [[John Silkin]] and [[Donald Bruce, Baron Bruce of Donington|Donald Bruce]], who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.<ref>For a detailed account of the Silkin takeover attempt, see articles by Chris Mullin, New Statesman, January 11 and 18, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Paper of the soft left===\nMullin left in 1984, with circulation at around 6,000, a level it roughly remained for the next ten years). He was replaced by his equally Bennite protege [[Nigel Williamson (UK journalist)|Nigel Williamson]], who surprised everyone by arguing for a realignment of the left and took the paper into the [[soft left]] camp, supporting Kinnock, a long-time ''Tribune'' contributor and onetime board member, as Labour leader against the Bennites. The next two editors [[Phil Kelly (UK journalist)|Phil Kelly]] and [[Paul Anderson (UK journalist)|Paul Anderson]] took much the same line, although both clashed with Kinnock, particularly over his decision to abandon Labour's non-nuclear defence policy.\n\nUnder Kelly, ''Tribune'' supported [[John Prescott]]'s challenge to [[Roy Hattersley]] as Labour Deputy leader in 1988 and came close to going bust, a fate averted by an emergency appeal launched by a front page exclaiming \"Don't let this be the last issue of ''Tribune''\". Under Anderson, the paper took a strongly pro-European stance, supported electoral reform and argued for military intervention against Serbian aggression in Croatia and Bosnia. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, ''Tribune'' acted as a clearing house for arguments inside the Labour Party, with contributions from all major players.\n\n===Back to basics===\nFrom 1993, [[Mark Seddon (UK journalist)|Mark Seddon]] shifted ''Tribune'' several degrees back to the left, particularly after [[Tony Blair]] became Labour leader in 1994. The paper strongly opposed Blair's abandonment of [[Clause Four]] of the Labour Party constitution and resisted his rebranding of the party as New Labour.\n\nAfter Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], the paper maintained an oppositionist stance, objecting to the Blair government's military interventions and its reliance on spin-doctors. In 2001, ''Tribune'' opposed the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States-led invasion of Afghanistan]] and it was outspoken against the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The paper under Seddon also reverted to an anti-European position very similar to that it adopted in the 1970s and early 1980s and campaigned for Gordon Brown to replace Blair as Labour Leader and Prime Minister.\n\n''Tribune'' changed format from newspaper to magazine in 2001, but remained plagued by financial uncertainty, coming close to folding again in 2002. However, Seddon and Chairman of Tribune Publications, the Labour MP [[Peter Kilfoyle]] led a team of pro-bono advisers who organised a rescue package with a consortium of trade unions ([[UNISON|Unison]], [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]], [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|Aslef]],<ref name=\"Plunkett\">John Plunkett, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/09/pressandpublishing \"Tribune set to close by November\"], ''The Guardian'', 9 October 2008.

While it is independent, it has usually supported the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. From 2009 to 2018, it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' in late 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n''Tribune'' was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] and [[George Strauss]], to back the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)#The Unity Campaign|Unity Campaign]], an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement [[United Front]] between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left. The latter included Cripps's (Labour-affiliated) [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB).\n\nThe paper's first editor was [[William Mellor (journalist)|William Mellor]]. Among its journalists were [[Michael Foot]] and Barbara Betts (later [[Barbara Castle]]), while the board included the Labour MPs [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Ellen Wilkinson]], [[Harold Laski]] of the [[Left Book Club]] and the veteran left-wing journalist and former ILP member [[H. N. Brailsford]].\n\nMellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CPGB policy\u2014supported by Cripps\u2014of backing a [[Popular Front]], including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by H. J. Hartshorn, a secret member of the CPGBP. Meanwhile [[Victor Gollancz]], the Left Book Club's publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.\n\n===1940s===\nWith the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]] and the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, ''Tribune'' initially adopted the CPGB's position of denouncing the British and French declarations of war on Germany as imperialist. After the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn's unrelenting [[Stalinism]]. Strauss fired Hartshorn in February 1940, replacing him as editor with [[Raymond Postgate]]. Under Postgate's editorship, the Soviet [[fellow travellers]] at ''Tribune'' were either dismissed, or in Postgate's words, \"left soon after in dislike of me\".<ref>Bill Jones, ''The Russia Complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977,  {{ISBN|0719006961}}), pp. 48-49</ref> From then on, the paper became the voice of the pro-war democratic left in the Labour Party, taking a position similar to that adopted by Gollancz in the volume ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' he edited attacking the communists for backing the Nazi-Soviet pact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n[[Image:Tribune flier 1941.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Early 1941 ''Tribune'' flier]]\nBevan ousted Postgate after a series of personality clashes in 1941, assuming the role of editor himself, although the day-to-day running of the paper was done by [[Jon Kimche]]. The Bevan-Kimche ''Tribune'' is revered as one of the greatest left-wing papers in British history{{By whom|date=April 2020}}. It campaigned vigorously for the opening of a second front against [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany, was consistently critical of the [[Winston Churchill]] government's failings, and argued that only a democratic socialist post-war settlement in Britain and Europe as a whole was viable.\n\n[[George Orwell]] was hired in 1943 as literary editor. In this role, as well as commissioning and writing reviews, he wrote a series of columns, most of them under the title \"[[As I Please]]\", that have become touchstones of the opinion journalist's craft. Orwell left the ''Tribune'' staff in early 1945 to become a war correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]'', to be replaced as literary editor by his friend [[Tosco Fyvel]], but he remained a regular contributor until March 1947.\n\nOrwell's most famous contributions to ''Tribune'' as a columnist include \"You and the atom bomb\", \"The sporting spirit\", \"Books v cigarettes\", \"[[Decline of the English Murder]]\" and \"[[Some Thoughts on the Common Toad]]\", all of which have since appeared in dozens of anthologies.\n\nOther writers who contributed to ''Tribune'' in the 1940s include [[Naomi Mitchison]], [[Stevie Smith]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]], [[Julian Symons]], [[Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)|Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], Daniel George, [[Inez Holden]], and [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Lizabeth |last=Paravisini-Gebert |title=Phyllis Shand Allfrey: A Caribbean Life |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-8135-2265-X |page=61 }}</ref>\n\nKimche left ''Tribune'' to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by [[Frederic Mullally]]. After the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|Labour landslide election victory of 1945]], Bevan joined [[Clement Attlee]]'s government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and [[Evelyn Anderson]] as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, ''Tribune'' was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally's departure to the [[Sunday Pictorial]]) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\n\nIn the first few years of the Attlee administration, ''Tribune'' became the focus for the Labour left's attempts to persuade [[Ernest Bevin]], the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a \"third force\" democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the United States and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'' (which was published by the rival ''[[New Statesman]]'').\n\nAfter the Soviet rejection of [[Marshall Aid]] and the communist takeover of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948, ''Tribune'' endorsed the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and took a strongly anti-communist line, with its editor declaring in November 1948: \"The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy. It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another\".\n\n=== Bevanism and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ===\nFoot remained in the editorial chair until 1952 when [[Bob Edwards (British journalist)|Bob Edwards]] took over, but he returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, ''Tribune'' became the organ of the [[Bevanite]] left opposition to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership, turning against the United States over its handling of the Korean War, then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. However, ''Tribune'' remained critical of the Soviet Union as it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953 and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the British government's [[Suez]] adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his \"naked into the conference chamber\" speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference. For the next five years, ''Tribune'' was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, \"the official weekly of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\" (CND) as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND's general secretary [[Peggy Duff]] had been ''Tribune'' general manager. Among journalists on ''Tribune'' in the 1950s were [[Richard Clements (journalist)|Richard Clements]], [[Ian Aitken (journalist)|Ian Aitken]] and [[Mervyn Jones (UK journalist)|Mervyn Jones]], who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography ''Chances''.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nAfter Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan's old seat of [[Ebbw Vale]], Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nAs such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964\u2014\"Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet\", exclaimed a headline\u2014the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government's timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the [[European Communities]] (EC) and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the [[Vietnam War]]. It also backed the unions' campaigns against the government's prices-and-incomes policies and against ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', Barbara Castle's 1969 package of trade union law reforms.\n\nThe paper continued in the same vein after [[Edward Heath]] won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government's trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath's negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, ''Tribune'' played a central part in the \"no\" campaign in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum on British EEC membership]].\n\nHowever, ''Tribune'' in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper's reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but it was in fact much less.\n\n===Brief support of Tony Benn===\nClements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot (by now Labour leader), a role he continued under Foot's successor as Labour leader, [[Neil Kinnock]]. Clements was succeeded in the ''Tribune'' chair by [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]], who steered the paper into supporting [[Tony Benn]] (then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left) and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them [[John Silkin]] and [[Donald Bruce, Baron Bruce of Donington|Donald Bruce]], who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.<ref>For a detailed account of the Silkin takeover attempt, see articles by Chris Mullin, New Statesman, January 11 and 18, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Paper of the soft left===\nMullin left in 1984, with circulation at around 6,000, a level it roughly remained for the next ten years). He was replaced by his equally Bennite protege [[Nigel Williamson (UK journalist)|Nigel Williamson]], who surprised everyone by arguing for a realignment of the left and took the paper into the [[soft left]] camp, supporting Kinnock, a long-time ''Tribune'' contributor and onetime board member, as Labour leader against the Bennites. The next two editors [[Phil Kelly (UK journalist)|Phil Kelly]] and [[Paul Anderson (UK journalist)|Paul Anderson]] took much the same line, although both clashed with Kinnock, particularly over his decision to abandon Labour's non-nuclear defence policy.\n\nUnder Kelly, ''Tribune'' supported [[John Prescott]]'s challenge to [[Roy Hattersley]] as Labour Deputy leader in 1988 and came close to going bust, a fate averted by an emergency appeal launched by a front page exclaiming \"Don't let this be the last issue of ''Tribune''\". Under Anderson, the paper took a strongly pro-European stance, supported electoral reform and argued for military intervention against Serbian aggression in Croatia and Bosnia. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, ''Tribune'' acted as a clearing house for arguments inside the Labour Party, with contributions from all major players.\n\n===Back to basics===\nFrom 1993, [[Mark Seddon (UK journalist)|Mark Seddon]] shifted ''Tribune'' several degrees back to the left, particularly after [[Tony Blair]] became Labour leader in 1994. The paper strongly opposed Blair's abandonment of [[Clause Four]] of the Labour Party constitution and resisted his rebranding of the party as New Labour.\n\nAfter Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], the paper maintained an oppositionist stance, objecting to the Blair government's military interventions and its reliance on spin-doctors. In 2001, ''Tribune'' opposed the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States-led invasion of Afghanistan]] and it was outspoken against the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The paper under Seddon also reverted to an anti-European position very similar to that it adopted in the 1970s and early 1980s and campaigned for Gordon Brown to replace Blair as Labour Leader and Prime Minister.\n\n''Tribune'' changed format from newspaper to magazine in 2001, but remained plagued by financial uncertainty, coming close to folding again in 2002. However, Seddon and Chairman of Tribune Publications, the Labour MP [[Peter Kilfoyle]] led a team of pro-bono advisers who organised a rescue package with a consortium of trade unions ([[UNISON|Unison]], [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]], [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|Aslef]],<ref name=\"Plunkett\">John Plunkett, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/09/pressandpublishing \"Tribune set to close by November\"], ''The Guardian'', 9 October 2008.

Seddon resigned as editor in summer 2004 and was succeeded by [[Chris McLaughlin (UK journalist)|Chris McLaughlin]], former political editor of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]''.\n\nDuring 2007, ''Tribune'' spawned two offshoot websites, a Tribune Cartoons blog, put together by cartoonists who draw for the magazine; and a ''Tribune'' History blog.\n\nIn September 2008, the magazine's future was again in doubt thanks to problems with its trade union funding.

During the 1980s, the Tribune Group was the Labour soft left's political caucus, but its closeness to the leadership of [[Neil Kinnock]] meant that it had lost any real ''raison d'etre'' by the early 1990s.
