The \"new\" classification criteria, jointly published by the [[American College of Rheumatology]] (ACR) and the [[European League Against Rheumatism]] (EULAR) establish a point value between 0 and 10. Four areas are covered in the diagnosis:<ref name=acr-eular/>\n* joint involvement, designating the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s, [[proximal interphalangeal joint]]s, the [[interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal joint]] of the thumb, second through fifth [[metatarsophalangeal joint]] and [[wrist]] as ''small joints'', and [[shoulder]]s, [[elbow]]s, [[hip joint]]s, [[knee]]s, and [[ankle]]s as ''large joints'':\n** Involvement of 1 large joint gives 0 points\n** Involvement of 2\u201310 large joints gives 1 point\n** Involvement of 1\u20133 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) gives 2 points\n** Involvement of 4\u201310 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) gives 3 points\n** Involvement of more than 10 joints (with involvement of at least 1 small joint) gives 5 points\n* serological parameters \u2013 including the [[rheumatoid factor]] as well as [[anti-citrullinated protein antibody|ACPA]] \u2013 \"ACPA\" stands for \"anti-citrullinated protein antibody\":\n** Negative RF ''and'' negative ACPA gives 0 points\n** Low-positive RF ''or'' low-positive ACPA gives 2 points\n** High-positive RF ''or'' high-positive ACPA gives 3 points\n* acute phase reactants: 1 point for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]], or elevated [[C-reactive protein|CRP]] value (c-reactive protein)\n* duration of [[arthritis]]: 1 point for symptoms lasting six weeks or longer\n\nThe new criteria accommodate to the growing understanding of RA and the improvements in diagnosing RA and disease treatment.

When looking at these joints, both the number of joints with tenderness upon touching (TEN28) and swelling (SW28) are counted. The [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) is measured and the affected person makes a subjective assessment (SA) of disease activity during the preceding 7 days on a scale between 0 and 100, where 0 is \"no activity\" and 100 is \"highest activity possible\".

Joints become swollen, tender and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected ([[polyarthritis]]).

Increased stiffness early in the morning is often a prominent feature of the disease and typically lasts for more than an hour. Gentle movements may relieve symptoms in early stages of the disease. These signs help distinguish rheumatoid from non-inflammatory problems of the joints, such as [[osteoarthritis]].

Joints included are ([[bilateral symmetry|bilaterally]]): [[proximal interphalangeal joint]]s (10 joints), [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s (10), [[wrist]]s (2), [[elbow]]s (2), [[shoulder]]s (2) and [[knee]]s (2). When looking at these joints, both the number of joints with tenderness upon touching (TEN28) and swelling (SW28) are counted. The [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) is measured and the affected person makes a subjective assessment (SA) of disease activity during the preceding 7 days on a scale between 0 and 100, where 0 is \"no activity\" and 100 is \"highest activity possible\". With these parameters, DAS28 is calculated as:<ref name=Prevoo1995/>\n<math>DAS28=0.56 \\times \\sqrt{TEN28} + 0.28 \\times \\sqrt{SW28} + 0.70 \\times \\ln(ESR) + 0.014 \\times SA</math>\n\nFrom this, the disease activity of the affected person can be classified as follows:<ref name=Prevoo1995>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prevoo ML, van 't Hof MA, Kuper HH, van Leeuwen MA, van de Putte LB, van Riel PL | title = Modified disease activity scores that include twenty-eight-joint counts.

{"title_page": "Transformation in economics", "text_new": "{{For|transformation in [[development economics]]|economic transformation}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2019}}\n{{original research|date=June 2019}}\n}}\n\n'''Transformation in economics''' refers to a long-term change in dominant economic activity in terms of prevailing relative engagement or employment of able individuals.\n\nHuman economic systems undergo a number of deviations and departures from the \"normal\" state, trend or development. Among them are Disturbance (short-term disruption, temporary disorder), Perturbation (persistent or repeated divergence, predicament, decline or crisis), Deformation (damage, regime change, loss of self-sustainability, distortion), Transformation (long-term change, restructuring, conversion, new \u201cnormal\u201d) and Renewal (rebirth, transmutation, corso-ricorso, renaissance, new beginning).\n\nTransformation is a [[Unidirectional network|unidirectional]] and irreversible change in dominant human economic activity ([[Economic sectors|economic sector]]). Such change is driven by slower or faster continuous improvement in sector productivity growth rate. Productivity growth itself is fueled by advances in technology, inflow of useful innovations, accumulated practical knowledge and experience, levels of education, viability of institutions, quality of decision making and organized human effort. Individual sector transformations are the outcomes of human [[socio-economic]] evolution.\n\nHuman economic activity has so far undergone at least two fundamental transformations, as the leading sector has changed:\n\n#[[Neolithic Revolution|From nomadic hunting and gathering (H/G) to agriculture (A)]]\n#[[Industrial Revolution|From agriculture (A) to industry (I)]]\n\nBeyond industry there is no clear pattern now.  Some may argue that service sectors (particularly finance) have eclipsed industry, but the evidence is inconclusive and industrial productivity growth remains the main driver of overall economic growth in most national economies.\n\nThis evolution naturally proceeds from securing necessary food, through producing useful things, to providing helpful services, both private and public.  Accelerating productivity growth rates speed up the transformations, from millennia, through centuries, to decades of the recent era. It is this acceleration which makes transformation relevant economic category of today, more fundamental in its impact than any recession, crisis or depression. The evolution of four forms of capital (Indicated in Fig. 1) accompanies all economic transformations.\n\nTransformation is quite different from accompanying cyclical recessions and crises, despite the similarity of manifested phenomena (unemployment, technology shifts, socio-political discontent, bankruptcies, etc.). However, the tools and interventions used to combat crisis are clearly ineffective for coping with non-cyclical transformations. The problem is whether we face a mere crisis or a fundamental transformation (globalization\u2192relocalization).\n\n== Four key forms of capital ==\n[[File:Fig1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital.PNG|thumb|Fig. 1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital|287x287px]]\n\nFig. 1 refers to the four transformations through the parallel (and overlapping) evolution of four forms of capital: Natural\u2192Built\u2192Human\u2192Social. These evolved forms of capital present a minimal complex of sustainability and self-sustainability of pre-human and human systems.\n\n'''[[Natural capital|Natural capital (N)]]'''. The nature-produced, renewed and reproduced \u201cresources\u201d of land, water, air, raw materials, biomass and organisms. Natural capital is subject to both renewable and non-renewable depletion, degradation, cultivation, recycling and reuse.\n\n'''Built capital (B)'''. The man-made physical assets of infrastructures, technologies, buildings and means of transportation. This is the manufactured \u201chardware\u201d of nations. This national hardware must be continually maintained, renewed and modernized to assure its continued productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n'''[[Human capital|Human capital (H)]]'''. The continued investment in people's skills, knowledge, education, health & nutrition, abilities, motivation and effort. This is the \u201csoftware\u201d and \u201cbrainware\u201d of a nation; most important form of capital for developing nations.\n\n'''[[Social capital|Social capital (S)]]'''. The enabling infrastructure of institutions, civic communities, cultural and national cohesion, collective and family values, trust, traditions, respect and the sense of belonging. This is the voluntary, spontaneous \u201csocial order\u201d which cannot be engineered, but its self-production (autopoiesis) can be nurtured, supported and cultivated.\n\n== Parallelism of crises and transformations ==\nThe triggers that induce the catharsis of a crisis often coincide with and are undistinguishable from the triggers launching qualitative transformations of the economy, business and society at large. While crises are cyclical recessions or slowdowns within the same paradigm, transformation represents a paradigmatic change in the way of doing business: moving towards new standards and quality, in a unique and non-recursive way.  Most developed and mature economies of the world (USA, Japan, Western Europe) are undergoing long-term transformation towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d of doing business, state governance and ways of life. Cyclical crisis is a parallel, accompanying phenomenon, subject to different causes, special rules and separate dynamics.\n\n[[Milan Zeleny]] cautions that confounding crisis and transformation as one phenomenon brings forth the confusion, inconsistency and guessing.<ref name=\"Crisis\">{{cite journal | url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/d54282m4176x844n/ | title=Machine/organism dichotomy and free-market economics: Crisis or transformation? | publisher=IOS Press | author=Zeleny, Milan | journal=Human Systems Management |date=November 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4/2010 | pages=P191\u2013204}}</ref> While many changes in the market system are cyclical, there are also evolutionary changes which are unidirectional and qualitatively transformational. The transformations of the US economy from agricultural to industrial, or from industrial to services, were not crises, although there were cyclical crises along the way. Transformational \u201closses\u201d cannot be recovered or regained by definition. Not understanding that is at the core of wasteful spending of rigidly hopeless governmental interventions. Barry Bosworth of the [[Brookings Institution]] confirms:  \u201cThe assumption has always been that the U.S. economy will gain back what was lost in a recession. Academics are coming to the realization that this time is different and that those losses appear permanent and cannot be regained.\u201d<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/u-dot-s-dot-potential-gdp-revised-downward-as-recession-damage-lingers | title=The GDP in 2017 Is Not Looking Good | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=March 2014 | author=Brendan Greeley}}</ref>   In transformations there are no \u201closses\u201d, only changes and transitions to a new economic order.\n\n== Underlying pattern of recessions ==\n[[File:Percent Job Losses After WWII Recessions.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. Comparison of major US recessions over past 30 years|452x452px]]\n\nWhen comparing major US recessions since 1980, as in Fig. 2, it is clear that they have been getting deeper and longer in terms of the recovery of initial employment level. Only the first is classical V shape, there are several W, U and finally L shapes. There clearly is an underlying causal phenomenon which is getting stronger and more persistent over time. Such underlying causation is of interest, as it may signal the prelude and gathering of forces of another emerging transformation.\n\nLooking back, even [[Great Depression in the United States|the Great Depression]] of the 1930s was not just a crisis, but a long-term transformation from the pre-war industrial economy to the post-war service economy in the U.S. However, in the early 1980s, the service sector had started slowing down its employment absorption and growth potential, ultimately leading to the jobless economy of 2011. No such comparisons with the 1930s are useful: one can compare recessions but not transformations. Industrial economy of 1930s and the post-service economy of 2000s are two different \u201canimals\u201d in two different contexts. It is still not clear what kind of transformation is emerging and eventually replaces the service and public sector economy.\n\nThe unrecognized confluence of crisis and transformation, and the inability to separate them, lies at the core of old tools ([[Keynesian economics|keynesianism]], [[monetarism]]) not working properly. The tools for adapting successfully to paradigmatic transformation have not been developed.  An example of a paradigmatic transformation would be the shift from geocentric to heliocentric view of our world.  Within both views there can be any number of crises, cyclical failures of old and searches for new theories and practices. But there was only one transformation, from geocentric to heliocentric, and there was nothing cyclical about it. It was resisted with all the might of the mighty: remember Galilei and Bruno. While crises are cyclical corrections and adjustments, transformations are evolutionary shifts or even revolutions (industrial, computer) towards new and different levels of existence.\n\nThe most important indicator is the arena of employment, especially in the US, providing clues to transformational qualities of the current global crisis phenomena. Persistent rates of unemployment, combined with falling workforce participation rate indicate that also this crisis is intertwined with underlying transformation and so it displays atypical dynamics and unusual persistence, presenting new challenges to conventional economic thought, business practices and government interventional \u201ctoolbox\u201d. Sector evolution and dynamics is the key to explaining these phenomena.\n\n== Sector dynamics ==\n[[Economic sectors]] evolve (in terms of employment levels), albeit through fluctuations, in one general direction (along so called S-curve): they emerge, expand, plateau, contract and exit\u2014just like any self-organizing system or living organism. We are naturally interested in the percentage of total workforce employed in a given sector. The dynamics of this percentage provides clues to where and when are the new jobs generated and old ones abandoned.\n\nSector's percentage share of employment evolves in dependency on sector's productivity growth rate.  Agriculture has emerged and virtually disappeared as a source of net employment. Today, only \u00bd percent or so of total workforce is employed in US agriculture \u2013 the most productive sector of the economy. Manufacturing had emerged, peaked and contracted. Services have emerged and started contracting \u2013 all due to incessant, unavoidable and desirable productivity growth rates.\n\nThe [[Manufacturing in the United States|U.S. absolute manufacturing output]] has more than tripled over the past 60 years. Because of the productivity growth rates, these goods were produced by ever decreasing number of people. While in 1980-2012 total economic output per hour worked increased 85 percent, in manufacturing output per hour skyrocketed by 189 percent. The number of employees in manufacturing was about a third of total workforce in 1953, about a fifth in 1980, and about a tenth (12 million) in 2012. This decline is now accelerating because of the high-tech automation and robotization.\n\nA public sector of employment has been emerging: government, welfare and unemployment, based on tax-financed consumption rather than added value production, sheltered from market forces, producing public services. (Observe that the unemployed are temporary \u201cemployees\u201d of the government, as long as they receive payments.) Creating employment in GWU sector is achievable at the expense of productive sectors, i.e. only at the risk of major debt accumulation, in a non-lasting way and with low added value. Sustaining employment growth in such a sector is severely limited by the growing debt financing.\n\n== The Four Basic Sectors ==\nThe Four Basic Sectors refers to the current stage of [[industrial sector|sector]] evolution, in the sequence of four undergone transformations, namely [[agriculture]], [[industry]], [[Service (business)|services]] and GWU ([[government]], [[welfare]] and [[unemployment]])\n\nThe US economy has become one of the most mature (with Japan and Western Europe) in terms of its sector evolution.<ref name=\"M. Zeleny 1\">{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management & Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=136}}</ref>    It has entered the stage \u2013 perhaps as the first economy ever \u2013 of declining employment share in both the service and government sectors.\n\n[[Productivity]] growth rates are now{{when|date=February 2018}} accelerating in the US services and its employment creation and absorption potential are declining rapidly. Accelerating productivity growth rates are dictated by global competition and human striving for better [[standards of living]] \u2013 they cannot be stopped at will.  In the US there are only three subsectors where net jobs are still being created: [[education in the US|education]], [[health care in the US|health care]], and government. The first two are subject to market forces and will undergo accelerating productivity growth rates and declining employment levels in the near future{{when|date=February 2018}}. The third one, GWU, is sheltered from competition, cannot expand its share substantially because it depends on taxation from other sectors; its [[employment growth]] is [[unsustainable]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nSlowly, the US economy has shifted towards sectors with lower added value, leading to lower real incomes and increasing indebtness. This is a systemic condition which no amount of regulation and [[Keynesian]]/monetarist stimuli can effectively address.  Even desirable piercing of speculative, employment and debt bubbles has ceased to be politically correct. Even 100% taxation of all incomes would not alleviate US debt.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nSo, the US is at the transforming cusp and hundreds of years of sector evolution comes to a halt.  There are only four essential activities humans can do economically: 1. [[food production|Produce food]], 2. Manufacture goods, 3. Provide services (private and public), and 4. Do nothing. This is why the idea of \u201c[[basic income]]\u201d, independent of employment, is being considered e.g. in Switzerland.\n\nUS economy has exploited (from employment share viewpoint) all three productive sectors. There is no new sector lurking in the offing: qualitative transformation is taking place. Less developed economies still have time left, some still have to industrialize and some still have the services to expand. But the US economy is now the harbinger of the things to come, the role model for others to follow or reject, but hardly ignore. For the first time in history, this one economy has reached the end of the old model (or paradigm) and is groping to find the new ways of organizing its business, economy and society.<ref name=\"M. Zeleny 2\">{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management & Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=79}}</ref>\n\n== New transformation ==\n\n[[File:Fig. 3a.

It took remarkable ingenuity to unleash the forces that paralyzed markets, overturned governments, and ruined countless lives, not to mention causing an historic decline in global gross domestic product. For creativity to fail in the summing up is just one more insult. Of course, it\u2019s hard to name what you can\u2019t comprehend.\" |Editor's Letter|[[Businessweek]] , September 12, 2013}}\n\nMeanwhile, New Transformation has already well advanced.\n\nIn Fig. 3a, observe that the US economy has matured in terms of its sector evolution. It has entered the stage \u2013 as the first economy ever \u2013 of declining employment in the service and GWU sectors.\n\nAs Fig. 3a documents, the US economy has exhausted (from employment viewpoint) all three productive sectors and has reached for the 17% in GWU. In Fig. 3b we separate the last workforce bar from Fig. 3a, in order to see the impact of productivity growth today.\n\nAll four sectors are subject to accelerated productivity growth rates in the near future. The only expanding space of the workforce is the grey region \u201c?\u201d in Fig. 3b, essentially reflecting the decline in workforce participation rate. This grey area is also the space of the new transformation: that's where those who left unemployment registers are starting new ventures and enterprises, and participating in regional economies.\n\nThis new \u201ctransformation\u201d is different from all preceding sector transformations: it does not usher in a new sector but completes the secular cycle of localization\u2192globalization\u2192re-localization. A new economic paradigm is emerging, with a new structure, behavior, institutions and values. A more precise label would be Economic Metamorphosis. [[Metamorphosis]] is the outcome of a series of transformations, not dissimilar to a caterpillar-to-butterfly change of form, through the construction\u2192destruction\u2192reconstruction autopoietic self-production cycle.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mystery_of_Metamorphosis.html?id=2G7VWWKRMa4C | title=The Mystery of Metamorphosis: A Scientific Detective Story | publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing | date=April 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Frank}}</ref>\n\nEven when the recession ends, the metamorphosis of economic form shall continue, accelerate and expand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shale: the \u2018IT bubble\u2019 of the 21st century?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13363#.UuhZvxAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}</ref>  Less and less we shall be able to tell the difference. Pressures for increased productivity growth rates, declining employment and workforce participation, as well as budget cuts shall grow unabated. Due to massive automation, sector GDP can grow even under the conditions of declining employment. More than that: increasing the minimum wage,<ref>{{cite web|title=Minimum Wage, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minimumwage.htm}}</ref> historically rather neutral with respect to employment, will now be readily replacing low-level jobs with ever cheaper and more abundant automation - along with millions of jobs being lost due to the still uninformed and aimless political process. Obscuring the difference between cyclical crisis and the ongoing transformation (metamorphosis) is not without consequences: when true diagnosis is not attempted, and people do not know what is happening with their economy and why, all forms of contagious social unrest follow worldwide.\n\n== Okun's law ==\n[[File:Fig. 4. Labor participation.png|thumb|Fig. 4. Labor participation|228x228px]]\nIn economics, [[Okun's law]] (named after [[Arthur Melvin Okun]]), is an empirically observed relationship relating unemployment to losses in a country's production. This correlation \"law\" states that a 2% decline in output (GDP) will be accompanied by a 1% rise in unemployment. It has been dubbed as \u201c[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-26/macroeconomic-mystery-u-dot-s-dot-unemployment-subverts-okuns-law Macroeconomic Mystery]\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Macroeconomic Mystery | journal=Business Week |date=30 September \u2013 6 October 2013 | pages=P24}}</ref> After holding for the past 40 years, it faltered during current \u201crecovery\u201d. Unemployment shot up faster than predicted, but then it fell more quickly than indicated by slow U.S. growth in 2009\u20132013. Output grew 2% but unemployment is 7.6% instead of 8.8% expected by this \u201claw\u201d.\n\nThe notion of transformation explains this artificial mystery. First, unemployment shot up faster because there are no major sectors absorbing and replacing the loss of jobs. Second, unemployment also falls faster because, due to the long duration of the crisis, the workforce participation rate keeps shrinking (In 2007, 66% were working or seeking job, in 2013 only 63.2%), as can be seen in Fig. 4. In other words, people leaving the workforce are not counted among the unemployed. For example, in summer 2013, on average only 148,000 new jobs per month were created, yet unemployment rate dropped steeply to 7.3%, at the cost of 312,000 people dropping out of the work force. The number of unemployed (i.e. actively seeking jobs) is different from the number of people without work \u2013 another sign of fundamental transformation and not just a \u201ccrisis\u201d.\n\nThe correlation between growth and employment is very tenuous during ongoing transformation. Based on productivity growth rates, GDP could accelerate and yet jobs drop precipitously, due to automation, robotization, digitization and self-service of the transformation era. Also, correlations in economics are always dangerous because they do not prove or establish causal relationships.\n\n== Self-service, disintermediation and customization ==\nThe new transformational paradigm could be defined by the ongoing self-organization of the market economy itself: its rates of self-service, [[disintermediation]] and [[mass customization]] are increasing and becoming most effective on local and regional levels. Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the economy seeks to reinstate its new balance through these new modes of doing business. Producers and providers are outsourcing their production and services to customers and to technology. Outsourcing to customers is a natural and necessary self-organizing process, including disintermediation, customer integration and mass customization, all driven by the global productivity at the cusp of transformation.\n\nDue to its productivity growth rates, each sector must emerge, grow, persist, stagnate, decline and dissipate in terms of its employment generating capacity. The high-productivity growth sectors are emerging and dissipating first, the low-productivity growth sectors (like services) are completing their life cycles only now. Different productivity growth rates in different sectors are accompanied by virtually uniform growth rates in wages and salaries across all sectors, as required by free market forces.\n\nAs a consequence, the goods of high productivity growth sectors (food, manufactured goods) are getting cheaper and the products of low productivity growth sectors (health care, education, insurance) are getting more expensive. In many developing nations this may still be the other way around (due to the prevailing stage of sector evolution): food and manufactured goods more expensive, while services still relatively cheap, as captured in the Figure 5:\n[[File:Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates.PNG|thumb|Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates|372x372px]]\n\nRational economics agents tend towards substituting relatively cheaper and capital intensive manufactured goods for relatively more expensive and labor-intensive services. Consumers will use goods instead of services wherever economical and possible. By observing the emergence of automated teller machines instead of bank tellers, self-service gas stations instead of full-service stations, self-driving instead of chauffeurs, do-it-yourself pregnancy kits rather than hospital testing services, self-handled optical scanners rather than cashiers, and cloud computing instead of central mainframes, mature economies are entering the era of self-service, disintermediation and mass customization.\n\nModern production is primarily based on the processing of information, not on the hauling of goods, humans and machinery over large distances.  One can more effectively \u201chaul the information,\u201d to produce goods and provide services locally. Information and knowledge travel effortlessly through electronic superhighways, through telecommunications and social networks over the internet.\n\n== Relocalization ==\n{{See also|Localism (politics)}}\nBecause there is no new productive sector to emerge, the market system seeks to reinstate its new balance through new modes of doing business. [[Deglobalization]] is taking place, supply chains are turning into demand chains, large economies are focusing on their internal markets, outsourcing is followed by \u201cbacksourcing\u201d, returning activities back to the countries and locations of their origin. The original slogan of \u201cThink globally, act locally,\u201d is being re-interpreted as exploiting global information and knowledge in local action, under local conditions and contexts.\n\nWhile [[globalization]] refers to a restructuring of the initially distributed and localized world economy into spatially reorganized processes of production and consumption across national economies and political states on a global scale, in deglobalization, people move towards relocalization: the global experience and knowledge becoming embodied in local communities. So, the corso-ricorso of socio-economic transformation is properly captured by a triad Localization \u2192 Globalization \u2192 Relocalization.\n\nThe trend of [[deglobalization]] is turning much more significant during these years. The growth of worldwide GDP is now exceeding the overall growth of trade for the first time; foreign investment (Cross Border Capital Flows) is only 60% of their pre-crisis levels and has plunged to some 40 percent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Financial globalization: Retreat or reset?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/global_capital_markets/financial_globalization|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|date=March 2013|author1=Susan Lund |author2=Toos Daruvala |author3=Richard Dobbs }}</ref>  World capital flows include loans and deposits, foreign investments, bonds and equities \u2013 all down in their cross-border segment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6754e5da-76e6-11e3-a253-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rDTwZEyH | title=Rapid fall in capital flows poses growth risk | publisher=The Financial Times |author1=Ralph Atkins |author2=Keith Fray |date=January 2014}}</ref>  This means that the rate of globalization has reversed its momentum. Globalizers are still worried about 2014 being the year of irreversible decline. Improvement in the internal growth of U.S.A., EU, and Japan does not carry into external trade \u2013 these economies are starting to function as zero-sum.\n\nThe income inequality and long-term unemployment lead to re-localized experiments with ''[[Guaranteed Minimum Income]]'' (to be traced to [[Thomas Paine]]) for all citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Paine|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/tpaine3.html|publisher=Social Security Administration}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/2698139/Two_arguments_for_Basic_Income_Thomas_Paine_1737-1809_and_Thomas_Spence_1750-1814_ | title=Two arguments for Basic Income | last=Marangos | first=John | journal=History of Economic Ideas |date=January 2006}}</ref>  In Switzerland this guarantee would be $33,000 per year, regardless of working or not.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Swiss Join the Fight Against Inequality|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/inequality-fight-swiss-will-vote-on-minimum-income|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author=Stephan Faris|date=January 2014}}</ref>  Under the name Generation Basic Income it is now subject to [[2013 Swiss referendums|Swiss referendum]]. Unemployment then frees people to pursue their own creative talents.\n\nWith this transformation, an entirely new vocabulary is emerging in economics: in addition to deglobalization and relocalization, we also encounter glocalization (adjustment of products to local culture) and local community restoration (regional self-government and direct democracy). With relocalization, an entire new cycle of societal corso-ricorso is brought forth. Local services, local production and local agriculture, based on distributed energy generation, additive manufacturing and [[vertical farming]], are enhancing individual, community and regional autonomy through self-service, disintermediation and mass customization. Both requisite technologies and appropriate business models necessary for relocalization are already in place, forming a vital part of our daily business and life experience. New transformation is well on its way.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Economic transformation]]\n* [[Transformation of culture]]\n* [[Structural change]]\n* [[Overconsumption]]\n* [[Fourth Industrial Revolution]]\n* [[Digital Revolution]]\n* [[Sharing economy]]\n* [[Peer production]]\n* [[Technological unemployment]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=B5LwUErqliAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA372&dq=%EF%80%AD%09%22The+Self-Service+Society:+A+New+Scenario+of+the+Future,%22+Planning+Review,+7(1979)+3,+pp.+3-7,+37-38.&ots=bwtm9pGJwW&sig=TRFkwamJplqCjNaFZ9EQ59JiS-Q#v=onepage&q=%EF%80%AD%09%22The%20Self-Service%20Society%3A%20A%20New%20Scenario%20of%20the%20Future%2C%22%20Planning%20Review%2C%207(1979)%203%2C%20pp.%203-7%2C%2037-38.&f=false \"The Self-Service Society: A New Scenario of the Future\"], ''Planning Review'', 7(1979) 3, pp.&nbsp;3\u20137, 37\u201338.\n* \"Towards a Self-Service Society\", [http://iospress.metapress.com/content/x24wv0227033838t/ ''Human Systems Management'']{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, 1(1980) 1, pp.&nbsp;1\u20133.\n* \"Socio-Economic Foundations of a Self-Service Society\", in: ''Progress in Cybernetics and Systems Research'', vol. 10, Hemisphere Publishing, Washington, D.C., 1982, pp.&nbsp;127\u2013132.\n* \"Self-Service Trends in the Society\", in: ''Applied Systems and Cybernetics'', Vol. 3, edited by G.

Among them are Disturbance (short-term disruption, temporary disorder), Perturbation (persistent or repeated divergence, predicament, decline or crisis), Deformation (damage, regime change, loss of self-sustainability, distortion), Transformation (long-term change, restructuring, conversion, new \u201cnormal\u201d) and Renewal (rebirth, transmutation, corso-ricorso, renaissance, new beginning).\n\nTransformation is a [[Unidirectional network|unidirectional]] and irreversible change in dominant human economic activity ([[Economic sectors|economic sector]]). Such change is driven by slower or faster continuous improvement in sector productivity growth rate. Productivity growth itself is fueled by advances in technology, inflow of useful innovations, accumulated practical knowledge and experience, levels of education, viability of institutions, quality of decision making and organized human effort. Individual sector transformations are the outcomes of human [[socio-economic]] evolution.\n\nHuman economic activity has so far undergone at least two fundamental transformations, as the leading sector has changed:\n\n#[[Neolithic Revolution|From nomadic hunting and gathering (H/G) to agriculture (A)]]\n#[[Industrial Revolution|From agriculture (A) to industry (I)]]\n\nBeyond industry there is no clear pattern now.  Some may argue that service sectors (particularly finance) have eclipsed industry, but the evidence is inconclusive and industrial productivity growth remains the main driver of overall economic growth in most national economies.\n\nThis evolution naturally proceeds from securing necessary food, through producing useful things, to providing helpful services, both private and public.  Accelerating productivity growth rates speed up the transformations, from millennia, through centuries, to decades of the recent era. It is this acceleration which makes transformation relevant economic category of today, more fundamental in its impact than any recession, crisis or depression. The evolution of four forms of capital (Indicated in Fig. 1) accompanies all economic transformations.\n\nTransformation is quite different from accompanying cyclical recessions and crises, despite the similarity of manifested phenomena (unemployment, technology shifts, socio-political discontent, bankruptcies, etc.). However, the tools and interventions used to combat crisis are clearly ineffective for coping with non-cyclical transformations. The problem is whether we face a mere crisis or a fundamental transformation (globalization\u2192relocalization).\n\n== Four key forms of capital ==\n[[File:Fig1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital.PNG|thumb|Fig. 1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital|287x287px]]\n\nFig. 1 refers to the four transformations through the parallel (and overlapping) evolution of four forms of capital: Natural\u2192Built\u2192Human\u2192Social. These evolved forms of capital present a minimal complex of sustainability and self-sustainability of pre-human and human systems.\n\n'''[[Natural capital|Natural capital (N)]]'''. The nature-produced, renewed and reproduced \u201cresources\u201d of land, water, air, raw materials, biomass and organisms. Natural capital is subject to both renewable and non-renewable depletion, degradation, cultivation, recycling and reuse.\n\n'''Built capital (B)'''. The man-made physical assets of infrastructures, technologies, buildings and means of transportation. This is the manufactured \u201chardware\u201d of nations. This national hardware must be continually maintained, renewed and modernized to assure its continued productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n'''[[Human capital|Human capital (H)]]'''. The continued investment in people's skills, knowledge, education, health & nutrition, abilities, motivation and effort. This is the \u201csoftware\u201d and \u201cbrainware\u201d of a nation; most important form of capital for developing nations.\n\n'''[[Social capital|Social capital (S)]]'''. The enabling infrastructure of institutions, civic communities, cultural and national cohesion, collective and family values, trust, traditions, respect and the sense of belonging. This is the voluntary, spontaneous \u201csocial order\u201d which cannot be engineered, but its self-production (autopoiesis) can be nurtured, supported and cultivated.\n\n== Parallelism of crises and transformations ==\nThe triggers that induce the catharsis of a crisis often coincide with and are undistinguishable from the triggers launching qualitative transformations of the economy, business and society at large. While crises are cyclical recessions or slowdowns within the same paradigm, transformation represents a paradigmatic change in the way of doing business: moving towards new standards and quality, in a unique and non-recursive way.  Most developed and mature economies of the world (USA, Japan, Western Europe) are undergoing long-term transformation towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d of doing business, state governance and ways of life. Cyclical crisis is a parallel, accompanying phenomenon, subject to different causes, special rules and separate dynamics.\n\n[[Milan Zeleny]] cautions that confounding crisis and transformation as one phenomenon brings forth the confusion, inconsistency and guessing.<ref name=\"Crisis\">{{cite journal | url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/d54282m4176x844n/ | title=Machine/organism dichotomy and free-market economics: Crisis or transformation? | publisher=IOS Press | author=Zeleny, Milan | journal=Human Systems Management |date=November 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4/2010 | pages=P191\u2013204}}</ref> While many changes in the market system are cyclical, there are also evolutionary changes which are unidirectional and qualitatively transformational. The transformations of the US economy from agricultural to industrial, or from industrial to services, were not crises, although there were cyclical crises along the way. Transformational \u201closses\u201d cannot be recovered or regained by definition. Not understanding that is at the core of wasteful spending of rigidly hopeless governmental interventions. Barry Bosworth of the [[Brookings Institution]] confirms:  \u201cThe assumption has always been that the U.S. economy will gain back what was lost in a recession. Academics are coming to the realization that this time is different and that those losses appear permanent and cannot be regained.\u201d<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/u-dot-s-dot-potential-gdp-revised-downward-as-recession-damage-lingers | title=The GDP in 2017 Is Not Looking Good | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=March 2014 | author=Brendan Greeley}}</ref>   In transformations there are no \u201closses\u201d, only changes and transitions to a new economic order.\n\n== Underlying pattern of recessions ==\n[[File:Percent Job Losses After WWII Recessions.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. Comparison of major US recessions over past 30 years|452x452px]]\n\nWhen comparing major US recessions since 1980, as in Fig. 2, it is clear that they have been getting deeper and longer in terms of the recovery of initial employment level. Only the first is classical V shape, there are several W, U and finally L shapes. There clearly is an underlying causal phenomenon which is getting stronger and more persistent over time. Such underlying causation is of interest, as it may signal the prelude and gathering of forces of another emerging transformation.\n\nLooking back, even [[Great Depression in the United States|the Great Depression]] of the 1930s was not just a crisis, but a long-term transformation from the pre-war industrial economy to the post-war service economy in the U.S. However, in the early 1980s, the service sector had started slowing down its employment absorption and growth potential, ultimately leading to the jobless economy of 2011. No such comparisons with the 1930s are useful: one can compare recessions but not transformations. Industrial economy of 1930s and the post-service economy of 2000s are two different \u201canimals\u201d in two different contexts. It is still not clear what kind of transformation is emerging and eventually replaces the service and public sector economy.\n\nThe unrecognized confluence of crisis and transformation, and the inability to separate them, lies at the core of old tools ([[Keynesian economics|keynesianism]], [[monetarism]]) not working properly. The tools for adapting successfully to paradigmatic transformation have not been developed.  An example of a paradigmatic transformation would be the shift from geocentric to heliocentric view of our world.  Within both views there can be any number of crises, cyclical failures of old and searches for new theories and practices. But there was only one transformation, from geocentric to heliocentric, and there was nothing cyclical about it. It was resisted with all the might of the mighty: remember Galilei and Bruno. While crises are cyclical corrections and adjustments, transformations are evolutionary shifts or even revolutions (industrial, computer) towards new and different levels of existence.\n\nThe most important indicator is the arena of employment, especially in the US, providing clues to transformational qualities of the current global crisis phenomena. Persistent rates of unemployment, combined with falling workforce participation rate indicate that also this crisis is intertwined with underlying transformation and so it displays atypical dynamics and unusual persistence, presenting new challenges to conventional economic thought, business practices and government interventional \u201ctoolbox\u201d. Sector evolution and dynamics is the key to explaining these phenomena.\n\n== Sector dynamics ==\n[[Economic sectors]] evolve (in terms of employment levels), albeit through fluctuations, in one general direction (along so called S-curve): they emerge, expand, plateau, contract and exit\u2014just like any self-organizing system or living organism. We are naturally interested in the percentage of total workforce employed in a given sector. The dynamics of this percentage provides clues to where and when are the new jobs generated and old ones abandoned.\n\nSector's percentage share of employment evolves in dependency on sector's productivity growth rate.  Agriculture has emerged and virtually disappeared as a source of net employment. Today, only \u00bd percent or so of total workforce is employed in US agriculture \u2013 the most productive sector of the economy. Manufacturing had emerged, peaked and contracted. Services have emerged and started contracting \u2013 all due to incessant, unavoidable and desirable productivity growth rates.\n\nThe [[Manufacturing in the United States|U.S. absolute manufacturing output]] has more than tripled over the past 60 years. Because of the productivity growth rates, these goods were produced by ever decreasing number of people. While in 1980-2012 total economic output per hour worked increased 85 percent, in manufacturing output per hour skyrocketed by 189 percent. The number of employees in manufacturing was about a third of total workforce in 1953, about a fifth in 1980, and about a tenth (12 million) in 2012. This decline is now accelerating because of the high-tech automation and robotization.\n\nA public sector of employment has been emerging: government, welfare and unemployment, based on tax-financed consumption rather than added value production, sheltered from market forces, producing public services. (Observe that the unemployed are temporary \u201cemployees\u201d of the government, as long as they receive payments.) Creating employment in GWU sector is achievable at the expense of productive sectors, i.e. only at the risk of major debt accumulation, in a non-lasting way and with low added value. Sustaining employment growth in such a sector is severely limited by the growing debt financing.\n\n== The Four Basic Sectors ==\nThe Four Basic Sectors refers to the current stage of [[industrial sector|sector]] evolution, in the sequence of four undergone transformations, namely [[agriculture]], [[industry]], [[Service (business)|services]] and GWU ([[government]], [[welfare]] and [[unemployment]])\n\nThe US economy has become one of the most mature (with Japan and Western Europe) in terms of its sector evolution.<ref name=\"M. Zeleny 1\">{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management & Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=136}}</ref>    It has entered the stage \u2013 perhaps as the first economy ever \u2013 of declining employment share in both the service and government sectors.\n\n[[Productivity]] growth rates are now{{when|date=February 2018}} accelerating in the US services and its employment creation and absorption potential are declining rapidly. Accelerating productivity growth rates are dictated by global competition and human striving for better [[standards of living]] \u2013 they cannot be stopped at will.  In the US there are only three subsectors where net jobs are still being created: [[education in the US|education]], [[health care in the US|health care]], and government. The first two are subject to market forces and will undergo accelerating productivity growth rates and declining employment levels in the near future{{when|date=February 2018}}. The third one, GWU, is sheltered from competition, cannot expand its share substantially because it depends on taxation from other sectors; its [[employment growth]] is [[unsustainable]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nSlowly, the US economy has shifted towards sectors with lower added value, leading to lower real incomes and increasing indebtness. This is a systemic condition which no amount of regulation and [[Keynesian]]/monetarist stimuli can effectively address.  Even desirable piercing of speculative, employment and debt bubbles has ceased to be politically correct. Even 100% taxation of all incomes would not alleviate US debt.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nSo, the US is at the transforming cusp and hundreds of years of sector evolution comes to a halt.  There are only four essential activities humans can do economically: 1. [[food production|Produce food]], 2. Manufacture goods, 3. Provide services (private and public), and 4. Do nothing. This is why the idea of \u201c[[basic income]]\u201d, independent of employment, is being considered e.g. in Switzerland.\n\nUS economy has exploited (from employment share viewpoint) all three productive sectors. There is no new sector lurking in the offing: qualitative transformation is taking place. Less developed economies still have time left, some still have to industrialize and some still have the services to expand. But the US economy is now the harbinger of the things to come, the role model for others to follow or reject, but hardly ignore. For the first time in history, this one economy has reached the end of the old model (or paradigm) and is groping to find the new ways of organizing its business, economy and society.<ref name=\"M.

Of course, it\u2019s hard to name what you can\u2019t comprehend.\" |Editor's Letter|[[Businessweek]] , September 12, 2013}}\n\nMeanwhile, New Transformation has already well advanced.\n\nIn Fig. 3a, observe that the US economy has matured in terms of its sector evolution. It has entered the stage \u2013 as the first economy ever \u2013 of declining employment in the service and GWU sectors.\n\nAs Fig. 3a documents, the US economy has exhausted (from employment viewpoint) all three productive sectors and has reached for the 17% in GWU. In Fig. 3b we separate the last workforce bar from Fig. 3a, in order to see the impact of productivity growth today.\n\nAll four sectors are subject to accelerated productivity growth rates in the near future. The only expanding space of the workforce is the grey region \u201c?\u201d in Fig. 3b, essentially reflecting the decline in workforce participation rate. This grey area is also the space of the new transformation: that's where those who left unemployment registers are starting new ventures and enterprises, and participating in regional economies.\n\nThis new \u201ctransformation\u201d is different from all preceding sector transformations: it does not usher in a new sector but completes the secular cycle of localization\u2192globalization\u2192re-localization. A new economic paradigm is emerging, with a new structure, behavior, institutions and values. A more precise label would be Economic Metamorphosis. [[Metamorphosis]] is the outcome of a series of transformations, not dissimilar to a caterpillar-to-butterfly change of form, through the construction\u2192destruction\u2192reconstruction autopoietic self-production cycle.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mystery_of_Metamorphosis.html?id=2G7VWWKRMa4C | title=The Mystery of Metamorphosis: A Scientific Detective Story | publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing | date=April 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Frank}}</ref>\n\nEven when the recession ends, the metamorphosis of economic form shall continue, accelerate and expand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shale: the \u2018IT bubble\u2019 of the 21st century?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13363#.UuhZvxAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}</ref>  Less and less we shall be able to tell the difference. Pressures for increased productivity growth rates, declining employment and workforce participation, as well as budget cuts shall grow unabated. Due to massive automation, sector GDP can grow even under the conditions of declining employment. More than that: increasing the minimum wage,<ref>{{cite web|title=Minimum Wage, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minimumwage.htm}}</ref> historically rather neutral with respect to employment, will now be readily replacing low-level jobs with ever cheaper and more abundant automation - along with millions of jobs being lost due to the still uninformed and aimless political process. Obscuring the difference between cyclical crisis and the ongoing transformation (metamorphosis) is not without consequences: when true diagnosis is not attempted, and people do not know what is happening with their economy and why, all forms of contagious social unrest follow worldwide.\n\n== Okun's law ==\n[[File:Fig. 4. Labor participation.png|thumb|Fig. 4. Labor participation|228x228px]]\nIn economics, [[Okun's law]] (named after [[Arthur Melvin Okun]]), is an empirically observed relationship relating unemployment to losses in a country's production. This correlation \"law\" states that a 2% decline in output (GDP) will be accompanied by a 1% rise in unemployment. It has been dubbed as \u201c[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-26/macroeconomic-mystery-u-dot-s-dot-unemployment-subverts-okuns-law Macroeconomic Mystery]\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Macroeconomic Mystery | journal=Business Week |date=30 September \u2013 6 October 2013 | pages=P24}}</ref> After holding for the past 40 years, it faltered during current \u201crecovery\u201d. Unemployment shot up faster than predicted, but then it fell more quickly than indicated by slow U.S. growth in 2009-2013. Output grew 2% but unemployment is 7.6% instead of 8.8% expected by this \u201claw\u201d.\n\nThe notion of transformation explains this artificial mystery. First, unemployment shot up faster because there are no major sectors absorbing and replacing the loss of jobs. Second, unemployment also falls faster because, due to the long duration of the crisis, the workforce participation rate keeps shrinking (In 2007, 66% were working or seeking job, in 2013 only 63.2%), as can be seen in Fig. 4. In other words, people leaving the workforce are not counted among the unemployed. For example, in summer 2013, on average only 148,000 new jobs per month were created, yet unemployment rate dropped steeply to 7.3%, at the cost of 312,000 people dropping out of the work force. The number of unemployed (i.e. actively seeking jobs) is different from the number of people without work \u2013 another sign of fundamental transformation and not just a \u201ccrisis\u201d.\n\nThe correlation between growth and employment is very tenuous during ongoing transformation. Based on productivity growth rates, GDP could accelerate and yet jobs drop precipitously, due to automation, robotization, digitization and self-service of the transformation era. Also, correlations in economics are always dangerous because they do not prove or establish causal relationships.\n\n== Self-service, disintermediation and customization ==\nThe new transformational paradigm could be defined by the ongoing self-organization of the market economy itself: its rates of self-service, [[disintermediation]] and [[mass customization]] are increasing and becoming most effective on local and regional levels. Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the economy seeks to reinstate its new balance through these new modes of doing business. Producers and providers are outsourcing their production and services to customers and to technology. Outsourcing to customers is a natural and necessary self-organizing process, including disintermediation, customer integration and mass customization, all driven by the global productivity at the cusp of transformation.\n\nDue to its productivity growth rates, each sector must emerge, grow, persist, stagnate, decline and dissipate in terms of its employment generating capacity. The high-productivity growth sectors are emerging and dissipating first, the low-productivity growth sectors (like services) are completing their life cycles only now. Different productivity growth rates in different sectors are accompanied by virtually uniform growth rates in wages and salaries across all sectors, as required by free market forces.\n\nAs a consequence, the goods of high productivity growth sectors (food, manufactured goods) are getting cheaper and the products of low productivity growth sectors (health care, education, insurance) are getting more expensive. In many developing nations this may still be the other way around (due to the prevailing stage of sector evolution): food and manufactured goods more expensive, while services still relatively cheap, as captured in the Figure 5:\n[[File:Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates.PNG|thumb|Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates|372x372px]]\n\nRational economics agents tend towards substituting relatively cheaper and capital intensive manufactured goods for relatively more expensive and labor-intensive services. Consumers will use goods instead of services wherever economical and possible. By observing the emergence of automated teller machines instead of bank tellers, self-service gas stations instead of full-service stations, self-driving instead of chauffeurs, do-it-yourself pregnancy kits rather than hospital testing services, self-handled optical scanners rather than cashiers, and cloud computing instead of central mainframes, mature economies are entering the era of self-service, disintermediation and mass customization.\n\nModern production is primarily based on the processing of information, not on the hauling of goods, humans and machinery over large distances.  One can more effectively \u201chaul the information,\u201d to produce goods and provide services locally. Information and knowledge travel effortlessly through electronic superhighways, through telecommunications and social networks over the internet.\n\n== Relocalization ==\n{{See also|Localism (politics)}}\nBecause there is no new productive sector to emerge, the market system seeks to reinstate its new balance through new modes of doing business. [[Deglobalization]] is taking place, supply chains are turning into demand chains, large economies are focusing on their internal markets, outsourcing is followed by \u201cbacksourcing\u201d, returning activities back to the countries and locations of their origin. The original slogan of \u201cThink globally, act locally,\u201d is being re-interpreted as exploiting global information and knowledge in local action, under local conditions and contexts.\n\nWhile [[globalization]] refers to a restructuring of the initially distributed and localized world economy into spatially reorganized processes of production and consumption across national economies and political states on a global scale, in deglobalization, people move towards relocalization: the global experience and knowledge becoming embodied in local communities. So, the corso-ricorso of socio-economic transformation is properly captured by a triad Localization \u2192 Globalization \u2192 Relocalization.\n\nThe trend of [[deglobalization]] is turning much more significant during these years. The growth of worldwide GDP is now exceeding the overall growth of trade for the first time; foreign investment (Cross Border Capital Flows) is only 60% of their pre-crisis levels and has plunged to some 40 percent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Financial globalization: Retreat or reset?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/global_capital_markets/financial_globalization|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|date=March 2013|author1=Susan Lund |author2=Toos Daruvala |author3=Richard Dobbs }}</ref>  World capital flows include loans and deposits, foreign investments, bonds and equities \u2013 all down in their cross-border segment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6754e5da-76e6-11e3-a253-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rDTwZEyH | title=Rapid fall in capital flows poses growth risk | publisher=The Financial Times |author1=Ralph Atkins |author2=Keith Fray |date=January 2014}}</ref>  This means that the rate of globalization has reversed its momentum. Globalizers are still worried about 2014 being the year of irreversible decline. Improvement in the internal growth of U.S.A., EU, and Japan does not carry into external trade \u2013 these economies are starting to function as zero-sum.\n\nThe income inequality and long-term unemployment lead to re-localized experiments with ''[[Guaranteed Minimum Income]]'' (to be traced to [[Thomas Paine]]) for all citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Paine|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/tpaine3.html|publisher=Social Security Administration}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/2698139/Two_arguments_for_Basic_Income_Thomas_Paine_1737-1809_and_Thomas_Spence_1750-1814_ | title=Two arguments for Basic Income | last=Marangos | first=John | journal=History of Economic Ideas |date=January 2006}}</ref>  In Switzerland this guarantee would be $33,000 per year, regardless of working or not.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Swiss Join the Fight Against Inequality|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/inequality-fight-swiss-will-vote-on-minimum-income|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author=Stephan Faris|date=January 2014}}</ref>  Under the name Generation Basic Income it is now subject to [[2013 Swiss referendums|Swiss referendum]]. Unemployment then frees people to pursue their own creative talents.\n\nWith this transformation, an entirely new vocabulary is emerging in economics: in addition to deglobalization and relocalization, we also encounter glocalization (adjustment of products to local culture) and local community restoration (regional self-government and direct democracy). With relocalization, an entire new cycle of societal corso-ricorso is brought forth. Local services, local production and local agriculture, based on distributed energy generation, additive manufacturing and [[vertical farming]], are enhancing individual, community and regional autonomy through self-service, disintermediation and mass customization. Both requisite technologies and appropriate business models necessary for relocalization are already in place, forming a vital part of our daily business and life experience. New transformation is well on its way.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Economic transformation]]\n* [[Transformation of culture]]\n* [[Structural change]]\n* [[Overconsumption]]\n* [[Fourth Industrial Revolution]]\n* [[Digital Revolution]]\n* [[Sharing economy]]\n* [[Peer production]]\n* [[Technological unemployment]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=B5LwUErqliAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA372&dq=%EF%80%AD%09%22The+Self-Service+Society:+A+New+Scenario+of+the+Future,%22+Planning+Review,+7(1979)+3,+pp.+3-7,+37-38.&ots=bwtm9pGJwW&sig=TRFkwamJplqCjNaFZ9EQ59JiS-Q#v=onepage&q=%EF%80%AD%09%22The%20Self-Service%20Society%3A%20A%20New%20Scenario%20of%20the%20Future%2C%22%20Planning%20Review%2C%207(1979)%203%2C%20pp.%203-7%2C%2037-38.&f=false \"The Self-Service Society: A New Scenario of the Future\"], ''Planning Review'', 7(1979) 3, pp.&nbsp;3\u20137, 37-38.\n* \"Towards a Self-Service Society\", [http://iospress.metapress.com/content/x24wv0227033838t/ ''Human Systems Management'']{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, 1(1980) 1, pp.&nbsp;1\u20133.\n* \"Socio-Economic Foundations of a Self-Service Society\", in: ''Progress in Cybernetics and Systems Research'', vol. 10, Hemisphere Publishing, Washington, D.C., 1982, pp.&nbsp;127\u2013132.\n* \"Self-Service Trends in the Society\", in: ''Applied Systems and Cybernetics'', Vol. 3, edited by G.

Adventures of Sabrina''''' is an American [[comic book]] series published by [[Archie Horror]], an imprint of [[Archie Comics]], beginning in 2014. The series is a darker take on the characters and setting of ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]''. It is written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]], with art by Robert Hack, and is inspired by the appearances of Sabrina in Aguirre-Sacasa's other Archie series, ''[[Afterlife with Archie]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nDue to the positive reception of ''[[Afterlife with Archie]]'' #6, which centered on Sabrina, a solo series starring her was announced in June 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/07/24/afterlife-with-archie-6-review|title = Afterlife with Archie #6 Review|date = July 23, 2014|accessdate = July 24, 2015|website = au.ign.com|publisher = IGN Australia|last = Logsdon|first = Mike}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3297282/archie-comics-reveals-sabrina-horror-series/|title = Archie Comics Reveals \"Sabrina\" Horror Series!|date = June 3, 2014|accessdate = July 24, 2015|website = bloody-disgusting.com|publisher = |last = Nadler|first = Lonnie}}</ref> The first issue was released in October 2014.

In issue #8, Sabrina experiences a vision of the ''Afterlife with Archie'' versions of herself and [[Jughead Jones]], suggesting some connection between the two continuities. While the show maintains a vintage aesthetic the use of contemporaneous technology shows that it is firmly set in the modern day.\n\n==Story arcs==\n===Volume 1: The Crucible (issues 1\u20135)===\nHalf-witch [[Sabrina Spellman|Sabrina]] lives with her witch aunts, [[Hilda Spellman|Hilda]] and [[Zelda Spellman|Zelda]], her warlock cousin Ambrose, and [[Salem Saberhagen|Salem]], her feline [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], in the town of Greendale.

This tidbit was revealed in part 2. Sabrina was told that her mother died; she hasn't seen her father since she was young. While Sabrina is taught witchery by her aunts at home, she lives a relatively normal life in public as a cheerleader and student at Baxter High School.

Heartbroken that he chose a mortal over her, Iola killed herself and wound up in the pits of [[Gehenna]], a place reserved in the circle of Hell for suicides, where she remained faceless until she was accidentally released by two amateur witches. After gaining a new face, she burns the tree that encased Edward and cures Diana of the insanity he inflicted upon her, but leaves her unable to leave the psychiatric facility.

He quickly rose through the ranks in the Church of Night as a skilled conjuror and eventually became a High Priest. He broke witch-law to marry Diana Sawyer, a mortal, whom he hoped would bear him an heir. When Hilda and Zelda discovered that Edward had been lying to the congregation, they trapped him in a tree as punishment. His ex-lover Madam Satan would go on to vengefully burn the tree, but would also aid in his resurrection into Harvey's body. With Sabrina believing that she brought back Harvey, Edward wonders who could\u2019ve helped her with such strong magic, and why.

Diana is briefly able to contact Sabrina through a dream, but is stopped and Sabrina soon forgets the encounter.<ref name=\"#1&#2\"/>\n*'''Rosalind''', also called \"Roz\" and \"Rossy\" on occasion, a student at Baxter High School who competes with Sabrina for everything from boys to roles in the school play to popularity. Since Rosalind is usually the one losing out, she frequently gossips maliciously about Sabrina to other students.

{"title_page": "List of minimum driving ages", "text_new": "The '''minimum driving age''' is the minimum age at which a person may obtain a [[driver's licence]] to lawfully drive a motor vehicle on public roads. That age is determined by and for each jurisdiction and is most commonly set at 18 years of age, but learner drivers may be permitted on the road at an earlier age under supervision. Before reaching the minimum age for a driver's licence or anytime afterwards, the person wanting the licence would normally be tested for driving ability and knowledge of road rules before being issued with a licence, provided he or she is above the minimum driving age. Countries with the lowest driving ages (17 and below) are Canada, El Salvador, Iceland, Israel, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, the United Kingdom (mainland), United States and Zimbabwe. In several jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, drivers can be as young as 14 (with parental supervision).\n\nMost jurisdictions recognise driver's licences issued by another jurisdiction, which may result in a young person who obtains a licence in a jurisdiction with a low minimum driving age being permitted to drive in a jurisdiction which normally has a higher driving age.\n\nThe minimum age may vary depending on vehicle type. This list refers to the minimum driving age for a light motor vehicle (typically under 3500 kg gross vehicle mass) or motorcycle, where noted.\n\n== Africa ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"100\" | State\n! width=\"130\" | Minimum driving age\n! width=\"300\" | Notes\n|-\n| {{flag|Algeria}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Cameroon}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16{{citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Source}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Egypt}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aupairinamerica.com/resources/culture_quests/egypt.asp |title=Au Pairs from Egypt - Culture Quests |publisher=Aupairinamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Eswatini}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Ethiopia}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adcidl.com/Driving-in-Ethiopia.html |title=Driving in Ethiopia |publisher=Adcidl.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Ghana}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aupairinamerica.com/resources/culture_quests/ghana.asp |title=Au Pairs from Ghana - Culture Quests |publisher=Aupairinamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Kenya}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |18<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kra.go.ke/roadtransport/roadsdrivinglicenses.html|title=KRA - Driving Licenses|website=www.kra.go.ke|access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Lesotho}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4pGABdauysC&pg=PA615&lpg=PA615&dq=Lesotho+Driving+Age&source=bl&ots=Vyzbz5D-a2&sig=XD3QjPMNBMgUMM69z1xMexQw9O4&hl=en&ei=oph3TOavCYHNjAengsm1Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved= |title=South Africa Lesotho and Swaziland - James Bainbridge - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Libya}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://internationaldriversassociation.com/international-drivers-license-libya/|title=Get an international license to drive in Libya|website=International Drivers License - InternationalDriversAssociation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Mali}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Mauritania}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Mauritius}}\n| 15 (autocycles), 17 (motorcycles), 18 (cars)<ref name=\"Mauritius police\">{{Cite web |url=http://police.govmu.org/English/Pages/App_driving_licence.aspx |title=The Mauritius Police Force - Application for Driving Licence  |publisher=[[Mauritius Police Force]] |access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| ''{{flag|Mayotte}}''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Morocco}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economycarhire.com/car-hire-morocco/driving-in-morocco.php |title=Morocco Driving Guide |publisher=Economy Car Hire |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-morocco-tour.com/about-morocco |title=About Morocco |publisher=Your-morocco-tour.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|- \n| {{flag|Mozambique}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Namibia}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aupairinamerica.com/resources/culture_quests/namibia.asp |title=Au Pairs from Namibia - Culture Quests |publisher=Aupairinamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Niger}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|author=Avando Systems Ltd |url=http://www.travcour.com/g_page.php?pageid=689&Pagetitle=Niger |title=Niger visa service UK, London|publisher=Travcour.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Nigeria}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| ''{{flag|R\u00e9union}}'' (France)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Senegal}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|South Africa}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n| The National Road Traffic act specifies that a driver needs to be 17 to legally obtain a license for all motor vehicles under 3500&nbsp;kg. 17 years old may allow one to obtain a learners license, to drive while supervised by an already licensed driver who has had their license for more than a year.

That age is determined by and for each jurisdiction and is most commonly set at 18 years of age, but learner drivers may be permitted on the road at an earlier age under supervision. Before reaching the minimum age for a driver's licence or anytime afterwards, the person wanting the licence would normally be tested for driving ability and knowledge of road rules before being issued with a licence, provided he or she is above the minimum driving age. Countries with the lowest driving ages (17 and below) are Canada, El Salvador, Iceland, Israel, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, the United Kingdom (mainland), United States and Zimbabwe. In several jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, drivers can be as young as 14 (with parental supervision).\n\nMost jurisdictions recognise driver's licences issued by another jurisdiction, which may result in a young person who obtains a licence in a jurisdiction with a low minimum driving age being permitted to drive in a jurisdiction which normally has a higher driving age.\n\nThe minimum age may vary depending on vehicle type. This list refers to the minimum driving age for a light motor vehicle (typically under 3500 kg gross vehicle mass) or motorcycle, where noted.\n\n== Africa ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"100\" | State\n! width=\"130\" | Minimum driving age\n! width=\"300\" | Notes\n|-\n| {{flag|Algeria}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Cameroon}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16{{citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Source}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Egypt}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aupairinamerica.com/resources/culture_quests/egypt.asp |title=Au Pairs from Egypt - Culture Quests |publisher=Aupairinamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Eswatini}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Ethiopia}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adcidl.com/Driving-in-Ethiopia.html |title=Driving in Ethiopia |publisher=Adcidl.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Ghana}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aupairinamerica.com/resources/culture_quests/ghana.asp |title=Au Pairs from Ghana - Culture Quests |publisher=Aupairinamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Kenya}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |18<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kra.go.ke/roadtransport/roadsdrivinglicenses.html|title=KRA - Driving Licenses|website=www.kra.go.ke|access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Lesotho}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4pGABdauysC&pg=PA615&lpg=PA615&dq=Lesotho+Driving+Age&source=bl&ots=Vyzbz5D-a2&sig=XD3QjPMNBMgUMM69z1xMexQw9O4&hl=en&ei=oph3TOavCYHNjAengsm1Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved= |title=South Africa Lesotho and Swaziland - James Bainbridge - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Libya}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://internationaldriversassociation.com/international-drivers-license-libya/|title=Get an international license to drive in Libya|website=International Drivers License - InternationalDriversAssociation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Mali}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Mauritania}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Mauritius}}\n| 15 (autocycles), 17 (motorcycles), 18 (cars)<ref name=\"Mauritius police\">{{Cite web |url=http://police.govmu.org/English/Pages/App_driving_licence.aspx |title=The Mauritius Police Force - Application for Driving Licence  |publisher=[[Mauritius Police Force]] |access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| ''{{flag|Mayotte}}''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Morocco}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economycarhire.com/car-hire-morocco/driving-in-morocco.php |title=Morocco Driving Guide |publisher=Economy Car Hire |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-morocco-tour.com/about-morocco |title=About Morocco |publisher=Your-morocco-tour.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|- \n| {{flag|Mozambique}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Namibia}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aupairinamerica.com/resources/culture_quests/namibia.asp |title=Au Pairs from Namibia - Culture Quests |publisher=Aupairinamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Niger}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18<ref>{{cite web|author=Avando Systems Ltd |url=http://www.travcour.com/g_page.php?pageid=689&Pagetitle=Niger |title=Niger visa service UK, London|publisher=Travcour.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Nigeria}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| ''{{flag|R\u00e9union}}'' (France)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Senegal}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|South Africa}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n| The National Road Traffic act specifies that a driver needs to be 17 to legally obtain a license for all motor vehicles under 3500&nbsp;kg. 17 years old may allow one to obtain a learners license, to drive while supervised by an already licensed driver who has had their license for more than a year.

The most prominent period of his career was five years with Italian club [[A.C. Milan]], with whom he won the 1999 [[Serie A]] championship and 2003 [[UEFA Champions League]] tournament.\n\nHelveg was named 1994 [[Danish Football Player of the Year|Danish ''Player of the Year'']], the year he made his debut for the [[Denmark national football team]]. He has played 108 games and scored two goals for Denmark. He has played for Denmark under three different national coaches, and has participated in the 1996, 2000 and 2004 [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] and the 1998 and 2002 [[FIFA World Cup]] tournaments.\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Odense]], Helveg started his senior career at local club [[Odense Boldklub]] (OB) in the top-flight [[Danish 1st Division]]. Helveg played two matches in the last part of OB's [[Danish 1st Division 1989|1989 1st Division]] winning season, and he was soon a part of the OB [[first team]] alongside later national team players [[Allan Nielsen]] and [[Brian Steen Nielsen]]. Helveg represented Denmark at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], playing all three Denmark matches in the tournament. When OB played English club [[Arsenal F.C.]] in the 1993\u201394 [[Cup Winners' Cup]] tournament, Helveg was put to the task of handling [[England national football team|English international]] striker [[Ian Wright]], for which he received praise.<ref>Leif Rasmussen, \"''Ob blev p\u00e5 toget''\", [[Ekstra Bladet]], 30 September 1993</ref>\n\n===Moving abroad===\nThomas Helveg's international career began when he was [[loan (sports)|loaned out]] for six months by OB, in November 1993. He joined Italian club [[Udinese Calcio]], who were [[relegation]] battlers in the [[Serie A]] championship. He made his Udinese debut in a 0\u20130 draw with [[Atalanta B.C.]] on 28 November 1993, and played 22 games and scored two goals in his first season at the club. Even though Udinese was relegated to the [[Serie B]] at the end of the season, he received his first call-up to the Denmark national team by national manager [[Richard M\u00f8ller Nielsen]] in April 1994. He came on as a substitute in the 14th minute for the injured [[John Jensen]], and Helveg would receive rave reviews for his performance,<ref>Allan Nielsen, \"''Skaden f\u00f8dte en storspiller''\", [[Politiken]], 21 April 1994</ref> making him a mainstay in the Denmark squad from day one. Despite their relegation, he was bought by Udinese and was soon to have success in the [[Udine]] club. Combined with his international breakthrough with the Denmark team, his first year at Udinese earned him the 1994 [[Danish Player of the Year|Danish ''Player of the Year'']] award.\n\nFor five seasons, he was first choice in the right side of the Udinese starting line-up, as a [[Wing-back (association football)|wingback]] charging up and down the sideline. He played 30 of 38 games, as Udinese finished second in the [[1994\u201395 Serie B]] season, and won [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] back into the Serie A after a single season in Serie B. Under guidance of coach [[Alberto Zaccheroni]], Udinese steadily became a tough opponent for the other clubs in Serie A, and finished in tenth place of the [[1995\u201396 Serie A]] season. Helveg scored his first national team goal in June 1996, before representing Denmark in his first major international tournament at the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996 European Championship]] (Euro 1996) later that month. He played all three Denmark matches in the preliminary group stage of the Euro 1996, which ended unsuccessfully in an early exit from the tournament.\n\nIn April 1997, he was joined at Udinese by fellow Danish player [[Martin J\u00f8rgensen]]. The pair developed a close relationship, naming each other nephew J\u00f8rgensen and uncle Helveg. For the next two seasons, Udinese mingled with the biggest Serie A clubs, the \"Seven Sisters\".<ref>[[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[SS Lazio]], [[A.C. Milan]], [[Parma F.C.|Parma AC]], and [[A.S. Roma]] were considered in a class of their own, as they dominated the seven first spots of the league every year.</ref> Helveg played 30 of 34 games as Udinese finished in fifth place of the [[1996\u201397 Serie A]] season, and qualified for European football for the first time in club history. In the following season, Helveg played four games for Udinese in the European [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] tournament, and helped the club finish in a meriting third place of the [[1997\u201398 Serie A]] season. Both Helveg and Martin J\u00f8rgensen were included in new national manager [[Bo Johansson]]'s Danish squad for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Their connection was evident in their joint celebration following Helveg's goal in Denmark's 4\u20131 win over [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in the World Cup round of 16.\n\n===Milan===\nBefore the 1998 World Cup, Helveg had been sold to [[A.C. Milan]], alongside his Udinese teammate [[Oliver Bierhoff]]. The [[transfer deal]] made Helveg the most expensive Danish player at the time, at the price of \u00a36 million.<ref>Thorsten Dam, \"''Thomas Helveg solgt for rekordbel\u00f8b''\", [[Berlingske Tidende]], 31 May 1998 (amount translated from [[Danish krone]]r)</ref> The shift from Udinese to A.C. Milan was made easier, when Milan later signed manager Alberto Zaccheroni from the Udinese days. The trio gained success in [[Milano]], as the club won the Italian championship, ''Lo Scudetto'', in 1998\u201399. Thomas Helveg played a large role in the success as a starter in almost every game in the season. In the next two seasons he was still first choice, but in the season 2001\u201302 he began to be challenged severely by the young Italian players like [[Gennaro Gattuso]] and [[Massimo Ambrosini]]. He scored his first goal for the club on 6 December 2000; the only goal in a 1-0 win at [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1057494.stm |title=Helveg strike sinks Deportivo |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 December 2000 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2001\u201302 season he played less than half of Milan's games in Serie A, and following only eight of 34 matches in the 2002\u201303 season, he moved to [[Inter Milan]] \u2013 the [[Derby della Madonnina|cross-city rivals]] of A.C. Milan \u2013 before the season 2003\u201304. Helveg was in fact already owned by Inter, who had bought him in November 2000 (swapped with [[Cyril Domoraud]]), and subsequently loaned him to A.C. Milan for three and a half seasons for a peppercorn. Through his five years at A.C. Milan, Helveg had been selected for Denmark in both the [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] as well as [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. While the Euro 2000 was no success for neither Denmark nor Helveg, who had an injury which limited him to playing a combined 98 minutes in two games, the 2002 World Cup gave him more time on the pitch. He played full-time in the three successful group stage matches, until another injury forced him to leave the pitch in the seventh minute of Denmark's final game before elimination.\n\n===Veteran years===\nIn Inter Milan, he rejoined his former manager in both Udinese and A.C. Milan, Alberto Zaccheroni. Helveg regained some of his form and played 22 games in Serie A and six matches in the European cups. In this his last year in Italy, he was from time to time also used in the left side of the defence. He was once more a part of a European Championship tournament, when he played full-time in Denmark's four games at the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. Helveg was named national team captain following the retirement of [[Ren\u00e9 Henriksen]] after the Euro 2004 tournament. After a year at Inter Milan, Helveg moved on to play in England in the summer 2004.\n\nHe joined [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on a [[Free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]]. Norwich had been promoted to the English [[FA Premier League]] and saw Helveg as a signing who would bring class and experience to the side. His signing was seen as something of a coup for Norwich, but Helveg struggled to reproduce the form shown in Serie A and on the international scene, and he lost his place in the starting line-up in the opening weeks of the season. After a long absence, partly due to injury, he regained his place in the side in early 2005, this time in central midfield. He finished the season, in typically versatile fashion, as the first choice right back. After a largely disappointing season, Norwich was relegated. Helveg left the club, having shown only flashes of his former class.\n\nHelveg signed a two-year contract with German club [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] in the [[Bundesliga]] championship. Four appearances into his M\u00f6nchengladbach debut season, he sustained a serious [[achilles tendon]] injury that forced him out for more than eight months. He returned to Bundesliga action at the end of that season, coming on as a substitute in injury-time in M\u00f6nchengladbach's final match. Having played eight of M\u00f6nchengladbach's first 19 games during the 2006\u201307 season, Helveg was dropped from the Danish national team by national manager [[Morten Olsen]]. Helveg and M\u00f6nchengladbach mutually terminated his contract in January 2007, and he moved back to play for OB.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/360941/artikel_Helveg-wechselt-zu-Odense-BK.html | title = Helveg wechselt zu Odense BK | publisher = kicker.de | date = 31 January 2007 | language = German | accessdate = 21 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 December 2010, Helveg played the last match of his career.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Club===\n:''The following table is up to date as of 28 April 2007''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"2\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[UEFA|Europe]]\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|[[Odense BK]]<ref name=\"resol\">{{cite web|url=http://resol.dr.dk/sportservice_person.aspx?personid=11828 |title=Danmarks Radio career statistics |publisher=resol.dr.dk |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314065933/http://resol.dr.dk/sportservice_person.aspx?personid=11828 |archivedate=14 March 2007 }}</ref>\n|[[1989 Danish 1st Division|1989]]\n|2||1||?||?||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||2||1\n|-\n|[[1990 Danish 1st Division|1990]]\n|19||2||?||?||2||0||\u2013||\u2013||21||2\n|-\n|[[1991 Danish Superliga|1991]]\n|17||0||?||?||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||17||0\n|-\n|[[1991\u201392 Danish Superliga|1991\u201392]]\n|21||0||?||?||1||0||\u2013||\u2013||22||0\n|-\n|[[1992\u201393 Danish Superliga|1992\u201393]]\n|31||1||?||?||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||31||1\n|-\n|[[1993\u201394 Danish Superliga|1993\u201394]]\n|13||0||?||?||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||13||0\n|-\n!Total\n!103!!4!!?!!?!!3!!0!!0!!0!!106!!4\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]<ref name=\"ef\">{{cite web|url=http://espacefootball.ifrance.com/helveg.htm |title=Thomas Helveg |publisher=espacefootball.ifrance.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503212326/http://espacefootball.ifrance.com/helveg.htm |archivedate=3 May 2007 }}</ref>\n|[[1993\u201394 Serie A|1993\u201394]]\n|22||2||2||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||24||2\n|-\n|[[1994\u201395 Serie B|1994\u201395]]\n|30||1||2||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||32||1\n|-\n|[[1995\u201396 Serie A|1995\u201396]]\n|31||2||1||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||32||2\n|-\n|[[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397]]\n|30||1||0||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||30||1\n|-\n|[[1997\u201398 Serie A|1997\u201398]]\n|28||0||2||0||4||0||\u2013||\u2013||34||0\n|-\n!Total\n!141!!6!!7!!0!!4!!0!!0!!0!!152!!6\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[A.C.

The most prominent period of his career was five years with Italian club [[A.C. Milan]], with whom he won the 1999 [[Serie A]] championship and 2003 [[UEFA Champions League]] tournament.\n\nHelveg was named 1994 [[Danish Football Player of the Year|Danish ''Player of the Year'']], the year he made his debut for the [[Denmark national football team]]. He has played 108 games and scored two goals for Denmark. He has played for Denmark under three different national coaches, and has participated in the 1996, 2000 and 2004 [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] and the 1998 and 2002 [[FIFA World Cup]] tournaments.\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Odense]], Helveg started his senior career at local club [[Odense Boldklub]] (OB) in the top-flight [[Danish 1st Division]]. Helveg played two matches in the last part of OB's [[Danish 1st Division 1989|1989 1st Division]] winning season, and he was soon a part of the OB [[first team]] alongside later national team players [[Allan Nielsen]] and [[Brian Steen Nielsen]]. Helveg represented Denmark at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], playing all three Denmark matches in the tournament. When OB played English club [[Arsenal F.C.]] in the 1993\u201394 [[Cup Winners' Cup]] tournament, Helveg was put to the task of handling [[England national football team|English international]] striker [[Ian Wright]], for which he received praise.<ref>Leif Rasmussen, \"''Ob blev p\u00e5 toget''\", [[Ekstra Bladet]], 30 September 1993</ref>\n\n===Moving abroad===\nThomas Helveg's international career began when he was [[loan (sports)|loaned out]] for six months by OB, in November 1993. He joined Italian club [[Udinese Calcio]], who were [[relegation]] battlers in the [[Serie A]] championship. He made his Udinese debut in a 0\u20130 draw with [[Atalanta B.C.]] on 28 November 1993, and played 22 games and scored two goals in his first season at the club. Even though Udinese was relegated to the [[Serie B]] at the end of the season, he received his first call-up to the Denmark national team by national manager [[Richard M\u00f8ller Nielsen]] in April 1994. He came on as a substitute in the 14th minute for the injured [[John Jensen]], and Helveg would receive rave reviews for his performance,<ref>Allan Nielsen, \"''Skaden f\u00f8dte en storspiller''\", [[Politiken]], 21 April 1994</ref> making him a mainstay in the Denmark squad from day one. Despite their relegation, he was bought by Udinese and was soon to have success in the [[Udine]] club. Combined with his international breakthrough with the Denmark team, his first year at Udinese earned him the 1994 [[Danish Player of the Year|Danish ''Player of the Year'']] award.\n\nFor five seasons, he was first choice in the right side of the Udinese starting line-up, as a [[Wing-back (association football)|wingback]] charging up and down the sideline. He played 30 of 38 games, as Udinese finished second in the [[1994\u201395 Serie B]] season, and won [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] back into the Serie A after a single season in Serie B. Under guidance of coach [[Alberto Zaccheroni]], Udinese steadily became a tough opponent for the other clubs in Serie A, and finished in tenth place of the [[1995\u201396 Serie A]] season. Helveg scored his first national team goal in June 1996, before representing Denmark in his first major international tournament at the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996 European Championship]] (Euro 1996) later that month. He played all three Denmark matches in the preliminary group stage of the Euro 1996, which ended unsuccessfully in an early exit from the tournament.\n\nIn April 1997, he was joined at Udinese by fellow Danish player [[Martin J\u00f8rgensen]]. The pair developed a close relationship, naming each other nephew J\u00f8rgensen and uncle Helveg. For the next two seasons, Udinese mingled with the biggest Serie A clubs, the \"Seven Sisters\".<ref>[[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[SS Lazio]], [[A.C. Milan]], [[Parma F.C.|Parma AC]], and [[A.S. Roma]] were considered in a class of their own, as they dominated the seven first spots of the league every year.</ref> Helveg played 30 of 34 games as Udinese finished in fifth place of the [[1996\u201397 Serie A]] season, and qualified for European football for the first time in club history. In the following season, Helveg played four games for Udinese in the European [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] tournament, and helped the club finish in a meriting third place of the [[1997\u201398 Serie A]] season. Both Helveg and Martin J\u00f8rgensen were included in new national manager [[Bo Johansson]]'s Danish squad for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Their connection was evident in their joint celebration following Helveg's goal in Denmark's 4\u20131 win over [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in the World Cup round of 16.\n\n===Milan===\nBefore the 1998 World Cup, Helveg had been sold to [[A.C. Milan]], alongside his Udinese teammate [[Oliver Bierhoff]]. The [[transfer deal]] made Helveg the most expensive Danish player at the time, at the price of \u00a36 million.<ref>Thorsten Dam, \"''Thomas Helveg solgt for rekordbel\u00f8b''\", [[Berlingske Tidende]], 31 May 1998 (amount translated from [[Danish krone]]r)</ref> The shift from Udinese to A.C. Milan was made easier, when Milan later signed manager Alberto Zaccheroni from the Udinese days. The trio gained success in [[Milano]], as the club won the Italian championship, ''Lo Scudetto'', in 1998\u201399. Thomas Helveg played a large role in the success as a starter in almost every game in the season. In the next two seasons he was still first choice, but in the season 2001\u201302 he began to be challenged severely by the young Italian players like [[Gennaro Gattuso]] and [[Massimo Ambrosini]]. He scored his first goal for the club on 6 December 2000; the only goal in a 1-0 win at [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1057494.stm |title=Helveg strike sinks Deportivo |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 December 2000 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2001\u201302 season he played less than half of Milan's games in Serie A, and following only eight of 34 matches in the 2002\u201303 season, he moved to [[Inter Milan]] \u2013 the [[Derby della Madonnina|cross-city rivals]] of A.C. Milan \u2013 before the season 2003\u201304. Helveg was in fact already owned by Inter, who had bought him in November 2000 (swapped with [[Cyril Domoraud]]), and subsequently loaned him to A.C. Milan for three and a half seasons for a peppercorn. Through his five years at A.C. Milan, Helveg had been selected for Denmark in both the [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] as well as [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. While the Euro 2000 was no success for neither Denmark nor Helveg, who had an injury which limited him to playing a combined 98 minutes in two games, the 2002 World Cup gave him more time on the pitch. He played full-time in the three successful group stage matches, until another injury forced him to leave the pitch in the seventh minute of Denmark's final game before elimination.\n\n===Veteran years===\nIn Inter Milan, he rejoined his former manager in both Udinese and A.C. Milan, Alberto Zaccheroni. Helveg regained some of his form and played 22 games in Serie A and six matches in the European cups. In this his last year in Italy, he was from time to time also used in the left side of the defence. He was once more a part of a European Championship tournament, when he played full-time in Denmark's four games at the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. Helveg was named national team captain following the retirement of [[Ren\u00e9 Henriksen]] after the Euro 2004 tournament. After a year at Inter Milan, Helveg moved on to play in England in the summer 2004.\n\nHe joined [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on a [[Free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]]. Norwich had been promoted to the English [[FA Premier League]] and saw Helveg as a signing who would bring class and experience to the side. His signing was seen as something of a coup for Norwich, but Helveg struggled to reproduce the form shown in Serie A and on the international scene, and he lost his place in the starting line-up in the opening weeks of the season. After a long absence, partly due to injury, he regained his place in the side in early 2005, this time in central midfield. He finished the season, in typically versatile fashion, as the first choice right back. After a largely disappointing season, Norwich was relegated. Helveg left the club, having shown only flashes of his former class.\n\nHelveg signed a two-year contract with German club [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] in the [[Bundesliga]] championship. Four appearances into his M\u00f6nchengladbach debut season, he sustained a serious [[achilles tendon]] injury that forced him out for more than eight months. He returned to Bundesliga action at the end of that season, coming on as a substitute in injury-time in M\u00f6nchengladbach's final match. Having played eight of M\u00f6nchengladbach's first 19 games during the 2006\u201307 season, Helveg was dropped from the Danish national team by national manager [[Morten Olsen]]. Helveg and M\u00f6nchengladbach mutually terminated his contract in January 2007, and he moved back to play for OB.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/360941/artikel_Helveg-wechselt-zu-Odense-BK.html | title = Helveg wechselt zu Odense BK | publisher = kicker.de | date = 31 January 2007 | language = German | accessdate = 21 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 December 2010, Helveg played the last match of his career.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Club===\n:''The following table is up to date as of 28 April 2007''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"2\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[UEFA|Europe]]\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|[[Odense BK]]<ref name=\"resol\">{{cite web|url=http://resol.dr.dk/sportservice_person.aspx?personid=11828 |title=Danmarks Radio career statistics |publisher=resol.dr.dk |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314065933/http://resol.dr.dk/sportservice_person.aspx?personid=11828 |archivedate=14 March 2007 }}</ref>\n|[[1989 Danish 1st Division|1989]]\n|2||1||?||?||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||2||1\n|-\n|[[1990 Danish 1st Division|1990]]\n|19||2||?||?||2||0||\u2013||\u2013||21||2\n|-\n|[[1991 Danish Superliga|1991]]\n|17||0||?||?||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||17||0\n|-\n|[[1991\u201392 Danish Superliga|1991\u201392]]\n|21||0||?||?||1||0||\u2013||\u2013||22||0\n|-\n|[[1992\u201393 Danish Superliga|1992\u201393]]\n|31||1||?||?||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||31||1\n|-\n|[[1993\u201394 Danish Superliga|1993\u201394]]\n|13||0||?||?||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||13||0\n|-\n!Total\n!103!!4!!?!!?!!3!!0!!0!!0!!106!!4\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]<ref name=\"ef\">{{cite web|url=http://espacefootball.ifrance.com/helveg.htm |title=Thomas Helveg |publisher=espacefootball.ifrance.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503212326/http://espacefootball.ifrance.com/helveg.htm |archivedate=3 May 2007 }}</ref>\n|[[1993\u201394 Serie A|1993\u201394]]\n|22||2||2||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||24||2\n|-\n|[[1994\u201395 Serie B|1994\u201395]]\n|30||1||2||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||32||1\n|-\n|[[1995\u201396 Serie A|1995\u201396]]\n|31||2||1||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||32||2\n|-\n|[[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397]]\n|30||1||0||0||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||30||1\n|-\n|[[1997\u201398 Serie A|1997\u201398]]\n|28||0||2||0||4||0||\u2013||\u2013||34||0\n|-\n!Total\n!141!!6!!7!!0!!4!!0!!0!!0!!152!!6\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[A.C.

Taxila is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], valued for its archaeological and religious history.\n\n===Gandhara civilisation===\n[[Gandh\u0101ra]] was an ancient kingdom situated in the northwestern region of Pakistan, in the [[Peshawar valley]] and [[Potohar plateau]] with its capital at [[Taxila]] in modern northwestern Pakistan. Gandhara existed since the time of the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1500\u20131200 BC),<ref name=\"auto22\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01126.htm|title=Rigveda 1.126:7, English translation by Ralph TH Griffith|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325215648/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01126.htm|archivedate=25 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wM-dNOa7fMC&pg=PA130&dq=gandharis+rgveda#v=onepage&q=gandharis+rgveda&f=false|title=A History of Sanskrit Literature|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|date=29 December 2017|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=9788120800953|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208190332/https://books.google.com/books?id=8wM-dNOa7fMC&pg=PA130&dq=gandharis+rgveda#v=onepage&q=gandharis+rgveda&f=false|archivedate=8 February 2018|url-status=live|via=Google Books}}</ref> as well as the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]], which mentions it as ''Va\u0113k\u0259r\u0259ta'', the sixth most beautiful place on earth, created by [[Ahura Mazda]]. Gandhara was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC. Later it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 327 BC, it subsequently became part of the [[Maurya Empire]] and then the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The name of the [[Gandhari people|Gandh\u0101ris]] is attested in the Rigveda ([[Mandala 1|RV 1]].126.7<ref name=\"auto22\" />) and in ancient inscriptions dating back to Achaemenid Persia. The primary cities of Gandhara were Puru\u1e63apura ([[Peshawar]]), Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101 ([[Taxila]]), and Pushkalavati ([[Charsadda]]). Gandhara's language was a [[Prakrit]] or \"Middle Indo-Aryan\" dialect, usually called G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b. The language used the Kharosthi script, which died out about the 4th century. However [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Kohistani language|Kohistani]], and [[Hindko]] are derived from the Prakrit that were spoken in Gandhara and its surrounding areas.\n\n===Central Asian, Greek and Persian Empires===\nThe [[Achaemenid]] Persian empire included Gandhara and western Punjab, administered through the satrapies of [[Gand\u0101ra]], [[Hindush]] and [[Sattagydia]]. \n[[File:AlexanderConquestsInIndia.jpg|thumb|Alexander's Indian Campaign]]\nHaving conquered [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]], [[Gedrosia]] and [[Seistan]] in ten days, [[Alexander the Great]] (known in Urdu as [[Sikandar-e-Azam|'Sikander-e-Azam']]) crossed the [[Hindu Kush]] and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold, gems and pearls. However, Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains. Having taken a northeasterly direction, he marched against the Aspii (mountaineers), who offered vigorous resistance, but were subdued.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Alexander then marched through [[Ghazni]], blockaded Magassa, and then marched to Ora and Bazira. Turning to the northeast, Alexander marched to Pucela, the capital of the district now known as Pakhli. He entered Western Punjab, where the ancient city of Nysa (at the site of modern-day [[Mong, Punjab|Mong]]) was situated. A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians, the people of [[Multan]], who were very skilful in war. Alexander invested many troops, eventually killing 17,000 Cathians in this battle, and the city of Sagala (present-day [[Sialkot]]) was razed to the ground. The [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] was fought astride the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] River in western Punjab against the regional chieftain Porus, and the [[Mallian Campaign|Siege of the Malli Tribe]] which occurred at the confluence of the Indus and Hydaspes Rivers near modern [[Multan]] (during which Alexander suffered a near-fatal arrow wound). Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C. and continued to campaign down the course of the Indus River in modern-day Sindh and Baluchistan.\n\n===Indo-Greek Kingdom===\nThe [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] or Graeco-Indian Kingdom was a Hellenistic kingdom covering most of the Punjab. The kingdom was founded when the Graeco-Bactrian king [[Demetrius]] invaded the subcontinent early in the 2nd century BC. The city of [[Sirkap]] founded by Demetrius combines Greek and Indian influences without signs of segregation between the two cultures. The most famous Indo-Greek ruler was [[Menander]] (Milinda). He had his capital at [[Sagala]] in the Punjab (present-day [[Sialkot]]). The Indo-Greeks were involved with local faiths, particularly with Buddhism, but also with Hinduism'. Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and their rule, especially that of [[Menander]], has been remembered as benevolent.\n\n=== Indo-Scythian Kingdom ===\nThe [[Indo-Scythian]] king [[Maues]] invaded Indo-Greek territories in Punjab and established an Indo-Scythian empire. Maues first conquered Gandhara and Taxila around 80 BCE, but his kingdom disintegrated after his death. The Indo-Scythians ultimately established a kingdom in the northwest south Asia, based near Taxila, with two great Satraps, one in [[Mathura]] in the east, and one in Surastrene (Gujarat) in the southwest. The Indo-Scythians seem to have been followers of Buddhism, and many of their practices apparently continued those of the Indo-Greeks.\n\n===Indo-Parthian Kingdom===\nThe [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] was ruled by the Gondopharid dynasty with its capital at [[Taxila]], Punjab. [[Gondophares]], founder of the Indo-Parthian kingdom, was a ruler of Seistan in what is today eastern Iran, probably a vassal or relative of the Apracarajas. Around 20\u201310 BCE, he made conquests in the former Indo-Scythian kingdom, perhaps after the death of the important ruler [[Azes]]. Gondophares became the ruler of areas comprising Arachosia, Seistan, Sindh, Punjab, and the Kabul valley. The temple of [[Jandial]], Taxila is usually interpreted as a Zoroastrian fire temple from the period of the Indo-Parthians.\n\n=== Kushan and Hephthalite Empires ===\nThe [[Kushan Empire]] was a syncretic empire, formed by the Yuezhi, in the Bactrian territories in the early 1st century. Around 75 CE under the leadership of Kujula Kadphises they gained control of Gandhara and other parts of what is now Pakistan. The Kushan period is considered the Golden Period of Gandhara. Gandhara's culture peaked during the reign of the Kushan ruler [[Kanishka the Great]] (128\u2013151). The cities of Taxila (Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101) at Sirsukh and Peshawar were built. Kanishka was a great patron of the Buddhist faith; Buddhism spread to Central Asia and the Far East across Bactria and [[Sogdia]], where his empire met the [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]] of China. Buddhist art spread from Gandhara to other parts of Asia. Under Kanishka, Gandhara became a holy land of Buddhism and attracted Chinese pilgrims eager to view the monuments associated with many [[Jataka tales|Jatakas]]. The [[Hephthalite|Hephthalite Huns]] captured Gandhara around 451, and did not adopt Buddhism, but in fact \"perpetrated frightful massacres.\" [[Mihirakula]] became a \"terrible persecutor\" of the Buddhist religion.<ref name=\"Rene2\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/69|title=The Empire of the Steppes|last=Grousset|first=Rene|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1970|isbn=0-8135-1304-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/69 69\u201371]}}</ref> During their rule, [[Hinduism]] revived itself and the Buddhist civilisation in Gandhara declined.\n\n=== Islamic Empires ===\n==== Arrival of Islam  ====\n[[File:Mahmud and Ayaz and Shah Abbas I.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Persian miniature of [[Mahmud Ghazni|Mahmud of Ghazni]] (right in red robe) shaking a Sufi's hand.

Another equally important saint for Punjabis was the Punjabi Muslim [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar]] also known reverentially as B\u0101b\u0101 Far\u012bd or Shaikh Far\u012bd. He is widely considered to be one of the earliest proponents of Punjabi as the language of poetry. Far\u012bd laid the basis for a vernacular Punjabi literature and ultimately a Punjabi identity.\n\nThe area subsequently came under various other Islamic rulers until finally becoming part of the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1526.\n\n==== Mughal Empire ====\nThe Punjab region rose to significance in the [[Mughal Empire]] when [[Lahore]] became the capital for the royal family in 1584,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania|date=1994|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=522}}</ref> the legacy of which is seen today in its rich display of [[Mughal architecture]] all over modern day Punjab, Pakistan.\n\nThe Mughals left an indelible mark on the landscape of Punjab from 1556 to 1739 by commissioning the construction of great gardens, forts, tombs, baths and mosques such as the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mughalgardens.org/html/shalamar.html |title=Shalamar Garden |website=Gardens of the Mughal Empire |access-date=1 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724112652/http://www.mughalgardens.org/html/shalamar.html |archivedate=24 July 2016 }}</ref> [[Lahore Fort]], [[Tomb of Jahangir]], [[Tomb of Nur Jahan]], [[Shahi Hammam]], [[Akbari Sarai]], [[Wazir Khan Mosque]], and the [[Badshahi Mosque]], all situated in Lahore, as well as architectural projects such as [[Hiran Minar]] and others elsewhere in Punjab.

During the [[Mughal empire]], many Hindus increasingly adopted [[Sikhism]]. The Sikhs became a formidable military force after the death of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707 and challenged the Mughals and later the Durrani Afghans for power in Punjab. After fighting [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in the later eighteenth century, the Sikh Misls took control of Punjab and its capital Lahore was captured by the [[Bhangi Misl]]. In 1799 [[Ranjit Singh]], ruler of the [[Sukerchakia Misl]], defeated the Bhangi Misl and captured Lahore thereby proclaiming himself as the \"Maharaja of Punjab\" at the age of 21. Ranjit Singh made Lahore his capital and formed a sophisticated [[Sikh Empire]] which lasted from 1799 to 1849. Ranjit Singh modernized his Sikh Khalsa army by using Franco-British principles and by employing veterans of the Napoleonic Wars to train the infantry in European style. Ranjit Singh expanded his empire so that by his death in 1839 his empire included most of [[Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Kashmir]].\n\nRanjit Singh was not without opponents who challenged his authority in the regions he had conquered. He faced huge opposition from [[Nawab Muzaffar Khan]], [[Azim Khan]], [[Syed Ahmad Barelvi]] and [[Mir Painda Khan]]. In 1818 Nawab Muzaffar Khan was killed by the Sikhs at the [[Battle of Multan]] after putting up stout resistance for many years. Azim Khan was the governor of Kashmir from 1812 until 1819 when Ranjit Singh captured it for himself. In 1823 Azim Khan took control of Peshawar and with support from Pashtun tribesmen faced off against the encroaching Khalsa army in the [[Battle of Nowshera]]. He abandoned his troops whilst they regrouped to continue fighting until they were defeated. Azim Khan retreated to Kabul where he died shortly thereafter due to grief. Syed Ahmad Barelvi was an Indian Muslim who declared Jihad against the Sikhs by garnering support from local Pashtun tribesmen and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Sharia.<ref name=\"Mortimer, Edward 1982 p.68-70\">Mortimer, Edward, Faith and Power, (1982), p.68-70</ref> In 1821 Syed Ahmad Barelvi spent two years organizing popular and material support for his Punjab campaign. In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at [[Akora Khattak]], with no decisive result. Barelvi's movement weakened after there was infighting with his Pashtun followers and in a major battle near the town of [[Balakot]] in 1831, Syed Ahmad Barelvi and [[Shah Ismail Shaheed]] with volunteer Muslims were defeated and killed by the Sikh Army.<ref name=\"Grey1993\">{{cite book|last=Grey|first=C.|title=European Adventures of Northern India|year=1993|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0853-5|pages=343\u2013}}</ref> Only Mir Painda Khan was able to maintain his independence at [[Tanawal]] in [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] from the Sikh Empire. From about 1813 he began a series of rebellions against the Sikhs which continued throughout his lifetime inflicting defeats on the Sikhs whilst also losing territory to them before being poisoned in 1844.

Relationships with neighbouring British territories then broke down, starting the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]]; this led to a British official being resident in Lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the Satluj to [[British India]]. After the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849, the Sikh Empire became the last territory to be merged into British India. In [[Jhelum]] 35 British soldiers of the HM XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].<ref>''Freedom fighters of India'' {{ISBN|8-18205-468-0}} pp. 40-41</ref>\n\n===Pakistani Independence===\nIn 1947 the Punjab province of [[British Raj|British India]] was divided along religious lines into [[West Punjab]] and [[East Punjab]]. Western Punjab was assimilated into the new country of [[Pakistan]], while East Punjab became a part of [[modern-day India]]. This led to massive rioting as both sides committed atrocities against fleeing refugees.\n\nThe part of [[Punjab region|the Punjab]] now in Pakistan once formed a major region of British Punjab, and was home to a large minority population of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]] up to 1947 apart from the Muslim majority.<ref>The Punjab in 1920s \u2013 A Case study of Muslims, Zarina Salamat, Royal Book Company, [[Karachi]], 1997. table 45, pp. 136. {{ISBN|969-407-230-1}}</ref>\n\nMigration between Eastern and Western Punjab was continuous before [[Partition of India|independence]]. By the 1900s Western Punjab was predominantly Muslim and supported the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]]. After independence, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to [[India]] while [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in the Western Punjab and across [[Pakistan]], having fled [[pogroms]] that almost entirely depopulated Eastern Punjab of its Muslim population.<ref>Dube, I. &.

Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Pakistani Ranger.jpg|thumb|At the [[Wagah border ceremony]]]]\nSince the 1950s, Punjab industrialised rapidly. New factories were established in [[Lahore]], [[Sargodha]], [[Multan]], [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Sialkot]], [[Wah]] and [[Rawal Pindi|Rawalpindi]].\n\nAgriculture continues to be the largest sector of Punjab's economy. The province is the breadbasket of the country as well as home to the largest ethnic group in Pakistan, the [[Punjabis]]. Unlike neighbouring India, there was no large-scale redistribution of agricultural land. As a result, most rural areas are dominated by a small set of feudalistic [[Zamindar|land-owning families]].\n\nIn the 1950s there was tension between the eastern and western halves of Pakistan. To address the situation, a new formula resulted in the abolition of the province status for Punjab in 1955. It was merged into a single province [[West Pakistan]]. In 1972, after [[East Pakistan]] seceded and became [[Bangladesh]], Punjab again became a province.\n\nPunjab witnessed major battles between the armies of [[Indian Army|India]] and [[Pakistan Army|Pakistan]] in the wars of [[1965 War|1965]] and [[1971 War|1971]]. Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan's nuclear program such as [[Kahuta]]. It also hosts major military bases such as at [[Sargodha]] and [[Rawalpindi]]. The peace process between India and Pakistan, which began in earnest in 2004, has helped pacify the situation. Trade and people-to-people contacts through the [[Wagah]] border are now starting to become common. Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as [[Nankana Sahib]].\n\nStarting in the 1980s, large numbers of Punjabis migrated to the Middle East, Britain, Spain, Canada and the United States for economic opportunities, forming the large [[Punjabi diaspora]], resulting in growing economic ties between Punjab and these countries.\n\n==Geography==\nPunjab is Pakistan's second largest province by area after [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] with an area of {{convert|205344|km2|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"Punjab\">{{cite web|title=Punjab|url=http://www.smeda.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69&Itemid=174|publisher=Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority|accessdate=14 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625202613/http://www.smeda.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69&Itemid=174|archivedate=25 June 2016}}</ref> It occupies 25.8% of the total landmass of [[Pakistan]].<ref name=\"Punjab\"/> Punjab province is bordered by [[Sindh]] to the south, the province of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] to the southwest, the province of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] to the west, and the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] in the north.

Sparse [[deserts]] can be found in southern Punjab near the border with [[Rajasthan]] and near the Sulaiman Range. Punjab also contains part of the [[Thal Desert|Thal]] and [[Cholistan Desert|Cholistan]] deserts.

Its canal-irrigation system established by the British is the largest in the world. Wheat and cotton are the largest crops. Other crops include rice, [[sugarcane]], [[millet]], [[maize|corn]], [[oilseeds]], [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]], vegetables, and fruits such as [[kinoo]]. Livestock and poultry production are also important. Despite past animosities, the rural masses in Punjab's farms continue to use the Hindu calendar for planting and harvesting.\n\nPunjab contributes about 76% to annual food grain production in the country. Cotton and rice are important crops. They are the [[cash crops]] that contribute substantially to the national exchequer. Attaining self-sufficiency in agriculture has shifted the focus of the strategies towards small and medium farming, stress on barani areas, farms-to-market roads, electrification for tube-wells and control of water logging and salinity.\n\nPunjab has also more than 68 thousand industrial units. There are 39,033 small and cottage industrial units. The number of textile units is 14,820. The ginning industries are 6,778. There are 7,355 units for processing of agricultural raw materials including food and feed industries.\n\nLahore and Gujranwala Divisions have the largest concentration of small light engineering units. The district of Sialkot excels in sports goods, surgical instruments and cutlery goods.\n\nPunjab is also a mineral-rich province with extensive mineral deposits of coal, iron, gas, petrol, [[rock salt]] (with the second largest salt mine in the world), [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], [[gypsum]], and silica-sand. The Punjab Mineral Development Corporation is running over a hundred economically viable projects. Manufacturing includes machine products, cement, plastics, and various other goods.\n\nThe incidence of poverty differs between the different regions of Punjab. With Northern and Central Punjab facing much lower levels of poverty than Western and Southern Punjab. Those living in Southern and Western Punjab are also a lot more dependent on agriculture due to lower levels of industrialisation in those regions.\n\n{{As of|2012|6}}, Pakistan's electricity problems were so severe that violent riots were taking place across Punjab. According to protesters, [[load shedding]] was depriving the cities of electricity 20\u201322 hours a day, causing businesses to go bust and making living extremely hard.

The ruins of [[Harappa]] show an advanced urban culture that flourished over 8000 years ago. [[Taxila (modern)|Ancient Taxila]], another historic landmark also stands out as a proof of the achievements of the area in learning, arts and crafts. The ancient Hindu [[Katasraj temple]] and the Salt Range temples are regaining attention and are in need of repair.\n\nMosques abound all over Punjab and vary in architectural style. Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab. The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam (1320 AD) at [[Multan]] are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy. The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi (1150 AD) at Multan. A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar, with its brilliant blue dome. The tile-work of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] is of a richer and more elaborate nature. The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world.\n\n==Fairs and festivals==\n{{Main|Punjabi festivals (Pakistan)}}\nThe culture of Punjab derives its basis from the institution of [[Sufism|Sufi saints]], who spread Islam and preached and lived the Muslim way of life. People have festivities to commemorate these traditions. The fairs and festivals of Punjab reflect the entire gamut of its folk life and cultural traditions. These mainly fall in the following categories:\n\n===Religious and seasonal fairs and festivals===\nReligious fairs are held on special days of Islamic significance like [[Eid ul-Adha]], [[Eid-ul-Fitr]], [[Milad al-Nabi|Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi]], [[Shahb-e-Barat]], [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], [[Laylat al-Qadr]] and [[Jumu'ah-tul-Wida]]. The main activities on these special occasions are confined to congregational prayers and rituals. Melas are also held to mark these occasions.\n\n===Devotional fairs (Urs)===\n[[File:Data Sahib night view.JPG|220px|thumb|Punjab is famous for various shrines of [[Sufi]] saints and [[Data durbar]] in particular]]\nThe fairs held at the shrines of [[Sufi]] saints are called [[urs]]. They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint. On these occasions, devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint. Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy. The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing. It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages. The most important urs are: urs of Data [[Ali Hujwiri|Ganj Buksh]] at [[Lahore]], urs of [[Sultan Bahu]] at [[Jhang]], urs of Shah Jewna at [[Jhang]], urs of [[Mian Mir]] at Lahore, urs of [[Baba Farid]] Ganj Shakar at [[Pakpattan]], urs of Bahaudin Zakria at [[Multan]], urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at [[Dera Ghazi Khan]], urs of [[Shah Hussain]] at Lahore, urs of [[Bulleh Shah]] at [[Kasur]], urs of Imam Bari (Bari Shah Latif) at [[Rawalpindi]]-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayat Qadri (the murrshad of [[Bulleh Shah]]) in Lahore.\n\nA big fair/mela is organised at [[Jandiala Sher Khan]] in district [[Sheikhupura]] on the mausoleum of Syed [[Waris Shah]] who is the most loved Sufi poet of Punjab due to his classic work, [[Heer Ranjha]]. The shrine of [[Heer Ranjha]] in [[Jhang]] is one of the most visited shrines in Punjab.\n[[File:Badshahi Mosque, Lahore.JPG|220px|thumb|right|[[Badshahi Mosque]], built by Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] at [[Lahore]]]]\n\n===Industrial and commercial fairs===\nExhibitions and annual horse shows in all districts and a national horse and cattle show at Lahore are held with the official patronage. The national horse and cattle show at Lahore is the biggest festival where sports, exhibitions, and livestock competitions are held. It not only encourages and patronises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots.\n\n===Other festivals===\nVaisakhi, also called Besakhi, is a harvest festival to celebrate harvesting the wheat crop. Colourful festivals are held at the time of Besakhi when farmers are free to enjoy their leisure time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DsRjAAAAMAAJ&dq=besakhi+pakistan+as+memories+come&q=attract|title=As memories come|first=M.

The [[Anarkali|Anarkali Market]] and [[Jahangir]]'s Tomb are prominent in the city of [[Lahore]] as is the [[Lahore Museum]], while the ancient city of [[Taxila]] in the northwest was once a major centre of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu civilization|Hindu]] influence. Several important [[Sikh]] shrines are in the province, including the birthplace of the first [[Guru]], [[Guru Nanak]]. (born at [[Nankana Sahib]]). There are a few famous hill stations, including [[Murree]], [[Bhurban]], [[Patriata]] and [[Fort Munro]].\n\nKatasraj Mandir is a [[Hindu]] temple complex situated in Katas village near [[Choa Saidanshah]] in the [[Chakwal District|Chakwal district]]. Dedicated to [[Shiva]], the temple has, according to Hindu legend, existed since the days of [[Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata]] and the [[Pandava]] brothers spent a substantial part of their exile at the site and later [[Krishna]] himself laid the foundation of this temple.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Khewra Salt Mine]] is a tourist attraction. Tours are accompanied by guides as the mine itself is very large and the complex interconnected passages are like a maze. There is a small but beautiful mosque inside the mine made from salt stone. A clinical ward with 20 beds was established in 2007<ref>{{cite news|title=Salt mine resort for asthma patients|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2007/03/27/nat18.htm|accessdate=14 April 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=27 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Shahzad|first=Khurram|title=Asthma treatment in Pakistani salt mine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7527907/Asthma-treatment-in-Pakistani-salt-mine.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=26 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710015656/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7527907/Asthma-treatment-in-Pakistani-salt-mine.html|archivedate=10 July 2012}}</ref> for the treatment of [[asthma]] and other respiratory diseases using [[salt therapy]].\n\n==Music and dance==\n{{Main|Music of Punjab|Punjabi dance}}\n[[File:Jashn-e-kharian.jpg|thumb|left|Various festivals in rural Punjab]]\nClassical music forms, such as [[Pakistani classical music]], are an important part of the cultural wealth of the Punjab. The Muslim musicians have contributed a large number of ragas to the repository of classical music. The most common instruments used are the [[tabla]] and [[Pump organ|harmonium]].\n\nAmong the Punjabi poets, the names of [[Baba Farid]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Sultan Bahu]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Waris Shah]] and [[Mian Muhammad Bakhsh|Mian Muhammad Baksh]] are well known. Amongst folk singers the likes of [[Inayat Hussain Bhatti]], [[Tufail Niazi]], [[Alam Lohar]], Sain Marna, Mansoor Malangi, Allah Ditta Lonawala, Talib Hussain Dard, [[Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi]], Gamoo Tahliwala, Mamzoo Gha-lla, Akbar Jat, [[Arif Lohar]], Ahmad Nawaz Cheena and Hamid Ali Bela are well-known. In the composition of classical ragas, there are such masters as ''Malika-i-Mauseequi'' (Queen of Music) Roshan Ara Begum, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan, Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Fateh Ali Khan. Alam Lohar has made significant contributions to folklore and Punjabi literature, by being a very influential Punjabi folk singer from 1930 until 1979.\n\nFor the popular taste however, light music, particularly Ghazals and folk songs, which have an appeal of their own, the names of [[Mehdi Hassan]], [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ghulam Ali]], [[Noor Jehan|Nur Jehan]], [[Malika Pukhraj]], [[Farida Khanum]], Roshen Ara Begum, and [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] are well-known. Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods: the rains, sowing and harvesting seasons. Luddi, Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living. Love legends of Heer Ranjha, Mirza Sahiban, Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles.\n\nFor the most popular music from the region, [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]], the names of [[Abrar-Ul-Haq]], [[Arif Lohar]], [[Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi]], [[Jawad Ahmed]], [[Sajjad Ali]], Legacy, and [[Malkoo]] are renowned.\n\n==Folklore==\n[[File:4094w sain-zahoor.jpg|thumb|Punjabi folk]]\n{{main|Punjabi folklore}}\nFolklore songs, ballads, epics and romances are generally written and sung in the various [[Punjabi dialects]].\n\nThere are a number of folk tales that are popular in different parts of the Punjab. These are the folk tales of [[Mirza Sahiban]], [[Sayful Muluk]], [[Yusuf Zulekha]], [[Heer Ranjha]], [[Sohni Mahiwal]], [[Dulla Bhatti]], and [[Sassi Punnun]].\nThe mystic folk songs include the ''Kafees'' of Khwaja Farid in Saraiki, Punjabi and the ''Shalooks'' by [[Baba Farid]]. They also include ''Baits'', ''Dohas'', ''Lohris'', ''Sehra'', and ''[[Jugni]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punjabilok.com/pakistan/pak_punjab.htm|title=punjabilok.com|accessdate=22 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920082514/http://www.punjabilok.com/pakistan/pak_punjab.htm|archivedate=20 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous of the romantic love songs are ''Mayhiah'', ''Dhola'' and ''Boliyan''. Punjabi romantic dances include Dharees, [[Dhamaal]], [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]], [[Giddha]], [[Dhola (dance)|Dhola]], and [[Sammi (dance)|Sammi]].\n\n==Social issues==\nOne social/educational issue is the status of Punjabi language. According to Manzur Ejaz, \"In Central Punjab, Punjabi is neither an official language of the province nor it is used as medium of education at any level. There are only two daily newspapers published in Punjabi in the Central areas of Punjab. Only a few monthly literary magazines constitute Punjabi press in Pakistan\".<ref>Sarah Veach, Katy Williamson, [http://languagemanuals.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/5/3/4853169/punjabi.pdf Punjabi Culture

Punjab reached the height of its splendour during the reign of the [[Mughal Empire]], which for a time ruled from Lahore. During the 18th century, [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire]] caused Mughal authority in the Punjab to fall apart and it thus fell into chaos. The Durrani Afghans under [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] wrested control of Punjab but lost it to the Sikhs after a successful rebellion which allowed Sikh armies to claim Lahore in 1759.

Taxila is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], valued for its archaeological and religious history.\n\n===Gandhara civilisation===\n[[Gandh\u0101ra]] was an ancient kingdom situated in the northwestern region of Pakistan, in the [[Peshawar valley]] and [[Potohar plateau]] with its capital at [[Taxila]] in modern northwestern Pakistan. Gandhara existed since the time of the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1500\u20131200 BC),<ref name=\"auto22\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01126.htm|title=Rigveda 1.126:7, English translation by Ralph TH Griffith|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325215648/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01126.htm|archivedate=25 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wM-dNOa7fMC&pg=PA130&dq=gandharis+rgveda#v=onepage&q=gandharis+rgveda&f=false|title=A History of Sanskrit Literature|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|date=29 December 2017|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=9788120800953|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208190332/https://books.google.com/books?id=8wM-dNOa7fMC&pg=PA130&dq=gandharis+rgveda#v=onepage&q=gandharis+rgveda&f=false|archivedate=8 February 2018|url-status=live|via=Google Books}}</ref> as well as the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]], which mentions it as ''Va\u0113k\u0259r\u0259ta'', the sixth most beautiful place on earth, created by [[Ahura Mazda]]. Gandhara was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC. Later it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 327 BC, it subsequently became part of the [[Maurya Empire]] and then the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The name of the [[Gandhari people|Gandh\u0101ris]] is attested in the Rigveda ([[Mandala 1|RV 1]].126.7<ref name=\"auto22\" />) and in ancient inscriptions dating back to Achaemenid Persia. The primary cities of Gandhara were Puru\u1e63apura ([[Peshawar]]), Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101 ([[Taxila]]), and Pushkalavati ([[Charsadda]]). Gandhara's language was a [[Prakrit]] or \"Middle Indo-Aryan\" dialect, usually called G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b. The language used the Kharosthi script, which died out about the 4th century. However [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Kohistani language|Kohistani]], and [[Hindko]] are derived from the Prakrit that were spoken in Gandhara and its surrounding areas.\n\n===Central Asian, Greek and Persian Empires===\nThe [[Achaemenid]] Persian empire included Gandhara and western Punjab, administered through the satrapies of [[Gand\u0101ra]], [[Hindush]] and [[Sattagydia]]. \n[[File:AlexanderConquestsInIndia.jpg|thumb|Alexander's Indian Campaign]]\nHaving conquered [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]], [[Gedrosia]] and [[Seistan]] in ten days, [[Alexander the Great]] (known in Urdu as [[Sikandar-e-Azam|'Sikander-e-Azam']]) crossed the [[Hindu Kush]] and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold, gems and pearls. However, Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains. Having taken a northeasterly direction, he marched against the Aspii (mountaineers), who offered vigorous resistance, but were subdued.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Alexander then marched through [[Ghazni]], blockaded Magassa, and then marched to Ora and Bazira. Turning to the northeast, Alexander marched to Pucela, the capital of the district now known as Pakhli. He entered Western Punjab, where the ancient city of Nysa (at the site of modern-day [[Mong, Punjab|Mong]]) was situated. A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians, the people of [[Multan]], who were very skilful in war. Alexander invested many troops, eventually killing 17,000 Cathians in this battle, and the city of Sagala (present-day [[Sialkot]]) was razed to the ground. The [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] was fought astride the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] River in western Punjab against the regional chieftain Porus, and the [[Mallian Campaign|Siege of the Malli Tribe]] which occurred at the confluence of the Indus and Hydaspes Rivers near modern [[Multan]] (during which Alexander suffered a near-fatal arrow wound). Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C. and continued to campaign down the course of the Indus River in modern day Sindh and Baluchistan.\n\n===Indo-Greek Kingdom===\nThe [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] or Graeco-Indian Kingdom was a Hellenistic kingdom covering most of the Punjab. The kingdom was founded when the Graeco-Bactrian king [[Demetrius]] invaded the subcontinent early in the 2nd century BC. The city of [[Sirkap]] founded by Demetrius combines Greek and Indian influences without signs of segregation between the two cultures. The most famous Indo-Greek ruler was [[Menander]] (Milinda). He had his capital at [[Sagala]] in the Punjab (present-day [[Sialkot]]). The Indo-Greeks were involved with local faiths, particularly with Buddhism, but also with Hinduism'. Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and their rule, especially that of [[Menander]], has been remembered as benevolent.\n\n=== Indo-Scythian Kingdom ===\nThe [[Indo-Scythian]] king [[Maues]] invaded Indo-Greek territories in Punjab and established an Indo-Scythian empire. Maues first conquered Gandhara and Taxila around 80 BCE, but his kingdom disintegrated after his death. The Indo-Scythians ultimately established a kingdom in the northwest south Asia, based near Taxila, with two great Satraps, one in [[Mathura]] in the east, and one in Surastrene (Gujarat) in the southwest. The Indo-Scythians seem to have been followers of Buddhism, and many of their practices apparently continued those of the Indo-Greeks.\n\n===Indo-Parthian Kingdom===\nThe [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] was ruled by the Gondopharid dynasty with its capital at [[Taxila]], Punjab. [[Gondophares]], founder of the Indo-Parthian kingdom, was a ruler of Seistan in what is today eastern Iran, probably a vassal or relative of the Apracarajas. Around 20\u201310 BCE, he made conquests in the former Indo-Scythian kingdom, perhaps after the death of the important ruler [[Azes]]. Gondophares became the ruler of areas comprising Arachosia, Seistan, Sindh, Punjab, and the Kabul valley. The temple of [[Jandial]], Taxila is usually interpreted as a Zoroastrian fire temple from the period of the Indo-Parthians.\n\n=== Kushan and Hephthalite Empires ===\nThe [[Kushan Empire]] was a syncretic empire, formed by the Yuezhi, in the Bactrian territories in the early 1st century. Around 75 CE under the leadership of Kujula Kadphises they gained control of Gandhara and other parts of what is now Pakistan. The Kushan period is considered the Golden Period of Gandhara. Gandhara's culture peaked during the reign of the Kushan ruler [[Kanishka the Great]] (128\u2013151). The cities of Taxila (Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101) at Sirsukh and Peshawar were built. Kanishka was a great patron of the Buddhist faith; Buddhism spread to Central Asia and the Far East across Bactria and [[Sogdia]], where his empire met the [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]] of China. Buddhist art spread from Gandhara to other parts of Asia. Under Kanishka, Gandhara became a holy land of Buddhism and attracted Chinese pilgrims eager to view the monuments associated with many [[Jataka tales|Jatakas]]. The [[Hephthalite|Hephthalite Huns]] captured Gandhara around 451, and did not adopt Buddhism, but in fact \"perpetrated frightful massacres.\" [[Mihirakula]] became a \"terrible persecutor\" of the Buddhist religion.<ref name=\"Rene2\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/69|title=The Empire of the Steppes|last=Grousset|first=Rene|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1970|isbn=0-8135-1304-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/69 69\u201371]}}</ref> During their rule, [[Hinduism]] revived itself and the Buddhist civilisation in Gandhara declined.\n\n=== Islamic Empires ===\n==== Arrival of Islam  ====\n[[File:Mahmud and Ayaz and Shah Abbas I.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Persian miniature of [[Mahmud Ghazni|Mahmud of Ghazni]] (right in red robe) shaking a Sufi's hand.

Another equally important saint for Punjabis was the Punjabi Muslim [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar]] also known reverentially as B\u0101b\u0101 Far\u012bd or Shaikh Far\u012bd. He is widely considered to be one of the earliest proponents of Punjabi as the language of poetry. Far\u012bd laid the basis for a vernacular Punjabi literature and ultimately a Punjabi identity.\n\nThe area subsequently came under various other Islamic rulers until finally becoming part of the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1526.\n\n==== Mughal Empire ====\nThe Punjab region rose to significance in the [[Mughal Empire]] when [[Lahore]] became the capital for the royal family in 1584,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania|date=1994|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=522}}</ref> the legacy of which is seen today in its rich display of [[Mughal architecture]] all over modern day Punjab, Pakistan.\n\nThe Mughals left an indelible mark on the landscape of Punjab from 1556 to 1739 by commissioning the construction of great gardens, forts, tombs, baths and mosques such as the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mughalgardens.org/html/shalamar.html |title=Shalamar Garden |website=Gardens of the Mughal Empire |access-date=1 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724112652/http://www.mughalgardens.org/html/shalamar.html |archivedate=24 July 2016 }}</ref> [[Lahore Fort]], [[Tomb of Jahangir]], [[Tomb of Nur Jahan]], [[Shahi Hammam]], [[Akbari Sarai]], [[Wazir Khan Mosque]], and the [[Badshahi Mosque]], all situated in Lahore, as well as architectural projects such as [[Hiran Minar]] and others elsewhere in Punjab.

During the [[Mughal empire]], many Hindus increasingly adopted [[Sikhism]]. The Sikhs became a formidable military force after the death of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707 and challenged the Mughals and later the Durrani Afghans for power in Punjab. After fighting [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in the later eighteenth century, the Sikh Misls took control of Punjab and its capital Lahore was captured by the [[Bhangi Misl]]. In 1799 [[Ranjit Singh]], ruler of the [[Sukerchakia Misl]], defeated the Bhangi Misl and captured Lahore thereby proclaiming himself as the \"Maharaja of Punjab\" at the age of 21. Ranjit Singh made Lahore his capital and formed a sophisticated [[Sikh Empire]] which lasted from 1799 to 1849. Ranjit Singh modernized his Sikh Khalsa army by using Franco-British principles and by employing veterans of the Napoleonic Wars to train the infantry in European style. Ranjit Singh expanded his empire so that by his death in 1839 his empire included most of [[Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Kashmir]].\n\nRanjit Singh was not without opponents who challenged his authority in the regions he had conquered. He faced huge opposition from [[Nawab Muzaffar Khan]], [[Azim Khan]], [[Syed Ahmad Barelvi]] and [[Mir Painda Khan]]. In 1818 Nawab Muzaffar Khan was killed by the Sikhs at the [[Battle of Multan]] after putting up stout resistance for many years. Azim Khan was the governor of Kashmir from 1812 until 1819 when Ranjit Singh captured it for himself. In 1823 Azim Khan took control of Peshawar and with support from Pashtun tribesmen faced off against the encroaching Khalsa army in the [[Battle of Nowshera]]. He abandoned his troops whilst they regrouped to continue fighting until they were defeated. Azim Khan retreated to Kabul where he died shortly thereafter due to grief. Syed Ahmad Barelvi was an Indian Muslim who declared Jihad against the Sikhs by garnering support from local Pashtun tribesmen and attempted to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Sharia.<ref name=\"Mortimer, Edward 1982 p.68-70\">Mortimer, Edward, Faith and Power, (1982), p.68-70</ref> In 1821 Syed Ahmad Barelvi spent two years organizing popular and material support for his Punjab campaign. In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at [[Akora Khattak]], with no decisive result. Barelvi's movement weakened after there was infighting with his Pashtun followers and in a major battle near the town of [[Balakot]] in 1831, Syed Ahmad Barelvi and [[Shah Ismail Shaheed]] with volunteer Muslims were defeated and killed by the Sikh Army.<ref name=\"Grey1993\">{{cite book|last=Grey|first=C.|title=European Adventures of Northern India|year=1993|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0853-5|pages=343\u2013}}</ref> Only Mir Painda Khan was able to maintain his independence at [[Tanawal]] in [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] from the Sikh Empire. From about 1813 he began a series of rebellions against the Sikhs which continued throughout his lifetime inflicting defeats on the Sikhs whilst also losing territory to them before being poisoned in 1844.

Relationships with neighbouring British territories then broke down, starting the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]]; this led to a British official being resident in Lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the Satluj to [[British India]]. After the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849, the Sikh Empire became the last territory to be merged into British India. In [[Jhelum]] 35 British soldiers of the HM XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].<ref>''Freedom fighters of India'' {{ISBN|8-18205-468-0}} pp. 40-41</ref>\n\n===Pakistani Independence===\nIn 1947 the Punjab province of [[British Raj|British India]] was divided along religious lines into [[West Punjab]] and [[East Punjab]]. Western Punjab was assimilated into the new country of [[Pakistan]], while East Punjab became a part of [[modern-day India]]. This led to massive rioting as both sides committed atrocities against fleeing refugees.\n\nThe part of [[Punjab region|the Punjab]] now in Pakistan once formed a major region of British Punjab, and was home to a large minority population of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]] up to 1947 apart from the Muslim majority.<ref>The Punjab in 1920s \u2013 A Case study of Muslims, Zarina Salamat, Royal Book Company, [[Karachi]], 1997. table 45, pp. 136. {{ISBN|969-407-230-1}}</ref>\n\nMigration between Eastern and Western Punjab was continuous before [[Partition of India|independence]]. By the 1900s Western Punjab was predominantly Muslim and supported the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]]. After independence, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to [[India]] while [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in the Western Punjab and across [[Pakistan]], having fled [[pogroms]] that almost entirely depopulated Eastern Punjab of its Muslim population.<ref>Dube, I. &.

New factories were established in [[Lahore]], [[Sargodha]], [[Multan]], [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Sialkot]], [[Wah]] and [[Rawal Pindi|Rawalpindi]].\n\nAgriculture continues to be the largest sector of Punjab's economy. The province is the breadbasket of the country as well as home to the largest ethnic group in Pakistan, the [[Punjabis]]. Unlike neighbouring India, there was no large-scale redistribution of agricultural land. As a result, most rural areas are dominated by a small set of feudalistic [[Zamindar|land-owning families]].\n\nIn the 1950s there was tension between the eastern and western halves of Pakistan. To address the situation, a new formula resulted in the abolition of the province status for Punjab in 1955. It was merged into a single province [[West Pakistan]]. In 1972, after [[East Pakistan]] seceded and became [[Bangladesh]], Punjab again became a province.\n\nPunjab witnessed major battles between the armies of [[Indian Army|India]] and [[Pakistan Army|Pakistan]] in the wars of [[1965 War|1965]] and [[1971 War|1971]]. Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan's nuclear program such as [[Kahuta]]. It also hosts major military bases such as at [[Sargodha]] and [[Rawalpindi]]. The peace process between India and Pakistan, which began in earnest in 2004, has helped pacify the situation. Trade and people-to-people contacts through the [[Wagah]] border are now starting to become common. Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as [[Nankana Sahib]].\n\nStarting in the 1980s, large numbers of Punjabis migrated to the Middle East, Britain, Spain, Canada and the United States for economic opportunities, forming the large [[Punjabi diaspora]], resulting in growing economic ties between Punjab and these countries.\n\n==Geography==\nPunjab is Pakistan's second largest province by area after [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] with an area of {{convert|205344|km2|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"Punjab\">{{cite web|title=Punjab|url=http://www.smeda.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69&Itemid=174|publisher=Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority|accessdate=14 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625202613/http://www.smeda.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69&Itemid=174|archivedate=25 June 2016}}</ref> It occupies 25.8% of the total landmass of [[Pakistan]].<ref name=\"Punjab\"/> Punjab province is bordered by [[Sindh]] to the south, the province of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] to the southwest, the province of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] to the west, and the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] in the north.

Punjab also includes several mountainous regions, including the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] in the southwest part of the province, the [[Margalla Hills]] in the north near [[Islamabad]], and the [[Salt Range]] which divides the most northerly portion of Punjab, the [[Pothohar Plateau]], from the rest of the province. Sparse [[deserts]] can be found in southern Punjab near the border with [[Rajasthan]] and near the Sulaiman Range. Punjab also contains part of the [[Thal Desert|Thal]] and [[Cholistan Desert|Cholistan]] deserts.

The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted. June and July are oppressively hot. Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46&nbsp;\u00b0C, newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51&nbsp;\u00b0C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat. Heat records were broken in [[Multan]] in June 1993, when the [[Temperature measurement|mercury]] was reported to have risen to 54&nbsp;\u00b0C. In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the [[wet season|rainy season]], referred to as ''barsat'', which brings relief in its wake. The hardest part of the summer is then over, but cooler weather does not come until late October.\n\nRecently the province experienced one of the coldest winters in the last 70 years.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dawn.com/2007/01/06/nat47.htm|title= Mercury drops to freezing point \u2013 Dawn Pakistan|date= 6 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nPunjab's region temperature ranges from \u22122\u00b0 to 45&nbsp;\u00b0C, but can reach 50&nbsp;\u00b0C (122&nbsp;\u00b0F) in summer and can touch down to \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter.\n\nClimatically, Punjab has three major seasons:<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web |url=http://punjabgovt.nic.in/punjabataglance/SomeFacts.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 November 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123230402/http://punjabgovt.nic.in/PUNJABATAGLANCE/SomeFacts.htm |archivedate=23 November 2005 }}</ref>\n\n* Hot weather (April to June) when temperature rises as high as 110&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n* Rainy season (July to September).

With its contribution ranging from 52.1% to 64.5% in the Service Sector and 56.1% to 61.5% in the agriculture sector. It is also a major manpower contributor because it has the largest pool of professionals and highly skilled (technically trained) manpower in Pakistan.

Its canal-irrigation system established by the British is the largest in the world. Wheat and cotton are the largest crops. Other crops include rice, [[sugarcane]], [[millet]], [[maize|corn]], [[oilseeds]], [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]], vegetables, and fruits such as [[kinoo]]. Livestock and poultry production are also important. Despite past animosities, the rural masses in Punjab's farms continue to use the Hindu calendar for planting and harvesting.\n\nPunjab contributes about 76% to annual food grain production in the country. Cotton and rice are important crops. They are the [[cash crops]] that contribute substantially to the national exchequer. Attaining self-sufficiency in agriculture has shifted the focus of the strategies towards small and medium farming, stress on barani areas, farms-to-market roads, electrification for tube-wells and control of water logging and salinity.\n\nPunjab has also more than 68 thousand industrial units. There are 39,033 small and cottage industrial units. The number of textile units is 14,820. The ginning industries are 6,778. There are 7,355 units for processing of agricultural raw materials including food and feed industries.\n\nLahore and Gujranwala Divisions have the largest concentration of small light engineering units. The district of Sialkot excels in sports goods, surgical instruments and cutlery goods.\n\nPunjab is also a mineral-rich province with extensive mineral deposits of coal, iron, gas, petrol, [[rock salt]] (with the second largest salt mine in the world), [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], [[gypsum]], and silica-sand. The Punjab Mineral Development Corporation is running over a hundred economically viable projects. Manufacturing includes machine products, cement, plastics, and various other goods.\n\nThe incidence of poverty differs between the different regions of Punjab. With Northern and Central Punjab facing much lower levels of poverty than Western and Southern Punjab. Those living in Southern and Western Punjab are also a lot more dependent on agriculture due to lower levels of industrialisation in those regions.\n\n{{As of|2012|6}}, Pakistan's electricity problems were so severe that violent riots were taking place across Punjab. According to protesters, [[load shedding]] was depriving the cities of electricity 20\u201322 hours a day, causing businesses to go bust and making living extremely hard.

The ruins of [[Harappa]] show an advanced urban culture that flourished over 8000 years ago. [[Taxila (modern)|Ancient Taxila]], another historic landmark also stands out as a proof of the achievements of the area in learning, arts and crafts. The ancient Hindu [[Katasraj temple]] and the Salt Range temples are regaining attention and are in need of repair.\n\nMosques abound all over Punjab and vary in architectural style. Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab. The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam (1320 AD) at [[Multan]] are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy. The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi (1150 AD) at Multan. A specimen of the sixteenth century tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar, with its brilliant blue dome. The tile-work of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] is of a richer and more elaborate nature. The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world.\n\n==Fairs and festivals==\n{{Main|Punjabi festivals (Pakistan)}}\nThe culture of Punjab derives its basis from the institution of [[Sufism|Sufi saints]], who spread Islam and preached and lived the Muslim way of life. People have festivities to commemorate these traditions. The fairs and festivals of Punjab reflect the entire gamut of its folk life and cultural traditions. These mainly fall in the following categories:\n\n===Religious and seasonal fairs and festivals===\nReligious fairs are held on special days of Islamic significance like [[Eid ul-Adha]], [[Eid-ul-Fitr]], [[Milad al-Nabi|Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi]], [[Shahb-e-Barat]], [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], [[Laylat al-Qadr]] and [[Jumu'ah-tul-Wida]]. The main activities on these special occasions are confined to congregational prayers and rituals. Melas are also held to mark these occasions.\n\n===Devotional fairs (Urs)===\n[[File:Data Sahib night view.JPG|220px|thumb|Punjab is famous for various shrines of [[Sufi]] saints and [[Data durbar]] in particular]]\nThe fairs held at the shrines of [[Sufi]] saints are called [[urs]]. They generally mark the death anniversary of the saint. On these occasions, devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint. Soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy. The music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing. It forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages. The most important urs are: urs of Data [[Ali Hujwiri|Ganj Buksh]] at [[Lahore]], urs of [[Sultan Bahu]] at [[Jhang]], urs of Shah Jewna at [[Jhang]], urs of [[Mian Mir]] at Lahore, urs of [[Baba Farid]] Ganj Shakar at [[Pakpattan]], urs of Bahaudin Zakria at [[Multan]], urs of Sakhi Sarwar Sultan at [[Dera Ghazi Khan]], urs of [[Shah Hussain]] at Lahore, urs of [[Bulleh Shah]] at [[Kasur]], urs of Imam Bari (Bari Shah Latif) at [[Rawalpindi]]-Islamabad and urs of Shah Inayat Qadri (the murrshad of [[Bulleh Shah]]) in Lahore.\n\nA big fair/mela is organised at [[Jandiala Sher Khan]] in district [[Sheikhupura]] on the mausoleum of Syed [[Waris Shah]] who is the most loved Sufi poet of Punjab due to his classic work, [[Heer Ranjha]]. The shrine of [[Heer Ranjha]] in [[Jhang]] is one of the most visited shrines in Punjab.\n[[File:Badshahi Mosque, Lahore.JPG|220px|thumb|right|[[Badshahi Mosque]], built by Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] at [[Lahore]]]]\n\n===Industrial and commercial fairs===\nExhibitions and annual horse shows in all districts and a national horse and cattle show at Lahore are held with the official patronage. The national horse and cattle show at Lahore is the biggest festival where sports, exhibitions, and livestock competitions are held. It not only encourages and patronises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots.\n\n===Other festivals===\nVaisakhi, also called Besakhi, is a harvest festival to celebrate harvesting the wheat crop. Colourful festivals are held at the time of Besakhi when farmers are free to enjoy their leisure time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DsRjAAAAMAAJ&dq=besakhi+pakistan+as+memories+come&q=attract|title=As memories come|first=M.

The [[Anarkali|Anarkali Market]] and [[Jahangir]]'s Tomb are prominent in the city of [[Lahore]] as is the [[Lahore Museum]], while the ancient city of [[Taxila]] in the northwest was once a major centre of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu civilization|Hindu]] influence. Several important [[Sikh]] shrines are in the province, including the birthplace of the first [[Guru]], [[Guru Nanak]]. (born at [[Nankana Sahib]]). There are a few famous hill stations, including [[Murree]], [[Bhurban]], [[Patriata]] and [[Fort Munro]].\n\nKatasraj Mandir is a [[Hindu]] temple complex situated in Katas village near [[Choa Saidanshah]] in the [[Chakwal District|Chakwal district]]. Dedicated to [[Shiva]], the temple has, according to Hindu legend, existed since the days of [[Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata]] and the [[Pandava]] brothers spent a substantial part of their exile at the site and later [[Krishna]] himself laid the foundation of this temple.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Khewra Salt Mine]] is a tourist attraction. Tours are accompanied by guides as the mine itself is very large and the complex interconnected passages are like a maze. There is a small but beautiful mosque inside the mine made from salt stone. A clinical ward with 20 beds was established in 2007<ref>{{cite news|title=Salt mine resort for asthma patients|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2007/03/27/nat18.htm|accessdate=14 April 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=27 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Shahzad|first=Khurram|title=Asthma treatment in Pakistani salt mine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7527907/Asthma-treatment-in-Pakistani-salt-mine.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=26 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710015656/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7527907/Asthma-treatment-in-Pakistani-salt-mine.html|archivedate=10 July 2012}}</ref> for the treatment of [[asthma]] and other respiratory diseases using [[salt therapy]].\n\n==Music and dance==\n{{Main|Music of Punjab|Punjabi dance}}\n[[File:Jashn-e-kharian.jpg|thumb|left|Various festivals in rural Punjab]]\nClassical music forms, such as [[Pakistani classical music]], are an important part of the cultural wealth of the Punjab. The Muslim musicians have contributed a large number of ragas to the repository of classical music. The most common instruments used are the [[tabla]] and [[Pump organ|harmonium]].\n\nAmong the Punjabi poets, the names of [[Baba Farid]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Sultan Bahu]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Waris Shah]] and [[Mian Muhammad Bakhsh|Mian Muhammad Baksh]] are well known. Amongst folk singers the likes of [[Inayat Hussain Bhatti]], [[Tufail Niazi]], [[Alam Lohar]], Sain Marna, Mansoor Malangi, Allah Ditta Lonawala, Talib Hussain Dard, [[Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi]], Gamoo Tahliwala, Mamzoo Gha-lla, Akbar Jat, [[Arif Lohar]], Ahmad Nawaz Cheena and Hamid Ali Bela are well-known. In the composition of classical ragas, there are such masters as ''Malika-i-Mauseequi'' (Queen of Music) Roshan Ara Begum, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan, Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Fateh Ali Khan. Alam Lohar has made significant contributions to folklore and Punjabi literature, by being a very influential Punjabi folk singer from 1930 until 1979.\n\nFor the popular taste however, light music, particularly Ghazals and folk songs, which have an appeal of their own, the names of [[Mehdi Hassan]], [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ghulam Ali]], [[Noor Jehan|Nur Jehan]], [[Malika Pukhraj]], [[Farida Khanum]], Roshen Ara Begum, and [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] are well-known. Folk songs and dances of the Punjab reflect a wide range of moods: the rains, sowing and harvesting seasons. Luddi, Bhangra and Sammi depict the joy of living. Love legends of Heer Ranjha, Mirza Sahiban, Sohni Mahenwal and Saiful Mulk are sung in different styles.\n\nFor the most popular music from the region, [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]], the names of [[Abrar-Ul-Haq]], [[Arif Lohar]], [[Attaullah Khan Essa Khailwi]], [[Jawad Ahmed]], [[Sajjad Ali]], Legacy, and [[Malkoo]] are renowned.\n\n==Folklore==\n[[File:4094w sain-zahoor.jpg|thumb|Punjabi folk]]\n{{main|Punjabi folklore}}\nFolklore songs, ballads, epics and romances are generally written and sung in the various [[Punjabi dialects]].\n\nThere are a number of folk tales that are popular in different parts of the Punjab. These are the folk tales of [[Mirza Sahiban]], [[Sayful Muluk]], [[Yusuf Zulekha]], [[Heer Ranjha]], [[Sohni Mahiwal]], [[Dulla Bhatti]], and [[Sassi Punnun]].\nThe mystic folk songs include the ''Kafees'' of Khwaja Farid in Saraiki, Punjabi and the ''Shalooks'' by [[Baba Farid]]. They also include ''Baits'', ''Dohas'', ''Lohris'', ''Sehra'', and ''[[Jugni]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punjabilok.com/pakistan/pak_punjab.htm|title=punjabilok.com|accessdate=22 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920082514/http://www.punjabilok.com/pakistan/pak_punjab.htm|archivedate=20 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous of the romantic love songs are ''Mayhiah'', ''Dhola'' and ''Boliyan''. Punjabi romantic dances include Dharees, [[Dhamaal]], [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]], [[Giddha]], [[Dhola (dance)|Dhola]], and [[Sammi (dance)|Sammi]].\n\n==Social issues==\nOne social/educational issue is the status of Punjabi language. According to Manzur Ejaz, \"In Central Punjab, Punjabi is neither an official language of the province nor it is used as medium of education at any level. There are only two daily newspapers published in Punjabi in the Central areas of Punjab. Only a few monthly literary magazines constitute Punjabi press in Pakistan\".<ref>Sarah Veach, Katy Williamson, [http://languagemanuals.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/5/3/4853169/punjabi.pdf Punjabi Culture and Language Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113700/http://languagemanuals.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/5/3/4853169/punjabi.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} ([https://archive.org/stream/Punjabi-CultureAndLanguageManual#page/n0/mode/2up archived]), Texas State University, p.&nbsp;6, retrieved 14 May 2016.</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[List of people from Punjab, Pakistan]]\n*[[List of Punjabi people]]: Some people who were born in area currently part of Punjab, Pakistan and migrated to India might exist in this list.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Lahore Fort.jpg|[[Lahore Fort]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage]] Site\nFile:Jungle in Punjab.JPG|Jungle in Sahiwal, Punjab\nFile:Mosque amjad 2006.JPG|[[Badshahi Mosque]], Lahore\nFile:Jehangir_Tomb3.jpg|[[Tomb of Jahangir]], Lahore\nFile:Katasraj Temple by Aizad Sayid.jpg|[[Katas Raj Temples]] (Sardar of Hari Singh's Haveli)\nFile:Lahore Museum, Lahore.jpg|[[Lahore Museum]]\nFile:Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore.jpg|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore|Sacred Heart Cathedral]], Lahore\nFile:Beautiful pavilion of Faiz Baksh terrace.jpg|[[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore|Shalimar Gardens]]\nFile:Asif Khan's Mausoleum.jpg|[[Asaf Khan IV|Asaf Khan's Mausoleum]]\nFile:Minar -e Pakistan at Night.jpeg|[[Minar e Pakistan]]\nFile:GPO Mall Road Lahore.jpg|[[General Post Office|GPO]], Lahore\nFile:GCU Tower P1140896.jpg|Clock Tower at Govt College University, Lahore\nFile:Clock Tower Faisalabad by Usman Nadeem.jpg|[[Faisalabad Clock Tower]]\nFile:Entrance to the Chenab Club, Faisalabad.jpg|Chenab Club, Faisalabad\nFile:Faisalabad Railway Station (Lyallpur).jpg|[[Faisalabad Railway Station]]\nFile:Nusrat Fathe Ali Khan Auditorium Faisalabad.JPG|Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Auditorium in Faisalabad\nFile:M2-2.JPG|Faisalabad Pindi Battian Interchange\nFile:Irrigation Faisalabad, Pakistan (PSSP).jpg|Irrigation canals in [[Faisalabad]]\nFile:Hindus mandar faisalabad.jpg|Hindu temple in Faisalabad\nFile:Dhan Gali Bridge.jpg|Dhan Gali Bridge\nFile:Mosque in Jhelum Cantonment Pakistan.jpg|CMH Mosque, Jhelum Cantt\nFile:Taxila Pakistan juillet 2004.jpg|Taxila is a [[World Heritage Site]]\nFile:Government college for Women Dhoke Kala Khan.JPG|Government college for Women, Rawalpindi\nFile:Samadhi of Ranjit Singh July 1 2005.jpg|[[Samadhi of Ranjit Singh]]\nFile:Major Akram Memorial.jpg|Major Akram Memorial, [[Jhelum]]\nFile:WheatFieldsPandjab.jpg|Wheat Fields\nFile:A beautiful view of Murree, Pakistan.jpg|A view of Murree, a famous hill station of Punjab\nFile:Clay pots in punjab pakistan-2.jpg|Different shapes of clay pots mostly made in [[Gujrat District|Gujrat]]\nFile:Sadwal kalan1.JPG|A Fields View from North Punjab\nFile:Tilla Jogian.jpg|[[Tilla Jogian]] Jhelum, considered sacred by [[Hindus]] and scenic peak in Punjab\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Pakistan|Geography}}\n*[[History of the Punjab]]\n*[[Punjab, India]]\n*[[Punjabi culture]]\n*[[Punjabi people]]\n*[[Saraikistan]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation |author=Pakistan Narcotics Control Board|authorlink=Pakistan Narcotics Control Board|title=National survey on drug abuse in Pakistan|date=1986|publisher=[[The University of Michigan]]|ref={{sfnref|Pakistan Narcotics Control Board|1986}}}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Punjab (Pakistan)}}\n{{commons|Punjab (Pakistan)}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.punjab.gov.pk}}\n*{{curlie|Regional/Asia/Pakistan/Provinces/Punjab}}\n* Guide to [https://web.archive.org/web/20170919203232/http://dmoz.pk/Provinces/Punjab/ Punjab, Pakistan]\n\n{{Punjab, Pakistan topics}}\n{{Five rivers of the Punjab|state=collapsed}}\n{{Administrative units of Pakistan}}\n{{Districts of Punjab, Pakistan|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Provinces of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Punjab, Pakistan| ]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1970]]\n[[Category:Punjabi-speaking countries and territories]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCentral Asian, Greek and Persian Empires:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: modern day \u2192 modern-day", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan"}
