Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the [[Church of Satan]] in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various [[Christianity|Christian]] groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the [[Devil in popular culture|concept of Satan]], has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression.\n\n\n\nAccusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the [[Inquisition]] attached to the [[Catholic Church]] alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Cathars]], performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent [[Early Modern period]], belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in [[Witch trials in the early modern period|mass trials of alleged witches]] across Europe and the North American colonies. Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active, and behind events such as [[Protestantism]] (and conversely, the [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation#Antichrist|Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist]]) and the [[French Revolution]] continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century. The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential [[Taxil hoax]] of France in the 1890s, which claimed that [[Freemasonry]] worshiped Satan, [[Lucifer]], and [[Baphomet]] in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom, amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites. In most of these cases, there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them.\n\nSince the 19th century, various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography. Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural [[deity]], viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a [[patriarch]]. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\">{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n \nContemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet.<ref name=\"crsi\">{{cite book |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |author= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= Introduction: Embracing Satan}}</ref> The Internet spreads awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for Satanist disputes.<ref name=\"crsi\" /> Satanism started to reach [[Central and Eastern Europe]] in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], and most noticeably in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], predominantly Roman Catholic countries.<ref name=\"crs8\">{{cite book |last= Alisauskiene |first= Milda |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |editor= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= The Peculiarities of Lithuanian Satanism}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title =Satanism stalks Poland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/778438.stm |work= BBC News |date= 2000-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|224px|''[[Wolfgang of Regensburg|Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'', by [[Michael Pacher]].]]\n\nIn their study of Satanism, the [[religious studies]] scholars Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal, [[James R.

Petersen stated that the term ''Satanism'' \"has a history of being a designation made by people against those whom they dislike; it is a term used for '[[othering]]'\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=7}} The concept of Satanism is an invention of Christianity, for it relies upon the figure of Satan, a character deriving from [[Christian mythology]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=16}}\n\nElsewhere, Petersen noted that \"Satanism as something others do is very different from Satanism as a self-designation\".{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=92}}\nEugene Gallagher noted that, as commonly used, ''Satanism'' was usually \"a [[polemical]], not a descriptive term\".{{sfn|Gallagher|2006|p=151}}\n\nIn 1994, the Italian sociologist [[Massimo Introvigne]] suggested to define Satanism with the simultaneous presence of \"1) the worship of the character identified with the name of Satan or Lucifer in the Bible, 2) by organized groups with at least a minimal organization and hierarchy, 3) through ritual or liturgical practices.\" The definition applies regardless the way in which \"each group perceives Satan, as personal or impersonal, real or symbolical.<ref>{{cite book | first = Massimo | last1 = Introvigne | author-link = Massimo Introvigne | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=nt8zDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 | title = Satanism: A Social History | publisher = Brill | date = September 29, 2016 | language = en | access-date = February 20, 2020 | location = \tLeiden ;

in this context, it appears at several points in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=19}} For instance, in the [[Book of Samuel]], [[David]] is presented as the satan (\"adversary\") of the [[Philistines]], while in the [[Book of Numbers]] the term appears as a verb, when God sent an angel to ''satan'' (\"to oppose\") [[Balaam]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=51}} Prior to the composition of the [[New Testament]], the idea developed within Jewish communities that Satan was the name of an angel who had rebeled against God and had been cast out of Heaven along with his followers; this account would be incorporated into contemporary texts like the [[Book of Enoch]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=52}} This Satan was then featured in parts of the New Testament, where he was presented as a figure who tempted humans to commit [[sin]];

him in light of their own time and their own interests, in turn generating new and different portraits of Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe shifting view of Satan owes many of its origins to [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), in which Satan features as the protagonist.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=28|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=70}} Milton was a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] and had never intended for his depiction of Satan to be a sympathetic one.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=28, 30}} However, in portraying Satan as a victim of his own pride who rebeled against God he humanized him and also allowed him to be interpreted as a rebel against tyranny.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} This was how Milton's Satan was understood by later readers like the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1pp=28, 30|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=69\u201370}} and the [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosopher [[William Godwin]], who reflected it in his 1793 book ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} ''Paradise Lost'' gained a wide readership in the eighteenth century, both in Britain and in continental Europe, where it had been translated into French by [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=70}} Milton thus became \"a central character in rewriting Satanism\" and would be viewed by many later religious Satanists as a \"''de facto'' Satanist\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe nineteenth century saw the emergence of what has been termed \"literary Satanism\" or \"romantic Satanism\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} According to Van Luijk, this cannot be seen as a \"coherent movement with a single voice, but rather as a ''post factum'' identified group of sometimes widely divergent authors among whom a similar theme is found\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}} For the literary Satanists, Satan was depicted as a benevolent and sometimes heroic figure,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=69}} with these more sympathetic portrayals proliferating in the art and poetry of many [[romanticism|romanticist]] and [[Decadent movement|decadent]] figures.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}} For these individuals, Satanism was not a religious belief or ritual activity, but rather a \"strategic use of a symbol and a character as part of artistic and political expression\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}}\n\nAmong the romanticist poets to adopt this view of Satan was the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who had been influenced by Milton.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=71\u201372}} In his poem ''[[Laon and Cythna]]'', Shelley praised the \"Serpent\", a reference to Satan, as a force for good in the universe.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=97\u201398}}\nAnother was Shelley's fellow British poet [[Lord Byron]], who included Satanic themes in his 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', which was a dramatization of the Biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} These more positive portrayals also developed in France; one example was the 1823 work ''[[Eloa]]'' by [[Alfred de Vigny]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=74\u201375}} Satan was also adopted by the French poet [[Victor Hugo]], who made the character's fall from Heaven a central aspect of his ''[[La Fin de Satan]]'', in which he outlined his own [[cosmogony]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=105\u2013107}}\nAlthough the likes of Shelley and Byron promoted a positive image of Satan in their work, there is no evidence that any of them performed religious rites to venerate him, and thus it is problematic to regard them as religious Satanists.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}}\n\nRadical left-wing political ideas had been spread by the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u201383 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789\u201399, and the figure of Satan, who was interpreted as having rebelled against the tyranny imposed by God, was an appealing one for many of the radical leftists of the period.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=77\u201379}} For them, Satan was \"a symbol for the struggle against tyranny, injustice, and oppression... a mythical figure of rebellion for an age of revolutions, a larger-than-life individual for an age of individualism, a free thinker in an age struggling for free thought\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}} The French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who was a staunch critic of Christianity, embraced Satan as a symbol of liberty in several of his writings.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=117\u2013119}} Another prominent 19th century anarchist, the Russian [[Mikhail Bakunin]], similarly described the figure of Satan as \"the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds\" in his book ''[[God and the State]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=119\u2013120}} These ideas likely inspired the American [[feminism|feminist]] activist [[Moses

set of features that were common to the groups in this Satanic milieu: these were the positive use of the term \"Satanist\" as a designation, an emphasis on individualism, a genealogy that connects them to other Satanic groups, a transgressive and antinomian stance, a self-perception as an elite, and an embrace of values such as pride, self-reliance, and productive non-conformity.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=7&ndash;9}}\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen argued that the groups within the Satanic milieu could be divided into three groups: reactive Satanists, rationalist Satanists, and esoteric Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They saw reactive Satanism as encompassing \"popular Satanism, inverted Christianity, and symbolic rebellion\" and noted that it situates itself in opposition to society while at the same time conforming to society's perspective of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} Rationalist Satanism

wanted to use the term \"Lucifer\" without adopting the term \"Satan\" in a similar way.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=37}} The early [[Theosophical Society]] held to the view that \"Lucifer\" was a force that aided humanity's awakening to its own spiritual nature.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=37\u201338}} In keeping with this view, the Society began production of a journal titled ''Lucifer''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=38}}\n\n\"Satan\" was also used within the esoteric system propounded by the Danish occultist [[Carl William Hansen]], who used the pen name \"Ben

Luciferianism is often identified as an auxiliary creed or movement of Satanism, due to the common identification of Lucifer with Satan. Some Luciferians accept this identification and/or consider Lucifer as the \"light bearer\" and illuminated aspect of Satan, giving them the name of Satanists and the right to bear the title. Others reject it, giving the argument that Lucifer is a more positive and easy-going ideal than Satan. They are inspired by the ancient myths of [[Egyptian mythology|Egypt]], [[Roman mythology|Rome]] and [[Greek mythology|Greece]], [[Gnosticism]] and traditional Western occultism.\n\n==== Order of Nine Angles ====\n{{Main|Order of Nine Angles}}\n[[File:Ona.svg|thumb|right|One of the principal symbols of the ONA]]\n\nAccording to the group's own claims, the Order of Nine Angles was established in [[Shropshire]], Western England during the late 1960s, when a Grand Mistress united a number of ancient pagan groups active in the area.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}}\nThis account states that when the Order's Grand Mistress migrated to Australia, a man known as \"Anton Long\" took over as the new Grand Master.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} From 1976 onward he authored an array of texts for the tradition, codifying and extending its teachings, mythos, and structure.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=87}}\nVarious academics have argued that Long is the pseudonym of British neo-Nazi activist [[David Myatt]],{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=216|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=268|3a1=Faxneld|3y=2013a|3p=207}} an allegation that Myatt has denied.{{sfnm|1a1=Ryan|1y=2003|1p=53|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=267}}\nThe ONA arose to public attention in the early 1980s,{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} spreading its message through magazine articles over the following two decades.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}} In 2000, it established a presence on the internet,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}} later adopting [[social media]] to promote its message.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=107}}\n\nThe ONA is a secretive organization,{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=236}} and lacks any central administration, instead operating as a network of allied Satanic practitioners, which it terms the \"kollective\".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}} It consists largely of autonomous [[Covert cell|cells]] known as \"nexions\".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}} The majority of these are located in Britain, Ireland, and Germany, although others are located elsewhere in Europe, and in Russia, Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, and the United States.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}}\n\nThe ONA describe their occultism as \"Traditional Satanism\".{{sfnm|1a1=Faxneld|1y=2013a|1p=207|2a1=Faxneld|2y=2013b|2p=88|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=250|4a1=Sieg|4y=2013|4p=252}} The ONA's writings encourage human sacrifice,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1pp=218&ndash;219|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} referring to their victims as ''opfers''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} According to the Order's teachings, such opfers must demonstrate character faults that mark them out as being worthy of death,{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=237|2a1=Ryan|2y=2003|2p=54}} and accordingly the ONA insists that children must never be victims.{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=292|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2000|2p=237}} No ONA cell have admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritualized manner, but rather Order members have joined the police and military in order to carry out such killings.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=114}} Faxneld described the Order as \"a dangerous and extreme form of Satanism\",{{sfn|Faxneld|2013a|p=207}} while religious studies scholar Graham Harvey claimed that the ONA fit the stereotype of the Satanist \"better than other groups\" by embracing \"deeply shocking\" and illegal acts.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=292}}\n\n==== Temple of Set ====\n{{Main|Temple of Set}}\nThe Temple of Set is an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[occult]] society claiming to be the world's leading [[Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path|left-hand path]] religious organization.

They described this as an adolescent and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] means of rebeling in a Christian society, by which an individual transgresses cultural boundaries.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They believed that there were two tendencies within reactive Satanism: one, \"Satanic tourism\", was characterized by the brief period of time in which an individual was involved, while the other, the \"Satanic quest\", was typified by a longer and deeper involvement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}}\n\nThe researcher Gareth Medway noted that in 1995 he encountered a British woman who stated that she had been a practicing Satanist during her teenage years. She had grown up in a small mining village, and had come to believe that she had [[psychic]] powers. After hearing about Satanism in some library books, she declared herself a Satanist and formulated a belief that Satan was the true god. After her teenage years she abandoned Satanism and became a [[Chaos Magic|chaos magic]]kian.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=362\u2013365}}\n\nSome reactive Satanists are teenagers or mentally disturbed individuals who have engaged in criminal activities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=130}} During the 1980s and 1990s, several groups of teenagers were apprehended after sacrificing animals and vandalizing both churches and graveyards with Satanic imagery.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} Introvigne expressed the view that these incidents were \"more a product of juvenile deviance and marginalization than Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} In a few cases the crimes of these reactive Satanists have included murder. In 1970, two separate groups of teenagers\u2014one led by Stanley Baker in [[Big Sur]] and the other by Steven Hurd in [[Los Angeles]]\u2014killed a total of three people and consumed parts of their corpses in what they later claimed were sacrifices devoted to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}} In 1984, a U.S. group called the Knights of the Black Circle killed one of its own members, Gary Lauwers, over a disagreement regarding the group's illegal drug dealing; group members later related that Lauwers' death was a sacrifice to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}}\nThe American serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]] for instance claimed that he was a Satanist; during his 1980s killing spree he left an inverted pentagram at the scene of each murder and at his trial called out \"Hail Satan!\"{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=122}}\n\n===Demographics===\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen observed that from surveys of Satanists conducted in the early 21st century, it was clear that the Satanic milieu was \"heavily dominated by young males\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} They nevertheless noted that census data from New Zealand suggested that there may be a growing proportion of women becoming Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} In comprising more men than women, Satanism differs from most other religious communities, including most new religious communities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=158}} Most Satanists came to their religion through reading, either online or books, rather than through being introduced to it through personal contacts.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=146}} Many practitioners do not claim that they converted to Satanism, but rather state that they were born that way, and only later in life confirmed that Satanism served as an appropriate label for their pre-existing worldviews.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=142}} Others have stated that they had experiences with [[supernatural]] phenomena that led them to embracing Satanism.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}} A number reported feelings of anger at the hypocrisy of many practicing Christians and expressed the view that the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Gods of Christianity and other religions are unethical, citing issues such as the [[problem of evil]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=202\u2013204}} For some practitioners, Satanism gave a sense of hope, including for those who had been physically and sexually abused.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThe surveys revealed that atheistic Satanists appeared to be in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists appeared to grow over time.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=179\u2013180}} Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most popular afterlife views were [[reincarnation]] and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=181\u2013182}} The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=183}} although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=209}} A number described performing [[curse|cursing]], in most cases as a form of vigilante justice.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=210\u2013212}}\nMost practitioners conduct their religious observances in a solitary manner, and never or rarely meet fellow Satanists for rituals.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=151, 153}} Rather, the primary interaction that takes place between Satanists is online, on websites or via email.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=153}}\nFrom their survey data, Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen noted that the average length of involvement in the Satanic milieu was seven years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=157}} A Satanist's involvement in the movement tends to peak in the early twenties and drops off sharply in their thirties.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=159}} A small proportion retain their allegiance to the religion into their elder years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=160}} When asked about their political views, the largest proportion of Satanists identified as apolitical or non-aligned, while only a small percentage identified as conservative despite the conservative views of prominent Satanists like LaVey and Marilyn Manson.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=171}} A small minority of Satanists expressed support for the far right; conversely, over two-thirds expressed negative or extremely negative views about [[Nazism]] and [[neo-Nazism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}}\n\n===Legal recognition===\n\nIn 2004 it was claimed that Satanism was allowed in the [[British Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] of the [[British Armed Forces]], despite opposition from Christians.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] [[CNN]]</ref><ref>Carter, Helen.

Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the [[Church of Satan]] in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various [[Christianity|Christian]] groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the [[Devil in popular culture|concept of Satan]], has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression.\n\n\n\nAccusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the [[Inquisition]] attached to the [[Catholic Church]] alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Cathars]], performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent [[Early Modern period]], belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in [[Witch trials in the early modern period|mass trials of alleged witches]] across Europe and the North American colonies. Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active, and behind events such as [[Protestantism]] (and conversely, the [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation#Antichrist|Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist]]) and the [[French Revolution]] continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century. The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential [[Taxil hoax]] of France in the 1890s, which claimed that [[Freemasonry]] worshiped Satan, [[Lucifer]], and [[Baphomet]] in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom, amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites. In most of these cases, there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them.\n\nSince the 19th century, various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography. Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural [[deity]], viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a [[patriarch]]. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\">{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n \nContemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet.<ref name=\"crsi\">{{cite book |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |author= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= Introduction: Embracing Satan}}</ref> The Internet spreads awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for Satanist disputes.<ref name=\"crsi\" /> Satanism started to reach [[Central and Eastern Europe]] in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], and most noticeably in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], predominantly Roman Catholic countries.<ref name=\"crs8\">{{cite book |last= Alisauskiene |first= Milda |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |editor= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= The Peculiarities of Lithuanian Satanism}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title =Satanism stalks Poland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/778438.stm |work= BBC News |date= 2000-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|224px|''[[Wolfgang of Regensburg|Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'', by [[Michael Pacher]].]]\n\nIn their study of Satanism, the [[religious studies]] scholars Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal, [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], and Jesper Aa. Petersen stated that the term ''Satanism'' \"has a history of being a designation made by people against those whom they dislike; it is a term used for '[[othering]]'\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=7}} The concept of Satanism is an invention of Christianity, for it relies upon the figure of Satan, a character deriving from [[Christian mythology]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=16}}\n\nElsewhere, Petersen noted that \"Satanism as something others do is very different from Satanism as a self-designation\".{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=92}}\nEugene Gallagher noted that, as commonly used, ''Satanism'' was usually \"a [[polemical]], not a descriptive term\".{{sfn|Gallagher|2006|p=151}}\n\nIn 1994, the Italian sociologist [[Massimo Introvigne]] suggested to define Satanism with the simultaneous presence of \"1) the worship of the character identified with the name of Satan or Lucifer in the Bible, 2) by organized groups with at least a minimal organization and hierarchy, 3) through ritual or liturgical practices.\" The definition applies regardless the way in which \"each group perceives Satan, as personal or impersonal, real or symbolical.<ref>{{cite book | first = Massimo | last1 = Introvigne | author-link = Massimo Introvigne | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=nt8zDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 | title = Satanism: A Social History | publisher = Brill | date = September 29, 2016 | language = en | access-date = February 20, 2020 | location = \tLeiden ;

in this context, it appears at several points in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=19}} For instance, in the [[Book of Samuel]], [[David]] is presented as the satan (\"adversary\") of the [[Philistines]], while in the [[Book of Numbers]] the term appears as a verb, when God sent an angel to ''satan'' (\"to oppose\") [[Balaam]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=51}} Prior to the composition of the [[New Testament]], the idea developed within Jewish communities that Satan was the name of an angel who had rebeled against God and had been cast out of Heaven along with his followers; this account would be incorporated into contemporary texts like the [[Book of Enoch]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=52}} This Satan was then featured in parts of the New Testament, where he was presented as a figure who tempted humans to commit [[sin]]; in the [[Book of Matthew]] and the [[Book of Luke]], he attempted to tempt [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the latter fasted in the wilderness.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=53}}\n\nThe word \"Satanism\" was adopted into English from the [[French language|French]] ''satanisme''.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} The terms \"Satanism\" and \"Satanist\" are first recorded as appearing in the English and French languages during the sixteenth century, when they were used by Christian groups to attack other, rival Christian groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=2}} In a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] tract of 1565, the author condemns the \"heresies, blasphemies, and sathanismes [sic]\" of the [[Protestantism|Protestants]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} In an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] work of 1559, [[Anabaptists]] and other Protestant sects are condemned as \"swarmes of Satanistes [sic]\".{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=9}} As used in this manner, the term \"Satanism\" was not used to claim that people literally worshipped Satan, but rather presented the view that through deviating from what the speaker or writer regarded as the true variant of Christianity, they were regarded as being essentially in league with the [[devil]]. {{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} During the nineteenth century, the term \"Satanism\" began to be used to describe those considered to lead a broadly immoral lifestyle,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} and it was only in the late nineteenth century that it came to be applied in English to individuals who were believed to consciously and deliberately venerate Satan.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=2}} This latter meaning had appeared earlier in the [[Swedish language]]; the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Bishop [[Laurentius Paulinus Gothus]] had described devil-worshipping sorcerers as ''Sathanister'' in his ''Ethica Christiana'', produced between 1615 and 1630.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=44}}\n\n== Antagonism towards Satanism ==\n<!-- Groups or individuals alleged to have practiced Satanism before the appearance of modern Satanism in the 1960s -->\n\nHistorical and anthropological research suggests that nearly all societies have developed the idea of a sinister and anti-human force that can hide itself within society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=13\u201314}} This commonly involves a belief in [[witchcraft|witches]], a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in [[incest]], [[murder]], and [[cannibalism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=14}} Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}} For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=15}} or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=16}}\n\nAnother contributing factor to the idea of Satanism is the concept that there is an agent of misfortune and evil who operates on a cosmic scale,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=19}} something usually associated with a strong form of ethical dualism that divides the world clearly into forces of good and forces of evil.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=20}} The earliest such entity known is [[Angra Mainyu]], a figure that appears in the Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=19|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=18}} This concept was also embraced by [[Judaism]] and early Christianity, and although it was soon marginalized within Jewish thought, it gained increasing importance within early Christian understandings of the cosmos.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=21}} While the early Christian idea of the Devil was not well developed, it gradually adapted and expanded through the creation of folklore, art, theological treatises, and morality tales, thus providing the character with a range of extra-Biblical associations.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n===Medieval and Early Modern Christendom===\n\n[[File:Praetorius Blocksberg.jpg|thumb|Title illustration of [[Johannes Praetorius (writer)]] ''Blocksbergs Verrichtung'' (1668) showing many traditional features of the medieval [[Witches' Sabbath]]]]\n{{See also|European witchcraft|Maleficium (sorcery)|Witch-cult hypothesis}}\n\nAs Christianity expanded throughout the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and Europe, it came into contact with a variety of other religions, which it regarded as \"[[paganism|pagan]]\". Christian theologians claimed that the gods and goddesses venerated by these \"pagans\" were not genuine divinities, but were actually demons.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=23}} However, they did not believe that \"pagans\" were deliberately devil-worshippers, instead claiming that they were simply misguided.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}} In Christian iconography, the Devil and demons were given the physical traits of figures from [[Classical mythology]] such as the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], [[faun]]s, and [[satyr]]s.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=24}}\n\nThose Christian groups regarded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were treated differently, with theologians arguing that they were deliberately worshipping the Devil.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=24\u201326}} This was accompanied by claims that such individuals engaged in incestuous sexual orgies, murdered infants, and committed acts of [[cannibalism]], all stock accusations that had previously been leveled at Christians themselves in the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=25\u201326}}\nThe first recorded example of such an accusation being made within [[Western Christianity]] took place in [[Toulouse]] in 1022, when two clerics were tried for allegedly venerating a demon.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=25}} Throughout the middle ages, this accusation would be applied to a wide range of Christian heretical groups, including the [[Paulicians]], [[Bogomils]], [[Cathars]], [[Waldensians]], and the [[Hussites]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=28}} The [[Knights Templar]] were accused of worshipping an [[Cult image|idol]] known as [[Baphomet]], with Lucifer having appeared at their meetings in the form of a cat.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=126}} As well as these Christian groups, these claims were also made about Europe's Jewish community.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=28\u201329}} In the thirteenth century, there were also references made to a group of \"Luciferians\" led by a woman named Lucardis which hoped to see Satan rule in Heaven. References to this group continued into the fourteenth century, although historians studying the allegations concur that these Luciferians were likely a fictitious invention.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=29\u201331}}\n\nWithin Christian thought, the idea developed that certain individuals could make [[Deal with the Devil|a pact with Satan]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=57}} This may have emerged after observing that pacts with gods and goddesses played a role in various pre-Christian belief systems, or that such pacts were also made as part of the Christian cult of saints.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=58}} Another possibility is that it derives from a misunderstanding of [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s condemnation of [[augury]] in his ''[[On the Christian Doctrine]]'', written in the late fourth century. Here, he stated that people who consulted augurs were entering \"''quasi pacts''\" (covenants) with demons.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=57\u201358}} The idea of the diabolical pact made with demons was popularized across Europe in the story of [[Faust]], likely based in part on the real life [[Johann Georg Faust]].{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=60\u201363}}\n\n[[File:CompendiumMaleficarumEngraving15.jpg|thumb|left|''The Obscene Kiss'', an illustration of witches kissing the Devil's anus from [[Francesco Maria Guazzo]]'s ''Compendium Maleficarum'' (1608).]]\n\nAs the late medieval gave way to the [[early modern period]], European Christendom experienced a schism between the established [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the breakaway [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movement.

\"anti-Satanism\" movement that any child's claim about Satanic ritual abuse must be true, because children would not lie.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=16}} Although some involved in the anti-Satanism movement were from Jewish and secular backgrounds,{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=369|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=2016|2p=15}} a central part was played by fundamentalist and evangelical forms of Christianity, in particular [[Pentecostalism]], with Christian groups holding conferences and producing books and videotapes to promote belief in the conspiracy.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|p=15}} Various figures in law enforcement also came to be promoters of the conspiracy theory, with such \"cult cops\" holding various conferences to promote it.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=191\u2013195}} The scare was later imported to the United Kingdom through visiting evangelicals and became popular among some of the country's social workers,{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=220\u2013221}} resulting in a range of accusations and trials across

following increasing skepticism about such allegations,{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=210\u2013211}} and a number of those who had been convicted of perpetrating Satanic ritual abuse saw their convictions overturned.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=213}}\nIn 1990, an agent of the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Ken Lanning]], revealed that he had investigated 300 allegations of Satanic ritual abuse and found no evidence for Satanism or ritualistic activity in any of them.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=213}} In the UK, the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] commissioned the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine to examine the allegations of SRA.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=249}} She noted that while approximately half did reveal evidence of genuine sexual abuse of children, none revealed any evidence that Satanist groups had been involved or that any murders had taken place.{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016|pp=13\u201314}} She noted three examples in which lone individuals engaged in child molestation had created a ritual performance to facilitate their sexual acts, with the intent of frightening their victims and justifying their actions, but that none of these child molestors were involved in wider Satanist groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=118|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=2016|2p=14}} By the 21st century, hysteria about Satanism has waned in most Western countries, although

===\n[[Image:GustaveDoreParadiseLostSatanProfile.jpg|right|thumb|Satan in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', as illustrated by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\n\nFrom the late seventeenth through to the nineteenth century, the character of Satan was increasingly rendered unimportant in Western philosophy and ignored in Christian theology, while in folklore he came to be seen as a foolish rather than a menacing figure.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=29}} The development of new values in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]\u2014in particular those of [[reason]] and [[individualism]]\u2014contributed to a shift in how many Europeans viewed Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=29}} In this context, a number of individuals took Satan out of the traditional Christian narrative and reread and reinterpreted him in light of their own time and their own interests, in turn generating new and different portraits of Satan.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe shifting view of Satan owes many of its origins to [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), in which Satan features as the protagonist.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=28|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=70}} Milton was a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] and had never intended for his depiction of Satan to be a sympathetic one.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=28, 30}} However, in portraying Satan as a victim of his own pride who rebeled against God he humanized him and also allowed him to be interpreted as a rebel against tyranny.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} This was how Milton's Satan was understood by later readers like the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1pp=28, 30|2a1=Van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=69\u201370}} and the [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosopher [[William Godwin]], who reflected it in his 1793 book ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]''.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=30}} ''Paradise Lost'' gained a wide readership in the eighteenth century, both in Britain and in continental Europe, where it had been translated into French by [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=70}} Milton thus became \"a central character in rewriting Satanism\" and would be viewed by many later religious Satanists as a \"''de facto'' Satanist\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}}\n\nThe nineteenth century saw the emergence of what has been termed \"literary Satanism\" or \"romantic Satanism\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} According to Van Luijk, this cannot be seen as a \"coherent movement with a single voice, but rather as a ''post factum'' identified group of sometimes widely divergent authors among whom a similar theme is found\".{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}} For the literary Satanists, Satan was depicted as a benevolent and sometimes heroic figure,{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=69}} with these more sympathetic portrayals proliferating in the art and poetry of many [[romanticism|romanticist]] and [[Decadent movement|decadent]] figures.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=28}} For these individuals, Satanism was not a religious belief or ritual activity, but rather a \"strategic use of a symbol and a character as part of artistic and political expression\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}}\n\nAmong the romanticist poets to adopt this view of Satan was the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who had been influenced by Milton.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=71\u201372}} In his poem ''[[Laon and Cythna]]'', Shelley praised the \"Serpent\", a reference to Satan, as a force for good in the universe.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=97\u201398}}\nAnother was Shelley's fellow British poet [[Lord Byron]], who included Satanic themes in his 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', which was a dramatization of the Biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=73}} These more positive portrayals also developed in France; one example was the 1823 work ''[[Eloa]]'' by [[Alfred de Vigny]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=74\u201375}} Satan was also adopted by the French poet [[Victor Hugo]], who made the character's fall from Heaven a central aspect of his ''[[La Fin de Satan]]'', in which he outlined his own [[cosmogony]].{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=105\u2013107}}\nAlthough the likes of Shelley and Byron promoted a positive image of Satan in their work, there is no evidence that any of them performed religious rites to venerate him, and thus it is problematic to regard them as religious Satanists.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=108}}\n\nRadical left-wing political ideas had been spread by the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u201383 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789\u201399, and the figure of Satan, who was interpreted as having rebelled against the tyranny imposed by God, was an appealing one for many of the radical leftists of the period.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=77\u201379}} For them, Satan was \"a symbol for the struggle against tyranny, injustice, and oppression... a mythical figure of rebellion for an age of revolutions, a larger-than-life individual for an age of individualism, a free thinker in an age struggling for free thought\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=31}} The French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who was a staunch critic of Christianity, embraced Satan as a symbol of liberty in several of his writings.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=117\u2013119}} Another prominent 19th century anarchist, the Russian [[Mikhail Bakunin]], similarly described the figure of Satan as \"the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds\" in his book ''[[God and the State]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|pp=119\u2013120}} These ideas likely inspired the American [[feminism|feminist]] activist [[Moses Harman]] to name his anarchist periodical ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]''.{{sfn|Van Luijk|2016|p=120}} The idea of this \"Leftist Satan\" declined during the twentieth century,{{sfn|Van

Diamond, various black metal Satanists sought to distance themselves from LaVeyan Satanism, for instance by referring to their beliefs as \"devil worship\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} These individuals regarded Satan as a literal entity,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=479}} and in contrast to LaVey's views, they associated Satanism with criminality, suicide, and terror.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=480}} For them, Christianity was regarded as a plague which required eradication.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=482}} Many of these individuals\u2014such as [[Varg Vikernes]] and [[Euronymous]]\u2014were Norwegian,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=479\u2013481}} and influenced by the strong anti-Christian views of this milieu, between 1992 and 1996 around fifty Norwegian churches were destroyed in arson attacks.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=481}} Within the black metal scene, a number of musicians later replaced Satanic themes with those deriving from [[Heathenry (new religious

set of features that were common to the groups in this Satanic milieu: these were the positive use of the term \"Satanist\" as a designation, an emphasis on individualism, a genealogy that connects them to other Satanic groups, a transgressive and antinomian stance, a self-perception as an elite, and an embrace of values such as pride, self-reliance, and productive non-conformity.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=7&ndash;9}}\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen argued that the groups within the Satanic milieu could be divided into three groups: reactive Satanists, rationalist Satanists, and esoteric Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They saw reactive Satanism as encompassing \"popular Satanism, inverted Christianity, and symbolic

LaVey espoused the view that \"god\" is a creation of man, rather than man being a creation of \"god\".

They described this as an adolescent and [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] means of rebeling in a Christian society, by which an individual transgresses cultural boundaries.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=5}} They believed that there were two tendencies within reactive Satanism: one, \"Satanic tourism\", was characterized by the brief period of time in which an individual was involved, while the other, the \"Satanic quest\", was typified by a longer and deeper involvement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=6}}\n\nThe researcher Gareth Medway noted that in 1995 he encountered a British woman who stated that she had been a practicing Satanist during her teenage years. She had grown up in a small mining village, and had come to believe that she had [[psychic]] powers. After hearing about Satanism in some library books, she declared herself a Satanist and formulated a belief that Satan was the true god. After her teenage years she abandoned Satanism and became a [[Chaos Magic|chaos magic]]kian.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=362\u2013365}}\n\nSome reactive Satanists are teenagers or mentally disturbed individuals who have engaged in criminal activities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=130}} During the 1980s and 1990s, several groups of teenagers were apprehended after sacrificing animals and vandalizing both churches and graveyards with Satanic imagery.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} Introvigne expressed the view that these incidents were \"more a product of juvenile deviance and marginalization than Satanism\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=445}} In a few cases the crimes of these reactive Satanists have included murder. In 1970, two separate groups of teenagers\u2014one led by Stanley Baker in [[Big Sur]] and the other by Steven Hurd in [[Los Angeles]]\u2014killed a total of three people and consumed parts of their corpses in what they later claimed were sacrifices devoted to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}} In 1984, a U.S. group called the Knights of the Black Circle killed one of its own members, Gary Lauwers, over a disagreement regarding the group's illegal drug dealing; group members later related that Lauwers' death was a sacrifice to Satan.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=446}}\nThe American serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]] for instance claimed that he was a Satanist; during his 1980s killing spree he left an inverted pentagram at the scene of each murder and at his trial called out \"Hail Satan!\"{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=122}}\n\n===Demographics===\n\nDyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen observed that from surveys of Satanists conducted in the early 21st century, it was clear that the Satanic milieu was \"heavily dominated by young males\".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} They nevertheless noted that census data from New Zealand suggested that there may be a growing proportion of women becoming Satanists.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=138}} In comprising more men than women, Satanism differs from most other religious communities, including most new religious communities.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=158}} Most Satanists came to their religion through reading, either online or books, rather than through being introduced to it through personal contacts.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=146}} Many practitioners do not claim that they converted to Satanism, but rather state that they were born that way, and only later in life confirmed that Satanism served as an appropriate label for their pre-existing worldviews.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=142}} Others have stated that they had experiences with [[supernatural]] phenomena that led them to embracing Satanism.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}} A number reported feelings of anger at the hypocrisy of many practicing Christians and expressed the view that the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Gods of Christianity and other religions are unethical, citing issues such as the [[problem of evil]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=202\u2013204}} For some practitioners, Satanism gave a sense of hope, including for those who had been physically and sexually abused.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThe surveys revealed that atheistic Satanists appeared to be in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists appeared to grow over time.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=179\u2013180}} Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most popular afterlife views were [[reincarnation]] and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=181\u2013182}} The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=183}} although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=209}} A number described performing [[curse|cursing]], in most cases as a form of vigilante justice.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=210\u2013212}}\nMost practitioners conduct their religious observances in a solitary manner, and never or rarely meet fellow Satanists for rituals.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|pp=151, 153}} Rather, the primary interaction that takes place between Satanists is online, on websites or via email.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=153}}\nFrom their survey data, Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen noted that the average length of involvement in the Satanic milieu was seven years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=157}} A Satanist's involvement in the movement tends to peak in the early twenties and drops off sharply in their thirties.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=159}} A small proportion retain their allegiance to the religion into their elder years.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=160}} When asked about their political views, the largest proportion of Satanists identified as apolitical or non-aligned, while only a small percentage identified as conservative despite the conservative views of prominent Satanists like LaVey and Marilyn Manson.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=171}} A small minority of Satanists expressed support for the far right; conversely, over two-thirds expressed negative or extremely negative views about [[Nazism]] and [[neo-Nazism]].{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=143}}\n\n===Legal recognition===\n\nIn 2004 it was claimed that Satanism was allowed in the [[British Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] of the [[British Armed Forces]], despite opposition from Christians.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] [[CNN]]</ref><ref>Carter, Helen.

It was added to the JA cars on the 1997 [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]]. This system was standard on 1999 to 2003 model year Dodge Grand Caravan ES, but only the front-wheel drive models since the AWD used a different TCM. Many Chrysler models today come with this system, including the [[Chrysler 300|300]], [[Chrysler 300#2005 300.2F300C|300C]], [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]], [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]], [[Chrysler Sebring|Sebring]], [[Chrysler PT Cruiser|PT Cruiser]], [[Chrysler Crossfire|Crossfire]], [[Chrysler Pacifica|Pacifica]], [[Chrysler Town & Country]], [[Dodge Avenger]], [[Dodge Stratus|Dodge Stratus R/T]], [[Dodge Journey|Dodge Journey R/T and SXT]] and [[Dodge Grand Caravan]].\n\n===System advantages===\n*Ability to manually select gears\n*Ability to start from 2nd or 3rd in inclement weather to improve traction\n*Allows downshifting while coming down steep inclines to maintain speed\n*Improved performance with quicker, more firm shifts\n*Removes clutching with pedal, instead it is operated by hand\n\n===System components and operation===\nComponents of the Autostick system in the first Chrysler vehicles to have the design included a different TCM ([[Transmission Control Unit|Transmission Control Module]]), shift assembly utilizing a unique PRNDL design invented by Peter Gruich in 1994, and gauge cluster. The gauge cluster includes a read-out to let the driver know which gear is selected.\n\nThe system works by dropping the shifter down into a gated area on the shift assembly which allows the shifter to be pushed to the right (up-shift) or to the left (down-shift). When the driver pushes the shifter in either of these directions the assembly sends a signal to the TCM to shift up, or down depending on the driver's actions. Dropping the shifter into the Autostick gate while the vehicle is moving will simply keep the vehicle in the current gear selected.\n\nFor the column-shift third- and fourth-generation Dodge Grand Caravan ES, Chrysler Town and Country 1999\u20132003, four speed automatic transmission models with FWD (41TE) or AWD (41AE) transmission only.

When selected the current gear ratio is not changed, the \"Autostick\" indicator illuminates in the instrument cluster, the numbers 3 2 1 illuminate to the right of D, and a square appears around the gear currently engaged, D 3 2 or 1. The button on the end of the handle is used to engage/disengage overdrive lockout, the same function as selecting L when not equipped with Autostick. When engaged the transmission will not enter 4th gear and downshifts to 3rd if it is in 4th gear. Specific gears are selected by an up/off/down 3 position momentary switch in the middle of the handle on the PRNDL lever, up to upshift and down to downshift. OD lockout and specific gear selection are mutually exclusive. While in OD lockout the transmission behaves as a 3 speed automatic transmission. Autostick gear selection hold a specific gear 1, 2, or 3 until another gear is selected by the up/down switch, the vehicle comes to a complete stop and Autostick forces a shift to 1st gear, Autostick operation is cancelled by selecting 4th gear, aka D, or Autostick is disengaged by moving the PRNDL.\n\nThe service manual explains that Autostick signalling is multiplexed on a single wire. The transmission control module outputs a 5v signal to the handle and monitors it for voltage drop The voltage ranges 0.3-1.6,1.6-2.8, 2.8-3.8, and 3.8-4.8 representing down, up, overdrive lockout, and all open respectively. The vehicle drops into 1st after stopping but can be launched in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd gear. The speed (or cruise) control operates only in 3rd and 4th gear while in Autostick mode and is deactivated if shifted to 2nd gear, just as it would if the driver had braked. Shifting into 4th (aka D) cancels Autostick single gear selection mode, and gears are automatically selected as usual until down or OD lockout is pressed.\n\n===System failsafes===\nIn modern implementations if the user does not shift while driving in the Autostick mode, the transmission will automatically up-shift at redline (the exception being the Plymouth/Chrysler Prowler which will not shift automatically at redline when in AutoStick mode) to prevent engine/transmission damage, and will not downshift into redline.

Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy.\n\n==Derech Eretz==\nThe phrase ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is first found in the [[Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Avoth]]'' (2:2): \"Beautiful is the [[Torah study|study of Torah]] with ''Derech Eretz'', as involvement with both makes one forget sin\".

The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

After all, it is also true that work is a form of [[Gemilut Hasidim]] with benevolent \"intention\" so that someone could live in appropriate manner to have social and individual good civilization. Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]]. Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\".

Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy.\n\n==Derech Eretz==\nThe phrase ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is first found in the [[Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Avoth]]'' (2:2): \"Beautiful is the [[Torah study|study of Torah]] with ''Derech Eretz'', as involvement with both makes one forget sin\". The term ''Derech Eretz'', literally \"the way of the land\", is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in [[Rabbinic literature]], referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/><ref>{{citation | first = Gidon | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | title = Maharal on Avot | website = RJConline.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031164210/http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | archivedate = 2010-10-31 }}.</ref>\n\n===Appropriate behaviour and good character===\n{{see|Proper behavior precedes the Torah}}\n[[Image:Virtue. La Vertu (NYPL b14140320-1638489).jpg|thumb|200px|Personification of virtue - one aspect of ''Derech Eretz.'']]\nIn the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], there are approximately 200 teachings concerning ''Derech Eretz'' as decent, polite, respectful, thoughtful, and civilized behavior.<ref>{{citation | first = Jeff | last = Forsythe | url = http://www.shemayisrael.com/rabbiforsythe/interpersonal/derecheretz.htm | title = Derech Eretz: Civil, Polite and Thoughtful Behavior | publisher = Shema Yisrael}}.</ref> One representative teaching is that ''\"Derech Eretz comes before Torah\"'' (\u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05e7\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 \u05dc\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 ''[[Midrash#Midrash Rabbah|Midrash Vayikra Rabbah]]'' 9:3) \u2013 one cannot personify Torah until he demonstrates ''Derech Eretz'' in everything that he does. \n\nThere are many more such teachings in the [[rishonim]] and [[acharonim]] (post-Talmudic authorities). The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

Thus, as formulated in ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'' [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2032/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm 4:1]:\n{{quote|Who is rich? One who is satisfied with his lot.

After all, it is also true that work is a form of [[Gemilut Hasidim]] with benevolent \"intention\" so that someone could live in appropriate manner to have social and individual good civilization. Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]]. Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

The plays of Aurand Harris have been produced and applauded in thousands of productions around the world for nearly a half-century. Harris was a prodigious dramatist, writing a newly published play each season. He was a tireless experimenter of forms, themes, and subjects. This modest man of irrepressible imagination and energy carried a vast array of honors and accolades. He was the first recipient of a National Endowment of the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in Children's Theatre. He received an honorary doctorate from the Indiana University and was introduced into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. He was the first playwright to receive the Medallion of the Children's Theatre Foundation of America.  Aurand Harris died on May 6, 1996, in Manhattan, New York.  He is buried in the family plot in Jamesport, Missouri.<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/76817470/aurand-harris</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJames Aurand Harris, the only child of Myrtle Sebastian and Dr. George Dowe Harris, was born on July 4, 1915, in Jamesport, Missouri. His father was a physician; his mother, a graduate of Northwestern University, was trained in theater and speech, and was also an active and well-know director, teacher, and amateur actress who maintained her own studio.  From an early age, Aurand Harris was drawn to things theatrical, no doubt in part due to his mother's influence, but also because of the variety and high quality of the theater with which she surrounded him.\n\nHarris' acting career began at age four when he played a bumblebee in a local musical production; before seven, he had written his first \"little dramatic piece.\" His education was augmented with speech, dance, and musical train.  In high school, he was involved in dramatic and oratorical contests, to the extent that when he graduated, he was named \"the best actor and the best orator in the state of Missouri.\"\n\n==Education==\nIn 1936 he obtained Bachelor of Arts from the University Kansas City. In 1939, he obtained a Master of Arts from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he worked with [[Winifred Ward]], a pioneer in children's theatre.<ref name=\"coleman46\">{{cite book | last1 = Jennings | first1 = Coleman A. | last2 = Sendak | first2 = Maurice | title = Theatre for Young Audiences | page = 46 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2005 | ISBN = 0-312-33714-0}}</ref> Then he made postgraduate studies at Columbia University (1947). In 1991 he obtained his Doctor of Humane Letters (honorary) from the Indiana University. Thomas Ehrlich, the 15th President of the Indiana University, presented the honorary degree.<ref name=\"honorsandawards.iu.edu\">https://honorsandawards.iu.edu/search-awards/honoree.shtml?honoreeID=336</ref>\n \nHe commenced his teaching career in September 1939 at Horace Mann High School [[Gary, Indiana]], as a studio teacher for dramatics.  He taught there for two years. In September 1941, he served as the Head of the Drama Department at [[William Woods University|William Woods College]], in [[Fulton, Missouri]]. In 1946, he relocated to New York City to study writing for the theater. Simultaneously, he commenced a teaching position at Grace Episcopal Church School in [[Manhattan]]. He remained in this position for 33 years.<ref name=\"coleman46\"/>\n\nInitially, he was interested in adult theater, but after setbacks in that field, he turned his attention to writing for children, having already written several children's plays in his younger years.<ref name=\"coleman46\"/>\n\nAurand Harris's first play was ''Once Upon a Clothesline''. The first production of ''Once Upon a Clothesline'' was performed by the Campus Players of William Woods College, under the direction of the author, Aurand Harris.<ref name=\"juniortheatre.com\">https://juniortheatre.com/shows/once-upon-a-clothesline-1951/</ref>''Once Upon a Clothesline'' was a prize-winning play in the Second Annual Seattle Junior Programs Playwriting Contest. This production featured the intermediate group of sixth, seventh and eighth-grade students from the 1951 Seattle Summer Theatre Workshop, performing in the Recital Hall at the Palisades Building in Balboa Park. This play would later go on tour at playgrounds throughout the city.<ref name=\"juniortheatre.com\"/> Later, the play was performed on July 27\u201328, 1951, at the San Diego Junior Theater, directed by Signe Culbertson and assisted by James Sams.<ref>/juniortheatre.com/artists/aurand-harris/</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Aurand Harris wrote ''Androcles and the Lion'', his best-known work. His play educates the audience about ''commedia dell'arte'' while providing entertainment.  The play is funny and joyful, with an essential message about freedom and love. It was translated into ten languages and was, for a time, the most produced play of any American playwright for children. In 1976 he became the first children's playwright to receive a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship. In 1985 he was inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theater; the ceremony took place at the Kennedy Center in Washington. In 1988 he directed one of his plays at Shanghai Children's Art Theater.

The plays of Aurand Harris have been produced and applauded in thousands of productions around the world for nearly a half-century. Harris was a prodigious dramatist, writing a newly published play each season. He was a tireless experimenter of forms, themes, and subjects. This modest man of irrepressible imagination and energy carried a vast array of honors and accolades. He was the first recipient of a National Endowment of the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in Children's Theatre. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Indiana and was introduced into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. He was the first playwright to receive the Medallion of the Children's Theatre Foundation of America.  Aurand Harris died on May 6, 1996, in Manhattan, New York.  He is buried in the family plot in Jamesport, Missouri. <ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/76817470/aurand-harris</ref>\n\n==Early Life==\nJames Aurand Harris, the only child of Myrtle Sebastian and Dr. George Dowe Harris, was born on July 4, 1915, in Jamesport, Missouri. His father was a physician; his mother, a graduate of Northwestern University, was trained in theater and speech, and was also an active and well-know director, teacher, and amateur actress who maintained her own studio.  From an early age, Aurand Harris was drawn to things theatrical, no doubt in part due to his mother's influence, but also because of the variety and high quality of the theater with which she surrounded him. \n\nHarris' acting career began at age four when he played a bumblebee in a local musical production; before seven, he had written his first \"little dramatic piece.\" His education was augmented with speech, dance, and musical train.  In high school, he was involved in dramatic and oratorical contests, to the extent that when he graduated, he was named \"the best actor and the best orator in the state of Missouri.\"\n\n\n==Education==\nIn 1936 he obtained Bachelor of Arts from the University Kansas City. In 1939, he obtained a Master of Arts from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he worked with [[Winifred Ward]], a pioneer in children's theatre.<ref name=\"coleman46\">{{cite book | last1 = Jennings | first1 = Coleman A. | last2 = Sendak | first2 = Maurice | title = Theatre for Young Audiences | page = 46 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2005 | ISBN = 0-312-33714-0}}</ref>. Then he made postgraduate studies at Columbia University (1947). In 1991 he obtained his Doctor of Humane Letters (honorary) from the University of Indiana. Thomas Ehrlich, the 15th President of the University of Indiana, presented the honorary degree.<ref>https://honorsandawards.iu.edu/search-awards/honoree.shtml?honoreeID=336</ref>\n \nHe commenced his teaching career in September 1939 at Horace Mann High School [[Gary, Indiana]], as a studio teacher for dramatics.  He taught there for two years. In September 1941, he served as the Head of the Drama Department at [[William Woods University|William Woods College]], in [[Fulton, Missouri]]. In 1946, he relocated to New York City to study writing for the theater. Simultaneously, he commenced a teaching position at Grace Episcopal Church School in [[Manhattan]]. He remained in this position for 33 years.<ref name=\"coleman46\"/>\n\nInitially, he was interested in adult theater, but after setbacks in that field, he turned his attention to writing for children, having already written several children's plays in his younger years.<ref name=\"coleman46\"/>\n\nAurand Harris's first play was ''Once Upon a Clothesline''. The first production of ''Once Upon a Clothesline'' was performed by the Campus Players of William Woods College, under the direction of the author, Aurand Harris. <ref>https://juniortheatre.com/shows/once-upon-a-clothesline-1951/</ref>''Once Upon a Clothesline'' was a prize-winning play in the Second Annual Seattle Junior Programs Playwriting Contest. This production featured the intermediate group of sixth, seventh and eighth-grade students from the 1951 Seattle Summer Theatre Workshop, performing in the Recital Hall at the Palisades Building in Balboa Park. This play would later go on tour at playgrounds throughout the city.<ref>https://juniortheatre.com/shows/once-upon-a-clothesline-1951/</ref> Later, the play was performed on July 27-28, 1951, at the San Diego Junior Theater, directed by Signe Culbertson and assisted by James Sams. <ref>/juniortheatre.com/artists/aurand-harris/</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Aurand Harris wrote ''Androcles and the Lion'', his best-known work. His play educates the audience about ''commedia dell'arte'' while providing entertainment.  The play is funny and joyful, with an essential message about freedom and love. It was translated into ten languages and was, for a time, the most produced play of any American playwright for children. In 1976 he became the first children's playwright to receive a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship. In 1985 he was inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theater; the ceremony took place at the Kennedy Center in Washington. In 1988 he directed one of his plays at Shanghai Children's Art Theater. It was the first time a western children's play had been performed for Chinese children.<ref>Coleman Jennings, ''Theatre for Young Audiences'', MacMillian, p. 47.</ref>\n\nHe also co-edited several anthologies of plays for children and adolescents.<ref name=\"coleman47\">{{cite book | last1 = Jennings | first1 = Coleman A. | last2 = Sendak | first2 = Maurice | title = Theatre for Young Audiences | page = 47 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2005 | ISBN = 0-312-33714-0}}</ref> They include ''Short Plays of Theatre Classics'', selected and edited by Aurand Harris.
