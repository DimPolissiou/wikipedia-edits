It depicts the daily conversations between two cellmates in an Argentine prison, Molina and Valent\u00edn, and the intimate bond they form in the process. It is generally considered Puig's most successful work.<ref>Titler, Jonathan. \"Manuel Puig\". page 47.</ref>\n\nThe novel's form is unusual in that there is no traditional narrative voice, one of the primary features of fiction.  It is written in large part as dialogue, without any indication of who is speaking, except for a dash (-) to show a change of speaker. There are also significant portions of [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] writing. What is not written as dialogue or stream-of-consciousness is written as meta-fictional government documentation. The conversations between the characters, when not focused on the moment at hand, are recountings of films that Molina has seen, which act as a form of escape from their environment. Thus there are a main plot, several subplots, and five additional stories that comprise the novel.\n\nPuig adapted the novel into a [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (play)|stage play]] in 1983, with an English translation by Allan Baker. It was also made into an [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Academy Award-winning film]] in 1985, a [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (musical)|Broadway musical]] in 1993 and a [[Chapter Seven: Kiss of the Spider Woman|2020 television special episode]] of ''[[Katy Keene (TV series)|Katy Keene]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/katy-keene-first-look-musical-episode-kiss-of-the-spider-woman/|title=Get a first look at the Katy Keene musical episode 'Kiss of the Spider Woman'|last=Lee Lenker|first=Maureen|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nPuig started ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' in 1974 starting with Molina, who was an experiment in imagining a romantic female.

The story takes place between September 9, 1975 and October 8, 1975.<ref>Kerr, Lucille. \"Suspended Fictions\". page 184.</ref> Molina, a transgender woman, is in jail for \"corruption of a minor\", while Valent\u00edn is a political prisoner who is part of a revolutionary group trying to overthrow the government. The two characters, seemingly opposites in every way, form an intimate bond in their cell, and their relationship changes both of them in profound ways. Molina recounts various films she has seen to Valent\u00edn in order to help them forget their situation.\n\nToward the middle of the novel the reader finds out that Molina is actually a spy planted in Valent\u00edn's cell to befriend him and try to extract information about his organization. Molina gets provisions from the outside for her cooperation with the officials in the hopes of keeping up appearances that her mother comes to visit her (thus giving her a reason to leave the cell when she reports to the warden). It is through her general acts of kindness to Valent\u00edn that the two fall into a romance and become lovers, albeit briefly. For her cooperation, Molina is paroled. On the day she leaves, Valent\u00edn asks Molina to take a message to his revolutionary group on the outside. Little does she know that she is also being followed by secret police trying to find the location of the group.\n\nMolina dies after being shot by Valent\u00edn's group at the rendezvous point after the secret police disrupt the assignation. The novel ends in Valent\u00edn's consciousness, after he has been given an anesthetic following torture, in which he imagines himself sailing away with his beloved Marta.\n\n===The First Film===\nThe first story Molina recounts, which opens the novel, is based on the movie ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942).<ref>Levine, Suzanne Jill. ''Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman'' page 260.</ref> During the narration, the reader finds out that Valent\u00edn sympathizes with the secretary because of his long-lost love, Marta.\n\n===The Second Film===\nThe second story Molina recounts is based on a Nazi propaganda film. Unlike the first, it is unclear whether or not this is an actual movie, but may be a composite of multiple Nazi films and an American film called ''[[Paris Underground (film)|Paris Underground]]'' (1945).<ref>Levine, Suzanne Jill. \"Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman.\" page 305</ref>\n\nIn the film, a French woman falls in love with a noble Aryan officer and then dies in his arms after being shot by the French resistance. The film is a clear piece of Nazi propaganda, but Molina's disinclination to see past its [[superficial charm]]s is a symptom of her alienation from society, or at least her choice to disengage from the world that has rejected her.\n\n===The Third Film===\nThe third story Molina recounts, based on the film [[The Enchanted Cottage (1945 film)|The Enchanted Cottage]] (1945), is the only film Molina does not tell Valent\u00edn, instead he recites it to himself. It concerns an Air Force pilot, disfigured by war wounds, who secludes himself in a cottage. The cottage's homely maid eventually falls in love with and then marries the pilot. They discover that their love has transformed them-- he appears handsome to her and she beautiful to him. Their transformation is only perceived by the two lovers and the audience.\n\n===The Fourth Film===\nThe fourth film concerns a young revolutionary with a penchant for racing cars who meets a sultry older woman and whose father is later kidnapped by guerrillas. With his paramour's aid the boy attempts to rescue his father, who ends up dying in a shootout with police. Disillusioned, the young boy joins the guerrillas.\n\n===The Fifth Film===\nBased on the film ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943), the fifth story concerns a rich man who marries a woman and brings her to his island home. There his new bride discovers a witch doctor who has the ability to turn people into zombies. It is eventually revealed that the man's first wife was seduced by the witch doctor and turned into a zombie. Reunited with his first wife, the man proclaims his love for his first wife, but is ultimately killed by the witch doctor.\n\n===The Sixth Film===\nThe sixth film Molina recounts is a love story in which a newspaper man falls in love with the wife of a Mafia boss. Lovestruck, he stops his newspaper from running a potentially damaging story about the woman. They run away together but are unable to support themselves. When the man falls ill, his lover prostitutes herself so they can survive. Valent\u00edn is forced to finish the story despite Molina recounting it. In the end, the man dies and the woman ends up sailing away.\n\n==Characters==\n* Molina \u2013 One of the protagonists and the prime storyteller. Trans woman who has been jailed for \"corrupting a minor\".\n* Valent\u00edn \u2013 The other protagonist, and the main implied listener. He is a revolutionary, imprisoned for belonging to a leftist organization that is trying to overthrow the government.\n* The Warden \u2013 One of the antagonists in the novel; he sets up Molina to spy and retrieve information from Valent\u00edn, and receives regular reports from him.\n* Gabriel \u2013 The waiter whom Molina befriends; he acts as Molina's main love interest throughout the novel.\n* Marta \u2013 Marta is Valent\u00edn's love interest, whom he lost in order to maintain a serious commitment to his revolutionary organization. She only appears in memories and streams-of-consciousness in the novel.\n* The prison guard\n* Molina's mother\n\n==Criticism==\nThe novel received mixed reviews.

He gained experience as a supporting actor in British provincial theatres, and from 1876 to 1881 was a member of [[Henry Irving]]'s company, based at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London. \n\nPinero wrote his first play in 1877. Seven years later, having written 15 more, three of them highly successful, he abandoned acting and became a full-time playwright. He first became known for a series of [[farce]]s, of which ''[[The Magistrate (play)|The Magistrate]]'' (1885) was the longest-running. During the 1890s he turned to serious subjects. ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray]]'' (1893), dealing with a woman with a scandalous past, was regarded as shocking, but ran well and made a large profit. His other successes included ''[[Trelawny of the 'Wells'|Trelawny of the \"Wells\"]]'' (1898), a romantic comedy celebrating the theatre, old and new, and ''[[The Gay Lord Quex (play)|The Gay Lord Quex]]'', about a reformed rou\u00e9 and a feisty young woman. A venture into opera, with a libretto for ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898), was not a success, and Pinero thereafter generally stuck to his familiar genre of society dramas and comedies. \n\nAlthough he continued to write throughout the first three decades of the 20th century and into the fourth, its is Pinero's work from the 1880s and 1890s that has endured. There have been numerous revivals of many of his plays; and some have been adapted for the cinema or as musicals. By his later years, Pinero was seen as old-fashioned, and his last plays were not successful. He died in London at the age of 79.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Pinero's-drawing-of-his-father-1870.png|thumb|upright|alt=sketch of balding white man with side-whiskers, wearing pince-nez and reading a newspaper|John Daniel Pinero, sketched by his son, 1870]]\nPinero was born in London, the only son, and second of three children, of John Daniel Pinero (1798\u20131871), and his wife Lucy, ''n\u00e9e'' Daines (1836\u20131905). Pinero's father and grandfather were London [[solicitor]]s. They were descended from the Pinheiro family, described by Pinero's biographer John Dawick as \"a distinguished family of Sephardic Jews who rose to prominence in medieval Portugal before suffering the persecutions of the Inquisition\". Pinero's branch of the family fled to England. His grandfather abandoned the Jewish faith, became a member of the [[Church of England]], married a Christian Englishwoman, Margaret Wing, and became a highly successful lawyer. His younger son, Pinero's father, also took up the legal profession, but was much less successful; Pinero was brought up in circumstances that were not poor but were not affluent.<ref>Dawick, pp. 6\u201312</ref> He attended [[Spa Fields]] Chapel [[charity school]] in Exmouth Street, [[Clerkenwell]], London, until the age of ten, when he went to work in his father's office.<ref name=dnb>Wearing, J.

He first appeared at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]], Irving's London base, in December 1876 and played a total of 21 parts there between then and 1881. His Shakespearean roles were Lord Stanley in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' (1877), Rosencrantz in ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1878), Guildenstern in ''Hamlet'' (1879), Salarino in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1879), and Roderigo in ''[[Othello]]'' (1881). In a revival of the melodrama ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', with which Irving's name was already synonymous, he played Dr Zimmer (1878).<ref name=who/> \n\nWhile in Irving's company Pinero wrote his first plays. He began with ''\u00a3200 a Year'', a one-act comedy written in a single afternoon for a colleague to present at a benefit performance in 1877. The play was well received and was given several further performances, bringing Pinero's name a modest amount of publicity.<ref>Dawick, pp. 57\u201358</ref> His first full-length play, ''La Com\u00e8te'', was staged in a theatre in [[Croydon]] in 1878, and he wrote four more one-act comedies, staged in London in 1878\u20131880, playing in two of them \u2013 ''Daisy's Escape'' and ''Bygones'' \u2013 at the Lyceum.<ref name=who/> Another of these, ''Hester's Mystery'' (1880), written for the comic actor [[J.

The theatre historian [[J. P. Wearing]] regards the play as of particular importance in the history of the St James's, a theatre previously known more for its failures than its successes. Pinero's play was regarded as daringly unconventional and a risky venture, but it caught on with the public, particularly for the character Baron Croodle, a \"disreputable but delightful old reprobate and card-shark\" played by [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]].<ref name=hdnb>Wearing, J.

Wearing writes that in these plays Pinero \"attacked facets of Victorian society by creating credible though blinkered characters, trying to preserve their respectability while trapped in a relentless whirlpool of catastrophically illogical events.\"<ref name=dnb/> \n\nPinero told an interviewer that with the first of his Court farces, ''The Magistrate'', he had tried \"to raise farce a little from the low pantomime level\". Instead of relying on the Parisian stereotype, revolving around potentially adulterous liaisons, he tried to create believable characters in credible situations.<ref>Dawick, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> The piece played for 363 performances in its first run, the first play in the history of the Court to run for more than a year.<ref>\"Court Theatre\", ''The Standard'', 22 March 1886, p. 3</ref> When its star, [[Arthur Cecil]], required a summer break, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree|Beerbohm Tree]] deputised for him for three weeks.<ref>\"The Magistrate\", ''The Theatre'', May 1892, p. 257</ref> Three touring companies were needed to meet the demand for the play in the British provinces, and local managements in Australia, India and South Africa were licensed to stage it; Pinero travelled to New York for the American premiere, at [[Daly's Theatre (30th St.)|Daly's Theatre]] in October 1885.<ref>\"The Drama in America\", ''The Era'', 24 October 1885, p. 14; and Dawick, p. 130</ref> He had turned 30 earlier that year. A retrospective review of his career published in 1928 pointed out that Pinero \u2013 who had recently celebrated 50 years as a West End playwright \u2013 achieved fame at an unusually early age: his contemporaries [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[John Galsworthy]] were all in their thirties before their plays were produced in London.<ref>Holt, Edgar. \"A Dramatist's Jubilee \u2013 Arthur Pinero\", ''The Fortnightly Review'', March 1928, pp. 323\u2013331</ref>\n\nPinero's other Court farces \u2013 ''[[The Schoolmistress]]'' (1886), ''[[Dandy Dick (play)|Dandy Dick]]'' (1887), ''[[The Cabinet Minister]]'' (1890) and ''[[The Amazons (play)|The Amazons]]'' (1893) \u2013 ran for 291, 262, 199 and 114 performances respectively, an aggregate of 866.<ref name=list/>  Their success was outstripped by that of the gentler comedy ''[[Sweet Lavender]]'', which ran at [[Terry's Theatre]] for 684 performances from March 1888 to January 1890.<ref>\"Terry's Theatre\", ''The Morning Post'', 27 January 1890, p. 2</ref> This piece concerns an impoverished clerk, a bibulous but wise barrister, fraudulent bankers, a long-lost sweetheart and happy endings all round.

Wearing comments that Pinero began to write \"problem plays\", considering \"the double standard of morality, applied unequally to men and women\". His first was ''The Profligate'' (1889), in which past misdeeds come to haunt a seemingly respectable man. It was chosen to inaugurate the new [[Garrick Theatre]], but the lessee, John Hare, persuaded a reluctant Pinero to tone down the ending to avoid alienating his respectable society audience: in the final version the protagonist does not kill himself, as Pinero had written, but is forgiven by his wife.<ref>Dawick, p. 159</ref> The play ran for 129 performances.<ref name=list/>\n[[File:Punch-cartoon-The-Second-Mrs-Tanqueray-1893.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=cartoon showing a young woman in Victorian evening dress leaping over a hurdle on which the word \"convention\" is painted; she is followed by one man in evening dress and watched by another, who is mopping his brow in relief|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon showing Pinero's relief as the second Mrs Tanqueray ([[Mrs Patrick Campbell]]) successfully leaps over a hurdle marked \"Convention\", followed by [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]] as Tanqueray]]\nWhen his next such drama came to be produced Pinero remained firm: the play would, and did, end in tragedy. This was his best-known serious work, ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray]]'' (1893). While he was planning it, several plays of [[Henrik Ibsen]] were presented in London for the first time, regarded by much of polite society as ''avant garde'', blunt and shocking.{{refn|Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', ''[[Rosmersholm]]'', ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'' and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' were all given in London for the first time during 1891 and 1892, mostly at special matin\u00e9es.<ref name=d169>Dawick, pp. 169 and 173\u2013175</ref>|group= n}} Seeing ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' led Pinero to reconsider his approach to playwriting, which now seemed old-fashioned by comparison. He was far from uncritical of Ibsen's plays, but recognised that if he was to be a serious dramatist he must treat social problems and human misconduct frankly.<ref name=d169/>\n\n''The Second Mrs Tanqueray'' centred on \"a woman with a past\". Hare declined to present it, and [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]], the actor-manager running the [[St James's Theatre]], to whom Pinero then offered the play, said, \"Sorry, I daren't do it\".<ref>Dawick, p. 181</ref> He had second thoughts, and accepted it. The production was scheduled to replace [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', which also focused on a woman with a far from respectable past. Unlike Pinero's play, Wilde's ended happily, and was seen by the respectable habitu\u00e9s of the St James's as mildly shocking but acceptable.<ref>Pearson, p. 74</ref> In Pinero's play Paula Tanqueray kills herself. In Wearing's words, \"although not as avant-garde as Ibsen's plays, Tanqueray confronted its fashionable St James's audiences with as forceful a social message as they could stomach\".<ref name=dnb/> Both Pinero and Alexander were apprehensive about the public reception of the piece, but it was a sensational success at its opening in May 1893, made a profit of more than \u00a310,000,{{refn|According to the Measuring Worth website this equates to \u00a34,300,000 in 2017 values in terms of average earnings.<ref>[https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/result.php?year_source=1893&amount=10000&year_result=2017 \"Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.K. Pound Amount, 1270 to Present\"], Measuring Worth.

''The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith'' (1895) managed a run of 88 performances, ''The Benefit of the Doubt'' (1895) ran for 74, ''The Thunderbolt'' (1908) and ''Mid-Channel'' (1909) both ran for 58.<ref name=list/>\n\n===Fin de si\u00e8cle===\nThe year 1898 saw one of Pinero's most enduring successes and his most  conspicuous failure. The first was ''[[Trelawny of the 'Wells'|Trelawny of the \"Wells\"]]'', the second, ''[[The Beauty Stone]]''. In ''Trelawny of the \"Wells\"'', described by a 21st-century critic as \"Pinero's love letter to theatre\",<ref>Spencer, Charles.

The play shows a popular actress in mid-Victorian melodramas marrying into the aristocracy, regretting it, returning to the stage and finding that she can no longer make the old style of plays work, successfully switching to works in the new realistic style. Wearing calls the play Pinero's homage to [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]], whose pioneering theatrical realism influenced two generations of writers including [[W. S.

Pinero commented that they seemed \"divided as to whether the piece is a weak farce or an imperfect realistic drama\".<ref>Dawick, p. 240</ref> It had a good, though not outstanding, run of 135 performances at the Court, but subsequently became one of Pinero's most revived plays.<ref name=list/>\n[[File:Beauty-stone-poster.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=theatre poster showing the Devil, in red costume|Poster for ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'']]\nAt the same time the impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] was in need of a new opera for his [[Savoy Theatre]] after the end of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s long partnership. It is not clear why Carte chose to commission a libretto from two writers with no experience in the genre, but for [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''The Beauty Stone'' he brought together Pinero and [[J.

His comedy of manners ''Iris'' (1901) ran for 115 performances, and in 1906 he had one of his biggest successes, with ''His House in Order'', another work for Alexander and the St James's. This piece is a drama about a put-upon second wife who eventually triumphs over the domineering family of her husband's dead first wife and wins his undivided love. It was a triumph for [[Irene Vanbrugh]] and Alexander in the lead roles, and for Pinero;<ref>\"St. James's Theatre\", ''The Times'',  2 February 1906, p. 4</ref> it ran for 430 performances and took more than \u00a378,000 at the box-office. The alliance between Alexander had by now become a firm friendship, punctuated by occasional arguments between the actor-manager and the author, who became extremely prescriptive about the staging of his plays and the delivery of his lines.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nAnother of Pinero's friends was Shaw. As authors they held very different views of the nature and purpose of drama. Although both addressed social problems in their plays, Shaw, who held that all good art is didactic, concentrated on the problem itself, whereas Pinero focused more on the people affected by it, which Shaw felt weakened the argument.<ref>Griffin, p. 14</ref> Nevertheless, they were on good terms and both were prominent in campaigns for a national theatre and the reform or abolition of theatre censorship. Shaw conceived the idea that playwrights needed a titled figure to lead their campaigns, and lobbied the British government to secure a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] for Pinero. Whether because of Shaw's canvassing or not is unknown, but Pinero was knighted in 1909, only the second dramatist to receive the honour (Gilbert having been knighted two years earlier). Pinero rarely used the title, but shortened his signature from \"Arthur W. Pinero\" to \"Arthur Pinero\".<ref>Dawick, pp. 303\u2013307</ref> \n\n[[File:Arthur Wing Pinero.jpg|upright|thumb|Pinero aged about 55|left|alt=Right profile of white man with bald head except for a small amount of dark hair at the back and sides, clean shaven, with bushy eyebrows]]\nIn the second decade of the century Pinero had his last two real successes. The comedy ''[[The \"Mind the Paint\" Girl]]'' ran at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] for 126 performances in 1912, and ''The Big Drum'', his last play for Alexander had 111 performances at the St James's in 1915.<ref name=list/> The [[First World War]] badly affected his wish and ability to write. He had suffered an emotional blow in 1913 when his stepson killed himself, and the outbreak of war the following year appalled Pinero. Following the sinking of {{RMS|Lusitania}} by a German [[U-boat]] on 7 May 1915, he wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' calling on [[naturalization#In the United Kingdom|naturalised]] British citizens of German origin to make public statements of their loyalty to the King and reject Germany's methods of warfare.<ref>Pinero, Arthur. \"Where Protest is Due\", ''The Times'', 11 May 1915, p. 9</ref> In the following days, numerous letters were received by the newspaper from naturalised Britons affirming their loyalty, including public figures such as [[Ernest Cassel|Sir Ernest Cassel]], [[George Henschel|Sir George Henschel]], [[Sir Carl Meyer 1st Baronet|Sir Carl Meyer]] and [[Felix Schuster|Sir Felix Schuster]].<ref>Meyer, Carl. \"Barbaric Warfare\" ''The Times'', 12 May 1915, p. 9; Schuster, Felix. \"Barbaric Warfare\", The Times, 13 May  1915, p. 9; Henschel, George. \"Naturalized Citizens\", ''The Times'', 15 May, p. 10; Cassel, Ernest. \"Sir E Cassel's Declaration\", ''The Times'' 20 May 1915, p. 9</ref> Among others who came under public pressure because of the war was Shaw, who opposed it strenuously, and was much vilified by the public and even by his colleagues. Pinero refused to join in the chorus of disapproval, and his friendship with Shaw endured, although they saw less of each other after Shaw resigned from the Dramatists' Club under pressure from its pro-war members led by [[Henry Arthur Jones]].<ref>Dawick, pp. 342\u2013343</ref>\n\nPinero's wife died in 1919, having been an invalid for some time. Although her death was foreseen it caused Pinero deep distress, and after it he was often despondent, despite the devoted attention of his stepdaughter.<ref name=dnb/> During the last years of his life Pinero gradually ceased to be a figure of importance in the theatre.

Retrieved 17 February 2019</ref>\n\n===Reputation===\nIn 1906, ''The Times'' commented:\n:When Mr. Pinero is at his best we reckon ourselves as close upon the high water mark of theatrical enjoyment.  \u2026 This or that playwright may show more \"heart\" than Mr. Pinero or a more delicate subtlety, a third may easily outclass him in intellectual gymnastic, but in his command of the resources of the stage for the legitimate purposes of the stage he is without a rival. As it was said of Euripides that he was \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, the most tragic of the tragic writers, as it might be said of Moli\u00e8re that he was the most comic of comic writers, so it may be said of Mr. Pinero that of all our dramatists to-day he is the most \"dramatic\". The art of drama is, quintessentially, the art of story-telling, as the sculptors say, \"in the round\". Mr. Pinero is supreme as a story-teller of that sort. We are always keenly interested in what his people are doing at the moment; we always have the liveliest curiosity about what they are going to do a moment later.<ref>\"St James's Theatre, ''The Times'', 2 February 1906, p. 4</ref>\n\nBy the time of Pinero's death in 1934 the paper had become less enthusiastic. Both ''The Times'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published polite obituaries that respectfully relegated his works to a bygone era.<ref>Dawick, p. 374</ref> For twenty years after his death Pinero's reputation remained in what Dawick calls \"a state of near-eclipse\". From the 1950s onwards interest in his Court farces grew. In a 1972 study of the playwright, Walter Lazenby wrote, \"Pinero cannot be outranked as a farceur by any other English writer; not even Shakespeare consistently expended on this form the care and art which went into the Court Theatre farces or achieved such thoroughly satisfying results\".<ref>Lazenby, p. 155</ref> Reviewing the book, the academic Robert Ronning agreed that the farces were Pinero's most enduring works:\n:The fact that students will continue to read ''The Second Mrs Tanqueray'' instead of ''The Magistrate'' does not mean much except for what they learn about craftsmanship, and this could be learned equally well from the farces. ... While we have seen considerable interest in the field of nineteenth century drama in recent years, one doubts if Pinero's social and problem plays will ever catch on.<ref>Ronning, Robert.

Thus Coward has been revealed as an English Chekhov and Rattigan as the supreme explorer of the hidden heart. But neither would have been possible without Pinero, whose surprisingly moving, amazingly theatrical and deeply humane plays still have the power to astonish and delight 100 years after they first created such a stir.<ref>Unwin, Stephen.

He gained experience as a supporting actor in British provincial theatres, and from 1876 to 1881 was a member of [[Henry Irving]]'s company, based at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London. \n\nPinero wrote his first play in 1877. Seven years later, having written 15 more, three of them highly successful, he abandoned acting and became a full-time playwright. He first became known for a series of [[farce]]s, of which ''[[The Magistrate (play)|The Magistrate]]'' (1885) was the longest-running. During the 1890s he turned to serious subjects. ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray]]'' (1893), dealing with a woman with a scandalous past, was regarded as shocking, but ran well and made a large profit. His other successes included ''[[Trelawny of the 'Wells'|Trelawny of the \"Wells\"]]'' (1898), a romantic comedy celebrating the theatre, old and new, and ''[[The Gay Lord Quex (play)|The Gay Lord Quex]]'', about a reformed rou\u00e9 and a feisty young woman. A venture into opera, with a libretto for ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898), was not a success, and Pinero thereafter generally stuck to his familiar genre of society dramas and comedies. \n\nAlthough he continued to write throughout the first three decades of the 20th century and into the fourth, its is Pinero's work from the 1880s and 1890s that has endured. There have been numerous revivals of many of his plays; and some have been adapted for the cinema or as musicals. By his later years, Pinero was seen as old-fashioned, and his last plays were not successful.

Pinero's father and grandfather were London [[solicitor]]s. They were descended from the Pinheiro family, described by Pinero's biographer John Dawick as \"a distinguished family of Sephardic Jews who rose to prominence in medieval Portugal before suffering the persecutions of the Inquisition\". Pinero's branch of the family fled to England. His grandfather abandoned the Jewish faith, became a member of the [[Church of England]], married a Christian Englishwoman, Margaret Wing, and became a highly successful lawyer. His younger son, Pinero's father, also took up the legal profession, but was much less successful; Pinero was brought up in circumstances that were not poor but were not affluent.<ref>Dawick, pp. 6\u201312</ref> He attended [[Spa Fields]] Chapel [[charity school]] in Exmouth Street, [[Clerkenwell]], London, until the age of ten, when he went to work in his father's office.<ref name=dnb>Wearing, J.

A retrospective review of his career published in 1928 pointed out that Pinero \u2013 who had recently celebrated 50 years as a West End playwright \u2013 achieved fame at an unusually early age: his contemporaries [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[J.

Wearing comments that Pinero began to write \"problem plays\", considering \"the double standard of morality, applied unequally to men and women\". His first was ''The Profligate'' (1889), in which past misdeeds come to haunt a seemingly respectable man. It was chosen to inaugurate the new [[Garrick Theatre]], but the lessee, John Hare, persuaded a reluctant Pinero to tone down the ending to avoid alienating his respectable society audience: in the final version the protagonist does not kill himself, as Pinero had written, but is forgiven by his wife.<ref>Dawick, p. 159</ref> The play ran for 129 performances.<ref name=list/>\n[[File:Punch-cartoon-The-Second-Mrs-Tanqueray-1893.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=cartoon showing a young woman in Victorian evening dress leaping over a hurdle on which the word \"convention\" is painted; she is followed by one man in evening dress and watched by another, who is mopping his brow in relief|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon showing Pinero's relief as the second Mrs Tanqueray ([[Mrs Patrick Campbell]]) successfully leaps over a hurdle marked \"Convention\", followed by [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]] as Tanqueray]]\nWhen his next such drama came to be produced Pinero remained firm: the play would, and did, end in tragedy. This was his best-known serious work, ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray]]'' (1893). While he was planning it, several plays of [[Henrik Ibsen]] were presented in London for the first time, regarded by much of polite society as ''avant garde'', blunt and shocking.{{refn|Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', ''[[Rosmersholm]]'', ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'' and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' were all given in London for the first time during 1891 and 1892, mostly at special matin\u00e9es.<ref name=d169>Dawick, pp. 169 and 173\u2013175</ref>|group= n}} Seeing ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' led Pinero to reconsider his approach to playwriting, which now seemed old-fashioned by comparison. He was far from uncritical of Ibsen's plays, but recognised that if he was to be a serious dramatist he must treat social problems and human misconduct frankly.<ref name=d169/>\n\n''The Second Mrs Tanqueray'' centred on \"a woman with a past\". Hare declined to present it, and [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]], the actor-manager running the [[St James's Theatre]], to whom Pinero then offered the play, said, \"Sorry, I daren't do it\".<ref>Dawick, p. 181</ref> He had second thoughts, and accepted it. The production was scheduled to replace [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', which also focused on a woman with a far from respectable past. Unlike Pinero's play, Wilde's ended happily, and was seen by the respectable habitu\u00e9s of the St James's as mildly shocking but acceptable.<ref>Pearson, p. 74</ref> In Pinero's play Paula Tanqueray kills herself. In Wearing's words, \"although not as avant-garde as Ibsen's plays, Tanqueray confronted its fashionable St James's audiences with as forceful a social message as they could stomach\".<ref name=dnb/> Both Pinero and Alexander were apprehensive about the public reception of the piece, but it was a sensational success at its opening in May 1893, made a profit of more than \u00a310,000,{{refn|According to the Measuring Worth website this equates to \u00a34,300,000 in 2017 values in terms of average earnings.<ref>[https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/result.php?year_source=1893&amount=10000&year_result=2017 \"Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.K. Pound Amount, 1270 to Present\"], Measuring Worth.

As authors they held very different views of the nature and purpose of drama.

Shaw conceived the idea that playwrights needed a titled figure to lead their campaigns, and lobbied the British government to secure a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] for Pinero. Whether because of Shaw's canvassing or not is unknown, but Pinero was knighted in 1909, only the second dramatist to receive the honour (Gilbert having been knighted two years earlier).

Following the sinking of {{RMS|Lusitania}} by a German [[U-boat]] on 7 May 1915, he wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' calling on [[naturalization#In the United Kingdom|naturalised]] British citizens of German origin to make public statements of their loyalty to the King and reject Germany's methods of warfare.<ref>Pinero, Arthur. \"Where Protest is Due\", ''The Times'', 11 May 1915, p. 9</ref> In the following days, numerous letters were received by the newspaper from naturalised Britons affirming their loyalty, including public figures such as [[Ernest Cassel|Sir Ernest Cassel]], [[George Henschel|Sir George Henschel]], [[Sir Carl Meyer 1st Baronet|Sir Carl Meyer]] and [[Felix Schuster|Sir Felix Schuster]].<ref>Meyer, Carl. \"Barbaric Warfare\" ''The Times'', 12 May 1915, p. 9; Schuster, Felix. \"Barbaric Warfare\", The Times, 13 May  1915, p. 9; Henschel, George. \"Naturalized Citizens\", ''The Times'', 15 May, p. 10; Cassel, Ernest. \"Sir E Cassel's Declaration\", ''The Times'' 20 May 1915, p. 9</ref> Among others who came under public pressure because of the war was Shaw, who opposed it strenuously, and was much vilified by the public and even by his colleagues. Pinero refused to join in the chorus of disapproval, and his friendship with Shaw endured, although they saw less of each other after Shaw resigned from the Dramatists' Club under pressure from its pro-war members led by [[Henry Arthur Jones]].<ref>Dawick, pp. 342\u2013343</ref>\n\nPinero's wife died in 1919, having been an invalid for some time. Although her death was foreseen it caused Pinero deep distress, and after it he was often despondent, despite the devoted attention of his stepdaughter.<ref name=dnb/> During the last years of his life Pinero gradually ceased to be a figure of importance in the theatre. After the end of the war he wrote eight more plays; two of them remained unstaged and of the four that were produced in London the longest-running lasted for 64 performances.<ref name=list/>\n\nHis heart weakened by a serious bout of influenza, Pinero failed to survive an operation for a [[hernia]].  He died on 23 November 1934 in Marylebone Nursing Home.<ref>\"Deaths\", ''The Times'', 26 November 1934, p. 1</ref> A memorial service was held at [[St Marylebone Parish Church]] on 28 November 1934,<ref>\"Memorial Service: Sir Arthur Pinero\", ''The Times'', 30 November 1934, p. 21</ref> after which, by Pinero's request, his ashes were buried in his wife's grave in the churchyard of [[Chiddingfold]], Surrey, close to their former country house.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Works==\n===Plays===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Theatre\n! scope=\"col\" |Date\n! scope=\"col\" |Genre\n! scope=\"col\" |Acts\n! scope=\"col\" |Perfs\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n| ''\u00a3200 a Year''\n| [[Globe Theatre  (Newcastle Street)|Globe]]\n| 6 October 1877\n| comedy\n| 1\n| 36\n|\n|-\n| ''La Com\u00e8te''\n| Theatre Royal, Croydon\n| 22 April 1878\n| drama\n| 3\n| n/k\n|\n|-\n| ''Two Can Play at That Game''\n| [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]]\n| 20 May 1878\n| comedy\n| 1\n| 40\n|\n|-\n| ''Daisy's Escape''\n| Lyceum\n| 20 September 1878\n| comedy\n| 1\n| 31\n|\n|-\n| ''Hester's Mystery''\n| [[Folly Theatre|Folly]]\n| 5 June 1880\n| comedy\n| 1\n| 308\n|\n|-\n| ''Bygones''\n| Lyceum\n| 18 September 1880\n| comedy\n| 1\n| 89\n|\n|-\n| ''The Money Spinner''\n| Prince's Theatre, Manchester<br>and [[St James's Theatre|St James's]]\n| 5 November 1880<br>and 8 January 1881\n| comedy\n| 2\n| 98\n|\n|-\n| ''Imprudence''\n| Folly\n| 27 July 1881\n| farce\n| 3\n| 54\n|\n|-\n| ''Bound to Marry''\n| unperformed\n|\n| comedy\n| 3\n|\n|{{refn|Alternative titles:  ''The Breadwinners'', ''The Captain''.<ref name=list/>|group= n}}\n|-\n| ''The Squire''\n| St James's\n| 29 December 1881\n| play\n| 3\n| 170\n|\n|-\n| ''Girls and Boys''\n| [[Toole's Theatre]]\n| 31 October 1882\n| comedy\n| 3\n| 52\n|\n|-\n| ''The Rector''\n| [[Royal Court Theatre|Court]]\n| 24 March 1883\n| play\n| 4\n| 16\n|\n|-\n| ''Lords and Commons''\n| [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]]\n| 24 November 1883\n| comedy\n| 4\n| 70\n|\n|-\n| ''The Rocket''\n| Prince of Wales, Liverpool<br>and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]]\n| 30 July 1883<br>and 10 December 1883\n| farce\n| 3\n| 51\n|\n|-\n| ''Low Water''\n| Globe\n| 12 January 1884\n| comedy\n| 3\n| 7\n|\n|-\n| ''The Ironmaster''\n| St James's\n| 17 April 1884\n| play\n| 4\n| 200\n| {{refn| Adapted from Georges Ohnet's play ''Le Ma\u00eetre de forges''.<ref name=list/>|group= n}}\n|-\n| ''In Chancery''\n| Lyceum, Edinburgh<br>and Gaiety\n| 19 September 1884<br>and 24 December 1884\n| farce\n| 3\n| 36\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Magistrate (play)|The Magistrate]]''\n| Court\n| 21 March 1885\n| farce\n| 3\n| 363\n|\n|-\n| ''Mayfair''\n| St James's\n| 31 October 1885\n| play\n| 5\n| 53\n| {{refn|Adapted from Sardou's play ''Maison neuve''.<ref name=list/>|group= n}}\n|-\n| ''[[The Schoolmistress]]''\n| Court\n| 27 March 1886\n| farce\n| 3\n| 291\n|\n|-\n| ''The Hobby Horse''\n| St James's\n| 25 October 1886\n| comedy\n| 3\n| 109\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Dandy Dick (play)|Dandy Dick]]''\n| Court\n| 27 January 1887\n| farce\n| 3\n| 262\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Sweet Lavender]]''\n| [[Terry's Theatre|Terry's]]\n| 21 March 1888\n| comedy\n| 3\n| 684\n|\n|-\n| ''The Weaker Sex''\n| Theatre Royal, Manchester<br>and Court\n| 28 September 1888<br>and 16 March 1889\n| comedy\n| 3\n| 61\n|\n|-\n| ''The Profligate''\n| [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]]\n| 24 April 1889\n| play\n| 4\n| 129\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Cabinet Minister]]''\n| Court\n| 23 April 1890\n| farce\n| 4\n| 199\n|\n|-\n| ''Lady Bountiful''\n| Garrick\n| 7 February 1891\n| play\n| 4\n| 65\n|\n|-\n| ''The Times''\n| Terry's\n| 24 October 1891\n| comedy\n| 4\n| 155\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Amazons (play)|The Amazons]]''\n| Court\n| 7 March 1893\n| farce\n| 3\n| 114\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray]]''\n| St James's\n| 27 May 1893\n| play\n| 4\n| 225\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith|The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith]]''\n| Garrick\n| 13 March 1895\n| play\n| 4\n| 88\n|\n|-\n| ''The Benefit of the Doubt''\n| [[Harold Pinter Theatre|Comedy]]\n| 16 October 1895\n| comedy\n| 3\n| 74\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Princess and the Butterfly]]''\n| St James's\n| 29 March 1897\n| comedy\n| 4\n| 97\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Trelawny of the 'Wells'|Trelawny of the \"Wells\"]]''\n| Court\n| 20 January 1898\n| comedy\n| 4\n| 135\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Beauty Stone]]''\n| [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]]\n| 28 March 1898\n| opera\n| 3\n| 50\n| {{refn|Written with [[J.

Retrieved 17 February 2019</ref>\n\n===Reputation===\nIn 1906, ''The Times'' commented:\n:When Mr. Pinero is at his best we reckon ourselves as close upon the high water mark of theatrical enjoyment.  \u2026 This or that playwright may show more \"heart\" than Mr. Pinero or a more delicate subtlety, a third may easily outclass him in intellectual gymnastic, but in his command of the resources of the stage for the legitimate purposes of the stage he is without a rival. As it was said of Euripides that he was \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, the most tragic of the tragic writers, as it might be said of Moli\u00e8re that he was the most comic of comic writers, so it may be said of Mr. Pinero that of all our dramatists to-day he is the most \"dramatic\". The art of drama is, quintessentially, the art of story-telling, as the sculptors say, \"in the round\". Mr. Pinero is supreme as a story-teller of that sort. We are always keenly interested in what his people are doing at the moment; we always have the liveliest curiosity about what they are going to do a moment later.<ref>\"St James's Theatre, ''The Times'', 2 February 1906, p. 4</ref>\n\nBy the time of Pinero's death in 1934 the paper had become less enthusiastic. Both ''The Times'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published polite obituaries that respectfully relegated his works to a bygone era.<ref>Dawick, p. 374</ref> For twenty years after his death Pinero's reputation remained in what Dawick calls \"a state of near-eclipse\". From the 1950s onwards interest in his Court farces grew. In a 1972 study of the playwright, Walter Lazenby wrote, \"Pinero cannot be outranked as a farceur by any other English writer; not even Shakespeare consistently expended on this form the care and art which went into the Court Theatre farces or achieved such thoroughly satisfying results\".<ref>Lazenby, p. 155</ref> Reviewing the book, the academic Robert Ronning agreed that the farces were Pinero's most enduring works:\n:The fact that students will continue to read ''The Second Mrs Tanqueray'' instead of ''The Magistrate'' does not mean much except for what they learn about craftsmanship, and this could be learned equally well from the farces. ... While we have seen considerable interest in the field of nineteenth century drama in recent years, one doubts if Pinero's social and problem plays will ever catch on.<ref>Ronning, Robert. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3206101 \"Arthur Wing Pinero by Walter Lazenby], ''Educational Theatre Journal'', October 1974, pp. 415\u2013416 {{subscription}}</ref>\nIn 2012 the director [[Stephen Unwin (director)|Stephen Unwin]] wrote:\n\n:One of the most heartening developments in recent years has been the critical rehabilitation of the oft-scorned giants of the commercial theatre. Thus Coward has been revealed as an English Chekhov and Rattigan as the supreme explorer of the hidden heart. But neither would have been possible without Pinero, whose surprisingly moving, amazingly theatrical and deeply humane plays still have the power to astonish and delight 100 years after they first created such a stir.<ref>Unwin, Stephen.
