The first ordinance allows the city manager the abilities to close any city facility in order to ensure the health and safety of city employees and the community, to enter into temporary agreements with bargaining units to ensure continuation of city services and to adjust personnel policies, designate areas for carry-out and curbside pickup from restaurants in the downtown area of the city, and to extend deadlines for licenses issued under the city code.  The ordinance also officially suspends the charging late fees for water and sewer, stopping the disconnection of water and sewer service for non-payment, extension of the payment deadline of the city's food and beverage tax along with the package liquor tax until May 20, extends the motor fuel taxes and hotel/motel taxes until April 30. An additional item that was added was the suspension of the enforcement of the tall grass and weed ordinance.  The second ordinance allowed for a streamlined process of the enforcement of the multiple executive orders issued by Governor Pritzker. Typically these orders would be sent through the [[Jackson County, Illinois|Jackson County Health Department]] and then to the [[Illinois Department of Public Health]] for review and then off to the county state's attorney for enforcement. Instead these orders will be processed by the City of Carbondale and enforced by the Carbondale Police Department by way of fines up to $750 per day and alleviates a \"minor violation from becoming a misdemeanor or felony charge\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Issac |title=Carbondale City Council passes ordinance to declare emergency in response to COVID-19 |url=https://thesouthern.com/news/local/carbondale-city-council-passes-ordinance-to-declare-emergency-in-response-to-covid-19/article_6da6480b-8857-52c6-affe-99bf52cf5521.html |website=The Southern Illinoisian |accessdate=April 12, 2020 |date=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== City of Chicago ====\nOn March 12, Chicago Mayor [[Lori Lightfoot]] announced that after meeting with [[Comcast]] executives, the company would \"double internet speeds to low income households nationally.

He held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[heavyweight]] title from 2015 to 2020, and in doing so became the first American world heavyweight champion in nine years, which was the longest period of time in boxing history without an American heavyweight champion. As of February 2020, he is ranked as the world's third-best active heavyweight by the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrb.org/all-rankings/|title=RANKINGS {{!}} Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> fourth by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ringtv.com/ratings/|title=Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ring|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> and fifth by [[BoxRec]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/ratings?offset=0&sex=M&division=Heavyweight|title=BoxRec: Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=boxrec.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWilder had a late start to boxing, taking up the sport at 20 years of age. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the [[2008 Olympics]]. This led to his nickname of \"The Bronze Bomber\", which Wilder coined after [[Joe Louis]], who was known by the nickname of \"The Brown Bomber\".\n\nWilder is particularly known for his formidable punching power, having knocked out every opponent he has faced, except [[Tyson Fury]].  His [[knockout]]-to-win ratio stands at 98%, with 20 knockouts in the first round. He is a two-time winner of the ''[[Premier Boxing Champions]]'' [[Premier Boxing Champions#Knockout of the Year|Knockout of the Year]] award, in 2016 and 2017, and the winner of the [[The Ring magazine Knockout of the Year|''Ring'' magazine Knockout of the Year]] award in 2019.\n\n==Amateur career==\nWilder started boxing in October 2005, when he entered Skyy Boxing Gym in [[Northport, Alabama]], and began training under Jay Deas. Wilder was 20 at that time.\n\nBy 2007, he upset the favorites to win both the [[National Golden Gloves]] and the [[National Amateur Heavyweight Champions|US championships]] at 201&nbsp;lb (91&nbsp;kg).\n\nAt the Golden Gloves, he defeated highly touted cadet world champion [[Isiah Thomas (boxer)|Isiah Thomas]], a southpaw from Detroit, and David Thompson, of Brooklyn, in the finals. At the U.S. championship he defeated Quantis Graves and won the final 31\u201315 over southpaw James Zimmerman of San Jose, California.\n\nAt the Olympic trials, he beat Graves twice more and won the Olympic trials in only 21 bouts. Early in 2008 he scored a career-best win by edging out world championship silver medalist and future Olympic champion [[Rakhim Chakhkeiv|Rakhim Chakhiyev]] in Russia. He qualified for the Olympics by beating [[Deivi Julio Blanco|Deivis Julio]] 6:5 [[Jorge Qui\u00f1onez|Jorge Quinones]] from Ecuador on double countback and Brazilian [[Rafael Lima (boxer)|Rafael Lima]] 6:5 at the qualifier.\n\nIn a Russia-USA dual match on February 29, 2008, in [[Novosibirsk]], Wilder was knocked out by [[Evgenyi Romanov]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.sports.yahoo.com/news/boxe-evgeny-romanov-dernier-homme-084117921.html|title=Boxe: Evgeny Romanov, le dernier homme \u00e0 avoir mis KO le surpuissant Deontay Wilder|website=fr.sports.yahoo.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\nWilder then competed at heavyweight in the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]], defeating Abdelaziz Touilbini of Algeria and Mohamed Arjaoui of Morocco before losing to [[Clemente Russo]] of Italy in the semi-final to earn a bronze medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/olympic-results/beijing-2008/boxing/81-91kg-heavyweight-m?event=31432|title=81 - 91kg (heavyweight) men results - Boxing - Beijing 2008 Olympics|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\nWilder had an approximate amateur record of 30\u20135.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya_110112.htm|title=Developing Deontay Wilder|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114125605/http://doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya_110112.htm|archive-date=2013-01-14|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Deontay_Wilder#Amateur_Highlights|title=Deontay Wilder - BoxRec|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052830/http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Deontay_Wilder#Amateur_Highlights|archive-date=2017-01-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Olympic results===\n'''[[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]''':<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/BX.shtml|title=Beijing results|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820170926/http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/BX.shtml|archivedate=2008-08-20|df=}}</ref>\n*Defeated [[Abdelaziz Toulbini]] ([[Algeria]]) 10:4\n*Defeated [[Mohamed Arjaoui]] ([[Morocco]]) 10+:10 (tiebreaker criteria)\n*Lost to [[Clemente Russo]] ([[Italy]]) 1:7\n\n===World Championship results===\n'''[[2007 AIBA World Boxing Championships]]''':\n*Lost to [[Krzysztof Zimnoch]] ([[Poland]]) 20-23 (10/24/2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/WorldChamps2007.html|title=World Champs 2007|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416215928/http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/WorldChamps2007.html|archive-date=2016-04-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Early career===\nWilder made his professional debut at the age of 23 on November 15, 2008, at the Vanderbilt University Memorial Gymnasium in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

Fury, using his unorthodox stance, spent much of the fight using upper and lower-body movement to avoid Wilder's big shots and stay out of range. There was not much action in round one as both boxers used the round to feel each other out. Wilder tried to trap Fury into the corner, but Fury made Wilder miss most of his big swings. In round four, Wilder bloodied Fury's nose with his stiff jabs, but was unable to follow up on the attacks. In round six, Fury switched to southpaw stance and had success backing Wilder against the ropes and at the same time stayed cautious of Wilder's power. In round seven, after trading jabs, which saw Fury come out on top, Fury landed a counter right hand, then quickly tied Wilder up before he could throw anything back. Round eight saw back and forth action with both trying to land. Wilder threw a lot of power shots which Fury mostly evaded. In round nine, Wilder dropped Fury with a short left hook followed by an overhand right. Fury beat referee Jack Reiss' count and survived the round. Having expended a lot of energy trying to finish Fury in round nine, Wilder looked fatigued in round ten. This came to as an advantage for Fury as he landed two right hands. Fury also took advantage in round eleven, landing enough shots and avoided anything Wilder could throw. In round twelve, Wilder landed a right-left combination which put Fury down hard on his back. The crowd, commentary team and Wilder believed the fight was over. Reiss looked at Fury on the canvas and began giving him a count. To everyone's surprise, Fury beat the count. Reiss made Fury walk towards him and called for the action to continue. Wilder, fatigued again, was unable to land another power shot and Fury landed some right hands to finish the round and the fight on his feet. Both boxers embraced in a hug after the final bell sounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-controversial-draw-results--134241|title=Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury Ends in Controversial Draw|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46416721|title=Wilder v Fury: Stunning draw in WBC world heavyweight title fight|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Boxing|access-date=2008-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11569434/tyson-fury-forced-to-settle-for-a-draw-with-deontay-wilder|title=Tyson Fury forced to settle for a draw with Deontay Wilder|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\nAccording to CompuBox statistics, Wilder landed 71 punches of 430 thrown (17%), and Fury landed 84 of his 327 thrown (26%).

He held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[heavyweight]] title from 2015 to 2020, and in doing so became the first American world heavyweight champion in nine years, which was the longest period of time in boxing history without an American heavyweight champion. As of February 2020, he is ranked as the world's third-best active heavyweight by the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tbrb.org/all-rankings/|title=RANKINGS {{!}} Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> fourth by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ringtv.com/ratings/|title=Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ring|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> and fifth by [[BoxRec]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/ratings?offset=0&sex=M&division=Heavyweight|title=BoxRec: Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=boxrec.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWilder had a late start to boxing, taking up the sport at 20 years of age. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the [[2008 Olympics]]. This led to his nickname of \"The Bronze Bomber\", which Wilder coined after [[Joe Louis]], who was known by the nickname of \"The Brown Bomber\".\n\nWilder is particularly known for his formidable punching power, having knocked out every opponent he has faced, except [[Tyson Fury]].  His [[knockout]]-to-win ratio stands at 98%, with 20 knockouts in the first round. He is a two-time winner of the ''[[Premier Boxing Champions]]'' [[Premier Boxing Champions#Knockout of the Year|Knockout of the Year]] award, in 2016 and 2017, and the winner of the [[The Ring magazine Knockout of the Year|''Ring'' magazine Knockout of the Year]] award in 2019.\n\n==Amateur career==\nWilder started boxing in October 2005, when he entered Skyy Boxing Gym in [[Northport, Alabama]], and began training under Jay Deas. Wilder was 20 at that time.\n\nBy 2007, he upset the favorites to win both the [[National Golden Gloves]] and the [[National Amateur Heavyweight Champions|US championships]] at 201&nbsp;lb (91&nbsp;kg).\n\nAt the Golden Gloves, he defeated highly touted cadet world champion [[Isiah Thomas (boxer)|Isiah Thomas]], a southpaw from Detroit, and David Thompson, of Brooklyn, in the finals. At the U.S. championship he defeated Quantis Graves and won the final 31\u201315 over southpaw James Zimmerman of San Jose, California.\n\nAt the Olympic trials, he beat Graves twice more and won the Olympic trials in only 21 bouts. Early in 2008 he scored a career-best win by edging out world championship silver medalist and future Olympic champion [[Rakhim Chakhkeiv|Rakhim Chakhiyev]] in Russia. He qualified for the Olympics by beating [[Deivi Julio Blanco|Deivis Julio]] 6:5 [[Jorge Qui\u00f1onez|Jorge Quinones]] from Ecuador on double countback and Brazilian [[Rafael Lima (boxer)|Rafael Lima]] 6:5 at the qualifier.\n\nIn a Russia-USA dual match on February 29, 2008, in [[Novosibirsk]], Wilder was knocked out by [[Evgenyi Romanov]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.sports.yahoo.com/news/boxe-evgeny-romanov-dernier-homme-084117921.html|title=Boxe: Evgeny Romanov, le dernier homme \u00e0 avoir mis KO le surpuissant Deontay Wilder|website=fr.sports.yahoo.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\nWilder then competed at heavyweight in the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]], defeating Abdelaziz Touilbini of Algeria and Mohamed Arjaoui of Morocco before losing to [[Clemente Russo]] of Italy in the semi-final to earn a bronze medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/olympic-results/beijing-2008/boxing/81-91kg-heavyweight-m?event=31432|title=81 - 91kg (heavyweight) men results - Boxing - Beijing 2008 Olympics|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\nWilder had an approximate amateur record of 30\u20135.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya_110112.htm|title=Developing Deontay Wilder|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114125605/http://doghouseboxing.com/Gabriel/Montoya_110112.htm|archive-date=2013-01-14|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Deontay_Wilder#Amateur_Highlights|title=Deontay Wilder - BoxRec|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052830/http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Deontay_Wilder#Amateur_Highlights|archive-date=2017-01-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Olympic results===\n'''[[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]''':<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/BX.shtml|title=Beijing results|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820170926/http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/BX.shtml|archivedate=2008-08-20|df=}}</ref>\n*Defeated [[Abdelaziz Toulbini]] ([[Algeria]]) 10:4\n*Defeated [[Mohamed Arjaoui]] ([[Morocco]]) 10+:10 (tiebreaker criteria)\n*Lost to [[Clemente Russo]] ([[Italy]]) 1:7\n\n===World Championship results===\n'''[[2007 AIBA World Boxing Championships]]''':\n*Lost to [[Krzysztof Zimnoch]] ([[Poland]]) 20-23 (10/24/2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/WorldChamps2007.html|title=World Champs 2007|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416215928/http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/WorldChamps2007.html|archive-date=2016-04-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Early career===\nWilder made his professional debut at the age of 23 on November 15, 2008, at the Vanderbilt University Memorial Gymnasium in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

Entering round nine, Szpilka, aware from the ring commentators he could no longer win the fight on the cards, changed strategy and took a gamble. Going to the inside, Szpilka swung for the rafters, but Wilder read Szpilka and connected first with a powerful right hand to the face. Szpilka fell to the canvas, and his head jerked backwards in a reflex motion, abruptly ending the competitive contest and sending the ringside physicians and emergency medical personnel immediately into the ring.

Fury, using his unorthodox stance, spent much of the fight using upper and lower-body movement to avoid Wilder's big shots and stay out of range. There was not much action in round one as both boxers used the round to feel each other out. Wilder tried to trap Fury into the corner, but Fury made Wilder miss most of his big swings. In round four, Wilder bloodied Fury's nose with his stiff jabs, but was unable to follow up on the attacks. In round six, Fury switched to southpaw stance and had success backing Wilder against the ropes and at the same time stayed cautious of Wilder's power. In round seven, after trading jabs, which saw Fury come out on top, Fury landed a counter right hand, then quickly tied Wilder up before he could throw anything back. Round eight saw back and forth action with both trying to land. Wilder threw a lot of power shots which Fury mostly evaded. In round nine, Wilder dropped Fury with a short left hook followed by an overhand right. Fury beat referee Jack Reiss' count and survived the round. Having expended a lot of energy trying to finish Fury in round nine, Wilder looked fatigued in round ten. This came to as an advantage for Fury as he landed two right hands. Fury also took advantage in round eleven, landing enough shots and avoided anything Wilder could throw. In round twelve, Wilder landed a right-left combination which put Fury down hard on his back. The crowd, commentary team and Wilder believed the fight was over. Reiss looked at Fury on the canvas and began giving him a count. To everyone's surprise, Fury beat the count. Reiss made Fury walk towards him and called for the action to continue. Wilder, fatigued again, was unable to land another power shot and Fury landed some right hands to finish the round and the fight on his feet. Both boxers embraced in a hug after the final bell sounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-controversial-draw-results--134241|title=Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury Ends in Controversial Draw|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/46416721|title=Wilder v Fury: Stunning draw in WBC world heavyweight title fight|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Boxing|access-date=2008-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11569434/tyson-fury-forced-to-settle-for-a-draw-with-deontay-wilder|title=Tyson Fury forced to settle for a draw with Deontay Wilder|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\nAccording to CompuBox statistics, Wilder landed 71 punches of 430 thrown (17%), and Fury landed 84 of his 327 thrown (26%).

GT cars were now [[Group 3 (racing)|Group 3]] and Prototypes were now [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]]. Two new classes for Sports Cars were [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] and [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] for \u2018Special Sports Cars\u2019 (Group 1 and 2 covered Touring Cars, [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7]] led to the [[1966 Can-Am season|Can-Am series]], with Group 8 and 9 for single-seaters).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\">Spurring 2010, p.208</ref>\n\nAs Group 7 were ineligible for FIA events, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) opened its entry list to Group 3, 4 and 6. The FIA mandated minimum annual production runs of 500 cars for Group 3 (up from 100 previously<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.140\">Clausager 1982, p.140</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\">Moity 1974, p.102-4</ref>) and 50 for Group 4,<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/>  which also had a maximum engine capacity of 5000cc. There were no engine limits on the GTs or Prototypes. As before, the Groups were split up in classes based on engine size, there was a sliding scale of a minimum weight based on the increasing engine size (from 450 to 1000&nbsp;kg for 500 to 7000cc) as was fuel-tank capacity (60 to 160 litres).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\nAlong with the new Appendix J, after four years of focus on GT racing the FIA announced the International Manufacturer's Championship, for Group 6 Prototypes (2L / >2L), and the International Sports Car Championship for Group 4 (1.3L / 2L / 5L).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\n==Entries==\n[[File:Ford GT40 Mark II at Goodwood Revival 2013 001.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ford GT40]] Mark II ]]\n[[File:Ferrari-330p3-2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ferrari 330 P3]]]]\n[[File:Porsche 906 Tour Auto 2014 Circuit de Dijon Prenois 03.jpg|left|thumb|Porsche 906 Carrera]]\nWith the new regulations this year the ACO received a huge 103 entry requests.

Extensive work was done in the wind tunnel, and improving the brakes, handling and engine \u2013 not least improving the fuel economy.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\">Clarke 1997, p.6-7: Autosport Jun17 1966</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\">Fox 1973, p.201</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.18\">Clarke 1997, p.18: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\">Armstrong 1966, p.209</ref> The big 7-litre engine now put out 475&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But the new year started with promise with [[Ken Miles]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]] winning both the inaugural [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and then [[12 Hours of Sebring]].<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/> Copying Ferrari's tactic of overwhelming numbers, they put in fifteen Mark II entrants; eight were accepted by the ACO. This time six were built and prepared by [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]]. Shelby ran three cars himself for Americans [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Jerry Grant]], Miles was now paired with New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]] after Ruby had been injured in a plane-crash a month earlier.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\">Fox 1973, p.198</ref> The third car was the all-[[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]] pairing of [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]]. [[Holman Moody|Holman & Moody]], the successful Ford NASCAR race-team was brought on board to race another trio \u2013 for [[Mark Donohue]]/[[Paul Hawkins (racing driver)|Paul Hawkins]], [[Ronnie Bucknum]]/[[Dick Hutcherson]] and [[Lucien Bianchi]]/[[Mario Andretti]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.15\">Clarke 1997, p.15: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref> One of the big improvements Holman & Moody brought with them was a quick-change brakepad system to save time in the pits.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.21\">Clarke 1997, p.21: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref>\n\nThe British team [[Alan Mann Racing]] had two cars prepared by Ford Advanced Vehicles, for [[Graham Hill]]/[[Dick Thompson (racing driver)|Dick Thompson]] and [[John Whitmore (racing driver)|John Whitmore]]/[[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]]. Each of the eight cars was painted in a colour from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]] road-car range.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\">Spurring 2010, p.210-3</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\">Clarke 1997, p.10: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\nFerrari's response to the Mk II was the new [[Ferrari P#330 P3|Ferrari 330 P3]]. Shorter and wider than the P2, it kept the same 4-litre engine but with fuel-injection now put out 420&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\"/> The works team had a pair of closed-cockpit versions for [[John Surtees]]/[[Ludovico Scarfiotti]] and former winners [[Lorenzo Bandini]]/[[Jean Guichet]]. An open-cockpit variant was given to the [[North American Racing Team]] (NART) for [[Pedro Rodriguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] /[[Richie Ginther]]. But their race preparation had been limited by strike action in Italy.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\">Spurring 2010, p.217-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\">Laban 2001, p.150-1</ref>\n\nNART also entered a long-tailed P2, rebodied by [[Piero Drogo]] and driven by last year's winner [[Masten Gregory]] with [[Bob Bondurant]]. There were also P2/P3 hybrids for the [[Ecurie Francorchamps]] (Dumay/\"Beurlys\") and [[Scuderia Filipinetti]] ([[Willy Mairesse|Mairesse]]/[[Herbert M\u00fcller (racing driver)|M\u00fcller]]. Finally there was a P2 Spyder for Maranello Concessionaires ([[Richard Attwood|Attwood]]/[[David Piper (racing driver)|Piper]]).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\">Clarke 1997, p.9: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> Fighting on two fronts, the company also took on Porsche in the 2-litre class with its [[Dino 206 S]] with a pair from NART and another for Maranello. [[Nino Vaccarella]], race winner in [[1964 24 Hours of Le Mans|1964]], was furious when he found out he was \u2018demoted\u2019 to drive the Dino rather than the P3 and threatened to walk out, but did, in the end run the car.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\">Clarke 1997, p.24: Motor Jun25 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\">Armstrong 1966, p.235</ref>\n\nChevrolet was the other player in the over 2-litre class. Ex-Ferrari engineer [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] had fallen out with [[Renzo Rivolta]] and with his own company brought his new design, the P538, but still using the 5.3L Chevrolet engine. The other Chev was in Texan [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]]\u2019s [[Chaparral Cars#2|Chaparral 2D]]. The 5.3L \u2018small-block\u2019 put out 420&nbsp;bhp and had an semi-automatic transmission.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> Driven by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Jo Bonnier]], they made a big impact winning the N\u00fcrburgring round just two weeks earlier.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\">Spurring 2010, p.227</ref>\n\nPorsche came with a new model \u2013 the [[Porsche 906|906]] designed by the team led by [[Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch]]. With the 2.0L flat-6 engine from the 911, it had recently been homologated for Group 4 with the requisite 50 cars.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.210\">Armstrong 1966, p.210</ref> It was race-proven too, after winning the [[Targa Florio]] the month before. However three ''langheck'' (long-tail) prototypes were also entered by the works team, driven by [[Hans Herrmann]]/[[Herbert Linge]], [[Jo Siffert]]/[[Colin Davis (racing driver)|Colin Davis]] and [[Udo Sch\u00fctz]]/[[Peter de Klerk]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\">Spurring 2010, p.220-1</ref>\n\nAlfa Romeo, and its works team [[Autodelta]], had withdrawn from racing for a year to prepare a new car for 1967.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/> But this year, a significant new manufacturer entered the fray: [[Matra]] had bought out [[Automobiles Ren\u00e9 Bonnet]] in 1964, rebadging the [[Matra Djet|Djet]]. However it was a new design that was entered. The M620 had a 2-litre version of the BRM Formula 1 engine developing 245&nbsp;bhp that could match the Porsches in speed, making 275&nbsp;kp/h (170&nbsp;mph). The three cars were driven by up and coming young French single-seater drivers [[Jean-Pierre Beltoise]]/[[Johnny Servoz-Gavin]], [[Jean-Pierre Jaussaud]]/[[Henri Pescarolo]] and [[Jo Schlesser]] with Welshman [[Alan Rees (racing driver)|Alan Rees]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.222\">Spurring 2010, p.222</ref>\n\nRemarkably, given British dominance of the race barely a decade earlier, there were only three British cars in this year's race. Defending class-champions Austin-Healey had two works entries. The other was a [[Marcos Engineering]] kit-car based on a Mini Cooper 'S' chassis. Entered by Frenchman Hubert Giraud and driven by Jean-Louis Marnat and Claude Ballot-Lena, the team was able to get a works engine and gearbox from [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]]. The spectators laughed at the small car and its apparent resemblance to a flea.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\">Spurring 2010, p.233</ref> But the Mini Marcos would became the 'darling of the crowds' later on in the race.\n\nAlpine, after its poor showing in the previous year, returned with 6 cars. The new A210 had a 1.3L Gordini-Renault engine with a Porsche gearbox making it more durable if only a little faster at 245&nbsp;kp/h (150&nbsp;mph). This year a new customer team, the Ecurie Savin-Calberson was supported by Alpine, with former Index winner Roger Delageneste.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\">Spurring 2010, p.224</ref>\n\n[[Charles Deutsch]] (CD) brought his new aerodynamic SP66. The car was powered by a 1130cc Peugeot engine, marking the return of the French company last seen in the 1938 race.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\">Spurring 2010, p.231</ref> Another competitor in the small prototypes was [[ASA (automobile)|ASA]]. Originally a Ferrari design by [[Carlo Chiti]] and [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] before their famous [[History of Ferrari#1961 \u2013 The great walkout|walk-out from Ferrari]], it was sold to the new Italian company and uprated with a 1290cc engine giving 125&nbsp;bhp. Two cars were entered, one by ASA and one by NART.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\">Spurring 2010, p.228</ref>\n\nThe new Group 4 category started attracting interest as the earlier prototypes were meeting the homologation and production requirements. There were six GT40s entered by customer teams, with the 4.7L engine. [[Jochen Rindt]], the previous year's winner, had moved across from Ferrari to Ford, in the new Canadian Comstock Racing Team. They joined Ford France, Scuderia Filipinetti and new privateers Scuderia Bear and [[Superior Essex|Essex Wire]]. Joining Skip Scott, team owner of the Essex Wire team, was a 21-year old [[Jacky Ickx]] in his Le Mans debut.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\">Spurring 2010, p.214-5</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\">Clausager 1982, p.147</ref>\n\nUp against them was [[Ed Hugus]]\u2019 modified Ferrari 275 GTB and the [[Ecurie Nationale Belge|Equipe Nationale Belge]] ran its 250 LM. Porsche also ran three regular 906s in the Sports category, two works entries as well as one for their Paris importer \u2018Toto\u2019 Veuillet.\n\nWith Shelby now fully concentrated on the Ford program, the Cobra GTs were abandoned. There were only three GT entries: the Ferrari customer teams Ecurie Francorchamps and Maranello Concessionaires both entered a 275 GTB. The third was a quiet though significant entry: Jacques Dewes, ever the pioneering privateer, brought the first Porsche 911 to Le Mans. Production of what would become the ubiquitous Le Mans car had started in late 1964 and the new 911 S model had its \u2018boxer\u2019 6-cylinder engine tuned to 160&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.223\">Spurring 2010, p.223</ref>\n\nFinally, in a subcompetition of its own, there was the tyre-race between [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/>\n\n==Practice==\nOnce again there was rain at the April testing weekend. And once again there was tragedy with a fatal accident. American Walt Hansgen's Ford hit water on the pit straight and aquaplaned. He aimed for the escape road at the end of the straight, not realising it was blocked by a sandbank, which he hit at about 190&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph). Taken with critical injuries to the American military hospital at [[Orl\u00e9ans]], he died five days later.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\n\nA notable absentee at the test weekend was the Ferrari works team.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Chris Amon was fastest at the test weekend in the experimental [[Ford GT40#J-car|Ford J-car]] with a 3:34.4 lap.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But come race-week it was Gurney who put in the fastest qualifying lap of 3:30.6, a second faster than his stablemates Miles, Gardner and McLaren. Ginther was 5th in the fastest Ferrari with a 3:33.0, with Parkes and Bandini in 7th and 8th respectively. Phil Hill, in the Chaparral, broke up the Ford-Ferrari procession in 10th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\">Spurring 2010, p.235</ref>\n\nJo Siffert put the quickest Porsche 22nd on the grid with 3:51.0, with Nino Vaccarella's Ferrari in 24th (3:53.5) and Jo Schlesser's Matra just behind it (3:53.5). Over the test weekend, Mauro Bianchi had surprised many in the 1-litre Alpine, going as fast as the 1959 Ferrari Testa Rossas.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\nThe quickest Alpine in practice was [[Pauli Toivonen|Toivonen]]/Jansson (4:20.1), well ahead of the best CD (Ogier/Laurent 4:27.5) and the Austin-Healey's (4:45.1) and ASAs (4:49.8).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\"/>\n\nThere were also two significant dramas in practice. The biggest news was the walkout of Ferrari's lead driver [[John Surtees]]. He and team manager Eugenio Dragoni had decided that he, as the fastest Ferrari driver and driving with [[Mike Parkes]], would act as the hare to bait and break the Fords. He was also still recovering from a big accident the previous year and would hand over to Scarfiotti if he got overly tired. Yet during raceweek, with news that new FIAT chairman [[Gianni Agnelli]] would be at the race, Dragoni changed the plan, putting Scarfiotti (Agnelli's nephew) in first. Surtees was furious and stormed off to Maranello to argue his case with [[Enzo Ferrari]].<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Not listened to, Surtees, Ferrari's [[1964 Formula One season|1964 F1 World Champion]], quit the team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\nThe second incident was more serious \u2013 Dick Thompson in the Alan Mann Ford Mk II collided with Dick Holqvist who was going far slower in the Scuderia Bear Ford GT40 and pulled right in front of him at Maison Blanche.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> Holqvist spun off with heavy damage, while Thompson was able to get back to the pits. While repairing the damage, officials told the team that they were disqualified for Thompson leaving the scene of a major accident. Thompson was adamant he had advised pit officials, and in the hearing Ford's director of racing Leo Beebe threatened to withdraw all Fords. He was supported by [[Fritz Huschke von Hanstein|Huschke von Hanstein]] who was prepared to withdraw the Porsche team as well.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> In the end, the car was reinstated though Thompson was banned. This still posed a problem for Ford as they were lacking spare drivers, with injuries with [[A.J. Foyt]], [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> In the end Australian [[Brian Muir (racing driver)|Brian Muir]], who was in England was flown over to France. He did his two laps, his first ever at Le Mans on raceday morning to qualify.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\n==Race==\n===Start===\nOn a cool and cloudy afternoon, it was [[Henry Ford II]] this year who was the honorary starter.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Last minute raindrops caused a flurry of tyre changes and some cars switched from Firestone to Goodyear or Dunlop.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/> At the end of the first lap Ford's cars led \u2013 Hill ahead of Gurney then Bucknum, Parkes in the Ferrari, followed by Whitmore's Ford, the Chaparral, then the GT40s of Scott and Rindt.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> There had been instant excitement when Edgar Berney spun his Bizzarrini on the start-line amongst the crowd of departing cars.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.232\">Spurring 2010, p.232</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.144\">Clausager 1982, p.144</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Miles had to pit after the first lap to fix his door after colliding with Whitmore's Ford at the start.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> Also pitting on the first lap was Paul Hawkins whose Ford broke a halfshaft going down the [[Mulsanne Straight]] lurching him sideways at nearly 350&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> The Holman & Moody crew took 70 minutes to repair it only for Mark Donohue to have the rear boot blow off down the Mulsanne and find the differential had been terminally damaged.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.25\">Clarke 1997, p.25: Motor Jun25 1966</ref>\n\nOn the third lap Gurney took the lead, which he held onto until the first pit-stops. McLaren was being delayed by his tyres going off, so the team quietly changed from Firestones to Goodyears.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/> After only 9 laps, Rindt's Ford blew its engine at the end of the Mulsanne straight, so there would be no consecutive win.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/> At the end of the first hour Fords were 1-2-3, with Gurney leading by 24 seconds from Graham Hill and Bucknum. Fourth, 20 seconds further back, was the first NART Ferrari, of Rodriguez. Meanwhile, Miles had been putting in extremely fast laps, breaking the lap record and getting back up to 5th place. Parkes was 6th ahead of Bonnier in the Chaparral who had already been lapped. Within another hour Miles and Hulme had taken the lead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\">Spurring 2010, p.208-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/>\n\nAt 8pm, only the Miles and Gurney Fords and Rodiguez's Ferrari were on the lead lap (#64).<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.26\">Clarke 1997, p.26: Motor Jun25 1966</ref> At dusk it started to drizzle, reducing the power advantage of the big Fords, and allowing the Ferraris to keep in touch. The Fords were further delayed as a number chose to change brake pads early.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/> By then all three Dinos were out with mechanical issues, removing one threat to Porsche.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> A major accident occurred when Jean-Claude Ogier's CD got loose on spilt oil at the Mulsanne kink and was hit hard side-on by Fran\u00e7ois Pasquier in the NART ASA. Both cars hit the wall and caught fire,  and Ogier was taken to the hospital with two broken arms.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\"/><ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\">Clarke 1997, p.11: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\n===Night===\nAfter 6 hours, heavy rain was pouring down. Ginther's NART Ferrari was leading from Parkes, chased by the Fords of Miles and Gurney on the same lap, McLaren a lap behind then Bandini and Andretti two laps back. But Andretti was soon sidelined with a blown headgasket, as was the Hill/Muir Ford which had broken its front suspension coming out of Arnage corner.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\">Clarke 1997, p.12: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> As the rain eased, the Fords of Miles and Gurney retook the lead. Just before midnight Robert Buchet aquaplaned coming over the crest at the Dunlop Bridge and crashed the French Porsche.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/> The Chaparral had been running well initially, getting as high as 5th, until a broken alternator stopped them also just before midnight while running in 8th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\"/>\n\nAnother heavy downpour at 12.30 contributed to a big accident in the Esses. Guichet had just spun his Ferrari in the rain and got away when Buchet arrived and crashed his Porsche. Then Schlesser's Matra ran into the CD of Georges Heligouin avoiding the accident. As the damage was being cleared, Scarfiotti crashed his P3 into the Matra and all four cars were wrecked, although only Scarfiotti was taken to hospital, with minor bruising.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\"/>\n\nDuring the night the Ferraris started to suffer from overheating. When the NART P3 retired from 4th with a broken gearbox at 3am, and the Filipinetti car of Mairesse/M\u00fcller from 5th an hour later, the Ferrari challenge was spent \u2013 there would be no privateer-saviours for the marque this year. At halfway the Ford Mk IIs held the top-4 places (Miles/Hulme, Gurney/Grant, McLaren/Amon, Bucknum/Hutcherson) with GT40s in 5-6-8: Essex, Filipinetti and Ford-France (Revson/Scott, Spoerry/Sutcliffe, Ligier/Grossman). Siffert/Davis were leading a train of Porsches in 7th and the nearest Ferrari was the Bandini/Guichet P3 limping in 12th. Ford told their cars to drop to 4-minute laps, but Gurney and Miles kept racing hard for the lead.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\"/>\n\n===Morning===\nWhat could have been a procession was anything but for Ford. At 8 am, a pit-stop for the Filipinetti Ford running 5th spilled petrol on a rear tyre. On his out-lap Spoerry lost traction and spun at the Esses wrecking the car. The Ford-France and Essex cars had already retired with engine issues during the night.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/>\n\nAt 9am the Gurney/Grant car, which had been dicing for the lead with Miles & Hulme (against strict team orders), retired from 1st when the car blew a headgasket. That left Ford with only three Mk IIs left (albeit running 1-2-3) as all the GT40s had retired as well. Porsches now held the next five places and the two Ferrari GTs were 9th and 10th chased by the Alpines.\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nWith the field covered it was now that Leo Beebe, Ford racing director, contrived to stage a dead heat by having his two lead cars cross the line simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/le-mans/look-back-1966-le-mans-24-hours|title=A look back at the 1966 Le Mans 24 Hours|date=2016-05-05|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref> The ACO told him this would not be possible \u2014 given the staggered starting formation, the #2 car would have covered 20 metres further, and thus be the race winner.

Miles/Hulme were leading, followed by McLaren/Amon holding station on the same lap. The gold Bucknum/Hutcherson car was third, but twelve laps behind. Miles was told to ease off to allow McLaren to catch up with him. Just before 4pm, it started to drizzle again. As it turned out McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line just ahead and was declared the winner. It was rumoured that Miles, upset about the team orders, lifted off to allow McLaren to finish a length ahead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.13\">Clarke 1997, p.13: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1104584_watch-the-story-of-the-controversy-behind-the-ford-gt40s-photo-finish-at-le-mans-in-1966|title=Watch the story of the controversy behind the Ford GT40's photo finish at Le Mans in 1966|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2016/06/17/le-mans-1966-the-golden-mystery.html|title=Le Mans 1966: The Golden Mystery \u2013 dailysportscar.com|website=www.dailysportscar.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>\n\nAt their last pitstop, the 7th-placed Porsche of [[Peter Gregg (racing driver)|Peter Gregg]] and Sten Axelsson was stopped by engine problems. Gregg parked the car waiting for the last lap, but at 3.50pm he could not get it restarted and missed the formation finish. The other Porsches came in 4th to 7th led by Siffert/Davis, who also claimed the Index of Performance. The [[Rolf Stommelen|Stommelen]]/[[G\u00fcnter Klass|Klass]] car in 7th was the first, and only, Sports car to finish. Finally, the new 911 GT ran well and finished 14th starting a long record of success.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/>\n\nFour Alpines finished this year, 9-11-12-13, with that of Delageneste/Cheinisse from the Ecurie Savin-Calberson winning the Thermal Efficiency Index.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/> The final finisher was the little Mini Marcos. Formerly the object of laughter, it had become a crowd favourite running like clockwork. As car after car ran into trouble and dropped out, the little Marcos, by this time nicknamed 'la puce bleue' (the blue flea) wailed on. Despite finishing 26 laps behind the rest of the field.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> the car eventually came home at an incredible 15th overall.\n\nIt had taken three attempts for Ford to win [[1965 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] and the NASCAR Championship, and now it added the Le Mans 24 Hours. Chrysler had first entered in 1925, and after 41 years it was the first win for an American car.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/> The official [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] press release, erroneously dated 7/5/1966, claims:  {{cquote|The McLaren-Amon and the Miles-Hulme cars were running within seconds of each other as the race neared its end, with the Bucknum-Hutcherson car hanging back as insurance. A decision was made in the Ford pits to have the cars finish side by side in what hopefully would be considered a dead heat. All three cars went over the finish in formation, but any chance for a dead heat disappeared when officials discovered a rule that in case of a tie, the car that had started further down the grid had travelled the farther distance. Since McLaren and Amon had started 60 feet behind Miles and Hulme, they were declared the winners. Both [[New Zealanders]] who now reside in England, it was the most important victory yet for the two youngsters. McLaren, who builds his own Formula and sports cars, is 28. Amon 22, is the youngest winner in the history of the event. It was a record shattering performance as the winning car covered more miles (3,009.3) at a faster speed (125.38 mph) than any previous entry. It demonstrated that production engines could compete with racing powerplants and that an American-built car could top Europe's best.<ref>[https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2016/06/Ford%201966%20Le%20Mans%20release.pdf]</ref>}} The Ford team's decision was a big disappointment for Ken Miles, who was aiming for the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|'Endurance Racing]] Triple Crown'\u2014winning Daytona-Sebring-Le Mans\u2014as a reward for his investment in the GT40 development. \"I'm disappointed, of course, but what are you going to do about it.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18408295/|title=20 Jun 1966, Page 11 - The Cumberland News at Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref> Beebe also later admitted he had been annoyed with Miles racing Gurney, disregarding team orders by potentially risking the cars\u2019 endurance.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/>  Two months later, Ken Miles was killed at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] while testing the next generation Ford GT40 J-Car, which became the MkIV that won Le Mans in 1967.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|title=Ken Miles--an appreciation|website=www.cobracountry.com|access-date=2016-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201829/http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a race of attrition it was fortunate the big teams brought such quantity \u2013 only 3 of the 13 Fords finished and only the two GTs finished from the 14 Ferraris entered. By contrast, 5 of the 7 Porsches finished (including their 911 in the GT class) as did four of the six Alpines, showing much better reliability. It was the first time that the 3000 miles/125&nbsp;mph mark had been exceeded.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/>\n\nWith the bitter failure of Ferrari's 330 P3 mirroring the failure of the Ford prototypes the previous year (and with salt rubbed into the wound with Ford's formation finish), the \"Ford-Ferrari War\" moved into its climactic phase.  The Le Mans results boosted Ford over Ferrari for the [[1966 World Sportscar Championship#Manufacturers' Championship|1966 Manufacturers' Championship]].  Ford's answer to Ferrari's next weapon, the [[Ferrari P|330 P4]], was delayed by development problems, handing Ferrari a rematch with the Mk IIs that so dominated them at LeMans, at the 1967 [[Daytona 24 Hours]].  After a defective batch of transaxle shafts sank Ford's effort, Ferrari took a 1-2-3 finish with their new P4s and returned the favor of Ford's victory formation.  Ford's [[Ford GT40|Mark IV]] was ready in time for the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], where it won on its maiden outing.  Three more examples were produced and prepared for the Le Mans 24 Hours, while Ford's championship hopes rested on the older [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] and the new GT40-derived [[Mirage (race car)|Mirages]] to gain points in the intervening races.  After a disappointing showing at [[1000 km Monza|Monza]] a controversial denial of championship points from a Mirage win at the [[1000 km Spa|Spa]] event, Ford saw limited opportunity for taking the Manufacturers' title again and instead concentrated on a last hurrah at Le Mans, where the leading Mark IV, driven by Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt, won handily.  Ferrari took the Manufacturers' title for 1967, edging up-and-coming Porsche by two points.\n\nThe Ford-Ferrari War was ended by new rules for 1968 that eliminated the P4s and Mark IVs from eligibility for the Sports Prototype class with a 3-litre engine capacity limit.  The GT40s met the production requirement and 5 litre limit for [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] in the new [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class.  Ferrari found the production requirement for homologating the P4 under Group 4 daunting and withdrew from competition in the sport-racer classes.  Neither Ford nor Ferrari fielded a factory team for the Manufacturers' Championship that year; however, the [[John Wyer]] team running the Group 4 [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] brought home the title for Ford and in 1969 achieved wins with the GT40 at Sebring and Le Mans.  When Ferrari was able to enter a homologated car for 1970, the class they competed in was dominated by the [[Porsche 917]].\n\nSeveral cars of the original 24-hours race have survived and have been restored to their former glory. The crowd-pleasing Mini Marcos was club raced, rallied and hill climbed, road registered twice and repainted five times only to be stolen in the night of 30 October 1975 from beneath a flat in Paris. Three days earlier Marcos-boss Harold Dermott had made a deal to buy the car with the intention to restore it and put on museum display. Several people searched for the car ever since, but it was only found back in December 2016 in Portugal by Dutchman Jeroen Booij.\n\n== Legacy in popular culture ==\n=== ''Go Like Hell'' ===\nThe race became the subject of a 2009 book, detailing the race and the famous background rivalry between [[Enzo Ferrari]] and [[Henry Ford II]], by [[A.J.

I recall it was damp and we were running on intermediate Firestone tires and at 210\u2013220 mph [355 kmh] on the Mulsanne Straight, the tires were shedding tread. I took over from Bruce and he spoke to Firestone and they generously said we could switch to the Goodyears the other GT40s were running. Bruce said to me we had to drive the doors off the thing, so we did. There was a bit of history to that. We had both driven the first two 7.0-litre cars at Le Mans the previous year: Bruce with Ken Miles and myself with Phil Hill. We were warned to be careful with the gearbox as they were new and unproven, and both cars retired with gearbox failures. As a result, when I went to Daytona for the 24 hours, paired with Bruce, I suggested to Bruce that we set a fairly conservative pace for the race, and whilst we might be running out of the top three in the early stages, we might be the only one there at the end. We finished fifth. For Le Mans, we decided to set a pace for ourselves. This strategy fell apart when our tires started losing treads early in the race and we lost considerable time. When I was called in to change tires, I think Bruce's frustration had reached boiling point, he put his head through the car door and said 'Go like hell!'.\" At the finish: \"the idea was that the leading GT40s would cross the line together, but in practice, it wasn't possible to have a dead heat.

The following year, they won again. The year after that, they won a third time. And in 1969, a fourth.\n\nThat achievement was arguably the greatest in the company's history. It came after years of struggle, more than a few public failures, and enough burnt cash to refloat the ''Titanic. ''Ford's Sixties Le Mans program was famously the result of a dispute between Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari\u2013Ford had tried to purchase Ferrari (the company), only to have Enzo shut down the sale at the last minute. Ford the man vowed to get even, aiming his considerable resources at Ferrari's Le Mans record. The resulting warpath employed everyone from Bruce McLaren to Carroll Shelby and Indy 500 legend [[A. J. Foyt|A.J. Foyt]], putting the stops to Ferrari's unbroken, five-year winning streak at La Sarthe.\n\nCollectively, Ford's wins were one of countless bright moments in a golden decade for both motorsport and [[Popular culture|culture]] in general. That first win made it onto the front pages of European newspapers, and it actually helped sell new cars. Ferrari never won Le Mans again, but Ford wouldn't go back until 2016. When [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans|Dearborn won last year]], the world went less than nuts. But that makes sense: Both Le Mans and international motorsport are different now, tamer and less raw. So is the automobile itself. Racing is no longer a brutally dangerous pastime or the kind of thing that puts whole countries on the edge of their seats. And most of all, in 2016, there is no [[Henry Ford II|Henry the Deuce]], no world-altering grudge match, no Enzo, no Carroll.

GT cars were now [[Group 3 (racing)|Group 3]] and Prototypes were now [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]]. Two new classes for Sports Cars were [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] and [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] for \u2018Special Sports Cars\u2019 (Group 1 and 2 covered Touring Cars, [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7]] led to the [[1966 Can-Am season|Can-Am series]], with Group 8 and 9 for single-seaters).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\">Spurring 2010, p.208</ref>\n\nAs Group 7 were ineligible for FIA events, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) opened its entry list to Group 3, 4 and 6. The FIA mandated minimum annual production runs of 500 cars for Group 3 (up from 100 previously<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.140\">Clausager 1982, p.140</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\">Moity 1974, p.102-4</ref>) and 50 for Group 4,<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/>  which also had a maximum engine capacity of 5000cc. There were no engine limits on the GTs or Prototypes. As before, the Groups were split up in classes based on engine size, there was a sliding scale of a minimum weight based on the increasing engine size (from 450 to 1000&nbsp;kg for 500 to 7000cc) as was fuel-tank capacity (60 to 160 litres).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\nAlong with the new Appendix J, after four years of focus on GT racing the FIA announced the International Manufacturer's Championship, for Group 6 Prototypes (2L / >2L), and the International Sports Car Championship for Group 4 (1.3L / 2L / 5L).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\n==Entries==\n[[File:Ford GT40 Mark II at Goodwood Revival 2013 001.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ford GT40]] Mark II ]]\n[[File:Ferrari-330p3-2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ferrari 330 P3]]]]\n[[File:Porsche 906 Tour Auto 2014 Circuit de Dijon Prenois 03.jpg|left|thumb|Porsche 906 Carrera]]\nWith the new regulations this year the ACO received a huge 103 entry requests.

Extensive work was done in the wind tunnel, and improving the brakes, handling and engine \u2013 not least improving the fuel economy.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\">Clarke 1997, p.6-7: Autosport Jun17 1966</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\">Fox 1973, p.201</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.18\">Clarke 1997, p.18: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\">Armstrong 1966, p.209</ref> The big 7-litre engine now put out 475&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But the new year started with promise with [[Ken Miles]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]] winning both the inaugural [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and then [[12 Hours of Sebring]].<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/> Copying Ferrari's tactic of overwhelming numbers, they put in fifteen Mark II entrants; eight were accepted by the ACO. This time six were built and prepared by [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]]. Shelby ran three cars himself for Americans [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Jerry Grant]], Miles was now paired with New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]] after Ruby had been injured in a plane-crash a month earlier.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\">Fox 1973, p.198</ref> The third car was the all-[[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]] pairing of [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]]. [[Holman Moody|Holman & Moody]], the successful Ford NASCAR race-team was brought on board to race another trio \u2013 for [[Mark Donohue]]/[[Paul Hawkins (racing driver)|Paul Hawkins]], [[Ronnie Bucknum]]/[[Dick Hutcherson]] and [[Lucien Bianchi]]/[[Mario Andretti]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.15\">Clarke 1997, p.15: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref> One of the big improvements Holman & Moody brought with them was a quick-change brakepad system to save time in the pits.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.21\">Clarke 1997, p.21: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref>\n\nThe British team [[Alan Mann Racing]] had two cars prepared by Ford Advanced Vehicles, for [[Graham Hill]]/[[Dick Thompson (racing driver)|Dick Thompson]] and [[John Whitmore (racing driver)|John Whitmore]]/[[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]]. Each of the eight cars was painted in a colour from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]] road-car range.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\">Spurring 2010, p.210-3</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\">Clarke 1997, p.10: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\nFerrari's response to the Mk II was the new [[Ferrari P#330 P3|Ferrari 330 P3]]. Shorter and wider than the P2, it kept the same 4-litre engine but with fuel-injection now put out 420&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\"/> The works team had a pair of closed-cockpit versions for [[John Surtees]]/[[Ludovico Scarfiotti]] and former winners [[Lorenzo Bandini]]/[[Jean Guichet]]. An open-cockpit variant was given to the [[North American Racing Team]] (NART) for [[Pedro Rodriguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] /[[Richie Ginther]]. But their race preparation had been limited by strike action in Italy.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\">Spurring 2010, p.217-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\">Laban 2001, p.150-1</ref>\n\nNART also entered a long-tailed P2, rebodied by [[Piero Drogo]] and driven by last year's winner [[Masten Gregory]] with [[Bob Bondurant]]. There were also P2/P3 hybrids for the [[Ecurie Francorchamps]] (Dumay/\"Beurlys\") and [[Scuderia Filipinetti]] ([[Willy Mairesse|Mairesse]]/[[Herbert M\u00fcller (racing driver)|M\u00fcller]]. Finally there was a P2 Spyder for Maranello Concessionaires ([[Richard Attwood|Attwood]]/[[David Piper (racing driver)|Piper]]).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\">Clarke 1997, p.9: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> Fighting on two fronts, the company also took on Porsche in the 2-litre class with its [[Dino 206 S]] with a pair from NART and another for Maranello. [[Nino Vaccarella]], race winner in [[1964 24 Hours of Le Mans|1964]], was furious when he found out he was \u2018demoted\u2019 to drive the Dino rather than the P3 and threatened to walk out, but did, in the end run the car.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\">Clarke 1997, p.24: Motor Jun25 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\">Armstrong 1966, p.235</ref>\n\nChevrolet was the other player in the over 2-litre class. Ex-Ferrari engineer [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] had fallen out with [[Renzo Rivolta]] and with his own company brought his new design, the P538, but still using the 5.3L Chevrolet engine. The other Chev was in Texan [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]]\u2019s [[Chaparral Cars#2|Chaparral 2D]]. The 5.3L \u2018small-block\u2019 put out 420&nbsp;bhp and had an semi-automatic transmission.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> Driven by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Jo Bonnier]], they made a big impact winning the N\u00fcrburgring round just two weeks earlier.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\">Spurring 2010, p.227</ref>\n\nPorsche came with a new model \u2013 the [[Porsche 906|906]] designed by the team led by [[Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch]]. With the 2.0L flat-6 engine from the 911, it had recently been homologated for Group 4 with the requisite 50 cars.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.210\">Armstrong 1966, p.210</ref> It was race-proven too, after winning the [[Targa Florio]] the month before. However three ''langheck'' (long-tail) prototypes were also entered by the works team, driven by [[Hans Herrmann]]/[[Herbert Linge]], [[Jo Siffert]]/[[Colin Davis (racing driver)|Colin Davis]] and [[Udo Sch\u00fctz]]/[[Peter de Klerk]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\">Spurring 2010, p.220-1</ref>\n\nAlfa Romeo, and its works team [[Autodelta]], had withdrawn from racing for a year to prepare a new car for 1967.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/> But this year, a significant new manufacturer entered the fray: [[Matra]] had bought out [[Automobiles Ren\u00e9 Bonnet]] in 1964, rebadging the [[Matra Djet|Djet]]. However it was a new design that was entered. The M620 had a 2-litre version of the BRM Formula 1 engine developing 245&nbsp;bhp that could match the Porsches in speed, making 275&nbsp;kp/h (170&nbsp;mph). The three cars were driven by up and coming young French single-seater drivers [[Jean-Pierre Beltoise]]/[[Johnny Servoz-Gavin]], [[Jean-Pierre Jaussaud]]/[[Henri Pescarolo]] and [[Jo Schlesser]] with Welshman [[Alan Rees (racing driver)|Alan Rees]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.222\">Spurring 2010, p.222</ref>\n\nRemarkably, given British dominance of the race barely a decade earlier, there were only three British cars in this year's race. Defending class-champions Austin-Healey had two works entries. The other was a [[Marcos Engineering]] kit-car based on a Mini Cooper 'S' chassis. Entered by Frenchman Hubert Giraud and driven by Jean-Louis Marnat and Claude Ballot-Lena, the team was able to get a works engine and gearbox from [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]]. The spectators laughed at the small car and its apparent resemblance to a flea.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\">Spurring 2010, p.233</ref> But the Mini Marcos would became the 'darling of the crowds' later on in the race.\n\nAlpine, after its poor showing in the previous year, returned with 6 cars. The new A210 had a 1.3L Gordini-Renault engine with a Porsche gearbox making it more durable if only a little faster at 245&nbsp;kp/h (150&nbsp;mph). This year a new customer team, the Ecurie Savin-Calberson was supported by Alpine, with former Index winner Roger Delageneste.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\">Spurring 2010, p.224</ref>\n\n[[Charles Deutsch]] (CD) brought his new aerodynamic SP66. The car was powered by a 1130cc Peugeot engine, marking the return of the French company last seen in the 1938 race.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\">Spurring 2010, p.231</ref> Another competitor in the small prototypes was [[ASA (automobile)|ASA]]. Originally a Ferrari design by [[Carlo Chiti]] and [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] before their famous [[History of Ferrari#1961 \u2013 The great walkout|walk-out from Ferrari]], it was sold to the new Italian company and uprated with a 1290cc engine giving 125&nbsp;bhp. Two cars were entered, one by ASA and one by NART.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\">Spurring 2010, p.228</ref>\n\nThe new Group 4 category started attracting interest as the earlier prototypes were meeting the homologation and production requirements. There were six GT40s entered by customer teams, with the 4.7L engine. [[Jochen Rindt]], the previous year's winner, had moved across from Ferrari to Ford, in the new Canadian Comstock Racing Team. They joined Ford France, Scuderia Filipinetti and new privateers Scuderia Bear and [[Superior Essex|Essex Wire]]. Joining Skip Scott, team owner of the Essex Wire team, was a 21-year old [[Jacky Ickx]] in his Le Mans debut.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\">Spurring 2010, p.214-5</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\">Clausager 1982, p.147</ref>\n\nUp against them was [[Ed Hugus]]\u2019 modified Ferrari 275 GTB and the [[Ecurie Nationale Belge|Equipe Nationale Belge]] ran its 250 LM. Porsche also ran three regular 906s in the Sports category, two works entries as well as one for their Paris importer \u2018Toto\u2019 Veuillet.\n\nWith Shelby now fully concentrated on the Ford program, the Cobra GTs were abandoned. There were only three GT entries: the Ferrari customer teams Ecurie Francorchamps and Maranello Concessionaires both entered a 275 GTB. The third was a quiet though significant entry: Jacques Dewes, ever the pioneering privateer, brought the first Porsche 911 to Le Mans. Production of what would become the ubiquitous Le Mans car had started in late 1964 and the new 911 S model had its \u2018boxer\u2019 6-cylinder engine tuned to 160&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.223\">Spurring 2010, p.223</ref>\n\nFinally, in a subcompetition of its own, there was the tyre-race between [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/>\n\n==Practice==\nOnce again there was rain at the April testing weekend. And once again there was tragedy with a fatal accident. American Walt Hansgen's Ford hit water on the pit straight and aquaplaned. He aimed for the escape road at the end of the straight, not realising it was blocked by a sandbank, which he hit at about 190&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph). Taken with critical injuries to the American military hospital at [[Orl\u00e9ans]], he died five days later.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\n\nA notable absentee at the test weekend was the Ferrari works team.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Chris Amon was fastest at the test weekend in the experimental [[Ford GT40#J-car|Ford J-car]] with a 3:34.4 lap.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But come race-week it was Gurney who put in the fastest qualifying lap of 3:30.6, a second faster than his stablemates Miles, Gardner and McLaren. Ginther was 5th in the fastest Ferrari with a 3:33.0, with Parkes and Bandini in 7th and 8th respectively. Phil Hill, in the Chaparral, broke up the Ford-Ferrari procession in 10th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\">Spurring 2010, p.235</ref>\n\nJo Siffert put the quickest Porsche 22nd on the grid with 3:51.0, with Nino Vaccarella's Ferrari in 24th (3:53.5) and Jo Schlesser's Matra just behind it (3:53.5). Over the test weekend, Mauro Bianchi had surprised many in the 1-litre Alpine, going as fast as the 1959 Ferrari Testa Rossas.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\nThe quickest Alpine in practice was [[Pauli Toivonen|Toivonen]]/Jansson (4:20.1), well ahead of the best CD (Ogier/Laurent 4:27.5) and the Austin-Healey's (4:45.1) and ASAs (4:49.8).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\"/>\n\nThere were also two significant dramas in practice. The biggest news was the walkout of Ferrari's lead driver [[John Surtees]]. He and team manager Eugenio Dragoni had decided that he, as the fastest Ferrari driver and driving with [[Mike Parkes]], would act as the hare to bait and break the Fords. He was also still recovering from a big accident the previous year and would hand over to Scarfiotti if he got overly tired. Yet during raceweek, with news that new FIAT chairman [[Gianni Agnelli]] would be at the race, Dragoni changed the plan, putting Scarfiotti (Agnelli's nephew) in first. Surtees was furious and stormed off to Maranello to argue his case with [[Enzo Ferrari]].<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Not listened to, Surtees, Ferrari's [[1964 Formula One season|1964 F1 World Champion]], quit the team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\nThe second incident was more serious \u2013 Dick Thompson in the Alan Mann Ford Mk II collided with Dick Holqvist who was going far slower in the Scuderia Bear Ford GT40 and pulled right in front of him at Maison Blanche.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> Holqvist spun off with heavy damage, while Thompson was able to get back to the pits. While repairing the damage, officials told the team that they were disqualified for Thompson leaving the scene of a major accident. Thompson was adamant he had advised pit officials, and in the hearing Ford's director of racing Leo Beebe threatened to withdraw all Fords. He was supported by [[Fritz Huschke von Hanstein|Huschke von Hanstein]] who was prepared to withdraw the Porsche team as well.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> In the end, the car was reinstated though Thompson was banned. This still posed a problem for Ford as they were lacking spare drivers, with injuries with [[A.J. Foyt]], [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> In the end Australian [[Brian Muir (racing driver)|Brian Muir]], who was in England was flown over to France. He did his two laps, his first ever at Le Mans on raceday morning to qualify.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\n==Race==\n===Start===\nOn a cool and cloudy afternoon, it was [[Henry Ford II]] this year who was the honorary starter.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Last minute raindrops caused a flurry of tyre changes and some cars switched from Firestone to Goodyear or Dunlop.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/> At the end of the first lap Ford's cars led \u2013 Hill ahead of Gurney then Bucknum, Parkes in the Ferrari, followed by Whitmore's Ford, the Chaparral, then the GT40s of Scott and Rindt.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> There had been instant excitement when Edgar Berney spun his Bizzarrini on the start-line amongst the crowd of departing cars.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.232\">Spurring 2010, p.232</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.144\">Clausager 1982, p.144</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Miles had to pit after the first lap to fix his door after colliding with Whitmore's Ford at the start.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> Also pitting on the first lap was Paul Hawkins whose Ford broke a halfshaft going down the [[Mulsanne Straight]] lurching him sideways at nearly 350&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> The Holman & Moody crew took 70 minutes to repair it only for Mark Donohue to have the rear boot blow off down the Mulsanne and find the differential had been terminally damaged.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.25\">Clarke 1997, p.25: Motor Jun25 1966</ref>\n\nOn the third lap Gurney took the lead, which he held onto until the first pit-stops. McLaren was being delayed by his tyres going off, so the team quietly changed from Firestones to Goodyears.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/> After only 9 laps, Rindt's Ford blew its engine at the end of the Mulsanne straight, so there would be no consecutive win.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/> At the end of the first hour Fords were 1-2-3, with Gurney leading by 24 seconds from Graham Hill and Bucknum. Fourth, 20 seconds further back, was the first NART Ferrari, of Rodriguez. Meanwhile, Miles had been putting in extremely fast laps, breaking the lap record and getting back up to 5th place. Parkes was 6th ahead of Bonnier in the Chaparral who had already been lapped. Within another hour Miles and Hulme had taken the lead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\">Spurring 2010, p.208-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/>\n\nAt 8pm, only the Miles and Gurney Fords and Rodiguez's Ferrari were on the lead lap (#64).<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.26\">Clarke 1997, p.26: Motor Jun25 1966</ref> At dusk it started to drizzle, reducing the power advantage of the big Fords, and allowing the Ferraris to keep in touch. The Fords were further delayed as a number chose to change brake pads early.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/> By then all three Dinos were out with mechanical issues, removing one threat to Porsche.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> A major accident occurred when Jean-Claude Ogier's CD got loose on spilt oil at the Mulsanne kink and was hit hard side-on by Fran\u00e7ois Pasquier in the NART ASA. Both cars hit the wall and caught fire,  and Ogier was taken to the hospital with two broken arms.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\"/><ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\">Clarke 1997, p.11: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\n===Night===\nAfter 6 hours, heavy rain was pouring down. Ginther's NART Ferrari was leading from Parkes, chased by the Fords of Miles and Gurney on the same lap, McLaren a lap behind then Bandini and Andretti two laps back. But Andretti was soon sidelined with a blown headgasket, as was the Hill/Muir Ford which had broken its front suspension coming out of Arnage corner.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\">Clarke 1997, p.12: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> As the rain eased, the Fords of Miles and Gurney retook the lead. Just before midnight Robert Buchet aquaplaned coming over the crest at the Dunlop Bridge and crashed the French Porsche.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/> The Chaparral had been running well initially, getting as high as 5th, until a broken alternator stopped them also just before midnight while running in 8th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\"/>\n\nAnother heavy downpour at 12.30 contributed to a big accident in the Esses. Guichet had just spun his Ferrari in the rain and got away when Buchet arrived and crashed his Porsche. Then Schlesser's Matra ran into the CD of Georges Heligouin avoiding the accident. As the damage was being cleared, Scarfiotti crashed his P3 into the Matra and all four cars were wrecked, although only Scarfiotti was taken to hospital, with minor bruising.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\"/>\n\nDuring the night the Ferraris started to suffer from overheating. When the NART P3 retired from 4th with a broken gearbox at 3am, and the Filipinetti car of Mairesse/M\u00fcller from 5th an hour later, the Ferrari challenge was spent \u2013 there would be no privateer-saviours for the marque this year. At halfway the Ford Mk IIs held the top-4 places (Miles/Hulme, Gurney/Grant, McLaren/Amon, Bucknum/Hutcherson) with GT40s in 5-6-8: Essex, Filipinetti and Ford-France (Revson/Scott, Spoerry/Sutcliffe, Ligier/Grossman). Siffert/Davis were leading a train of Porsches in 7th and the nearest Ferrari was the Bandini/Guichet P3 limping in 12th. Ford told their cars to drop to 4-minute laps, but Gurney and Miles kept racing hard for the lead.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\"/>\n\n===Morning===\nWhat could have been a procession was anything but for Ford. At 8 am, a pit-stop for the Filipinetti Ford running 5th spilled petrol on a rear tyre. On his out-lap Spoerry lost traction and spun at the Esses wrecking the car. The Ford-France and Essex cars had already retired with engine issues during the night.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/>\n\nAt 9am the Gurney/Grant car, which had been dicing for the lead with Miles & Hulme (against strict team orders), retired from 1st when the car blew a headgasket. That left Ford with only three Mk IIs left (albeit running 1-2-3) as all the GT40s had retired as well. Porsches now held the next five places and the two Ferrari GTs were 9th and 10th chased by the Alpines.\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nWith the field covered it was now that Leo Beebe, Ford racing director, contrived to stage a dead heat by having his two lead cars cross the line simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/le-mans/look-back-1966-le-mans-24-hours|title=A look back at the 1966 Le Mans 24 Hours|date=2016-05-05|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref> The ACO told him this would not be possible \u2014 given the staggered starting formation, the #2 car would have covered 20 metres further, and thus be the race winner. But Beebe pushed on with his plan anyway.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\">Fox 1973, p.202</ref>\n\nAt the last pit stop, the Mark IIs were still in front. Miles/Hulme were leading, followed by McLaren/Amon holding station on the same lap. The gold Bucknum/Hutcherson car was third, but twelve laps behind. Miles was told to ease off to allow McLaren to catch up with him. Just before 4pm, it started to drizzle again. As it turned out McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line just ahead and was declared the winner. It was rumoured that Miles, upset about the team orders, lifted off to allow McLaren to finish a length ahead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.13\">Clarke 1997, p.13: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1104584_watch-the-story-of-the-controversy-behind-the-ford-gt40s-photo-finish-at-le-mans-in-1966|title=Watch the story of the controversy behind the Ford GT40's photo finish at Le Mans in 1966|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2016/06/17/le-mans-1966-the-golden-mystery.html|title=Le Mans 1966: The Golden Mystery \u2013 dailysportscar.com|website=www.dailysportscar.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>\n\nAt their last pitstop, the 7th-placed Porsche of [[Peter Gregg (racing driver)|Peter Gregg]] and Sten Axelsson was stopped by engine problems. Gregg parked the car waiting for the last lap, but at 3.50pm he could not get it restarted and missed the formation finish. The other Porsches came in 4th to 7th led by Siffert/Davis, who also claimed the Index of Performance. The [[Rolf Stommelen|Stommelen]]/[[G\u00fcnter Klass|Klass]] car in 7th was the first, and only, Sports car to finish. Finally, the new 911 GT ran well and finished 14th starting a long record of success.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/>\n\nFour Alpines finished this year, 9-11-12-13, with that of Delageneste/Cheinisse from the Ecurie Savin-Calberson winning the Thermal Efficiency Index.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/> The final finisher was the little Mini Marcos. Formerly the object of laughter, it had become a crowd favourite running like clockwork. As car after car ran into trouble and dropped out, the little Marcos, by this time nicknamed 'la puce bleue' (the blue flea) wailed on. Despite finishing 26 laps behind the rest of the field.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> the car eventually came home at an incredible 15th overall.\n\nIt had taken three attempts for Ford to win [[1965 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] and the NASCAR Championship, and now it added the Le Mans 24 Hours. Chrysler had first entered in 1925, and after 41 years it was the first win for an American car.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/> The official [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] press release, erroneously dated 7/5/1966, claims:  {{cquote|The McLaren-Amon and the Miles-Hulme cars were running within seconds of each other as the race neared its end, with the Bucknum-Hutcherson car hanging back as insurance. A decision was made in the Ford pits to have the cars finish side by side in what hopefully would be considered a dead heat. All three cars went over the finish in formation, but any chance for a dead heat disappeared when officials discovered a rule that in case of a tie, the car that had started further down the grid had travelled the farther distance. Since McLaren and Amon had started 60 feet behind Miles and Hulme, they were declared the winners. Both [[New Zealanders]] who now reside in England, it was the most important victory yet for the two youngsters. McLaren, who builds his own Formula and sports cars, is 28. Amon 22, is the youngest winner in the history of the event. It was a record shattering performance as the winning car covered more miles (3,009.3) at a faster speed (125.38 mph) than any previous entry. It demonstrated that production engines could compete with racing powerplants and that an American-built car could top Europe's best.<ref>[https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2016/06/Ford%201966%20Le%20Mans%20release.pdf]</ref>}} The Ford team's decision was a big disappointment for Ken Miles, who was aiming for the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|'Endurance Racing]] Triple Crown'\u2014winning Daytona-Sebring-Le Mans\u2014as a reward for his investment in the GT40 development. \"I'm disappointed, of course, but what are you going to do about it.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18408295/|title=20 Jun 1966, Page 11 - The Cumberland News at Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref> Beebe also later admitted he had been annoyed with Miles racing Gurney, disregarding team orders by potentially risking the cars\u2019 endurance.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/>  Two months later, Ken Miles was killed at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] while testing the next generation Ford GT40 J-Car, which became the MkIV that won Le Mans in 1967.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|title=Ken Miles--an appreciation|website=www.cobracountry.com|access-date=2016-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201829/http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a race of attrition it was fortunate the big teams brought such quantity \u2013 only 3 of the 13 Fords finished and only the two GTs finished from the 14 Ferraris entered. By contrast, 5 of the 7 Porsches finished (including their 911 in the GT class) as did four of the six Alpines, showing much better reliability. It was the first time that the 3000 miles/125&nbsp;mph mark had been exceeded.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/>\n\nWith the bitter failure of Ferrari's 330 P3 mirroring the failure of the Ford prototypes the previous year (and with salt rubbed into the wound with Ford's formation finish), the \"Ford-Ferrari War\" moved into its climactic phase.  The Le Mans results boosted Ford over Ferrari for the [[1966 World Sportscar Championship#Manufacturers' Championship|1966 Manufacturers' Championship]].  Ford's answer to Ferrari's next weapon, the [[Ferrari P|330 P4]], was delayed by development problems, handing Ferrari a rematch with the Mk IIs that so dominated them at LeMans, at the 1967 [[Daytona 24 Hours]].  After a defective batch of transaxle shafts sank Ford's effort, Ferrari took a 1-2-3 finish with their new P4s and returned the favor of Ford's victory formation.  Ford's [[Ford GT40|Mark IV]] was ready in time for the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], where it won on its maiden outing.  Three more examples were produced and prepared for the Le Mans 24 Hours, while Ford's championship hopes rested on the older [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] and the new GT40-derived [[Mirage (race car)|Mirages]] to gain points in the intervening races.  After a disappointing showing at [[1000 km Monza|Monza]] a controversial denial of championship points from a Mirage win at the [[1000 km Spa|Spa]] event, Ford saw limited opportunity for taking the Manufacturers' title again and instead concentrated on a last hurrah at Le Mans, where the leading Mark IV, driven by Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt, won handily.  Ferrari took the Manufacturers' title for 1967, edging up-and-coming Porsche by two points.\n\nThe Ford-Ferrari War was ended by new rules for 1968 that eliminated the P4s and Mark IVs from eligibility for the Sports Prototype class with a 3-litre engine capacity limit.  The GT40s met the production requirement and 5 litre limit for [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] in the new [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class.  Ferrari found the production requirement for homologating the P4 under Group 4 daunting and withdrew from competition in the sport-racer classes.  Neither Ford nor Ferrari fielded a factory team for the Manufacturers' Championship that year; however, the [[John Wyer]] team running the Group 4 [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] brought home the title for Ford and in 1969 achieved wins with the GT40 at Sebring and Le Mans.  When Ferrari was able to enter a homologated car for 1970, the class they competed in was dominated by the [[Porsche 917]].\n\nSeveral cars of the original 24-hours race have survived and have been restored to their former glory. The crowd-pleasing Mini Marcos was club raced, rallied and hill climbed, road registered twice and repainted five times only to be stolen in the night of 30 October 1975 from beneath a flat in Paris. Three days earlier Marcos-boss Harold Dermott had made a deal to buy the car with the intention to restore it and put on museum display. Several people searched for the car ever since, but it was only found back in December 2016 in Portugal by Dutchman Jeroen Booij.\n\n== Legacy in popular culture ==\n=== ''Go Like Hell'' ===\nThe race became the subject of a 2009 book, detailing the race and the famous background rivalry between [[Enzo Ferrari]] and [[Henry Ford II]], by [[A.J.

I recall it was damp and we were running on intermediate Firestone tires and at 210\u2013220 mph [355 kmh] on the Mulsanne Straight, the tires were shedding tread. I took over from Bruce and he spoke to Firestone and they generously said we could switch to the Goodyears the other GT40s were running. Bruce said to me we had to drive the doors off the thing, so we did. There was a bit of history to that. We had both driven the first two 7.0-litre cars at Le Mans the previous year: Bruce with Ken Miles and myself with Phil Hill. We were warned to be careful with the gearbox as they were new and unproven, and both cars retired with gearbox failures. As a result, when I went to Daytona for the 24 hours, paired with Bruce, I suggested to Bruce that we set a fairly conservative pace for the race, and whilst we might be running out of the top three in the early stages, we might be the only one there at the end. We finished fifth. For Le Mans, we decided to set a pace for ourselves. This strategy fell apart when our tires started losing treads early in the race and we lost considerable time.

The following year, they won again. The year after that, they won a third time. And in 1969, a fourth.\n\nThat achievement was arguably the greatest in the company's history. It came after years of struggle, more than a few public failures, and enough burnt cash to refloat the ''Titanic. ''Ford's Sixties Le Mans program was famously the result of a dispute between Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari\u2013Ford had tried to purchase Ferrari (the company), only to have Enzo shut down the sale at the last minute. Ford the man vowed to get even, aiming his considerable resources at Ferrari's Le Mans record. The resulting warpath employed everyone from Bruce McLaren to Carroll Shelby and Indy 500 legend [[A. J. Foyt|A.J. Foyt]], putting the stops to Ferrari's unbroken, five-year winning streak at La Sarthe.\n\nCollectively, Ford's wins were one of countless bright moments in a golden decade for both motorsport and [[Popular culture|culture]] in general. That first win made it onto the front pages of European newspapers, and it actually helped sell new cars. Ferrari never won Le Mans again, but Ford wouldn't go back until 2016. When [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans|Dearborn won last year]], the world went less than nuts. But that makes sense: Both Le Mans and international motorsport are different now, tamer and less raw. So is the automobile itself. Racing is no longer a brutally dangerous pastime or the kind of thing that puts whole countries on the edge of their seats. And most of all, in 2016, there is no [[Henry Ford II|Henry the Deuce]], no world-altering grudge match, no Enzo, no Carroll. The Ford-Ferrari war pivoted on how these men operated and thought, and they made that story what it was.\" Sam Smith, ''Adam Carolla's 'The 24 Hour War' Is a Car Movie by Car People That Isn't Just for Car People'', [[Road & Track|Road and Track]], Jan. 18, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/entertainment/a32330/film-review-adam-carollas-the-24-hour-war/|title=Adam Carolla's 'The 24 Hour War' Is a Car Movie by Car People That Isn't Just for Car People|date=2017-01-18|work=Road & Track|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}</ref>}}\n\n=== ''Ford v Ferrari'' ===\n{{Main|Ford v Ferrari}}\n''Ford v Ferrari'' (known as  ''Le Mans '66'' in the UK and other territories) is a sports drama film based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari for the dominance at Le Mans distributed by [[20th Century Fox]].
