The Oscan group is part of the [[Osco-Umbrian]] or Sabellic family, and includes the Oscan language and three variants ([[Hernici#Language|Hernican]], [[Marrucini#Language|Marrucinian]] and [[Paeligni#Language|Paelignian]]) known only from inscriptions left by the [[Hernici]], [[Marrucini]] and [[Paeligni]], minor tribes of eastern central Italy.

For example, Latin ''volo'', ''velle'', ''volui'', and other such forms from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *wel ('to will') were represented by words derived from *gher ('to desire'): Oscan ''herest'' ('(s)he shall want, (s)he shall desire', English cognate 'yearn') as opposed to Latin ''vult'' (id.). Latin ''locus'' (place) was absent and represented by the [[hapax]] ''slaagid'' (place), which Italian linguist Alberto Manco has linked to a surviving local toponym.<ref name=\"Manco\">Alberto Manco, \"Sull\u2019osco *slagi-\", [http://www.aionlinguistica.com/ AI\u03a9N Linguistica] 28, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn [[phonology]] too, Oscan exhibited a number of clear differences from Latin: thus, Oscan 'p' in place of Latin 'qu' (Osc. ''pis'', Lat. ''quis'') (compare the similar [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic/Q-Celtic]] cleavage in the [[Celtic languages]]); 'b' in place of Latin 'v'; medial 'f' in contrast to Latin 'b' or 'd' (Osc.

For example, Latin ''volo'', ''velle'', ''volui'', and other such forms from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *wel ('to will') were represented by words derived from *gher ('to desire'): Oscan ''herest'' ('(s)he shall want, (s)he shall desire', English cognate 'yearn') as opposed to Latin ''vult'' (id.). Latin ''locus'' (place) was absent and represented by the [[hapax]] ''slaagid'' (place), which Italian linguist Alberto Manco has linked to a surviving local toponym.<ref name=\"Manco\">Alberto Manco, \"Sull\u2019osco *slagi-\", [http://www.aionlinguistica.com/ AI\u03a9N Linguistica] 28, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn [[phonology]] too, Oscan exhibited a number of clear differences from Latin: thus, Oscan 'p' in place of Latin 'qu' (Osc. ''pis'', Lat. ''quis'') (compare the similar [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic/Q-Celtic]] cleavage in the [[Celtic languages]]); 'b' in place of Latin 'v'; medial 'f' in contrast to Latin 'b' or 'd' (Osc. ''mefiai'', Lat. ''mediae'').<ref name=\"Buck 2007 23\" />\n\nOscan is considered to be the most conservative of all the known Italic languages, and among attested Indo-European languages it is rivaled only by [[Greek language|Greek]] in the retention of the inherited vowel system with the [[diphthongs]] intact.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Writing system==\n[[File:Linguistic_Landscape_of_Central_Italy.png|thumb|400px|The linguistic landscape of Central Italy at the beginning of Roman expansion]]\n\n===Alphabet===\n\nOscan was originally written in a specific \"Oscan alphabet\", one of the [[Old Italic scripts]] derived from (or cognate with) the [[Etruscan alphabet]].

He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.

Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield. In 1930 there were only two houses that were occupied.
