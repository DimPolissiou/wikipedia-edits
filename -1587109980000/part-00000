The population was 12,232 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the principal city of the Bogalusa Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Washington Parish and is also part of the larger [[New Orleans\u2013Metairie\u2013Hammond combined statistical area]].\n\nThe name of the city derives from the [[Choctaw language]] term ''bogue lusa'', which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"dark water<ref>{{cite book|last=Leeper|first=Clare D'Artois|title=Louisiana Place Names: Popular, Unusual, and Forgotten Stories of Towns, Cities, Plantations, Bayous, and Even Some Cemeteries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHeeUa0xNxcC&pg=PA42|date=19 October 2012|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-4740-5|page=42}}</ref> or \"smoky water\".<ref>Rony, Vera. \"Bogalusa: The Economics of Tragedy\". ''Dissent'' May\u2013June 1966. p 235.</ref> Located in an area of pine forests, in the early 20th century, this industrial city was developed as a company town, to provide worker housing and services in association with a [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] [[sawmill]]. In the late 1930s, this operation was replaced with [[paper mill]]s and chemical operations.\n\n== History ==\n===Founding===\nIn the early 1900s, the brothers Frank Henry Goodyear and [[Charles W. Goodyear]] of [[Buffalo, New York]] who had been successful lumbermen in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]], bought hundreds of thousands of [[acre]]s of virgin [[longleaf pine]] forests in southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi for the timber and further their strategy to build railroad spurs to bring the wood to market. In 1902, they chartered the [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] (1908\u201338) and built its first [[sawmill]] in what became Bogalusa, a company town which they built to support this rural operation. The sawmill was the largest in the world at the time.<ref name=LSU>[http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/g3225.html LSU Libraries\u2014Great Southern Lumber Company Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715192354/http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/g3225.html |date=2014-07-15 }} Retrieved 2013-12-28</ref> The Goodyear interests built the city of Bogalusa to house workers and supervisors, and associated infrastructure. They also built the [[Great Northern New Orleans Railroad]] to New Orleans to transport their lumber and products to market.\n\n[[File:Bogalusa 1911 Map.jpg|170px|left|thumbnail|1911 Bogalusa, the planned city by the Great Southern Lumber Company]]\nThe city, designed by architect [[Rathbone DeBuys]] of New Orleans and built from the ground up in less than a year, had several hotels, schools, a hospital, a [[YMCA]] and [[YWCA]], churches of all faiths, and houses for the workers and supervisors. The town was laid out with the \"Mill Town\" and \"Commercial Town\" in four quadrants with racially segregated neighborhoods defined by the railroad running north-south and Bogue Lusa Creek running east-west. It was called the \"Magic City\" due to its rapid construction. The manager of Great Southern Lumber Company was [[William H. Sullivan (town boss)|William H. Sullivan]]. As sawmill manager, he acted as town boss when the city was built. After Bogalusa was incorporated as a city on July 4, 1914, Sullivan was elected as mayor by white voters (blacks had been disenfranchised), and repeatedly re-elected, serving until his death on June 26, 1929.\n\nThe Great Southern Lumber Company's sprawling sawmill produced up to a million [[board feet]] (2400&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of lumber each day. With the virgin pine forest cleared, the sawmill closed in 1938 during the [[Great Depression]]. It was replaced as the city's main industry by the Bogalusa Paper Company (a subsidiary of Great Southern), that merged with Gaylord Container Corporation in 1937 and a chemical plant run by Gaylord.  [[Crown-Zellerbach]] acquired Gaylord's operations in 1955. An attempt to keep the sawmill open with California redwood proved too costly, and the mill was closed. A paper mill and chemical operations continued. At its peak in 1960, the city had more than 21,000 residents. In 1985 Crown-Zellerbach was split up but the timber industry continued.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crt.state.la.us/Assets/OCD/hp/nationalregister/historic_contexts/The_Louisiana_Lumber_Boom_c1880-1925.pdf|last=Fricker|first=Donna |accessdate=2019-05-09|title=The Louisiana Lumber Boom, c.1880-1925|publisher=Fricker Historic Preservation Services LLC|date=2007-10-25|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\n===Racial conflicts===\nIn 1919 workers went on strike, triggering the largest labor strife at the town's [[Great Southern Lumber Company]], the largest sawmill in the world. Company owners supported a white militia group and brought in Black strikebreakers that increased racial tension. Events culminated in the [[Bogalusa sawmill killings]] which saw four union men killed. On August 31, 1919, Black veteran [[African American veterans lynched after WWI|Lucius McCarty]] was accused of assaulting a white woman and a mob of some 1,500 people seized McCarty and shot him more than 1,000 times. The mob then dragged his corpse behind a car through the black neighborhoods before burning his body in a bonfire. {{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}} {{sfn|Whitaker|2009|p=54}}\n\n===Civil rights era===\nBoth black and white industrial workers had come to the company town for work since the early 20th century. After World War II and service for their country, African-American veterans struggled in Louisiana and the South against the oppression of [[Jim Crow laws]], state segregation, and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] and exclusion from the political system, all continuing since the turn of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, black workers pressed [[Crown-Zellerbach]] to open all positions to them, promote them to supervisory positions, and otherwise give them equal opportunities at work. White workers resisted these changes. Similarly, blacks pressured the city of Bogalusa to integrate public facilities, especially after passage of the Civil Rights Law of 1964.\n\nIn Bogalusa, black workers also struggled against the industrial class system. As their activism increased in the [[civil rights era]], whites resisted. Local [[Ku Klux Klan]] members dominated the region, attacking and intimidating civil rights activists in the 1960s. In 1964, as civil rights activists continued to push for their constitutional rights after congressional passage that year of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] that year, whites increased their resistance.\n\nDetermined to fight for their rights, [[Bob Hicks (activist)|Bob Hicks]], [[Charles Sims (activist)|Charles Sims]],  [[A.Z. Young]], and others had taken leadership of the (all-black) [[Bogalusa Civic and Voters\u2019 League]]. On February 21, 1965, with the help of three activists from the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]] based in [[Jonesboro, Louisiana]], they founded the first affiliated chapter of that African-American self-defense organization. Other leaders of the Deacons were Bert Wyre, Aurilus \u201cReeves\u201d Perkins, Sam Bonds, Fletcher Anderson, and others.<ref name=\"foundation\"/> They mobilized many war veterans within the black community to provide armed security to civil rights activists and their families.<ref name=\"hague\">{{cite web|url=http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1997-8/Hague.html |last=Hague|first=Seth Hague|title= 'Niggers Ain't Gonna Run This Town': Militancy, Conflict and the Sustenance of the Hegemony in Bogalusa, Louisiana, (Outstanding History Paper)|date=1997-1998|publisher= Loyola University-New Orleans|access-date= 11 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gimletmedia.com/episode/the-deacons/|title=\u00bb The Deacons|website=Gimlet Media|access-date=2016-11-24}}</ref> Expecting a violent summer, the State Police established an office in Bogalusa in February 1965.<ref name=\"hague\"/>\n\nAs explained by Seth Hague, \n<blockquote>...the community came to embrace the militant rhetoric of the Jonesboro Deacons. Many violent conflicts ensued under this ideology and culminated in a climactic summer in 1965. Consequently, the black workers\u2019 militancy threatened not only the power of the middle class blacks, but also the political and economic hegemony of the white power structure in Bogalusa. Except for a few noteworthy courtroom \"victories\" versus Crown-Zellerbach, threatening the power structure was virtually the struggle's only effect as the white power structure subsumed the militancy and rhetoric of the revolutionary Bogalusans.\"<ref name=\"hague\"/></blockquote>\n\nTwo unsolved murders of African Americans took place in Bogalusa during the civil rights era: killed in 1965 was [[Oneal Moore]], the first black deputy sheriff hired for the Washington Parish Sheriff's Office, and in 1966 [[Clarence Triggs]] was killed.\n\n===1970 to present===\nWith changes in the lumber industry, through the late 20th century, after 1960, a steady decline in industrial operations, jobs, and associated population of the town occurred. By 2015, the population was estimated at slightly less than 12,000,<ref name=\"USCensusEst2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015|accessdate=July 2, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160602200744/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|archive-date=2016-06-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> more than 40% below the high in 1960.

Residents say \"the sky turned orange\" as a result. Emergency rooms filled with about 4,000 people who complained of burning eyes, skin, and lungs. Dozens of [[lawsuit]]s were filed against Gaylord Chemical and were finally settled in May 2005, with compensation checks issued to around 20,000 people affected by the accident.\n\nOn August 29, 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the city with winds of about {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}, downing numerous trees and power lines.

A paper mill was added in 1918.<ref>[http://www.nemerofflaw.com/asbestos/asbestos-job-sites/louisiana/bogalusa-paper-mill/ \"Bogalusa Paper Mill\"]</ref> By 1938, the Goodyear family's mill had clear cut all the virgin longleaf yellow pine within hundreds of miles of Bogalusa and after an unprofitable effort to import redwood from California, their sawmill operations at the Great Southern Lumber Company also ended. Bogalusa's industry then shifted to paper milling as Goodyear's sawmill passed onto [[Gaylord Container Corporation]] which was then bought by [[Crown Zellerbach]] in 1955. By the mid 1960s the mill was producing some 1300 tons of paper daily with four machines.<ref name=\"WLOS\">[https://www.nola.com/news/article_6ca32bac-98f8-11e9-9db5-57e742387089.html \"Why, like other small...\"]</ref> Georgia Pacific acquired the mill in 1986.

The population was 12,232 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the principal city of the Bogalusa Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Washington Parish and is also part of the larger [[New Orleans\u2013Metairie\u2013Hammond combined statistical area]].\n\nThe name of the city derives from the [[Choctaw language]] term ''bogue lusa'', which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"dark water<ref>{{cite book|last=Leeper|first=Clare D'Artois|title=Louisiana Place Names: Popular, Unusual, and Forgotten Stories of Towns, Cities, Plantations, Bayous, and Even Some Cemeteries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHeeUa0xNxcC&pg=PA42|date=19 October 2012|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-4740-5|page=42}}</ref> or \"smoky water\".<ref>Rony, Vera. \"Bogalusa: The Economics of Tragedy\". ''Dissent'' May\u2013June 1966. p 235.</ref> Located in an area of pine forests, in the early 20th century, this industrial city was developed as a company town, to provide worker housing and services in association with a [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] [[sawmill]]. In the late 1930s, this operation was replaced with [[paper mill]]s and chemical operations.\n\n== History ==\n===Founding===\nIn the early 1900s, the brothers Frank Henry Goodyear and [[Charles W. Goodyear]] of [[Buffalo, New York]] who had been successful lumbermen in [[New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]], bought hundreds of thousands of [[acre]]s of virgin [[longleaf pine]] forests in southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi for the timber and further their strategy to build railroad spurs to bring the wood to market. In 1902, they chartered the [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] (1908\u201338) and built its first [[sawmill]] in what became Bogalusa, a company town which they built to support this rural operation. The sawmill was the largest in the world at the time.<ref name=LSU>[http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/g3225.html LSU Libraries\u2014Great Southern Lumber Company Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715192354/http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/g3225.html |date=2014-07-15 }} Retrieved 2013-12-28</ref> The Goodyear interests built the city of Bogalusa to house workers and supervisors, and associated infrastructure. They also built the [[Great Northern New Orleans Railroad]] to New Orleans to transport their lumber and products to market.\n\n[[File:Bogalusa 1911 Map.jpg|170px|left|thumbnail|1911 Bogalusa, the planned city by the Great Southern Lumber Company]]\nThe city, designed by architect [[Rathbone DeBuys]] of New Orleans and built from the ground up in less than a year, had several hotels, schools, a hospital, a [[YMCA]] and [[YWCA]], churches of all faiths, and houses for the workers and supervisors. The town was laid out with the \"Mill Town\" and \"Commercial Town\" in four quadrants with racially segregated neighborhoods defined by the railroad running north-south and Bogue Lusa Creek running east-west. It was called the \"Magic City\" due to its rapid construction. The manager of Great Southern Lumber Company was [[William H. Sullivan (town boss)|William H. Sullivan]]. As sawmill manager, he acted as town boss when the city was built. After Bogalusa was incorporated as a city on July 4, 1914, Sullivan was elected as mayor by white voters (blacks had been disenfranchised), and repeatedly re-elected, serving until his death on June 26, 1929.\n\nThe Great Southern Lumber Company's sprawling sawmill produced up to a million [[board feet]] (2400&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of lumber each day. With the virgin pine forest cleared, the sawmill closed in 1938 during the [[Great Depression]]. It was replaced as the city's main industry by the Bogalusa Paper Company (a subsidiary of Great Southern), that merged with Gaylord Container Corporation in 1937 and a chemical plant run by Gaylord.  [[Crown-Zellerbach]] acquired Gaylord's operations in 1955. An attempt to keep the sawmill open with California redwood proved too costly, and the mill was closed. A paper mill and chemical operations continued. At its peak in 1960, the city had more than 21,000 residents. In 1985 Crown-Zellerbach was split up but the timber industry continued.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crt.state.la.us/Assets/OCD/hp/nationalregister/historic_contexts/The_Louisiana_Lumber_Boom_c1880-1925.pdf|last=Fricker|first=Donna |accessdate=2019-05-09|title=The Louisiana Lumber Boom, c.1880-1925|publisher=Fricker Historic Preservation Services LLC|date=2007-10-25|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\n===Racial conflicts===\nIn 1919 workers went on strike, triggering the largest labor strife at the town's [[Great Southern Lumber Company]], the largest sawmill in the world. Company owners supported a white militia group and brought in Black strikebreakers that increased racial tension. Events culminated in the [[Bogalusa sawmill killings]] which saw four union men killed. On August 31, 1919, Black veteran [[African American veterans lynched after WWI|Lucius McCarty]] was accused of assaulting a white woman and a mob of some 1,500 people seized McCarty and shot him more than 1,000 times. The mob then dragged his corpse behind a car through the black neighborhoods before burning his body in a bonfire. {{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}} {{sfn|Whitaker|2009|p=54}}\n\n===Civil rights era===\nBoth black and white industrial workers had come to the company town for work since the early 20th century. After World War II and service for their country, African-American veterans struggled in Louisiana and the South against the oppression of [[Jim Crow laws]], state segregation, and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] and exclusion from the political system, all continuing since the turn of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, black workers pressed [[Crown-Zellerbach]] to open all positions to them, promote them to supervisory positions, and otherwise give them equal opportunities at work. White workers resisted these changes. Similarly, blacks pressured the city of Bogalusa to integrate public facilities, especially after passage of the Civil Rights Law of 1964.\n\nIn Bogalusa, black workers also struggled against the industrial class system. As their activism increased in the [[civil rights era]], whites resisted. Local [[Ku Klux Klan]] members dominated the region, attacking and intimidating civil rights activists in the 1960s. In 1964, as civil rights activists continued to push for their constitutional rights after congressional passage that year of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] that year, whites increased their resistance.\n\nDetermined to fight for their rights, [[Bob Hicks (activist)|Bob Hicks]], [[Charles Sims (activist)|Charles Sims]],  [[A.Z. Young]], and others had taken leadership of the (all-black) [[Bogalusa Civic and Voters\u2019 League]]. On February 21, 1965, with the help of three activists from the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]] based in [[Jonesboro, Louisiana]], they founded the first affiliated chapter of that African-American self-defense organization. Other leaders of the Deacons were Bert Wyre, Aurilus \u201cReeves\u201d Perkins, Sam Bonds, Fletcher Anderson, and others.<ref name=\"foundation\"/> They mobilized many war veterans within the black community to provide armed security to civil rights activists and their families.<ref name=\"hague\">{{cite web|url=http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1997-8/Hague.html |last=Hague|first=Seth Hague|title= 'Niggers Ain't Gonna Run This Town': Militancy, Conflict and the Sustenance of the Hegemony in Bogalusa, Louisiana, (Outstanding History Paper)|date=1997-1998|publisher= Loyola University-New Orleans|access-date= 11 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gimletmedia.com/episode/the-deacons/|title=\u00bb The Deacons|website=Gimlet Media|access-date=2016-11-24}}</ref> Expecting a violent summer, the State Police established an office in Bogalusa in February 1965.<ref name=\"hague\"/>\n\nAs explained by Seth Hague, \n<blockquote>...the community came to embrace the militant rhetoric of the Jonesboro Deacons.

Consequently, the black workers\u2019 militancy threatened not only the power of the middle class blacks, but also the political and economic hegemony of the white power structure in Bogalusa. Except for a few noteworthy courtroom \"victories\" versus Crown-Zellerbach, threatening the power structure was virtually the struggle's only effect as the white power structure subsumed the militancy and rhetoric of the revolutionary Bogalusans.\"<ref name=\"hague\"/></blockquote>\n\nTwo unsolved murders of African Americans took place in Bogalusa during the civil rights era: killed in 1965 was [[Oneal Moore]], the first black deputy sheriff hired for the Washington Parish Sheriff's Office, and in 1966 [[Clarence Triggs]] was killed.\n\n===1970 to present===\nWith changes in the lumber industry, through the late 20th century, after 1960, a steady decline in industrial operations, jobs, and associated population of the town occurred. By 2015, the population was estimated at slightly less than 12,000,<ref name=\"USCensusEst2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015|accessdate=July 2, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160602200744/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|archive-date=2016-06-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> more than 40% below the high in 1960.

Residents say \"the sky turned orange\" as a result. Emergency rooms filled with about 4,000 people who complained of burning eyes, skin, and lungs.

A [[The Worst Witch (1998 TV series)|TV series based on the books]] aired from 1998 to 2001, and has inspired two spin-offs, ''[[Weirdsister College]]'', aired in 2001, and ''[[The New Worst Witch]]'', aired in 2005.

Although well-intentioned, Mildred's clumsy personality leads the girl to disastrous situations, and she is thus considered the worst student in the school. The benevolent headmistress, Miss Cackle, is generally  understanding, whereas Mildred's form teacher [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Miss Hardbroom|Miss Hardbroom]] thinks she just isn't trying hard enough. Mildred's friends include [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Maud Spellbody|Maud Spellbody]], a rotund, sensible girl who is always trying to avoid confusion, and [[Enid Nightshade]], a practical joker who is more likely than Mildred to get them all into trouble. The three girls have a strong rivalry with [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Ethel Hallow|Ethel Hallow]], a high-born, snobbish and vindictive classmate.\n\nEach book covers one term at the school. There are two terms each year: the Winter term, from September to January, and the Summer term, from March to July. In ''First Prize for the Worst Witch'', the most recent book, Mildred is in the Summer term of her fourth year.\n \nThe author Jill Murphy began writing ''The Worst Witch'' at the age of 15, while still at school, and based many points of the stories on her own school experiences at [[Ursuline High School, Wimbledon|Ursuline Convent]] in [[Wimbledon, England|Wimbledon]], England, with Singing becoming Chanting, Chemistry becoming Potions and so on.<ref>{{cite news| last = Deeley | first =L.| title =Back on top after a bad spell | work= The Times| date =27 October 2007 | url = http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article2745146.ece | accessdate =17 April 2008 }}</ref> Recalling how she got the idea for the story, she said: \"My two friends and I used to come home in our dark uniforms, looking very scruffy at the end of the day \u2013 my dark plaits sprouting tufts, with lost hair ribbons. My Mum used to say 'Look at you all. You look like the three witches!' and it gave me the idea for a witch's school \u2013 so that it was exactly like my school, but with a subtle touch of magic.

''The Worst Witch'' was finally published in 1974, when Murphy was 24.\n\n==Books==\n\n===''The Worst Witch''===\n''The Worst Witch'' was first published in 1974 by Allison & Busby, who took the book on after it had been turned down by three other publishers.<ref>Joanna Carey, [http://booksforkeeps.co.uk/issue/136/childrens-books/articles/authorgraph/authorgraph-no136-jill-murphy \"Authorgraph No.136: Jill Murphy\" (interview)], Books For Keeps.</ref><ref name=\"TelegraphInterview2014\"/>\n\n;Plot\nThe novel begins with Mildred Hubble and the upcoming traditional assembly where all of the first-years are given their own black cats that they will teach to ride on their [[broomsticks]] with them. Unlike the other girls, who receive black kittens, Mildred receives a tabby cat, which she simply calls Tabby. The kitten is unable to sit on a broomstick, so Mildred carries Tabby in her bag. Miss Hardbroom disapproves and Mildred has to stop. Afterwards, another witch called Ethel Hallow teases Mildred about it, and dares her to turn her into a frog. Mildred loses her temper and turns Ethel into a pig instead.\n\nIn the next chapter, Mildred and Maud inadvertently make an invisibility potion instead of a laughing potion in their class test.\n\nIn the following chapter, the girls are practising for a broomstick display for [[Halloween]]. Ethel lends Mildred her spare broom, on which she has secretly put a spell. During the Halloween festival, Mildred's broom starts bucking, causing all the girls to fall from their broomsticks. The Chief Magician denounces the academy, and Mildred is summoned to a meeting with Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom the next morning. Mildred, fearing expulsion, decides to run away with Tabby.\n\nWhen walking through the forests near the academy, Mildred hears voices through the trees and comes across a group of witches, headed by one who looks like Miss Cackle. After hearing their plot to turn every teacher and student witch in the academy into frogs, Mildred turns the group into snails, packs them into cardboard boxes and takes them back to the academy. At first, Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom refuse to believe her, but when Mildred describes the leader, Miss Cackle realises she sounds like her identical twin sister, [[List of minor The Worst Witch characters#Agatha Cackle|Agatha]]. They turn Agatha and the rest of the group back into humans, Mildred's interview is cancelled, and she is praised as a hero to the rest of the academy.\n\n===''The Worst Witch Strikes Again''===\n''The Worst Witch Strikes Again'' was first published in 1980 by Allison & Busby and features a new character, Enid Nightshade.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her first year. Miss Cackle has trusted Mildred to look after new girl Enid Nightshade and help her settle in. Mildred starts showing Enid around the academy, only to discover that Enid has smuggled a [[monkey]] into school with her. During the assembly that follows, Miss Cackle announces her birthday celebration.\n\nDuring a chanting lesson with [[Miss Bat (The Worst Witch)|Miss Bat]] after assembly, Enid deliberately sings awkwardly and out of tune, causing Mildred to burst into hysterical laughter. Mildred is sent to Miss Cackle's office. When going up to her room, Mildred checks on Enid's monkey, causing it to escape. Mildred chases it down the stairs and bumps into Miss Hardbroom, who sends her to the library to study.\n\nAfter spotting the monkey on top of one of the castle [[towers]] Mildred jumps onto her broomstick. Miss Hardbroom turns the monkey into its original form, a normal regulation [[black cat]]. Enid secretly reveals to Mildred that she turned the cat into a monkey for fun.\n\nOn Sports Day, Mildred and Enid become partners. Enid places a spell on Mildred's pole, so in the pole-vaulting contest, Mildred springs high into the air and lands into Miss Hardbroom's study via the window. Moments later, Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom, and Miss Drill arrive and Miss Cackle angrily says that if there is any more bother from Mildred that term, she will be expelled.\n\nDetermined to avoid expulsion for the rest of the term, Mildred refuses every daring suggestion Enid makes. Enid decides to skip Miss Cackle's boring birthday celebration and hides in a store cupboard, pulling Mildred in with her. Ethel Hallow locks the door behind them.\n\nInside the cupboard, the two girls find an old broomstick that they use to fly out of a slit-window leading into the assembly hall. As luck has it, Maud is on stage, having been chosen to recite the first years' contribution to the recital. Maud introduces Mildred and Enid as a surprise broomstick display item. The display is a disaster, but Miss Cackle decides it is the thought that counts, and praises them highly.  The three girls become friends.\n\n===''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch''===\n''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch'' ({{ISBN|978-0-7226-5763-8}}) was published in 1982. It features Ethel Hallow's little sister, Sybil Hallow, and her friend Clarice Crow.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for her second year, determined to lose her embarrassing reputation as \"the worst witch in the school\". After Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade arrive, the three bump into two first-years (one of whom reminds Mildred very strongly of someone, the other with [[ginger]] frizzy hair in [[bunches]]). The one who seems familiar bursts into tears and clings onto Mildred when she hears that many of the teachers (including Miss Hardbroom) are quite strict. Mildred also accidentally slips a made-up story about Miss Hardbroom turning a student into a frog when she was just two seconds late for a lesson. To the girl's horror, they also learn that they have Miss Hardbroom for another year.\n\nThe next morning, a fire bell rings. Mildred scrambles into her clothes but notices outside her window Miss Hardbroom standing in the playground surrounded by hazy purple smoke. Thinking she is in a state of shock, Mildred tries to douse her in freezing cold water but the bucket slips off her broomstick and lands with a clang on Miss Hardbroom's head. After witnessing the incident, Ethel Hallow confronts Mildred at lunchtime, saying that the girl she told the frog story to was her younger sister, Sybil. After prodding at Mildred, Mildred loses her temper and insults Ethel's family (\"All you Hallows are weeds, weeds, weeds!\").\n\nAfter an unfortunate flying lesson, where Tabby makes another terrifying attempt to avoid sitting on the end of the broomstick, Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room to calm down. When sitting in her bed, however, Mildred accidentally falls asleep and does not hear Ethel creeping into her room.\nMildred is awoken by her bedroom door shutting, only to find that everything looks giant-sized, even Tabby. Peeking in the mirror, she finds that somebody has turned her into a frog. When jumping onto her bed, the frog-Mildred notices a tatty handful of weeds on her pillow, no doubt left by Ethel as a reference to her family's insult and why she turned her into the frog.\n\nPanicking, Mildred squeezes under the gap under her bedroom door and hops off to a potions lesson, where everyone has noticed her disappearance. Miss Hardbroom, however, discovers her and puts her in a jar. During the lesson, Mildred manages to escape from the jar and hops over to Ethel's desk, where she drinks an [[invisibility]] [[potion]]. Taking advantage of her invisibility, the frog-Mildred hops out of the academy and lands in the lily pond on the castle grounds.\n\nThere, Mildred meets another frog who also was a human once called Algernon Rowan-Webb. Algernon reveals that he was turned into a frog by a fellow magician after an argument. Algernon also reveals that the one thing he craves is some toast and crumpets with butter.\n\nPromising to return for him, Mildred hops back up to the academy. Maud and Enid instantly recognise her and take her to Ethel, who reluctantly turns her back into a human. Miss Hardbroom comes by and Ethel tells her that she caught Maud, Enid, and Mildred sneaking around the school. Miss Hardbroom is about to give Mildred a punishment when she notices that Mildred's feet are still invisible. Mildred tells her what really happened. Miss Hardbroom tells Mildred and Ethel to report to her office the next day.\n\nIn the morning, Miss Hardbroom bans both Mildred and Ethel from attending the [[Halloween]] ceremonies \u2013 the only chance Mildred would have had to come into contact with a magician who could turn Algernon back into a human. Mildred feels she has no choice but to kidnap somebody who is going to the Halloween festival. She tricks a third-year witch, Griselda Blackwood, into looking under her bed for an imaginary [[beetle]] where Mildred ties her up and takes her cat.\n\nLater, Ethel discovers Griselda being held captive in Mildred's room and the two fly off to the festival to turn Mildred in. Mildred gives herself away and barges up to Mr Hellibore and gives him the box that contains Algernon. Mr Hellibore, one of Algernon's fellow magicians at the time of his transformation, turns him back to his human form.\n\nAs a last request from Mildred, Mr Hellibore magics up a pot of tea along with some toast and crumpets with butter. The three head off to enjoy the supper.\n\n===''The Worst Witch All at Sea''===\n''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' ({{ISBN|978-0-670-83253-8}}) was published in 1993. It is the only book in the series not set in Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, but by the sea instead.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her second year. Instead of the usual black-and-grey-checked dresses, Miss Hardbroom persuaded Miss Cackle to change them to plain black. After crash-landing in a pile of snow and meeting up with her best friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Ethel Hallow appears and tells Mildred that Miss Cackle wants to see her.\n\nMiss Cackle suggests to Mildred that she replaces Tabby. Last term, a third-year witch, Fenella Feverfew, transferred to Miss Pentangle's Academy several mountaintops away and left behind her sleek [[black cat]], Ebony, since they have owls at Miss Pentangle's instead of black cats. Down in the kitchens, Mildred reluctantly hands over Tabby to Miss [[Tapioca]] (to catch mice), who gives her Ebony in return. Mildred is too upset to tell either Maud or Enid about it.\nMiss Hardbroom also announces that Mr Rowan-Webb, the frog-magician whom Mildred saved from the lilypond the previous term, has invited all the second-years to spend a week's holiday at his castle, Gloom Castle at Grim Cove.\n\nUnable to bear the thought of a week without Tabby, on the morning before the girls set out for Grim Cove, Mildred sneaks down into the school kitchens, lets Ebony out of his cage and instead hides Tabby inside.\n\nWhen they reach Gloom Castle, they find that it is falling apart: the armchairs have springs and stuffing sticking out and there are no proper beds (apart from one, which Ethel Hallow soon claims) other than old sleeping-bags, piles of pillows, and what appear to be hospital trolleys. Mildred gets an old sleeping-bag under the window, and manages to divert attention away from Tabby.\n\nMildred spots a boat attached to a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and decides to hide Tabby in the cabin of the boat. After a wonderful day on the beach, Mildred tries to sneak some [[kippers]] to Tabby, but Ethel catches Mildred, who pretends to be looking for some mythical treasure on Cat's Head Rock in front of the [[cove]] in the boat on the breakwater. As the two head back up the cliff stairs, they witness Miss Hardbroom flying down to the beach on her broomstick with her own black cat, Morgana. Morgana runs to the boat and feeds on the kippers that were meant for Tabby. Miss Hardbroom spots both Tabby in the cabin and Morgana eating the fish. Stepping on board to investigate, she slips on a kipper, bangs her head and falls unconscious.\n\nSneaking out to feed Tabby again, Mildred is confronted by Ethel, who snidely tells her that she untied the boat and let it drift out to sea. Mildred manages to get to the boat where she discovers not only Tabby, but the comatose Miss Hardbroom. Minutes after falling onto the boat, they bump into Cat's Head Rock. Mildred ties the boat onto an odd-looking chunk of rock and falls asleep.\n\nWhen she awakens, she finds that Maud and Enid have discovered them. Mildred tells them that there is something strange about the rock the boat is tied to. They pull at it and find that it is the mythical treasure chest. \nWhen they get back, Miss Hardbroom has revived and her injured head is bandaged. The contents of the treasure chest are used to repair Gloom Castle and Mildred is given Tabby back as a reward.\n\nMildred enjoys the rest of the holidays, feeling like \"the luckiest girl in the world instead of the worst witch in the school\".\n\n===''The Worst Witch Saves the Day''===\n''The Worst Witch Saves the Day'' ({{ISBN|978-0-14-138218-0}}) was published in 2005. It features Agatha Cackle disguised as new teacher Miss Granite.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble is returning to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches on the first day of her third year. After meeting up with her friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Mildred sees that Maud's hair is curly (she borrowed a hairstyling brush from her aunt) and they also learn that they will have a new form-teacher this year other than Miss Hardbroom.\n\nThey see in assembly that their new form-teacher will be [[List of minor The Worst Witch characters#Agatha Cackle|Miss Granite]] (who was hired by Miss Cackle after [[Miss Gribble (The Worst Witch)|Miss Gribble]] failed to show discipline and against Miss Hardbroom's advice). Miss Granite is described as being very strange-looking and having \"a huge cloud of orange curls\n\" and also wearing \"enormous purple-tinted glasses and a short cape with a collar turned up so high that you couldn't see much of her face at all\". Miss Granite speaks in a very high-pitched, squeaky voice that shocks everyone including Ethel Hallow.\n\nMildred unravels her [[pigtails]] to try out Maud's styling brush. Maud and Enid find her with her hair loose and a chunk of her hair tangled up with the brush in a huge mess. Ethel comes in and volunteers to help. However, the \"help\" amounts to taking a pair of scissors and chopping off both the styling brush and the messy hair.\n\nEthel later offers to help Mildred again in her hair predicament. She formulates a [[potion]] that she claims will restore Mildred's hair to its rightful length. Mildred applies the potion that night and just when she is dropping off to sleep, her hair starts growing longer and longer by the minute, engulfing the whole school. Miss Hardbroom comes to investigate, states that Mildred is having \"a bad hair day\", manages to stop the hair growing and cuts it to its rightful length and vapourises the swathes of hair that had engulfed the whole school.\n\nIn a flying lesson, Ethel steals Tabby (who has been suffering a [[nervous breakdown]] as a result of the hair incident) and hides him on the roof in front of Miss Granite's study's window.\n\nThat night, when trying to recover Tabby, Mildred is locked in a cupboard by someone who seems to be Miss Cackle but is actually Miss Cackle's identical twin Agatha Cackle, who sneaked into the school disguised as Miss Granite. Agatha is trying to turn all the teachers and pupils into snails. Mildred manages to turn herself into an [[ant]], sneaks out of the cupboard and goes to Maud's room, where she tries unsuccessfully to wake her. Fortunately, she is able to attract Maud and Enid's attention by using ink-blots to write two notes \u2013 \"HELP NOT ANT\" attracting their attention to her and \"FORGOT SPEL\" clarifying her dilemma \u2013 and Maud and Enid turn her back into a human. Mildred tells them what is going on and, just as Agatha is about to turn Miss Cackle into a snail, Mildred turns her into a snail herself. They also bump into Miss Hardbroom, who had been away.\n\nMiss Hardbroom suggests that Miss Cackle poses as Agatha and invites Agatha's rebellious [[coven]] in, whereupon Mildred and the others will turn them all into snails, which happens. As Mildred, Maud, and Enid go back to bed they say they want Miss Hardbroom as form-teacher. She suddenly appears in front of them and is friendly for a brief moment before strictly telling them to get back to bed with no candles on.\n\n===''The Worst Witch to the Rescue''===\n''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'' ({{ISBN|978-0-14-138301-9}}) was published in 2007 and features Ethel Hallow's only friend, Drusilla Paddock, in a largely increased role since her brief cameo in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea''.\n\n;Plot\nEthel Hallow is returning to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her third year. Miss Hardbroom had previously set them a holiday project, but Ethel is doing exactly what Miss Hardbroom told them not to do: trying to think up a project in five minutes flat on the way back to school. Ethel spots Mildred Hubble crash-landed in a tree and manages to help her steady herself. Mildred explains to Ethel her project: a spell that can make animals talk, though it can only work on animals that fit into 25 centimetres and only lasts for two weeks. When helping Mildred out of the tree, Ethel knocks Mildred's luggage out of the tree. While Mildred tries to get Tabby, who had scampered up the tree, Ethel scoops up Mildred's project folder and art bag and her 30 [[coloured pencils]]. \nOn the way there, Mildred finds her friends Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade. When Mildred tells them about Ethel being nice for a change, Enid suggests she may have taken a \"niceness course\" during the holidays. Maud and Enid become suspicious when they catch Mildred talking to someone or something in her cat basket.\n\nThe girls find that their new form mistress is called [[Miss Mould]], who has a \"soft and kindly\" voice and \"short mousy hair parted in the middle and pulled into a [[ponytail]] at her neck\". She is a great relief from the horrifically strict Miss Hardbroom and the extremely weird Miss Granite whom they had had the previous term. Mildred sits next to [[Drusilla Paddock]], who swaps places with Ethel after Miss Mould tells Ethel her coils are too short. Minutes later, a [[maraca]]-like noise echoes through the classroom. Mildred finds that her coils have turned into five [[rattlesnakes]]. Miss Mould gets the whole class outside while Ethel stays inside and evaporates the rattlesnakes. Just then, Miss Hardbroom appears and Miss Mould explains what happened. Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room and bans her from art lessons for the rest of the term. Mildred runs to her room where she figures out it must have been Ethel who turned her pot and coils into the snakes out of [[jealousy]].\nThe next day, in a lesson with Miss Hardbroom, the girls are presenting their projects to the class. Ethel goes first but her project is the same as Mildred's. Mildred shouts to Miss Hardbroom that Ethel had stolen her project. Miss Hardbroom opens Mildred's project folder but finds only lots of sheets of paper with smiley faces drawn on them in different colours. Miss Hardbroom \"transfers\" Mildred to her room.\n\nLater, Mildred finds that the creature inside her cat basket, a [[tortoise]] called Speedy whom she had used her spell on, can still speak. She renames him [[Einstein]] and Einstein tells her that he overheard her conversation with Ethel inside the tree. After Mildred runs to tell Maud and Enid the good news, Mildred accidentally leaves her bedroom door open and Einstein escapes. While plodding along the corridor he is discovered by Drusilla Paddock, who takes him to Ethel's room. While Ethel and Drusilla talk, it is revealed that Ethel did indeed take Mildred's project and had also \"tried out\" a snake spell on Mildred's pot and coils in art. Einstein overhears everything.\n\nWhen they are taking Einstein back to Mildred, Ethel eavesdrops on what Mildred is telling Maud and Enid. After discovering that Einstein can still speak and had overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred about the project, and that Einstein only has one more day before the spell wears off and he becomes mute forever, Ethel orders Drusilla to hide Einstein in the hollow [[pine tree]] outside the school gates. Einstein is put into a cardboard box that also contains a small green frog called Cyril, the animal whom Ethel had used in her demonstration. Cyril escapes and hops to Mildred's room. Cyril tells Mildred that Drusilla hid Einstein in the hollow pine tree outside the school gates and that he overheard several conversations about stealing projects and turning pots into snakes.\n\nAfter releasing Cyril into the woods, Mildred gets on her broomstick and, during a violent thunderstorm, finds and rescues Einstein. On landing she is confronted by Miss Hardbroom, who takes Mildred and Einstein inside and, after hearing part of the incidents from Mildred, sets an interview with Mildred and Ethel the next morning.\nThe next morning, Mildred goes to Miss Cackle's office where Einstein, resting in Miss Cackle's overflowing [[in-tray]], awakes and tells Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom that he overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred in the tree. He also says that he heard Ethel telling Drusilla that she had tried out a snake spell on Mildred's coils and had taken Mildred's project, copied it out in her own writing, and then thrown it in the kitchen bins. Ethel sifts through the rubbish and eventually finds Mildred's tea-stained project. Miss Hardbroom makes Ethel apologise to Mildred in assembly in front of the whole year as an alternative to being expelled for [[cheating]] as well as for her actions that put herself and Mildred in great danger.\n\nDuring a broomstick-flying lesson, Mildred reveals to Maud and Enid that Miss Cackle had provided Miss Mould's classroom with a proper [[kiln]] and craft room and she also got to keep Einstein as a pet. As the clock strikes midday, Mildred sprints into her room and hears Einstein speak for the last time in his raspy little voice (\"I'm glad I belong to you\"), before munching on his carrot and going silent forever.\n\n===''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star''===\n''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star'' (Scholastic UK, {{ISBN|978-0-141351995}}; another(?), {{ISBN|978-0-141383996}}) was released by Scholastic UK on 3 October 2013.<ref>[http://shop.scholastic.co.uk/products/93355 \"''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star'' by Jill Murphy: For ages 7 to 9\"]. Scholastic Shop. Scholastic UK, 2013. Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref>\n\nReturning from the holidays in stormy weather Mildred, Maud and Enid arrive to be told by Miss Drill that there will be a talent-displaying competition between Miss Cackle's Academy, Moonridge and Pentangle's school to win a swimming pool as the award for the best talent.\n\nMildred, much to her disappointment, has been chosen to work lantern monitor along with Drusilla and Ethel. On that first night Maud spots a shooting star and Mildred makes a wish followed by Miss Hardbroom who does the same reluctantly. On the first lantern monitor shift Mildred is given a holdall containing safety objects in it. When she reaches the gates to finish the job Mildred spots a stray dog, who she names Star, she takes him to her bedroom as a secret pet, much to the disapproval of Tabby.\n\nDuring the weeks that follow Mildred, realising that Star is well behaved and calm on a broomstick, trains him to do various tricks with her. Maud and Enid, who realise Mildred isn't spending much time with them, soon discover about Star and are amazed by the tricks Mildred has taught him. Ethel, suspicious about Mildred hiding something in her holdall, reaches into it to discover Star was hidden in it and the both of them collapse\ninto the lanterns igniting the costumes Form Five have made for the talent competition.\n\nMiss Hardbroom, furious, sends Ethel and Mildred along with Star on a lead to Miss Cackle's office for what they had done then Maud and Enid explain about Star's tricks on the broom. Miss Cackle accepts the replacing talent and the next day the competition took place with the schools showing their talents. When it's Mildred's turn she amazes the judges with Star's tricks and wins the competition and the swimming pool. When the pupils go back to their school Miss Cackle allows Mildred to keep Star as her broomstick companion as a special privilege. Mildred later explains to Miss Hardbroom that she wished for Star on the shooting star at the beginning of term which doesn't annoy her as she wished on the star for them to win the competition. The story concludes with the teachers celebrating their victory and at the same time Miss Hardbroom's birthday.\n\n=== ''First Prize for the Worst Witch'' ===\n''First Prize for the Worst Witch'' ({{ISBN|9780141355092}}) was published in 2018.\n\nThe book deals with Mildred's graduation at the end of her fourth year. Its writing was delayed when Murphy underwent cancer treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/25/jill-murphy-worst-witch-career-classic-children-author |title=Jill Murphy: 'I just wanted to have a book on the shelf' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |first=Alison |last=Flood |date=25 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe stories mainly take place within the walls of Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, a girls-only boarding magic school that is described in the books as a stone castle on top of a mountain, surrounded by pine forest.\n\nThe school year is divided into two terms: the Winter term (September\u2013January) and the Summer term (March\u2013July), with a month's holiday between them. Students starts at Cackle's at the age of 12, and finish at the age of 17, for a total of five school years. The students arrive at the start of the term by flying broomsticks, except for the new first years, who walk through walker's gate as they can't fly yet. Halfway through the first term, the first years are each presented with a black kitten- Mildred receives a grey-and-black tabby cat as they apparently ran out of purely black cats- which they teach to ride the broomstick. The first book postulates that the cats weren't for any practical purpose except to keep tradition going, and in ''Wishing Star'', a group of elder witches note that there is no restriction on what animal a witch must have as her flight companion, with cats only being traditional as they are discreet and easy to care for, which leads to Mildred being permitted to fly with her dog, Star, after he shows greater broom aptitude than her cat Tabby. At the end of the first year, each pupil receives a copy of ''The Popular Book of Spells'', a three-inch thick volume bound in black leather. This was not really to be used, as they already had paperback editions for the classroom, but like the cats, it's another piece of tradition. At the end of the fifth and final year, students sit the exams for the W.H.C. (Witches' Higher Certificate), and most pupils were awarded with the certificate.\n\nThe first book says that the school winter uniform is composed of \"black gymslips, black stockings, black hob-nailed boots, grey shirts and black-and-grey ties.\" The first book also postulates that \"the only touches of colour [on the uniforms] were the sashes round their gymslips \u2013 a different colour for each house, although the houses are not named \u2013 and the school badge, which was a black cat sitting on a yellow moon.\" In the summer term, originally the girls wore grey-and-black checked dresses, but this was changed from ''Worst Witch All At Sea'' onwards to a simple black dress as Ms Hardbroom felt that the original design was too frivolous.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of The Worst Witch characters}}\n\n===Mildred Hubble===\nMildred \"Millie\" Hubble is the protagonist of the series. She is a good-hearted, but bungling young witch-in-training, who never seems to get anything right. She is friends with Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade and has a strong rivalry with Ethel Hallow. It is Miss Hardbroom, her potions teacher, who calls her \"The Worst Witch\".Miss Hardbroom also seem to hold a grudge against her.\n\nJill Murphy's illustrations shows that she is tall, with long brown [[braid|plaits]]. Some illustrations shows that she frequently fails to tie her bootlaces and the colour ones that her uniform sash is red. According to the author, Mildred's appearance is based on her own appearance as a teenager. She remembers: \"Mildred is based on myself when I had plaits so long that I could sit on them!\"<ref name=Q&A>{{cite web|title=World Book Day Q&A with Jill Murphy|url=http://www.gransnet.com/forums/webchats/a1204459-World-Book-Day-Q-A-with-Jill-Murphy|website=Gransnet|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Maud Spellbody===\nMaud Spellbody is Mildred's best friend. She is fiercely loyal to Mildred and assists her on most of her adventures, often against her better judgment. Maud is a decent and considerate person, but grows weary of Mildred's incessant clumsiness and often lectures her on how to improve herself. Ironically, Maud is not a perfect student, as she is also responsible for a laughing potion going wrong, as she along with Mildred had no idea how to make one. ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' reveals her last name to be Spellbody, rather than \"Moonshine\", which is what the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series dubbed her.\n\nThe author's illustrations shows that she is a short, plump girl with wide glasses who always wears her hair in bunches. The colour illustrations reveal that she is blonde and her uniform sash is yellow. According to the author, Maud is based on her best friend as a teenager, a girl called Elizabeth.<ref name=Q&A/>\n\n===Ethel Hallow===\nEthel Hallow is Mildred's acid-tongued rival. She does very well in class, comes from a prominent witch family, and gives the impression of being a model student. However, she is spoiled, snobbish and vindictive although able to [[turn on the charm]] and act sweet and innocent when the teachers are near, playing the role of a victim with Mildred as the bully. Up until ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'', she is Miss Hardbroom's favourite student; however, in the same book, she is exposed as a cheat and a liar, and thus has to watch her step lest she incur her teacher's wrath.\n\nThe book illustrations shows that she is a tall, skinny and sharp-faced young girl. Her hair is mousy brown and her uniform sash is purple.\n\nIn the first book of the series, it is revealed without explanation that Ethel and Mildred were enemies prior to the story. Ethel takes pleasure in taunting Mildred about her inability to train her cat into riding a broomstick, and Mildred responds by turning her into a pig. From then on Mildred and Ethel resent each other, and Ethel vows to get Mildred expelled. So far she has been unsuccessful. In the first five books she appears to have no friends, although her young sister, Sybil, makes an appearance in ''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch''. A friend of Ethel's, Drusilla, makes a brief appearance in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' and later plays a bigger part in ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'', where she hides Mildred's tortoise up a tree. Ethel is Mildred's arch-enemy.\n\n===Enid Nightshade===\nAnother of Mildred's closest friends. She makes her debut in ''The Worst Witch Strikes Again'' after she is transferred to Miss Cackle's Academy and Mildred is assigned to look after her, to the irritation of Miss Hardbroom. At first Mildred thinks Enid will simply be a nuisance and a pain, but she turns out to be a wild practical joker. Her attempts to make Mildred like her only result in Mildred getting into trouble, for example, turning her cat into a monkey and enchanting a vaulting pole which catapults Mildred into the air and into Miss Hardbroom's study.\n\nEnid is tall, well-built and rather muscular for a girl. She has large limbs and fair hair, usually in one long plait. In the TV series she is small and waiflike with dark hair. She takes an instant liking to Mildred and hopes to become her friend, implying that she is not a judgmental girl. Overall she is friendly and kind-hearted, but sometimes oversteps the mark in her attempt to befriend and help people, and being nice. Aside from Mildred herself, Enid is considered the second worst witch in the Academy, as she too is hopeless when it comes to broomstick riding and magic.\n\n===Miss Hardbroom===\nMiss Hardbroom is the fearsome deputy headmistress of Miss Cackle's Academy and the clear [[power behind the throne]]. She is Mildred's form mistress in first form and through various combinations of events continues to be her form mistress throughout the series. Tall, bony and sour-faced, she strikes fear into the pupils' hearts. \"HB\", as the girls refer to her, seems to have a particular resentment of Mildred. Miss Hardbroom frequently praises and rewards Ethel Hallow, and frequently rebukes Mildred in front of the other students. It is Miss Hardbroom who gives Mildred the title of \"the worst witch in the school\".\n\nIn the later books Miss Hardbroom's humanity comes through on occasion, in incidents such as her accident in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'', the restoring of Mildred's hair to its rightful length in ''The Worst Witch Saves the Day'', and her admitting of her error of judgment at the end of ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue''.\n\nMiss Hardbroom usually has her hair tied up in a tight bun which makes her face look really long.\nMiss Hardbroom is very strict on all of the girls except Ethel Hallow, the teachers' pet.\n\n===Miss Cackle===\nAmelia Cackle (Ada Cackle in the [[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|2017 TV series]]) is the kind-hearted headmistress of the Academy. Plump and pleasant, Miss Cackle is more lenient towards Mildred when she is in trouble, and rather than intimidate the girl as Miss Hardbroom does, Miss Cackle gives long, sorrowful lectures which causes Mildred to feel guilty for the trouble she is in. Her birthday is celebrated at her beloved Academy, and her students believe it to be the most boring event of the year. Despite her kind heart, Miss Cackle can be intimidating when she wants to, and has occasionally broken into fits of rage at Mildred, most notably both when Mildred humiliated the reputation of the Academy by ruining a broomstick display to honour the Wizards' Council (Ethel had cursed Mildred to ensure she would make a fool of herself), and after she incorrectly believed Mildred was cheating at the school sport's day, after Enid cast an improper spell upon Mildred to make sure she won the pole-vaulting competition. However, these moments of anger are few and short-lived.\n\nMiss Cackle has an evil twin sister named Agatha Cackle, who is bitterly jealous of her position of authority at the Academy. In the first of the series, Agatha and her [[coven]] of rebellious witches plotted to overthrow Miss Cackle and turn her, the staff, and students into frogs as they slept. Mildred caught them as they brewed their invisibility potion, by turning them into snails and taking them to the school to show Miss Cackle. Ashamed that her own sister would break the Witches' Code, she ordered Agatha to accept defeat and live the code like all decent witches. Agatha reluctantly co-operated. She tries to take over again at the end of series 1, by pretending to be Miss Cackle and dragging Mildred out of the classroom by her ear.\n\n===Drusilla Paddock===\nThe \"best friend\" of Ethel Hallow, with whom she is often paired up. Drusilla appears only briefly in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'', but her role in the TV series and in the later books increases greatly. Drusilla is a horrible, vindictive bully, but lacks the acid-tongued spite of Ethel, and seems to be in great awe of her. Their \"friendship\" seems to be more of an alliance or a form of servitude: Ethel and Drusilla are not true friends, they have stuck beside each other because nobody else can bear to be around them. Drusilla seems to have no will of her own. Drusilla does everything Ethel orders her to, and in one book (''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'') she steals Mildred's beloved pet [[tortoise]] and hides it in a tree. In the TV series, she and Ethel briefly end their friendship when Drusilla sides with Mildred and her friends. They make up at the end of the episode though.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Television film===\n{{main|The Worst Witch (film)}}\n\nIn 1986, the first book in the series was converted to a made-for-television film on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] starring [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Diana Rigg]], and [[Charlotte Rae]]. Though a British film, it also aired in the USA on [[HBO]]. The film followed the plot of the first book of the series, portraying the incidents of Mildred turning herself invisible and turning Ethel into a pig, Miss Cackle's evil twin sister Agatha plotting to take over the school, and the Grand Wizard viewing the Halloween Broomstick formation (sabotaged by Ethel's faulty broom she lent to Mildred). It was shot at [[St. Michael's College, Tenbury|St. Michael's College]] in [[Tenbury Wells]]. This holiday special later aired on the [[Disney Channel]] every year for [[Halloween]] until the late 1990s. Its opening song, \"Growing Up Isn't Easy\", was sung by [[Bonnie Langford]]; its music was composed by [[Charles Strouse]] and its lyrics were written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]. Their other musical number was \"Anything Can Happen on Halloween\", sung by [[Tim Curry]]. [[Denis King]] composed its incidental music score. He also wrote the song \"My Little School\".\n\n===Television series (1998\u20132001)===\n''[[The Worst Witch (1998 TV series)|The Worst Witch]]'', a TV series based on the books, starring [[Georgina Sherrington]] and [[Felicity Jones]] as Mildred Hubble and Ethel Hallow respectively, was broadcast from 1998 to 2001. It was shot in [[Montreal]], London and [[Cardiff]]. The series is mostly shot in studio in London, with some episodes filmed in Montreal, [[Quebec]], Canada. The exteriors of Cackle's Academy used [[Castell Coch]], a castle located near Cardiff. The courtyard was filmed at [[Loseley Park]], near [[Guildford]]. Inside the school (Great Hall, classrooms etc.) was filmed at [[Twickenham Studios]].\n\n====Spin-offs====\nWhen it was no longer realistic that Mildred would still be at school, the series relocated her to a magical university in [[Cambridge]] and was retitled ''[[Weirdsister College]]: The Further Adventures of the Worst Witch,'' and saw the return of Felicity Jones as a reinvented Ethel Hallow.\n\nIn 2004, a new series based on the 1998 series was made, entitled ''[[The New Worst Witch]]''. It centred on the adventures of Mildred's equally bungling cousin, Henrietta \"Hettie\" Hubble, played by [[Alice Connor]], also set at Cackle's Academy.\n\n===Television series (2017\u2013present)===\nA new version of ''[[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|The Worst Witch]]'' TV series began in 2017 airing on [[CBBC]], this one starring [[Bella Ramsey]] as Mildred Hubble, [[Claire Higgins]] as Miss Cackle, and [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hardbroom.\n\n===Stage Adaptation (2018\u20132019)===\nA musical stage production called ''Worst Witch Live'' was shown at the [[Royal & Derngate]] Theatre in Northampton from 27 November to 30 December 2018.

In April 2019 Kenny Wax Family Entertainment announced that ''Worst Witch Live'' would be showing at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in the West End from 24 July to 8 September 2019. This version is presented is a publicity play written by Mildred and acted out by the students and staff playing themselves, initially recreating Mildred's first year at school, although the second half takes on a metafictional angle as Agatha Cackle \"infiltrates\" the play and attempts to stage a coup of the magical government.\n\n''Worst Witch Live'' stars [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3930361/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Danielle Bird] as Mildred Hubble, [[imdbname:1118833|Polly Lister]] as Miss Cackle/Agatha, [https://www.mandy.com/actor/profile/rachel-heaton Rachel Heaton] as Miss Hardbroom and [https://www.actorum.com/actor/rosie-abraham/ Rosie Abraham] as Ethel Hallow.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature|Fantasy}}\n* [[Boarding schools in fiction]]\n* [[School story]]\n* [[Little Witch Academia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |25em |refs=\n<ref name=images>\n{{cite web |title=Jill Murphy: Biography |work=Images of Delight: Original artwork from children's book illustrators |url=http://www.imagesofdelight.com/gallery14.htm |accessdate=17 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929190352/http://www.imagesofdelight.com/client.asp?id=56 |archivedate=29 September 2007}} <!--update 2013-10-24--></ref>\n<ref name=\"new_series_2017_prod\">\n{{cite web|title=Netflix Sets Tween Series \u2018Worst Witch,\u2019 \u2018Horse Mystery Project\u2019 For 2017|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-tween-series-worst-witch-horse-mystery-project-1201849203|website=Variety|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{worldcat id|fast-962667|Mildred Hubble}}\n\n{{The Worst Witch}}\n\n<!--Mildred Hubbell?-->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worst Witch}}\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:British children's novels]]\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:Contemporary fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:The Worst Witch|*]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in written fiction]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n[[Category:Child characters in literature]] <!--Mildred Hubbell?-->\n[[Category:Characters in children's literature]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n[[Category:British novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:1974 children's books]]\n[[Category:Allison and Busby books]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the novel series}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox book series\n| name             = ''The Worst Witch''\n| image            = The Worst Witch Book Series Covers.jpg\n| image_caption    = The covers from the first seven books, shown in the publication order.\n| books            = The Worst Witch<br>The Worst Witch Strikes Again<br>A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch<br>The Worst Witch All at Sea<br>The Worst Witch Saves the Day<br>The Worst Witch to the Rescue<br>The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star<br>First Prize for The Worst Witch\n| author           = [[Jill Murphy]]\n| editors          =\n| title_orig       = \n| translator       = \n| illustrator      = Jill Murphy\n| cover_artist     = Jill Murphy\n| country          = United Kingdom\n| language         = English\n| genre            = [[Fantasy literature|Fantasy]], [[Children's literature|children's books]]\n| discipline       =\n| publisher        = [[Allison & Busby]] (original)<br>[[Puffin Books]] (current)\n| pub_date         = 1974\u20132018\n| english_pub_date = \n| media_type       = \n| number_of_books  = 8\n| list_books       = \n| preceded by      = \n| followed by      = \n}}\n'''''The Worst Witch''''' is a series of children's books written and illustrated by [[Jill Murphy]].

A [[The Worst Witch (1998 TV series)|TV series based on the books]] aired from 1998 to 2001, and has inspired two spin-offs, ''[[Weirdsister College]]'', aired in 2001, and ''[[The New Worst Witch]]'', aired in 2005. In January 2017, a [[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|new series]] premiered in some markets as a [[CBBC]], [[ZDF]], and [[Netflix]] co-production and as of July 2017 it was released internationally on Netflix as a [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|Netflix Original]].<ref name=\"new_series_2017_prod\" />\n\n==Series overview==\nThe books focus on [[Mildred Hubble]], a young witch who attends Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, a [[Magic (paranormal)|school of magic]]. Although well-intentioned, Mildred's clumsy personality leads the girl to disastrous situations, and she is thus considered the worst student in the school. The benevolent headmistress, Miss Cackle, is generally  understanding, whereas Mildred's form teacher [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Miss Hardbroom|Miss Hardbroom]] thinks she just isn't trying hard enough. Mildred's friends include [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Maud Spellbody|Maud Spellbody]], a rotund, sensible girl who is always trying to avoid confusion, and [[Enid Nightshade]], a practical joker who is more likely than Mildred to get them all into trouble. The three girls have a strong rivalry with [[List of The Worst Witch characters#Ethel Hallow|Ethel Hallow]], a high-born, snobbish and vindictive classmate.\n\nEach book covers one term at the school. There are two terms each year: the Winter term, from September to January, and the Summer term, from March to July. In ''First Prize for the Worst Witch'', the most recent book, Mildred is in the Summer term of her fourth year.\n \nThe author Jill Murphy began writing ''The Worst Witch'' at the age of 15, while still at school, and based many points of the stories on her own school experiences at [[Ursuline High School, Wimbledon|Ursuline Convent]] in [[Wimbledon, England|Wimbledon]], England, with Singing becoming Chanting, Chemistry becoming Potions and so on.<ref>{{cite news| last = Deeley | first =L.| title =Back on top after a bad spell | work= The Times| date =27 October 2007 | url = http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article2745146.ece | accessdate =17 April 2008 }}</ref> Recalling how she got the idea for the story, she said: \"My two friends and I used to come home in our dark uniforms, looking very scruffy at the end of the day \u2013 my dark plaits sprouting tufts, with lost hair ribbons. My Mum used to say 'Look at you all. You look like the three witches!' and it gave me the idea for a witch's school \u2013 so that it was exactly like my school, but with a subtle touch of magic. All the characters are based on my school friends (and enemies) and teachers.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphInterview2014\">Alice Vincent, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/11198259/An-oral-history-of-The-Worst-Witch.html \"An oral history of The Worst Witch....The Worst Witch was only published because of a party\"], ''The Telegraph'', 31 October 2014.</ref> Murphy concluded the first book at the age of 18, but failed to achieve a publishing deal, causing her to \"put it in a drawer\" and decide to \"concentrate on other things instead.\" After working as a nanny and in a children's home, Murphy had a phone call from a small publisher interested in the book. ''The Worst Witch'' was finally published in 1974, when Murphy was 24.\n\n==Books==\n\n===''The Worst Witch''===\n''The Worst Witch'' was first published in 1974 by Allison & Busby, who took the book on after it had been turned down by three other publishers.<ref>Joanna Carey, [http://booksforkeeps.co.uk/issue/136/childrens-books/articles/authorgraph/authorgraph-no136-jill-murphy \"Authorgraph No.136: Jill Murphy\" (interview)], Books For Keeps.</ref><ref name=\"TelegraphInterview2014\"/>\n\n;Plot\nThe novel begins with Mildred Hubble and the upcoming traditional assembly where all of the first-years are given their own black cats that they will teach to ride on their [[broomsticks]] with them. Unlike the other girls, who receive black kittens, Mildred receives a tabby cat, which she simply calls Tabby. The kitten is unable to sit on a broomstick, so Mildred carries Tabby in her bag. Miss Hardbroom disapproves and Mildred has to stop. Afterwards, another witch called Ethel Hallow teases Mildred about it, and dares her to turn her into a frog. Mildred loses her temper and turns Ethel into a pig instead.\n\nIn the next chapter, Mildred and Maud inadvertently make an invisibility potion instead of a laughing potion in their class test.\n\nIn the following chapter, the girls are practising for a broomstick display for [[Halloween]]. Ethel lends Mildred her spare broom, on which she has secretly put a spell. During the Halloween festival, Mildred's broom starts bucking, causing all the girls to fall from their broomsticks. The Chief Magician denounces the academy, and Mildred is summoned to a meeting with Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom the next morning. Mildred, fearing expulsion, decides to run away with Tabby.\n\nWhen walking through the forests near the academy, Mildred hears voices through the trees and comes across a group of witches, headed by one who looks like Miss Cackle. After hearing their plot to turn every teacher and student witch in the academy into frogs, Mildred turns the group into snails, packs them into cardboard boxes and takes them back to the academy. At first, Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom refuse to believe her, but when Mildred describes the leader, Miss Cackle realises she sounds like her identical twin sister, [[List of minor The Worst Witch characters#Agatha Cackle|Agatha]]. They turn Agatha and the rest of the group back into humans, Mildred's interview is cancelled, and she is praised as a hero to the rest of the academy.\n\n===''The Worst Witch Strikes Again''===\n''The Worst Witch Strikes Again'' was first published in 1980 by Allison & Busby and features a new character, Enid Nightshade.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her first year. Miss Cackle has trusted Mildred to look after new girl Enid Nightshade and help her settle in. Mildred starts showing Enid around the academy, only to discover that Enid has smuggled a [[monkey]] into school with her. During the assembly that follows, Miss Cackle announces her birthday celebration.\n\nDuring a chanting lesson with [[Miss Bat (The Worst Witch)|Miss Bat]] after assembly, Enid deliberately sings awkwardly and out of tune, causing Mildred to burst into hysterical laughter. Mildred is sent to Miss Cackle's office. When going up to her room, Mildred checks on Enid's monkey, causing it to escape. Mildred chases it down the stairs and bumps into Miss Hardbroom, who sends her to the library to study.\n\nAfter spotting the monkey on top of one of the castle [[towers]] Mildred jumps onto her broomstick. Miss Hardbroom turns the monkey into its original form, a normal regulation [[black cat]]. Enid secretly reveals to Mildred that she turned the cat into a monkey for fun.\n\nOn Sports Day, Mildred and Enid become partners. Enid places a spell on Mildred's pole, so in the pole-vaulting contest, Mildred springs high into the air and lands into Miss Hardbroom's study via the window. Moments later, Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom, and Miss Drill arrive and Miss Cackle angrily says that if there is any more bother from Mildred that term, she will be expelled.\n\nDetermined to avoid expulsion for the rest of the term, Mildred refuses every daring suggestion Enid makes. Enid decides to skip Miss Cackle's boring birthday celebration and hides in a store cupboard, pulling Mildred in with her. Ethel Hallow locks the door behind them.\n\nInside the cupboard, the two girls find an old broomstick that they use to fly out of a slit-window leading into the assembly hall. As luck has it, Maud is on stage, having been chosen to recite the first years' contribution to the recital. Maud introduces Mildred and Enid as a surprise broomstick display item. The display is a disaster, but Miss Cackle decides it is the thought that counts, and praises them highly.  The three girls become friends.\n\n===''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch''===\n''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch'' ({{ISBN|978-0-7226-5763-8}}) was published in 1982. It features Ethel Hallow's little sister, Sybil Hallow, and her friend Clarice Crow.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for her second year, determined to lose her embarrassing reputation as \"the worst witch in the school\". After Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade arrive, the three bump into two first-years (one of whom reminds Mildred very strongly of someone, the other with [[ginger]] frizzy hair in [[bunches]]). The one who seems familiar bursts into tears and clings onto Mildred when she hears that many of the teachers (including Miss Hardbroom) are quite strict. Mildred also accidentally slips a made-up story about Miss Hardbroom turning a student into a frog when she was just two seconds late for a lesson. To the girl's horror, they also learn that they have Miss Hardbroom for another year.\n\nThe next morning, a fire bell rings. Mildred scrambles into her clothes but notices outside her window Miss Hardbroom standing in the playground surrounded by hazy purple smoke. Thinking she is in a state of shock, Mildred tries to douse her in freezing cold water but the bucket slips off her broomstick and lands with a clang on Miss Hardbroom's head. After witnessing the incident, Ethel Hallow confronts Mildred at lunchtime, saying that the girl she told the frog story to was her younger sister, Sybil. After prodding at Mildred, Mildred loses her temper and insults Ethel's family (\"All you Hallows are weeds, weeds, weeds!\").\n\nAfter an unfortunate flying lesson, where Tabby makes another terrifying attempt to avoid sitting on the end of the broomstick, Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room to calm down. When sitting in her bed, however, Mildred accidentally falls asleep and does not hear Ethel creeping into her room.\nMildred is awoken by her bedroom door shutting, only to find that everything looks giant-sized, even Tabby. Peeking in the mirror, she finds that somebody has turned her into a frog. When jumping onto her bed, the frog-Mildred notices a tatty handful of weeds on her pillow, no doubt left by Ethel as a reference to her family's insult and why she turned her into the frog.\n\nPanicking, Mildred squeezes under the gap under her bedroom door and hops off to a potions lesson, where everyone has noticed her disappearance. Miss Hardbroom, however, discovers her and puts her in a jar. During the lesson, Mildred manages to escape from the jar and hops over to Ethel's desk, where she drinks an [[invisibility]] [[potion]]. Taking advantage of her invisibility, the frog-Mildred hops out of the academy and lands in the lily pond on the castle grounds.\n\nThere, Mildred meets another frog who also was a human once called Algernon Rowan-Webb. Algernon reveals that he was turned into a frog by a fellow magician after an argument. Algernon also reveals that the one thing he craves is some toast and crumpets with butter.\n\nPromising to return for him, Mildred hops back up to the academy. Maud and Enid instantly recognise her and take her to Ethel, who reluctantly turns her back into a human. Miss Hardbroom comes by and Ethel tells her that she caught Maud, Enid, and Mildred sneaking around the school. Miss Hardbroom is about to give Mildred a punishment when she notices that Mildred's feet are still invisible. Mildred tells her what really happened. Miss Hardbroom tells Mildred and Ethel to report to her office the next day.\n\nIn the morning, Miss Hardbroom bans both Mildred and Ethel from attending the [[Halloween]] ceremonies \u2013 the only chance Mildred would have had to come into contact with a magician who could turn Algernon back into a human. Mildred feels she has no choice but to kidnap somebody who is going to the Halloween festival. She tricks a third-year witch, Griselda Blackwood, into looking under her bed for an imaginary [[beetle]] where Mildred ties her up and takes her cat.\n\nLater, Ethel discovers Griselda being held captive in Mildred's room and the two fly off to the festival to turn Mildred in. Mildred gives herself away and barges up to Mr Hellibore and gives him the box that contains Algernon. Mr Hellibore, one of Algernon's fellow magicians at the time of his transformation, turns him back to his human form.\n\nAs a last request from Mildred, Mr Hellibore magics up a pot of tea along with some toast and crumpets with butter. The three head off to enjoy the supper.\n\n===''The Worst Witch All at Sea''===\n''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' ({{ISBN|978-0-670-83253-8}}) was published in 1993. It is the only book in the series not set in Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, but by the sea instead.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her second year. Instead of the usual black-and-grey-checked dresses, Miss Hardbroom persuaded Miss Cackle to change them to plain black. After crash-landing in a pile of snow and meeting up with her best friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Ethel Hallow appears and tells Mildred that Miss Cackle wants to see her.\n\nMiss Cackle suggests to Mildred that she replaces Tabby. Last term, a third-year witch, Fenella Feverfew, transferred to Miss Pentangle's Academy several mountaintops away and left behind her sleek [[black cat]], Ebony, since they have owls at Miss Pentangle's instead of black cats. Down in the kitchens, Mildred reluctantly hands over Tabby to Miss [[Tapioca]] (to catch mice), who gives her Ebony in return. Mildred is too upset to tell either Maud or Enid about it.\nMiss Hardbroom also announces that Mr Rowan-Webb, the frog-magician whom Mildred saved from the lilypond the previous term, has invited all the second-years to spend a week's holiday at his castle, Gloom Castle at Grim Cove.\n\nUnable to bear the thought of a week without Tabby, on the morning before the girls set out for Grim Cove, Mildred sneaks down into the school kitchens, lets Ebony out of his cage and instead hides Tabby inside.\n\nWhen they reach Gloom Castle, they find that it is falling apart: the armchairs have springs and stuffing sticking out and there are no proper beds (apart from one, which Ethel Hallow soon claims) other than old sleeping-bags, piles of pillows, and what appear to be hospital trolleys. Mildred gets an old sleeping-bag under the window, and manages to divert attention away from Tabby.\n\nMildred spots a boat attached to a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and decides to hide Tabby in the cabin of the boat. After a wonderful day on the beach, Mildred tries to sneak some [[kippers]] to Tabby, but Ethel catches Mildred, who pretends to be looking for some mythical treasure on Cat's Head Rock in front of the [[cove]] in the boat on the breakwater. As the two head back up the cliff stairs, they witness Miss Hardbroom flying down to the beach on her broomstick with her own black cat, Morgana. Morgana runs to the boat and feeds on the kippers that were meant for Tabby. Miss Hardbroom spots both Tabby in the cabin and Morgana eating the fish. Stepping on board to investigate, she slips on a kipper, bangs her head and falls unconscious.\n\nSneaking out to feed Tabby again, Mildred is confronted by Ethel, who snidely tells her that she untied the boat and let it drift out to sea. Mildred manages to get to the boat where she discovers not only Tabby, but the comatose Miss Hardbroom. Minutes after falling onto the boat, they bump into Cat's Head Rock. Mildred ties the boat onto an odd-looking chunk of rock and falls asleep.\n\nWhen she awakens, she finds that Maud and Enid have discovered them. Mildred tells them that there is something strange about the rock the boat is tied to. They pull at it and find that it is the mythical treasure chest. \nWhen they get back, Miss Hardbroom has revived and her injured head is bandaged. The contents of the treasure chest are used to repair Gloom Castle and Mildred is given Tabby back as a reward.\n\nMildred enjoys the rest of the holidays, feeling like \"the luckiest girl in the world instead of the worst witch in the school\".\n\n===''The Worst Witch Saves the Day''===\n''The Worst Witch Saves the Day'' ({{ISBN|978-0-14-138218-0}}) was published in 2005. It features Agatha Cackle disguised as new teacher Miss Granite.\n\n;Plot\nMildred Hubble is returning to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches on the first day of her third year. After meeting up with her friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Mildred sees that Maud's hair is curly (she borrowed a hairstyling brush from her aunt) and they also learn that they will have a new form-teacher this year other than Miss Hardbroom.\n\nThey see in assembly that their new form-teacher will be [[List of minor The Worst Witch characters#Agatha Cackle|Miss Granite]] (who was hired by Miss Cackle after [[Miss Gribble (The Worst Witch)|Miss Gribble]] failed to show discipline and against Miss Hardbroom's advice). Miss Granite is described as being very strange-looking and having \"a huge cloud of orange curls\n\" and also wearing \"enormous purple-tinted glasses and a short cape with a collar turned up so high that you couldn't see much of her face at all\". Miss Granite speaks in a very high-pitched, squeaky voice that shocks everyone including Ethel Hallow.\n\nMildred unravels her [[pigtails]] to try out Maud's styling brush. Maud and Enid find her with her hair loose and a chunk of her hair tangled up with the brush in a huge mess. Ethel comes in and volunteers to help. However, the \"help\" amounts to taking a pair of scissors and chopping off both the styling brush and the messy hair.\n\nEthel later offers to help Mildred again in her hair predicament. She formulates a [[potion]] that she claims will restore Mildred's hair to its rightful length. Mildred applies the potion that night and just when she is dropping off to sleep, her hair starts growing longer and longer by the minute, engulfing the whole school. Miss Hardbroom comes to investigate, states that Mildred is having \"a bad hair day\", manages to stop the hair growing and cuts it to its rightful length and vapourises the swathes of hair that had engulfed the whole school.\n\nIn a flying lesson, Ethel steals Tabby (who has been suffering a [[nervous breakdown]] as a result of the hair incident) and hides him on the roof in front of Miss Granite's study's window.\n\nThat night, when trying to recover Tabby, Mildred is locked in a cupboard by someone who seems to be Miss Cackle but is actually Miss Cackle's identical twin Agatha Cackle, who sneaked into the school disguised as Miss Granite. Agatha is trying to turn all the teachers and pupils into snails. Mildred manages to turn herself into an [[ant]], sneaks out of the cupboard and goes to Maud's room, where she tries unsuccessfully to wake her. Fortunately, she is able to attract Maud and Enid's attention by using ink-blots to write two notes \u2013 \"HELP NOT ANT\" attracting their attention to her and \"FORGOT SPEL\" clarifying her dilemma \u2013 and Maud and Enid turn her back into a human. Mildred tells them what is going on and, just as Agatha is about to turn Miss Cackle into a snail, Mildred turns her into a snail herself. They also bump into Miss Hardbroom, who had been away.\n\nMiss Hardbroom suggests that Miss Cackle poses as Agatha and invites Agatha's rebellious [[coven]] in, whereupon Mildred and the others will turn them all into snails, which happens. As Mildred, Maud, and Enid go back to bed they say they want Miss Hardbroom as form-teacher. She suddenly appears in front of them and is friendly for a brief moment before strictly telling them to get back to bed with no candles on.\n\n===''The Worst Witch to the Rescue''===\n''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'' ({{ISBN|978-0-14-138301-9}}) was published in 2007 and features Ethel Hallow's only friend, Drusilla Paddock, in a largely increased role since her brief cameo in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea''.\n\n;Plot\nEthel Hallow is returning to Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her third year. Miss Hardbroom had previously set them a holiday project, but Ethel is doing exactly what Miss Hardbroom told them not to do: trying to think up a project in five minutes flat on the way back to school. Ethel spots Mildred Hubble crash-landed in a tree and manages to help her steady herself. Mildred explains to Ethel her project: a spell that can make animals talk, though it can only work on animals that fit into 25 centimetres and only lasts for two weeks. When helping Mildred out of the tree, Ethel knocks Mildred's luggage out of the tree. While Mildred tries to get Tabby, who had scampered up the tree, Ethel scoops up Mildred's project folder and art bag and her 30 [[coloured pencils]]. \nOn the way there, Mildred finds her friends Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade. When Mildred tells them about Ethel being nice for a change, Enid suggests she may have taken a \"niceness course\" during the holidays. Maud and Enid become suspicious when they catch Mildred talking to someone or something in her cat basket.\n\nThe girls find that their new form mistress is called [[Miss Mould]], who has a \"soft and kindly\" voice and \"short mousy hair parted in the middle and pulled into a [[ponytail]] at her neck\". She is a great relief from the horrifically strict Miss Hardbroom and the extremely weird Miss Granite whom they had had the previous term. Mildred sits next to [[Drusilla Paddock]], who swaps places with Ethel after Miss Mould tells Ethel her coils are too short. Minutes later, a [[maraca]]-like noise echoes through the classroom. Mildred finds that her coils have turned into five [[rattlesnakes]]. Miss Mould gets the whole class outside while Ethel stays inside and evaporates the rattlesnakes. Just then, Miss Hardbroom appears and Miss Mould explains what happened. Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room and bans her from art lessons for the rest of the term. Mildred runs to her room where she figures out it must have been Ethel who turned her pot and coils into the snakes out of [[jealousy]].\nThe next day, in a lesson with Miss Hardbroom, the girls are presenting their projects to the class. Ethel goes first but her project is the same as Mildred's. Mildred shouts to Miss Hardbroom that Ethel had stolen her project. Miss Hardbroom opens Mildred's project folder but finds only lots of sheets of paper with smiley faces drawn on them in different colours. Miss Hardbroom \"transfers\" Mildred to her room.\n\nLater, Mildred finds that the creature inside her cat basket, a [[tortoise]] called Speedy whom she had used her spell on, can still speak. She renames him [[Einstein]] and Einstein tells her that he overheard her conversation with Ethel inside the tree. After Mildred runs to tell Maud and Enid the good news, Mildred accidentally leaves her bedroom door open and Einstein escapes. While plodding along the corridor he is discovered by Drusilla Paddock, who takes him to Ethel's room. While Ethel and Drusilla talk, it is revealed that Ethel did indeed take Mildred's project and had also \"tried out\" a snake spell on Mildred's pot and coils in art. Einstein overhears everything.\n\nWhen they are taking Einstein back to Mildred, Ethel eavesdrops on what Mildred is telling Maud and Enid. After discovering that Einstein can still speak and had overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred about the project, and that Einstein only has one more day before the spell wears off and he becomes mute forever, Ethel orders Drusilla to hide Einstein in the hollow [[pine tree]] outside the school gates. Einstein is put into a cardboard box that also contains a small green frog called Cyril, the animal whom Ethel had used in her demonstration. Cyril escapes and hops to Mildred's room. Cyril tells Mildred that Drusilla hid Einstein in the hollow pine tree outside the school gates and that he overheard several conversations about stealing projects and turning pots into snakes.\n\nAfter releasing Cyril into the woods, Mildred gets on her broomstick and, during a violent thunderstorm, finds and rescues Einstein. On landing she is confronted by Miss Hardbroom, who takes Mildred and Einstein inside and, after hearing part of the incidents from Mildred, sets an interview with Mildred and Ethel the next morning.\nThe next morning, Mildred goes to Miss Cackle's office where Einstein, resting in Miss Cackle's overflowing [[in-tray]], awakes and tells Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom that he overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred in the tree. He also says that he heard Ethel telling Drusilla that she had tried out a snake spell on Mildred's coils and had taken Mildred's project, copied it out in her own writing, and then thrown it in the kitchen bins. Ethel sifts through the rubbish and eventually finds Mildred's tea-stained project. Miss Hardbroom makes Ethel apologise to Mildred in assembly in front of the whole year as an alternative to being expelled for [[cheating]] as well as for her actions that put herself and Mildred in great danger.\n\nDuring a broomstick-flying lesson, Mildred reveals to Maud and Enid that Miss Cackle had provided Miss Mould's classroom with a proper [[kiln]] and craft room and she also got to keep Einstein as a pet. As the clock strikes midday, Mildred sprints into her room and hears Einstein speak for the last time in his raspy little voice (\"I'm glad I belong to you\"), before munching on his carrot and going silent forever.\n\n===''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star''===\n''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star'' (Scholastic UK, {{ISBN|978-0-141351995}}; another(?), {{ISBN|978-0-141383996}}) was released by Scholastic UK on 3 October 2013.<ref>[http://shop.scholastic.co.uk/products/93355 \"''The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star'' by Jill Murphy: For ages 7 to 9\"].

On that first night Maud spots a shooting star and Mildred makes a wish followed by Miss Hardbroom who does the same reluctantly. On the first lantern monitor shift Mildred is given a holdall containing safety objects in it. When she reaches the gates to finish the job Mildred spots a stray dog, who she names Star, she takes him to her bedroom as a secret pet, much to the disapproval of Tabby.\n\nDuring the weeks that follow Mildred, realising that Star is well behaved and calm on a broomstick, trains him to do various tricks with her. Maud and Enid, who realise Mildred isn't spending much time with them, soon discover about Star and are amazed by the tricks Mildred has taught him. Ethel, suspicious about Mildred hiding something in her holdall, reaches into it to discover Star was hidden in it and the both of them collapse\ninto the lanterns igniting the costumes Form Five have made for the talent competition.\n\nMiss Hardbroom, furious, sends Ethel and Mildred along with Star on a lead to Miss Cackle's office for what they had done then Maud and Enid explain about Star's tricks on the broom. Miss Cackle accepts the replacing talent and the next day the competition took place with the schools showing their talents. When it's Mildred's turn she amazes the judges with Star's tricks and wins the competition and the swimming pool. When the pupils go back to their school Miss Cackle allows Mildred to keep Star as her broomstick companion as a special privilege. Mildred later explains to Miss Hardbroom that she wished for Star on the shooting star at the beginning of term which doesn't annoy her as she wished on the star for them to win the competition. The story concludes with the teachers celebrating their victory and at the same time Miss Hardbroom's birthday.\n\n=== ''First Prize for the Worst Witch'' ===\n''First Prize for the Worst Witch'' ({{ISBN|9780141355092}}) was published in 2018.\n\nThe book deals with Mildred's graduation at the end of her fourth year. Its writing was delayed when Murphy underwent cancer treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/25/jill-murphy-worst-witch-career-classic-children-author |title=Jill Murphy: 'I just wanted to have a book on the shelf' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |first=Alison |last=Flood |date=25 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe stories mainly take place within the walls of Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, a girls-only boarding magic school that is described in the books as a stone castle on top of a mountain, surrounded by pine forest.\n\nThe school year is divided into two terms: the Winter term (September\u2013January) and the Summer term (March\u2013July), with a month's holiday between them. Students starts at Cackle's at the age of 12, and finish at the age of 17, for a total of five school years. The students arrive at the start of the term by flying broomsticks, except for the new first years, who walk through walker's gate as they can't fly yet. Halfway through the first term, the first years are each presented with a black kitten- Mildred receives a grey-and-black tabby cat as they apparently ran out of purely black cats- which they teach to ride the broomstick. The first book postulates that the cats weren't for any practical purpose except to keep tradition going, and in ''Wishing Star'', a group of elder witches note that there is no restriction on what animal a witch must have as her flight companion, with cats only being traditional as they are discreet and easy to care for, which leads to Mildred being permitted to fly with her dog, Star, after he shows greater broom aptitude than her cat Tabby. At the end of the first year, each pupil receives a copy of ''The Popular Book of Spells'', a three-inch thick volume bound in black leather. This was not really to be used, as they already had paperback editions for the classroom, but like the cats, it's another piece of tradition. At the end of the fifth and final year, students sit the exams for the W.H.C. (Witches' Higher Certificate), and most pupils were awarded with the certificate.\n\nThe first book says that the school winter uniform is composed of \"black gymslips, black stockings, black hob-nailed boots, grey shirts and black-and-grey ties.\" The first book also postulates that \"the only touches of colour [on the uniforms] were the sashes round their gymslips \u2013 a different colour for each house, although the houses are not named \u2013 and the school badge, which was a black cat sitting on a yellow moon.\" In the summer term, originally the girls wore grey-and-black checked dresses, but this was changed from ''Worst Witch All At Sea'' onwards to a simple black dress as Ms Hardbroom felt that the original design was too frivolous.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of The Worst Witch characters}}\n\n===Mildred Hubble===\nMildred \"Millie\" Hubble is the protagonist of the series. She is a good-hearted, but bungling young witch-in-training, who never seems to get anything right. She is friends with Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade and has a strong rivalry with Ethel Hallow. It is Miss Hardbroom, her potions teacher, who calls her \"The Worst Witch\".\n\nJill Murphy's illustrations shows that she is tall, with long brown [[braid|plaits]]. Some illustrations shows that she frequently fails to tie her bootlaces and the colour ones that her uniform sash is red. According to the author, Mildred's appearance is based on her own appearance as a teenager. She remembers: \"Mildred is based on myself when I had plaits so long that I could sit on them!\"<ref name=Q&A>{{cite web|title=World Book Day Q&A with Jill Murphy|url=http://www.gransnet.com/forums/webchats/a1204459-World-Book-Day-Q-A-with-Jill-Murphy|website=Gransnet|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Maud Spellbody===\nMaud Spellbody is Mildred's best friend. She is fiercely loyal to Mildred and assists her on most of her adventures, often against her better judgment. Maud is a decent and considerate person, but grows weary of Mildred's incessant clumsiness and often lectures her on how to improve herself. Ironically, Maud is not a perfect student, as she is also responsible for a laughing potion going wrong, as she along with Mildred had no idea how to make one. ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' reveals her last name to be Spellbody, rather than \"Moonshine\", which is what the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series dubbed her.\n\nThe author's illustrations shows that she is a short, plump girl with wide glasses who always wears her hair in bunches. The colour illustrations reveal that she is blonde and her uniform sash is yellow. According to the author, Maud is based on her best friend as a teenager, a girl called Elizabeth.<ref name=Q&A/>\n\n===Ethel Hallow===\nEthel Hallow is Mildred's acid-tongued rival. She does very well in class, comes from a prominent witch family, and gives the impression of being a model student. However, she is spoiled, snobbish and vindictive although able to [[turn on the charm]] and act sweet and innocent when the teachers are near, playing the role of a victim with Mildred as the bully. Up until ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'', she is Miss Hardbroom's favourite student; however, in the same book, she is exposed as a cheat and a liar, and thus has to watch her step lest she incur her teacher's wrath.\n\nThe book illustrations shows that she is a tall, skinny and sharp-faced young girl. Her hair is mousy brown and her uniform sash is purple.\n\nIn the first book of the series, it is revealed without explanation that Ethel and Mildred were enemies prior to the story. Ethel takes pleasure in taunting Mildred about her inability to train her cat into riding a broomstick, and Mildred responds by turning her into a pig. From then on Mildred and Ethel resent each other, and Ethel vows to get Mildred expelled. So far she has been unsuccessful. In the first five books she appears to have no friends, although her young sister, Sybil, makes an appearance in ''A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch''. A friend of Ethel's, Drusilla, makes a brief appearance in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'' and later plays a bigger part in ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'', where she hides Mildred's tortoise up a tree. Ethel is Mildred's arch-enemy.\n\n===Enid Nightshade===\nAnother of Mildred's closest friends. She makes her debut in ''The Worst Witch Strikes Again'' after she is transferred to Miss Cackle's Academy and Mildred is assigned to look after her, to the irritation of Miss Hardbroom. At first Mildred thinks Enid will simply be a nuisance and a pain, but she turns out to be a wild practical joker. Her attempts to make Mildred like her only result in Mildred getting into trouble, for example, turning her cat into a monkey and enchanting a vaulting pole which catapults Mildred into the air and into Miss Hardbroom's study.\n\nEnid is tall, well-built and rather muscular for a girl. She has large limbs and fair hair, usually in one long plait. In the TV series she is small and waiflike with dark hair. She takes an instant liking to Mildred and hopes to become her friend, implying that she is not a judgmental girl. Overall she is friendly and kind-hearted, but sometimes oversteps the mark in her attempt to befriend and help people, and being nice. Aside from Mildred herself, Enid is considered the second worst witch in the Academy, as she too is hopeless when it comes to broomstick riding and magic.\n\n===Miss Hardbroom===\nMiss Hardbroom is the fearsome deputy headmistress of Miss Cackle's Academy and the clear [[power behind the throne]]. She is Mildred's form mistress in first form and through various combinations of events continues to be her form mistress throughout the series. Tall, bony and sour-faced, she strikes fear into the pupils' hearts. \"HB\", as the girls refer to her, seems to have a particular resentment of Mildred. Miss Hardbroom frequently praises and rewards Ethel Hallow, and frequently rebukes Mildred in front of the other students. It is Miss Hardbroom who gives Mildred the title of \"the worst witch in the school\".\n\nIn the later books Miss Hardbroom's humanity comes through on occasion, in incidents such as her accident in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'', the restoring of Mildred's hair to its rightful length in ''The Worst Witch Saves the Day'', and her admitting of her error of judgment at the end of ''The Worst Witch to the Rescue''.\n\nMiss Hardbroom usually has her hair tied up in a tight bun which makes her face look really long.\nMiss Hardbroom is very strict on all of the girls except Ethel Hallow, the teachers' pet.\n\n===Miss Cackle===\nAmelia Cackle (Ada Cackle in the [[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|2017 TV series]]) is the kind-hearted headmistress of the Academy. Plump and pleasant, Miss Cackle is more lenient towards Mildred when she is in trouble, and rather than intimidate the girl as Miss Hardbroom does, Miss Cackle gives long, sorrowful lectures which causes Mildred to feel guilty for the trouble she is in. Her birthday is celebrated at her beloved Academy, and her students believe it to be the most boring event of the year. Despite her kind heart, Miss Cackle can be intimidating when she wants to, and has occasionally broken into fits of rage at Mildred, most notably both when Mildred humiliated the reputation of the Academy by ruining a broomstick display to honour the Wizards' Council (Ethel had cursed Mildred to ensure she would make a fool of herself), and after she incorrectly believed Mildred was cheating at the school sport's day, after Enid cast an improper spell upon Mildred to make sure she won the pole-vaulting competition. However, these moments of anger are few and short-lived.\n\nMiss Cackle has an evil twin sister named Agatha Cackle, who is bitterly jealous of her position of authority at the Academy. In the first of the series, Agatha and her [[coven]] of rebellious witches plotted to overthrow Miss Cackle and turn her, the staff, and students into frogs as they slept. Mildred caught them as they brewed their invisibility potion, by turning them into snails and taking them to the school to show Miss Cackle. Ashamed that her own sister would break the Witches' Code, she ordered Agatha to accept defeat and live the code like all decent witches. Agatha reluctantly co-operated. She tries to take over again at the end of series 1, by pretending to be Miss Cackle and dragging Mildred out of the classroom by her ear.\n\n===Drusilla Paddock===\nThe \"best friend\" of Ethel Hallow, with whom she is often paired up. Drusilla appears only briefly in ''The Worst Witch All at Sea'', but her role in the TV series and in the later books increases greatly. Drusilla is a horrible, vindictive bully, but lacks the acid-tongued spite of Ethel, and seems to be in great awe of her. Their \"friendship\" seems to be more of an alliance or a form of servitude: Ethel and Drusilla are not true friends, they have stuck beside each other because nobody else can bear to be around them. Drusilla seems to have no will of her own. Drusilla does everything Ethel orders her to, and in one book (''The Worst Witch to the Rescue'') she steals Mildred's beloved pet [[tortoise]] and hides it in a tree. In the TV series, she and Ethel briefly end their friendship when Drusilla sides with Mildred and her friends. They make up at the end of the episode though.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Television film===\n{{main|The Worst Witch (film)}}\n\nIn 1986, the first book in the series was converted to a made-for-television film on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] starring [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Diana Rigg]], and [[Charlotte Rae]]. Though a British film, it also aired in the USA on [[HBO]]. The film followed the plot of the first book of the series, portraying the incidents of Mildred turning herself invisible and turning Ethel into a pig, Miss Cackle's evil twin sister Agatha plotting to take over the school, and the Grand Wizard viewing the Halloween Broomstick formation (sabotaged by Ethel's faulty broom she lent to Mildred). It was shot at [[St. Michael's College, Tenbury|St. Michael's College]] in [[Tenbury Wells]]. This holiday special later aired on the [[Disney Channel]] every year for [[Halloween]] until the late 1990s. Its opening song, \"Growing Up Isn't Easy\", was sung by [[Bonnie Langford]]; its music was composed by [[Charles Strouse]] and its lyrics were written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]. Their other musical number was \"Anything Can Happen on Halloween\", sung by [[Tim Curry]]. [[Denis King]] composed its incidental music score. He also wrote the song \"My Little School\".\n\n===Television series (1998\u20132001)===\n''[[The Worst Witch (1998 TV series)|The Worst Witch]]'', a TV series based on the books, starring [[Georgina Sherrington]] and [[Felicity Jones]] as Mildred Hubble and Ethel Hallow respectively, was broadcast from 1998 to 2001. It was shot in [[Montreal]], London and [[Cardiff]]. The series is mostly shot in studio in London, with some episodes filmed in Montreal, [[Quebec]], Canada. The exteriors of Cackle's Academy used [[Castell Coch]], a castle located near Cardiff. The courtyard was filmed at [[Loseley Park]], near [[Guildford]]. Inside the school (Great Hall, classrooms etc.) was filmed at [[Twickenham Studios]].\n\n====Spin-offs====\nWhen it was no longer realistic that Mildred would still be at school, the series relocated her to a magical university in [[Cambridge]] and was retitled ''[[Weirdsister College]]: The Further Adventures of the Worst Witch,'' and saw the return of Felicity Jones as a reinvented Ethel Hallow.\n\nIn 2004, a new series based on the 1998 series was made, entitled ''[[The New Worst Witch]]''. It centred on the adventures of Mildred's equally bungling cousin, Henrietta \"Hettie\" Hubble, played by [[Alice Connor]], also set at Cackle's Academy.\n\n===Television series (2017\u2013present)===\nA new version of ''[[The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)|The Worst Witch]]'' TV series began in 2017 airing on [[CBBC]], this one starring [[Bella Ramsey]] as Mildred Hubble, [[Claire Higgins]] as Miss Cackle, and [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hardbroom.\n\n===Stage Adaptation (2018\u20132019)===\nA musical stage production called ''Worst Witch Live'' was shown at the [[Royal & Derngate]] Theatre in Northampton from 27 November to 30 December 2018.  In February 2019, the show began to tour the UK across 16 different venues. In April 2019 Kenny Wax Family Entertainment announced that ''Worst Witch Live'' would be showing at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in the West End from 24 July to 8 September 2019. This version is presented is a publicity play written by Mildred and acted out by the students and staff playing themselves, initially recreating Mildred's first year at school, although the second half takes on a metafictional angle as Agatha Cackle \"infiltrates\" the play and attempts to stage a coup of the magical government.\n\n''Worst Witch Live'' stars [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3930361/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Danielle Bird] as Mildred Hubble, [[imdbname:1118833|Polly Lister]] as Miss Cackle/Agatha, [https://www.mandy.com/actor/profile/rachel-heaton Rachel Heaton] as Miss Hardbroom and [https://www.actorum.com/actor/rosie-abraham/ Rosie Abraham] as Ethel Hallow.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature|Fantasy}}\n* [[Boarding schools in fiction]]\n* [[School story]]\n* [[Little Witch Academia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |25em |refs=\n<ref name=images>\n{{cite web |title=Jill Murphy: Biography |work=Images of Delight: Original artwork from children's book illustrators |url=http://www.imagesofdelight.com/gallery14.htm |accessdate=17 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929190352/http://www.imagesofdelight.com/client.asp?id=56 |archivedate=29 September 2007}} <!--update 2013-10-24--></ref>\n<ref name=\"new_series_2017_prod\">\n{{cite web|title=Netflix Sets Tween Series \u2018Worst Witch,\u2019 \u2018Horse Mystery Project\u2019 For 2017|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-tween-series-worst-witch-horse-mystery-project-1201849203|website=Variety|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{worldcat id|fast-962667|Mildred Hubble}}\n\n{{The Worst Witch}}\n\n<!--Mildred Hubbell?-->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worst Witch}}\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:British children's novels]]\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:Contemporary fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:The Worst Witch|*]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in written fiction]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n[[Category:Child characters in literature]] <!--Mildred Hubbell?-->\n[[Category:Characters in children's literature]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n[[Category:British novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:1974 children's books]]\n[[Category:Allison and Busby books]]\n", "name_user": "27.104.222.250", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMildred Hubble)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Worst_Witch"}
