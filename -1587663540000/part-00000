It portrays the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a wild [[beekeeper]] in the remote mountainous village of Bekirlija, [[North Macedonia]], and follows her lifestyle before and after neighbors move in next door. Although initially planned as a short film documenting the region surrounding the river [[Bregalnica]], the documentary's area of focus changed course when directors met Hatid\u017ee. ''Honeyland'' received its world premiere at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January and it has grossed $1,140,879.\n\nFilming of ''Honeyland'' lasted three years, with directors collecting a total of four hundred hours of footage. Several [[environmentalism|environmental topics]] are explored, such as [[climate change]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[exploitation of natural resources]]. Primarily focusing on the visual aspects, the directors wanted to portray humanity's balance with the [[ecosystem]] through Hatid\u017ee and [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]] through her neighbors. The documentary also portrays the protagonist's relationship with her bedridden mother and neighbors. ''Honeyland'' contains elements of several documentary styles, including [[fly on the wall]], [[direct cinema]], and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]. \n\n''Honeyland'' received universal critical acclaim from film critics who praised attention to detail and applauded the message of conservation of nature. The documentary received numerous awards and nominations at film festivals, including three awards at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] and two nominations at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] in the categories for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]]. ''Honeyland'' marked the first documentary in history to receive a nomination in both categories in the history of the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\n''Honeyland'' documents the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a Macedonian wild [[beekeeping|beekeeper]] of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Turkish]] descent who lives in the village of Bekirlija in the [[Lozovo Municipality|municipality of Lozovo]]. She is one of the last remaining wild beekeepers in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Europe]]. Due to its location in a secluded mountain, the village has no access to electricity or running water. Hatid\u017ee lives with her 85-year-old partly blind bedridden mother, Nazife, who is completely dependent on her daughter. She earns a living by selling honey in the country's capital [[Skopje]] which is four hours away from the village. \n\nThe atmosphere in the village changes when the nomadic rancher Hussein Sam arrives with a trailer along with his wife Ljutvie, their seven children and their imported domestic animals.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-2020-north-macedonia-selects-honeyland-best-international-feature-category-1234863|title=Oscars: North Macedonia Selects 'Honeyland' for Best International Feature Category|last=Holdsworth|first=Nick|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/106712-living-and-working-with-each-other-for-those-three-years-in-almost-unbearable-life-conditions-directors-ljubo-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-honeyland/|title=\"Living and Working with Each Other for Those Three Years in Almost Unbearable Life Conditions\": Directors Ljubo Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska {{!}} Honeyland|website=Filmmaker|date=28 January 2019|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Initially, Hatid\u017ee maintains good relationships with the family and spends time playing around with the children. In need of financial means, and inspired by Hatid\u017ee's way of earning money, Sam takes an interest in wild beekeeping himself. Hatid\u017ee instructs him on collecting honey and provides him with several bees so Sam can start his own colony. Despite being initially successful at it, Sam receives a demand by a customer to sell him more honey than his bees can produce. Sam disregards Hatid\u017ee's advice of always leaving half of the honey to his bees and proceeds to sell the entire honey his beehives produce. This leads to Sam's colonies attacking Hatid\u017ee's during the resource-scarce winter period. Hatid\u017ee scolds Sam for not following her advice as she finds her bee colony collapsing. Soon after, her mother passes away. As the nomadic family decides to move on to another village, Hatid\u017ee remains alone in Bekirlija.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/62254-honeyland-documentary-science-golden-rule|title=Oscar-nominated doc 'Honeyland' teaches a golden rule, rooted in science|work=Inverse.com|first=Sarah|last=Slota|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n[[File:Bregalnica River.JPG|thumb|left|The film was originally planned as a documentary short about preserving the region surrounding river [[Bregalnica]] (''pictured'').]]\n''Honeyland'' marks [[Tamara Kotevska]]'s and [[Ljubomir Stefanov]]'s second collaboration on a documentary movie after ''Lake of Apples'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eagan |first1=Daniel |title='It's a Choice: To Be a Filmmaker or a Human': Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska on Honeyland |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/107983-its-a-choice-to-be-a-filmmaker-or-a-human-ljubomir-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-on-honeyland/#.XhyTzFNKgWo |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The movie was originally intended as [[documentary short]] financially supported by the government.

It portrays the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a wild [[beekeeper]] in the remote mountainous village of Bekirlija, [[North Macedonia]], and follows her lifestyle before and after neighbors move in next door. Although initially planned as a short film documenting the region surrounding the river [[Bregalnica]], the documentary's area of focus changed course when directors met Hatid\u017ee. ''Honeyland'' received its world premiere at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January and it has grossed $1,140,879.\n\nFilming of ''Honeyland'' lasted three years, with directors collecting a total of four hundred hours of footage. Several [[environmentalism|environmental topics]] are explored, such as [[climate change]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[exploitation of natural resources]]. Primarily focusing on the visual aspects, the directors wanted to portray humanity's balance with the [[ecosystem]] through Hatid\u017ee and [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]] through her neighbors. The documentary also portrays the protagonist's relationship with her bedridden mother and neighbors. ''Honeyland'' contains elements of several documentary styles, including [[fly on the wall]], [[direct cinema]], and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]. \n\n''Honeyland'' received universal critical acclaim from film critics who praised attention to detail and applauded the message of conservation of nature. The documentary received numerous awards and nominations at film festivals, including three awards at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] and two nominations at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] in the categories for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]]. ''Honeyland'' marked the first documentary in history to receive a nomination in both categories in the history of the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\n''Honeyland'' documents the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a Macedonian wild [[beekeeping|beekeeper]] of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Turkish]] descent who lives in the village of Bekirlija in the [[Lozovo Municipality|municipality of Lozovo]]. She is one of the last remaining wild beekeepers in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Europe]]. Due to its location in a secluded mountain, the village has no access to electricity or running water. Hatid\u017ee lives with her 85-year-old partly blind bedridden mother, Nazife, who is completely dependent on her daughter. She earns a living by selling honey in the country's capital [[Skopje]] which is four hours away from the village. \n\nThe atmosphere in the village changes when the nomadic rancher Hussein Sam arrives with a trailer along with his wife Ljutvie, their seven children and their imported domestic animals.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-2020-north-macedonia-selects-honeyland-best-international-feature-category-1234863|title=Oscars: North Macedonia Selects 'Honeyland' for Best International Feature Category|last=Holdsworth|first=Nick|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/106712-living-and-working-with-each-other-for-those-three-years-in-almost-unbearable-life-conditions-directors-ljubo-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-honeyland/|title=\"Living and Working with Each Other for Those Three Years in Almost Unbearable Life Conditions\": Directors Ljubo Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska {{!}} Honeyland|website=Filmmaker|date=28 January 2019|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Initially, Hatid\u017ee maintains good relationships with the family and spends time playing around with the children. In need of financial means, and inspired by Hatid\u017ee's way of earning money, Sam takes an interest in wild beekeeping himself. Hatid\u017ee instructs him on collecting honey and provides him with several bees so Sam can start his own colony. Despite being initially successful at at it, Sam receives a demand by a customer to sell him more honey than his bees can produce. Sam disregards Hatid\u017ee's advice of always leaving half of the honey to his bees and proceeds to sell the entire honey his beehives produce. This leads to Sam's colonies attacking Hatid\u017ee's during the resource-scarce winter period. Hatid\u017ee scolds Sam for not following her advice as she finds her bee colony collapsing. Soon after, her mother passes away. As the nomadic family decides to move on to another village, Hatid\u017ee remains alone in Bekirlija.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/62254-honeyland-documentary-science-golden-rule|title=Oscar-nominated doc 'Honeyland' teaches a golden rule, rooted in science|work=Inverse.com|first=Sarah|last=Slota|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n[[File:Bregalnica River.JPG|thumb|left|The film was originally planned as a documentary short about preserving the region surrounding river [[Bregalnica]] (''pictured'').]]\n''Honeyland'' marks [[Tamara Kotevska]]'s and [[Ljubomir Stefanov]]'s second collaboration on a documentary movie after ''Lake of Apples'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eagan |first1=Daniel |title='It's a Choice: To Be a Filmmaker or a Human': Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska on Honeyland |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/107983-its-a-choice-to-be-a-filmmaker-or-a-human-ljubomir-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-on-honeyland/#.XhyTzFNKgWo |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The movie was originally intended as [[documentary short]] financially supported by the government.

Due to the outbreak of war, the graduation was several weeks early. He graduated 35th in his class of 139. Among those he graduated alongside were [[Matthew Ridgway]], [[Mark W.

All of these men were, like Collins, destined to become [[general officer]]s and later to achieve high rank in the army, with Ridgway, along with Collins, becoming [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chiefs of Staff]] and Clark becoming a [[four-star rank|four-star]] [[General (United States)|general]].\n\nCollins was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry Branch]] of the [[United States Army]] and was assigned as a [[platoon]] and later [[company commander]] with the [[22nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|22nd Infantry Regiment]]. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] in May 1917, and temporary [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in August. He attended the United States Army Infantry School of Arms at [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]] and served with the regiment at various locations between 1917 and 1919. He was promoted to captain in June 1918, and to temporary [[Major (United States)|major]] in September, and took command of the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment the following month.

He graduated from the company officer course at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1926, and from the advanced course at the [[United States Army Field Artillery School]] at Fort Sill, Oklahoma the year after. He was an instructor in weapons and tactics at the United States Army Infantry School from 1927 to 1931 and, promoted to major in August 1932, was [[executive officer]] of the 23rd Brigade in [[Manila]], and assistant chief of staff, as a G-2 staff officer, with the [[Philippine Division]] from 1933\u20131934.\n\nCollins graduated from the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy|United States Army Industrial College]] in 1937, and the [[United States Army War College]] the following year. He was then an instructor at the Army War College from 1938 to 1940.

At the time of his appointment he was the youngest division commander in the United States Army, aged 46. It was during this campaign that Collins gained his nickname of \"Lightning Joe\".<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" />\n\nCollins was later transferred to the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]], where he commanded the [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]] and on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] through to the [[end of World War II in Europe]] in May 1945. Collins was chosen by Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]], who had served with Collins at the Army Infantry School before the war and was then commanding the [[First United States Army|First Army]] in England, as a replacement for Major General [[Roscoe B. Woodruff]], the original commander of VII Corps and one of Bradley's West Point classmates, who was senior to Collins but, unlike Collins, had no recent combat experience. Collins was appointed after a brief interview with Bradley and General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], about his combat experience after Collins summed up his tactical approach in the Pacific as always targeting the high ground in an attack. Bradley turned to Eisenhower, claiming that Collins \"talks our language.\"<ref>Alan Axelrod, ''Bradley: A Biography'', p. 115</ref> At the age of 47, this made Collins the youngest corps commander in the United States Army. Among the units serving under Collins' command in Normandy was the veteran [[82nd Airborne Division]], commanded by Major General [[Matthew Ridgway]], a fellow graduate of the West Point class of 1917.\n[[File:General Joseph Lawton Collins, the Rhine River pontoon bridge and \"THE BEER BRIDGE Shortest Route to C.B.I.\" beer party art, from- General Pays Off - NARA - 12007749 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|General Joseph Lawton Collins challenged the 1106 Engineers Combat Group to build the [[Rhine river|Rhine River]] pontoon bridge at [[Bonn]], Germany in 10 hours and he would have a beer party.

VII Corps later played a major role in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the largest battle on the Western Front during World War II, and finally took part in the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]].

As a wartime chief of staff his primary responsibility was to ensure that adequately trained and equipped soldiers were sent to fight in Korea. He directed the Army's operation of the railroads, brought the first [[Special Forces]] group into the [[order of battle]], and was closely associated with the development of the army's contribution to the newly established [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).\n\nCollins was representative of the United States to the Military Committee and the Standing Group of NATO from 1953 to 1954.

During this time, Collins served in the [[Allied occupation of the Rhineland|Army of Occupation]] in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Paul M. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Korean War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scZN59DXeOwC&lpg=PA163&dq=Philippine%20%22Korean%20War%22&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q=Philippine%20%22Korean%20War%22&f=false |accessdate=19 March 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810874619 |page=65 |series=Volume 41 of Historical Dictionaries of War, Revolution, and Civil Unrest }}</ref>\n\n==Between the wars==\nCollins married Gladys Easterbrook in 1921 and, reverting to the rank of captain in 1920, he was instructor in the department of [[chemistry]] at the United States Military Academy from 1921 to 1925. He graduated from the company officer course at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1926, and from the advanced course at the [[United States Army Field Artillery School]] at Fort Sill, Oklahoma the year after. He was an instructor in weapons and tactics at the United States Army Infantry School from 1927 to 1931 and, promoted to major in August 1932, was [[executive officer]] of the 23rd Brigade in [[Manila]], and assistant chief of staff, as a G-2 staff officer, with the [[Philippine Division]] from 1933\u20131934.\n\nCollins graduated from the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy|United States Army Industrial College]] in 1937, and the [[United States Army War College]] the following year. He was then an instructor at the Army War College from 1938 to 1940. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in June 1940 and, now a full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], was [[chief of staff]] of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in 1941.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Two Soldiers on New Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|On the right, Major General J.

In February 1942 he was promoted to the [[one-star rank|one-star general officer rank]] of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] and the [[two-star rank|two-star]] general officer rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in May.<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_collins_j_lawton.html | title=J.

At the time of his appointment he was the youngest division commander in the United States Army, aged 46. It was during this campaign that Collins gained his nickname of \"Lightning Joe\".<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" />\n\nCollins was later transferred to the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]], where he commanded the [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]] and on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] through to the [[end of World War II in Europe]] in May 1945. Collins was chosen by Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]], who had served with Collins at the Army Infantry School before the war and was then commanding the [[First United States Army|First Army]] in England, as a replacement for Major General [[Roscoe B. Woodruff]], the original commander of VII Corps and one of Bradley's West Point classmates, who was senior to Collins but, unlike Collins, had no recent combat experience. Collins was appointed after a brief interview with Bradley and General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], about his combat experience after Collins summed up his tactical approach in the Pacific as always targeting the high ground in an attack. Bradley turned to Eisenhower, claiming that Collins \"talks our language.\"<ref>Alan Axelrod, ''Bradley: A Biography'', p. 115</ref> At the age of 47, this made Collins the youngest corps commander in the United States Army. Among the units serving under Collins' command in Normandy was the veteran [[82nd Airborne Division]], commanded by Major General [[Matthew Ridgway]], a fellow graduate of the West Point class of 1917.\n[[File:General Joseph Lawton Collins, the Rhine River pontoon bridge and \"THE BEER BRIDGE Shortest Route to C.B.I.\" beer party art, from- General Pays Off - NARA - 12007749 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|General Joseph Lawton Collins challenged the 1106 Engineers Combat Group to build the [[Rhine river|Rhine River]] pontoon bridge at [[Bonn]], Germany in 10 hours and he would have a beer party.

VII Corps later played a major role in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the largest battle on the Western Front during World War II, and finally took part in the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]]. VII Corps is perhaps best known for the leading role it played in Operation Cobra; less well known is Collins' contribution to that plan.<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" />\n\n[[File:GENERAL COLLINS, FIELD MARSHAL MONTGOMERY, AND GENERAL RIDGWAY.jpg|thumb|right|Major General J.

As a wartime chief of staff his primary responsibility was to ensure that adequately trained and equipped soldiers were sent to fight in Korea. He directed the Army's operation of the railroads, brought the first [[Special Forces]] group into the [[order of battle]], and was closely associated with the development of the army's contribution to the newly established [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).\n\nCollins was representative of the United States to the Military Committee and the Standing Group of NATO from 1953 to 1954. He was special representative of the United States in [[Vietnam]] with ambassadorial rank, 1954 to 1955, and returned to his NATO assignment. He retired from active service in March 1956, after almost 40 years of military service.\n\nGeneral Joseph Lawton Collins died in [[Washington, D.C.]], on September 12, 1987.

He reportedly accepted the conditions the Reform Party set out for joining the alliance, however the terms of entry were opposed by other members of the SDA's Council who blocked the move. In 2010 and early-2011, it was also reported that some members of the SDA's Council felt that Chiam was unable to properly fulfil his role of Chairman of the alliance, after he had cut back his political activities following his stroke in 2008. On 28 February 2011, the SDA's Council voted to relieve Chiam of his role as chairman, however the Council stressed that they still hoped to field Chiam as a candidate at the next general election. But two days later, on 2 March 2011, Chiam announced that the Singapore People's Party was withdrawing from the SDA, and that he would stand under the banner of the SPP instead of the SDA at the next general election.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1113966/1/.html GE: SDA says Chiam pulling SPP out of alliance], channelnewsasia.com, 2 March 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110303-0000259/Chiam-pulls-party-out-of-alliance Chiam pulls party out of alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306133237/http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110303-0000259/Chiam-pulls-party-out-of-alliance |date=6 March 2011 }}, ''Today'', 3 March 2011</ref>\n\nFor the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 general election]], Chiam's wife, Lina Loh Woon Lee (sometimes referred to as [[Lina Chiam]]), the SPP candidate in Potong Pasir.

His wife [[Lina Chiam]] (Lina Loh) failed to retain his old Potong Pasir seat and was defeated by his opponent in the last two elections, the PAP's [[Sitoh Yih Pin]], by a margin of 114 votes (0.72%). A week later, the [[Singapore People's Party]] (SPP) announced that [[Lina Chiam]] would accept an offer to become a [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament]] as one of the best-performing losing opposition candidates.\n\nIn October 2014, the biography of Chiam, ''Let the People Have Him'', by Loke Hoe Yeong (published by [[Epigram Books]]) revealed that Chiam's grandfather, Chiam Seng Poh, was a revolutionary who helped [[Sun Yat-sen]] overthrow the [[Qing dynasty]].

The movement was inspired by the writings of Cardinal [[Saint John Henry Newman]] encouraging societies for Catholic students attending secular universities.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090301223919/http://wsunewmancenter.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=29&Itemid=53 \"A Brief History\"]</ref>\n\nThese centers may include residential living space or may be actual houses close to the campus with or without a chapel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umassdcatholics.com/|title=Home Page - UMass Dartmouth Catholic Campus Mnistry|first=UMass Dartmouth Catholic Campus|last=Mnistry|website=www.umassdcatholics.com}}</ref> Activities vary between centers but usually include both spiritual worship like Sunday mass and [[eucharistic adoration]], social get-togethers (like movies or coffee socials), and group outings (like apple picking, [[March for Life]] events, and amusement parks).\n\n==History==\nThe first Newman club was established at Oxford University by [[Hartwell de la Garde Grissell]] in 1878 as [[Oxford University Catholic Club]], which was renamed in 1888 the Oxford University Newman Society.\n\nThe \u201cNewman Movement\u201d in the United States began in 1883 at the University of Wisconsin when Catholic students joined to form the Melvin Club, names after their hosts, Mr. and Mrs. John C. Melvin.<ref name=naab>Naab, Kathleen.[https://zenit.org/articles/what-newman-centers-owe-their-namesake-part-1/ \"What Newman Centers Owe Their Namesake\", ''Zenit'', August 30, 2010]</ref> The first Newman Club in America was established in 1893 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] by Timothy Harrington,<ref>John Whitney Evans, ''Making the Best of a Bad Job? Newman Chaplains between the Code and the Council'', U.S. Catholic Historian, Vol. 11, No. 1, Sulpicians and Seminaries, Prelates and Priests (Winter, 1993), pp. 35\u201350.</ref> a graduate medical student and former member of the Wisconsin group, together with John Gilbride, James and Joseph Walsh with assistance of Father P. J. Garvey, pastor of the local St. James Catholic Church. The club provided social activities, discussions on the faith, and mutual support for Catholic students in a sometimes hostile academic environment. The meetings were occasions to experience Catholic culture in a secular environment.<ref name=naab/>\n\n[[Cornell]] had one of the first Newman Clubs, organized in 1888. The Newman Club eventually became a full-fledged campus parish, the [[Cornell Catholic Community]].\n\nIn the early 1900s, the majority of Catholic college students attended private Catholic institutions.{{cn|date=April 2020}} However, over time, a growing number of Catholics began attending secular universities. Initially, small chapels were opened near the campuses of the secular universities.  In 1908, the Catholic clubs began an association which became the [[National Newman Club Federation]]. After [[Vatican II]], the U.S. bishops placed the \"Newman Apostolate\" under the care of the [[Catholic Campus Ministry Association]].<ref>Long-Garcia, [https://www.uscatholic.org/life/2012/01/newman-centers-brief-history \"Newman Centers: A brief history\", ''U.S.Catholic'', (Vol. 77, No. 2).February 2012, pp. 27-31]</ref>\n\nAccording to The Newman Connection <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmanconnection.com/|title=Home|website=The Newman Connection}}</ref>, a US [[Catholic Church]] Campus Ministries non-profit organization, there are over 2,000 Newman Centers in the United States.  \n\n==Ministry and services==\nThe centers provide pastoral services and ministries to their Catholic communities, in particular to the Roman Catholic student population within the universities. However, since these centers are located on university campuses, those of other [[Christian denomination]]s often come and participate as well. A variety of university and parish related meetings and social events take place at the centers, as well as personal events including [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|Catholic weddings]], anniversary celebrations, [[Baptism#Roman_Catholicism|baptisms]], [[Mass in the Catholic Church|masses]] and funeral receptions.\n\n==United States==\nHere are a few examples of campuses with Newman Centers:\n\n[[File:St. John&#039;s Catholic Newman Center Champaign, Illinois.jpg|thumb|St. John&#039;s Catholic Newman Center Champaign, Illinois]]\n[[St. John's Catholic Newman Center]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]\u2014formerly known as the Newman Foundation\u2014is the largest in the nation and has been considered one of the model Newman Centers in the United States.{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} The center encompasses three main entities: St. John's Catholic Chapel, Newman Hall, and the Institute of Catholic Thought. It is one of the few Newman Centers that also encompasses a large undergraduate residence, Newman Hall, through the University's Certified Private Housing program, having over 600 live-in residents, a cafeteria, and other services.<ref>[https://www.sjcnc.org/ St. John's Catholic Newman Center]</ref>\n\nThe Newman Center at [[Troy University]] in Troy, Alabama is a coed residence hall which opened in 2013.  The Newman Halls will house 376 residents, 6 resident assistants, and one live-in married couple who acts as the community directors.<ref>[https://www.troy.edu/student-life-resources/housing/newman-center.html \"Newman Center\", Troy University, Alabama]</ref> \n\nBlessed Pope John Paul II Newman Center at the [[University of Illinois, Chicago]] serves the largest Catholic student population in the Midwest and one of the largest in the country. UIC has 25,000+ students, of which over 15,000 are Catholic. The John Paul II Newman Center in 1999 established the Arthur J. Schmitt Chair in Catholic studies for students to study the Catholic faith and receive college credit for doing so. Currently, students may receive a minor in Catholic studies. Of the other programs the John Paul II Newman Center offers, Vocation Discernment averages 10\u201315 students each year who study to become priests and [[Religious (Catholic)|religious]] brothers and sisters. The Integritas Institute for Ethics, a third program, teaches ethics and morality. The John Paul II Newman Center is in the Catholic [[Archdiocese of Chicago]].<ref>http://www.jp2newman.org </ref>\n\nSt. Mary's Catholic Center at [[Texas A&M University]] decided to turn their permanent parishioners into volunteers for the campus ministry and discontinued all other parish programs not related directly to campus ministry.

Melvin.<ref name=naab>Naab, Kathleen.[https://zenit.org/articles/what-newman-centers-owe-their-namesake-part-1/ \"What Newman Centers Owe Their Namesake\", ''Zenit'', August 30, 2010]</ref> The first Newman Club in America was established in 1893 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] by Timothy Harrington,<ref>John Whitney Evans, ''Making the Best of a Bad Job?

J. Garvey, pastor of the local St. James Catholic Church. The club provided social activities, discussions on the faith, and mutual support for Catholic students in a sometimes hostile academic environment. The meetings were occasions to experience Catholic culture in a secular environment.<ref name=naab/>\n\n[[Cornell]] had one of the first Newman Clubs, organized in 1888. The Newman Club eventually became a full-fledged campus parish, the [[Cornell Catholic Community]].\n\nIn the early 1900s, the majority of Catholic college students attended private Catholic institutions.{{cn|date=April 2020}} However, over time, a growing number of Catholics began attending secular universities. Initially, small chapels were opened near the campuses of the secular universities.  In 1908, the Catholic clubs began an association which became the [[National Newman Club Federation]]. After [[Vatican II]], the U.S. bishops placed the \"Newman Apostolate\" under the care of the [[Catholic Campus Ministry Association]].<ref>Long-Garcia, [https://www.uscatholic.org/life/2012/01/newman-centers-brief-history \"Newman Centers: A brief history\", ''U.S.Catholic'', (Vol. 77, No. 2).February 2012, pp. 27-31]</ref>\n\nAccording to The Newman Connection <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmanconnection.com/|title=Home|website=The Newman Connection}}</ref>, a US [[Catholic Church]] Campus Ministries non-profit organization, there are over 2,000 Newman Centers in the United States.  \n\n==Ministry and services==\nThe centers provide pastoral services and ministries to their Catholic communities, in particular to the Roman Catholic student population within the universities. However, since these centers are located on university campuses, those of other [[Christian denomination]]s often come and participate as well. A variety of university and parish related meetings and social events take place at the centers, as well as personal events including [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|Catholic weddings]], anniversary celebrations, [[Baptism#Roman_Catholicism|baptisms]], [[Mass in the Catholic Church|masses]] and funeral receptions.\n\n==United States==\nHere are a few examples of campuses with Newman Centers:\n\n[[File:St. John&#039;s Catholic Newman Center Champaign, Illinois.jpg|thumb|St. John&#039;s Catholic Newman Center Champaign, Illinois]]\n[[St. John's Catholic Newman Center]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]\u2014formerly known as the Newman Foundation\u2014is the largest in the nation and has been considered one of the model Newman Centers in the United States.{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} The center encompasses three main entities: St. John's Catholic Chapel, Newman Hall, and the Institute of Catholic Thought. It is one of the few Newman Centers that also encompasses a large undergraduate residence, Newman Hall, through the University's Certified Private Housing program, having over 600 live-in residents, a cafeteria, and other services.<ref>[https://www.sjcnc.org/ St. John's Catholic Newman Center]</ref>\n\nThe Newman Center at [[Troy University]] in Troy, Alabama is a coed residence hall which opened in 2013.  The Newman Halls will house 376 residents, 6 resident assistants, and one live-in married couple who acts as the community directors.<ref>[https://www.troy.edu/student-life-resources/housing/newman-center.html \"Newman Center\", Troy University, Alabama]</ref> \n\nBlessed Pope John Paul II Newman Center at the [[University of Illinois, Chicago]] serves the largest Catholic student population in the Midwest and one of the largest in the country. UIC has 25,000+ students, of which over 15,000 are Catholic. The John Paul II Newman Center in 1999 established the Arthur J. Schmitt Chair in Catholic studies for students to study the Catholic faith and receive college credit for doing so. Currently, students may receive a minor in Catholic studies. Of the other programs the John Paul II Newman Center offers, Vocation Discernment averages 10\u201315 students each year who study to become priests and [[Religious (Catholic)|religious]] brothers and sisters. The Integritas Institute for Ethics, a third program, teaches ethics and morality. The John Paul II Newman Center is in the Catholic [[Archdiocese of Chicago]].<ref>http://www.jp2newman.org </ref>\n\nSt. Mary's Catholic Center at [[Texas A&M University]] decided to turn their permanent parishioners into volunteers for the campus ministry and discontinued all other parish programs not related directly to campus ministry.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on Neanderthal/human divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

Average [[body fat percentage]] (BFP) was estimated to be 25%, though it may have been 13% for males and 20% for females in more temperate areas. Using these measurements and average height and weight, the daily [[total energy expenditure]] (TEE)\u2014the amount of calories consumed in one day\u2014was estimated to be 3,454\u20134,019 and 3,828\u20134,483 [[kcal]] for males with high and low BFPs respectively, and 3,115\u20133,538 and 3,258\u20133,710 kcal for females. However, if the PAL was reduced to that of modern Siberian hunter-gatherers, the TEE becomes 2,959\u20133,524 and 3,333\u20133,988 kcal for males, and 2,620\u20133,043 and 2,764\u20133,215 kcal for females. This is comparable with the upper end of energetic demands of modern hunter gatherers, and the latter estimates are most similar to the Siberian [[Yakuts]], which contradicts earlier estimates of vastly higher energetic demands in Neanderthals than modern humans. Further, some Neanderthal populations are thought to have had a predominantly low-calorie plant diet, which suggests the minimum daily caloric intake was also low.<ref name=venner2018>{{cite thesis|first=S.

However, individuals with the 129 variant of the [[PRNP]] gene were naturally immune to the prions. Studying this gene led to the discovery that the 129 variant was widespread among all modern humans, which could indicate widespread cannibalism at some point in human prehistory. Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liberski |first1=P. |title=Kuru: a journey back in time from Papua New Guinea to the Neanderthals' extinction |journal=Pathogens |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=472\u2013505 |year=2013 |pmid=25437203 |pmc=4235695 |doi=10.3390/pathogens2030472 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Neanderthals in popular culture}}\n[[File:BlackTerror1636.jpg|thumb|upright|Cavemen in ''[[wikisource:The Black Terror/16|The Black Terror #16]]'' (1946)|alt=3 panels, a brawny man standing to the left and a child to the right on grass in front of a cave.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on Neanderthal/human divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

Average [[body fat percentage]] (BFP) was estimated to be 25%, though it may have been 13% for males and 20% for females in more temperate areas. Using these measurements and average height and weight, the daily [[total energy expenditure]] (TEE)\u2014the amount of calories consumed in one day\u2014was estimated to be 3,454\u20134,019 and 3,828\u20134,483 [[kcal]] for males with high and low BFPs respectively, and 3,115\u20133,538 and 3,258\u20133,710 kcal for females.

This is comparable with the upper end of energetic demands of modern hunter gatherers, and the latter estimates are most similar to the Siberian [[Yakuts]], which contradicts earlier estimates of vastly higher energetic demands in Neanderthals than modern humans.

When the [[Marshall Plan]] went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were [[Earmark (finance)|earmark]]ed for the construction of infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the [[International Development Association]] was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.\n\nBefore 1974, the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small. The Bank's staff were aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank. [[Fiscal conservatism]] ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict criteria.<ref name=\"Goldman 2005\" />{{rp|56\u201360}}\n\nThe first country to receive a World Bank loan was France. The Bank's president at the time, [[John J. McCloy|John McCloy]], chose France over two other applicants, Poland and Chile. The loan was for US$250&nbsp;million, half the amount requested, and it came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments. World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the [[United States State Department]] told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed. The French government complied and removed the [[Communist Party of France|Communist]] [[coalition government]] - the so-called [[Tripartite system (politics)|tripartite]]. Within hours, the loan to France was approved.<ref name=\"Bird 1992\">{{cite book |title=The Chairman: John J.

Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing [[Third World]] governments as \"[[rent-seeking]] states\".\n\nDuring the 1980s the bank emphasized lending to service Third-World debt, and [[structural adjustment]] policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations. [[UNICEF]] reported in the late 1980s that the structural adjustment programs of the World Bank had been responsible for \"reduced health, nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of children in [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], and [[Africa]]\".<ref name=\"Cornia et al. 1987\">{{Cite book | title = Adjustment with a Human Face: Protecting the Vulnerable and Promoting Growth | editor = Cornia, Giovanni Andrea | editor2 = Jolly, Richard | editor3 = Stewart, Frances | year = 1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press USA | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-19-828609-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/adjustmentwithhu0001unse }}</ref>\n\n===1989\u2013present===\nBeginning in 1989, in response to harsh criticism from many groups, the bank began including environmental groups and NGOs in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the criticism.<ref name=\"Goldman 2005\" />{{rp|93\u201397}} It also formed an implementing agency, in accordance with the Montreal Protocols, to stop [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depletion]] damage to the Earth's atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95% of ozone-depleting chemicals, with a target date of 2015. Since then, in accordance with its so-called \"Six Strategic Themes\", the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For example, in 1991 the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.\n\nIn order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces.

For the goals to be realized, six criteria must be met: stronger and more inclusive growth in Africa and fragile states, more effort in health and education, integration of the development and environment agendas, more as well as better aid, movement on trade negotiations, and stronger and more focused support from multilateral institutions like the World Bank.<ref name=\"World Bank MDGs 2012\">{{cite web |title = Millennium Development Goals|publisher = World Bank Group|author = World Bank|url = https://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/|accessdate = 31 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n# '''Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger''': From 1990 through 2004 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from almost a third to less than a fifth. Although results vary widely within regions and countries, the trend indicates that the world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty. Africa's poverty, however, is expected to rise, and most of the 36 countries where 90% of the world's undernourished children live are in Africa. Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving under-nutrition.\n# '''Achieve Universal Primary Education''': The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005. Still, about 72&nbsp;million children of primary school age, 57% of them girls, were not being educated {{as of|2005|lc=y}}.\n# '''Promote Gender Equality''': The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more women than men- worldwide more than 60% \u2013 are contributing but unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created to advance women's economic empowerment and promote shared growth.\n# '''Reduce Child Mortality''': There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005; most of their deaths were from preventable causes.\n# '''Improve Maternal Health''': Almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible.\n# '''Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases''': Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen, but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In the eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above 15 percent. Treatment has increased globally, but still meets only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across countries). AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.6&nbsp;million deaths in 2007). There are 300 to 500&nbsp;million cases of malaria each year, leading to more than 1&nbsp;million deaths. Nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n# '''Ensure Environmental Sustainability''': Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of biological diversity, which continues to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.\n# '''Develop a Global Partnership for Development''': Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development. Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs' realization.\n\nTo make sure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation, environmental, social and legal safeguards were defined. However, these safeguards have not been implemented entirely yet. At the World Bank's annual meeting in Tokyo 2012 a review of these safeguards has been initiated, which was welcomed by several civil society organisations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Most relevant review |author=Korinna Horta |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/world-bank-reviewing-its-social-and-environmental-safeguards-and-civil-society-organisations}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nThe President of the Bank is the president of the entire [[World Bank Group]].

GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues.\n\nGDLN clients are typically NGOs, government, private sector and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively, and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconference-based activities a year on behalf of their clients, reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.\n\n====GDLN Asia Pacific====\nThe GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate, or are planned in 20 countries: Australia, Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Japan, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Timor Leste, Fiji, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and New Zealand. With over 180 Distance Learning Centers, it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region. The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLN's East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006. Its vision is to become \"the premier network exchanging ideas, experience and know-how across the Asia Pacific Region\". GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank. It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and, in accordance with the Charter, a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed.\n\nThe committee comprises China (2), Australia (1), Thailand (1), The World Bank (1) and finally, a nominee of the Government of Japan (1). The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific.\n\nThe Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a \"Foundation\". The World Bank is currently engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this legal status.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand \u2013 Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.\n\n===JUSTPAL Network===\nA Justice Sector Peer-Assisted Learning (JUSTPAL) Network was launched in April 2011 by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Department of the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region. The JUSTPAL objective is to provide an online and offline platform for justice professionals to exchange knowledge, good practices and peer-driven improvements to justice systems and thereby support countries to improve their justice sector performance, quality of justice and service delivery to citizens and businesses.\n\nThe JUSTPAL Network includes representatives of judiciaries, ministries of justice, prosecutors, anti-corruption agencies and other justice-related entities from across the globe. The Network currently has active members from more than 50 countries.\n\nTo facilitate fruitful exchange of reform experiences and sharing of applicable good practices, the JUSTPAL Network has organized its activities under (currently) five Communities of Practice (COPs): (i) Budgeting for the Justice Sector; (ii) Information Systems for Justice Services; (iii) Justice Sector Physical Infrastructure; (iv) Court Management and Administration; and (v) Prosecution and Anti-Corruption Agencies.\n\n==Country assistance strategies==\nAs a guideline to the World Bank's operations in any particular country, a Country Assistance Strategy is produced in cooperation with the local government and any interested stakeholders and may rely on analytical work performed by the Bank or other parties.\n\n==Clean Air Initiative==\nClean Air Initiative (CAI) is a World Bank initiative to advance innovative ways to improve air quality in cities through partnerships in selected regions of the world by sharing knowledge and experiences.

Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], economic growth regressed and inflation worsened.

When the [[Marshall Plan]] went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were [[Earmark (finance)|earmark]]ed for the construction of infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the [[International Development Association]] was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.\n\nBefore 1974, the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small.

World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the [[United States State Department]] told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed.

Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing [[Third World]] governments as \"[[rent-seeking]] states\".\n\nDuring the 1980s the bank emphasized lending to service Third-World debt, and [[structural adjustment]] policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations. [[UNICEF]] reported in the late 1980s that the structural adjustment programs of the World Bank had been responsible for \"reduced health, nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of children in [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], and [[Africa]]\".<ref name=\"Cornia et al. 1987\">{{Cite book | title = Adjustment with a Human Face: Protecting the Vulnerable and Promoting Growth | editor = Cornia, Giovanni Andrea | editor2 = Jolly, Richard | editor3 = Stewart, Frances | year = 1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press USA | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-19-828609-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/adjustmentwithhu0001unse }}</ref>\n\n===1989\u2013present===\nBeginning in 1989, in response to harsh criticism from many groups, the bank began including environmental groups and NGOs in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the criticism.<ref name=\"Goldman 2005\" />{{rp|93\u201397}} It also formed an implementing agency, in accordance with the Montreal Protocols, to stop [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depletion]] damage to the Earth's atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95% of ozone-depleting chemicals, with a target date of 2015. Since then, in accordance with its so-called \"Six Strategic Themes\", the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For example, in 1991 the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.\n\nIn order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces.

For the goals to be realized, six criteria must be met: stronger and more inclusive growth in Africa and fragile states, more effort in health and education, integration of the development and environment agendas, more as well as better aid, movement on trade negotiations, and stronger and more focused support from multilateral institutions like the World Bank.<ref name=\"World Bank MDGs 2012\">{{cite web |title = Millennium Development Goals|publisher = World Bank Group|author = World Bank|url = https://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/|accessdate = 31 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n# '''Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger''': From 1990 through 2004 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from almost a third to less than a fifth. Although results vary widely within regions and countries, the trend indicates that the world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty. Africa's poverty, however, is expected to rise, and most of the 36 countries where 90% of the world's undernourished children live are in Africa. Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving under-nutrition.\n# '''Achieve Universal Primary Education''': The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005. Still, about 72&nbsp;million children of primary school age, 57% of them girls, were not being educated {{as of|2005|lc=y}}.\n# '''Promote Gender Equality''': The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more women than men- worldwide more than 60% \u2013 are contributing but unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created to advance women's economic empowerment and promote shared growth.\n# '''Reduce Child Mortality''': There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005; most of their deaths were from preventable causes.\n# '''Improve Maternal Health''': Almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible.\n# '''Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases''': Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen, but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In the eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above 15 percent. Treatment has increased globally, but still meets only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across countries). AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.6&nbsp;million deaths in 2007). There are 300 to 500&nbsp;million cases of malaria each year, leading to more than 1&nbsp;million deaths. Nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n# '''Ensure Environmental Sustainability''': Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of biological diversity, which continues to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.\n# '''Develop a Global Partnership for Development''': Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development. Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs' realization.\n\nTo make sure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation, environmental, social and legal safeguards were defined. However, these safeguards have not been implemented entirely yet. At the World Bank's annual meeting in Tokyo 2012 a review of these safeguards has been initiated, which was welcomed by several civil society organisations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Most relevant review |author=Korinna Horta |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/world-bank-reviewing-its-social-and-environmental-safeguards-and-civil-society-organisations}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nThe President of the Bank is the president of the entire [[World Bank Group]].

The government then identifies the country's priorities and targets for the reduction of poverty, and the World Bank instigates its aid efforts correspondingly.\n\nForty-five countries pledged US$25.1 billion in \"aid for the world's poorest countries\", aid that goes to the World Bank [[International Development Association]] (IDA), which distributes the loans to eighty poorer countries. Wealthier [[nations]] sometimes fund their own aid projects, including those for diseases. Robert B.

It aimed to inspire change agents and prepare them with essential tools that can help achieve development results. \nWBI had four major strategies to approach development problems: innovation for development, knowledge exchange, leadership and coalition building, and structured learning. World Bank Institute (WBI) was formerly known as Economic Development Institute (EDI), established on 11 March 1955 with the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The purpose of the institute was to serve as provide an open place where senior officials from developing countries could discuss development policies and programs. Over the years, EDI grew significantly and in 2000, the Institute was renamed as the World Bank Institute. Sanjay Pradhan is the past Vice President of the World Bank Institute.<ref name=\"World Bank Institute About 2012\">{{cite web | title = About WBI | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank Institute | url = http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | accessdate = 31 May 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120529155048/http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | archive-date = 29 May 2012 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> As of 2019, World Bank Institute functions have been mostly encapsulated by a new unit Global Operations Knowledge Management Unit (GOKMU), which is now responsible for knowledge management and learning across the Bank.\n\n===Global Development Learning Network===\nThe Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) is a partnership of over 120 learning centers (GDLN Affiliates) in nearly 80 countries around the world. GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues.\n\nGDLN clients are typically NGOs, government, private sector and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively, and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconference-based activities a year on behalf of their clients, reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.\n\n====GDLN Asia Pacific====\nThe GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate, or are planned in 20 countries: Australia, Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Japan, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Timor Leste, Fiji, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and New Zealand. With over 180 Distance Learning Centers, it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region. The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLN's East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006. Its vision is to become \"the premier network exchanging ideas, experience and know-how across the Asia Pacific Region\". GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank. It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and, in accordance with the Charter, a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed.\n\nThe committee comprises China (2), Australia (1), Thailand (1), The World Bank (1) and finally, a nominee of the Government of Japan (1). The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific.\n\nThe Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a \"Foundation\". The World Bank is currently engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this legal status.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand \u2013 Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.\n\n===JUSTPAL Network===\nA Justice Sector Peer-Assisted Learning (JUSTPAL) Network was launched in April 2011 by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Department of the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region. The JUSTPAL objective is to provide an online and offline platform for justice professionals to exchange knowledge, good practices and peer-driven improvements to justice systems and thereby support countries to improve their justice sector performance, quality of justice and service delivery to citizens and businesses.\n\nThe JUSTPAL Network includes representatives of judiciaries, ministries of justice, prosecutors, anti-corruption agencies and other justice-related entities from across the globe. The Network currently has active members from more than 50 countries.\n\nTo facilitate fruitful exchange of reform experiences and sharing of applicable good practices, the JUSTPAL Network has organized its activities under (currently) five Communities of Practice (COPs): (i) Budgeting for the Justice Sector; (ii) Information Systems for Justice Services; (iii) Justice Sector Physical Infrastructure; (iv) Court Management and Administration; and (v) Prosecution and Anti-Corruption Agencies.\n\n==Country assistance strategies==\nAs a guideline to the World Bank's operations in any particular country, a Country Assistance Strategy is produced in cooperation with the local government and any interested stakeholders and may rely on analytical work performed by the Bank or other parties.\n\n==Clean Air Initiative==\nClean Air Initiative (CAI) is a World Bank initiative to advance innovative ways to improve air quality in cities through partnerships in selected regions of the world by sharing knowledge and experiences.

Though the Washington Consensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development, it was criticized for ignoring equity, employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out.

Instead the projects often serve to expand the exercise of bureaucratic state power. Through his case-studies of development projects in [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] he shows that the World Bank's characterization of the economic conditions in [[Lesotho]] was flawed, and the Bank ignored the political and cultural character of the state in crafting their projects.

Some of these policies included encouraging [[production (economics)|production]], investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real [[exchange rates]] and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural adjustment loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.<ref name=\"deVries 1996\" />{{rp|69}}\n\nBy the late 1980s, international organizations began to admit that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises.<ref name=\"deVries 1996\" />{{rp|70}} In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans.<ref name=\"Tan 2007\">{{Cite encyclopedia | title = The poverty of amnesia: PRSPs in the legacy of structural adjustment | author = Tan, Celine | encyclopedia = The World Bank and Governance: A Decade of Reform and Reaction | editor = Stone, Diane | editor2 = Wright, Christopher | year = 2007 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-41282-7}}</ref>{{rp|147}} The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted as an extension of structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities.

In [[Jackson, California]], he purchased 173 acres of land. He organized a number of parishes and church-school municipalities. One of the most significant undertakings by Bishop Dionisije was his work in bringing and rescuing Serbs from the prison camps of Germany, Italy and Austria after the end of World War II.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent.

''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|title=Friedrich Hayek: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226181509}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Tebble|first1=Adam|last2=Meadowcroft|first2=John|title=F.A.

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''.

This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years.

This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D.

It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]].

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party.

Libertarian communists, including [[Anarcho-communism|anarchists]], [[Council communism|councillists]], [[Left communism|leftists]] and [[Libertarian Marxism|Marxists]], also reject the concept of a socialist state for being antithetical to socialism, but they believe that socialism and communism can only be established through [[revolution]] and dissolving the existence of the state.

Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay)\" and condemned \"wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not\" whilst emphasizing equality, by which they meant \"free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1004\u20131010|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4546}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of socialist states now enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: \"Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|year=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87286-330-9|page=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation of industry ===\nAs authoritarian powers enforce socialist economics, the process often goes hand in hand with supporting the growth of heavy industry as a means of reaching [[industrialization]] (as can be seen with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the [[Soviet Union]]).

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. {{ISBN|9780812004038}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|9780754636571}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. {{ISBN|9780140806229}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1986) [1981].

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries. The congress established [[African independence movements|national liberation]] as the main topic of their sessions, emphasizing the elimination and exploitation by the imperialist powers over authentic national sovereignty. However, they did not establish clear social or political parameters for this new liberation.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/>\n\nAfrican leaders consistently viewed socialism as a direct rejection of the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial system]] and in turn dismissed the notion of creating independent capitalist systems throughout the continent. They attempted to infuse various forms of socialism\u2014some Marxist\u2013Leninist, others democratic\u2014into tailored ideologies specific to each country.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/> Once these systems were in place, countries developed towards a \"focal institutional\" society.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources.

Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.
