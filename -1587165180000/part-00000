He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs first as a hobby, and then becoming a club performer. \n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], Prine credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]] and singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]] with discovering him, resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|eponymous debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed with [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1981, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs first as a hobby, and then becoming a club performer. \n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], Prine credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]] and singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]] with discovering him, resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|eponymous debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed with [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1981, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]]. He was born and raised in the Maywood suburb of Chicago.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Barry|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|title=John Prine Endures, With a Half-Smile and a Song|date=April 6, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 30, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330175317/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|archive-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zcAvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22William+Mason+Prine%22&source=bl&ots=jDOm_3v6oV&sig=ACfU3U35TPsyQSJTsNvdrVEMe6ixKUIQpQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjkg93TiNjoAhUMmuAKHXncA00Q6AEwA3oECAkQAQ|title=John Prine: In Spite of Himself|first=Eddie|last=Huffman|date=March 15, 2015|page=76|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|via=Google Books}}</ref> In summers, they would go back to visit family near [[Paradise, Kentucky]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/programs/john-prine-discusses-his-life-and-his-formation-music-0 |title=John Prine discusses his life and his formation in music |date=1975 |work=Studs Terkel Radio Archive |access-date=2020-04-11 |publisher=WFMT and Chicago History Museum |language=en}}</ref> Prine started playing guitar at age 14, taught by his brother, David.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |title=John Prine Information |website=Shrout.co.uk |date=October 10, 1946 |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006062927/http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/98957222421345075 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> and [[Proviso East High School|Proviso Township High School]] (later called Proviso East) in [[Maywood, Illinois]].

Highlights include the allegorical \"[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]]\", which includes a recitation and addresses the [[Vietnam War]], and the ballad \"Souvenirs,\" which Prine later recorded with Goodman.<ref>{{cite web |title=Looking Back on John Prine Buddy Steve Goodman |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/looking-back-on-john-prine-buddy-steve-goodman-860284/ |website=www.rollingstone.com |publisher=Rollingstone |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent albums include ''[[Sweet Revenge (John Prine album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1973), containing such fan favorites as \"Dear Abby\", \"Grandpa Was a Carpenter\", and \"Christmas in Prison\", and [[Common Sense (John Prine album)|''Common Sense'']] (1975), with \"Come Back to Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard.\" The latter album was Prine's first to be charted in the US Top 100 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reflecting growing commercial success. It was produced by Steve Cropper. ''[[Bruised Orange]]'' from 1978 was a Steve Goodman-produced album that gave listeners songs such as \"That's The Way That The World Goes 'Round\", \"Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone\", \"Fish and Whistle\", and the title track.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cocks |first1=Jay |title=Bruised Orange |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bruised-orange-190100/ |website=www.rollingstone.com |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, singer [[David Allan Coe]] achieved considerable success on the country charts with \"[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]\", co-written by Prine and Goodman.

He played alongside legendary ballplayers such as [[Honus Wagner]] and [[Mordecai Brown]].

In 1730 his father accompanied [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson]] to the [[Province of South Carolina]] and served as its Chief Justice until 1739.

Then, in May 1760, he was named as Lieutenant Governor to [[Henry Ellis (governor)|Henry Ellis]] in Georgia. He returned to America and took up residence in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. When Ellis resigned he was appointed Governor in November 1760.  He was the third, and arguably most popular, Royal Governor of the colony. He sold many of his holdings in South Carolina, acquired land in Georgia, and moved his financial operations as well. With peace temporarily established with the [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]], he successfully negotiated with the [[First Nations|Indians]] and the Crown to open new lands to development. In his early administration, the new lands and economic improvement fostered the development of the Georgia colony.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=James|title=Answers to queries sent by the Lords of Trade [in] 1761, 1762|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/zlna/id:jwr001|website=Southeastern Native American Documents, 1730-1842|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHis first troubles came with the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765. But, in spite of efforts by the [[Sons of Liberty]] to block its implementation, Georgia was the only colony to import and actually use the revenue stamps. In 1768, Wright established the 12,000 acre settlement known as [[Wrightsboro, Georgia]]. Wrightsboro was set aside for displaced [[Quakers]] from [[North Carolina]]<ref>[http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/2395-historic-wrightsboro Historic Wrightsboro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313215224/http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/2395-historic-wrightsboro |date=13 March 2014 }}. exploregeorgia.org.

As the [[American Revolution]] gathered momentum, Georgia remained the most [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyal]] colony\u2014due in part to its recent settlement, with many residents having direct ties through [[kinship]] in Great Britain, and, in part as well, to Wright's able administration. Georgia did not send delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] in 1774. That same year saw the death of his wife, Sarah.\n\nBy 1775, the revolutionary spirit had reached Georgia through the ''[[Committees of correspondence]]'' and he dismissed the assembly. But a revolutionary congress met that summer in Savannah and elected delegates to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. Then, in early 1776, following [[Battle of the Rice Boats|the arrival of a small British fleet]], rebel forces entered his home and briefly took him prisoner. Wright escaped on February 11, 1776, via [[Bonaventure Plantation]] and with the assistance of two compatriots, Colonel John Mullryne and [[Josiah Tattnall, Sr.|Josiah Tattnall]],<ref>[https://www.telfair.org/article/bonaventure-a-historical-sketch/ \"BONAVENTURE: A HISTORICAL SKETCH\"] - [[Telfair Museums]], July 27, 2018</ref> to the safety of HMS ''Scarborough'', and sent a letter to his council. The congress and the Council adjourned without answering him.\n\nFor a time, Wright continued negotiations. He was even able to trade with the rebels to keep his offshore troops and ships supplied. But the differences continued to escalate. When his attempt to retake Savannah with naval forces failed, he returned to England.\n\nBy 1778, Governor Wright convinced the government to lend him enough troops to once again attempt to take Savannah. After some short but sharp fights, he [[Capture of Savannah|regained control of Savannah]] on December 29, 1778. While never fully in control of the state, he did restore large areas within Georgia to colonial rule, making this the only colony that was regained by the British once they had been expelled. He led a successful defense against several American and French attempts to capture the city. When the war was lost, he withdrew on July 11, 1782 and retired to England.\n\nWright's extensive properties were seized by the revolutionary governments in South Carolina and Georgia. He died in London, and is interred at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n== Wright's offspring==\nJames F.

In 1730 his father accompanied [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson]] to the [[Province of South Carolina]] and served as its Chief Justice until 1739.  James followed soon after and began the practice of law in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].  In 1747 James was named [[Attorney General of South Carolina|colonial attorney-general]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deaton|first1=Stan|title=James Wright (1716-1785)|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/james-wright-1716-1785|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref> He also began amassing plantation lands.\n\nWright returned to London as an agent for the South Carolina colony in 1757. Then, in May 1760, he was named as Lieutenant Governor to [[Henry Ellis (governor)|Henry Ellis]] in Georgia. He returned to America and took up residence in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. When Ellis resigned he was appointed Governor in November 1760.  He was the third, and arguably most popular, Royal Governor of the colony. He sold many of his holdings in South Carolina, acquired land in Georgia, and moved his financial operations as well. With peace temporarily established with the [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]], he successfully negotiated with the [[First Nations|Indians]] and the Crown to open new lands to development. In his early administration, the new lands and economic improvement fostered the development of the Georgia colony.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=James|title=Answers to queries sent by the Lords of Trade [in] 1761, 1762|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/zlna/id:jwr001|website=Southeastern Native American Documents, 1730-1842|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHis first troubles came with the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765. But, in spite of efforts by the [[Sons of Liberty]] to block its implementation, Georgia was the only colony to import and actually use the revenue stamps. In 1768, Wright established the 12,000 acre settlement known as [[Wrightsboro, Georgia]]. Wrightsboro was set aside for displaced [[Quakers]] from [[North Carolina]]<ref>[http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/2395-historic-wrightsboro Historic Wrightsboro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313215224/http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/2395-historic-wrightsboro |date=13 March 2014 }}. exploregeorgia.org.

As the [[American Revolution]] gathered momentum, Georgia remained the most [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyal]] colony\u2014due in part to its recent settlement, with many residents having direct ties through [[kinship]] in Great Britain, and, in part as well, to Wright's able administration. Georgia did not send delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] in 1774. That same year saw the death of his wife, Sarah.\n\nBy 1775, the revolutionary spirit had reached Georgia through the ''[[Committees of correspondence]]'' and he dismissed the assembly. But a revolutionary congress met that summer in Savannah and elected delegates to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. Then, in early 1776, following [[Battle of the Rice Boats|the arrival of a small British fleet]], rebel forces entered his home and briefly took him prisoner. Wright escaped on February 11, 1776, via [[Bonaventure Plantation]] and with the assistance of two compatriots, Colonel John Mullryne and Josiah Tattnall, Sr.,<ref>[https://www.telfair.org/article/bonaventure-a-historical-sketch/ \"BONAVENTURE: A HISTORICAL SKETCH\"] - [[Telfair Museums]], July 27, 2018</ref> to the safety of HMS ''Scarborough'', and sent a letter to his council. The congress and the Council adjourned without answering him.\n\nFor a time, Wright continued negotiations. He was even able to trade with the rebels to keep his offshore troops and ships supplied. But the differences continued to escalate. When his attempt to retake Savannah with naval forces failed, he returned to England.\n\nBy 1778, Governor Wright convinced the government to lend him enough troops to once again attempt to take Savannah. After some short but sharp fights, he [[Capture of Savannah|regained control of Savannah]] on December 29, 1778. While never fully in control of the state, he did restore large areas within Georgia to colonial rule, making this the only colony that was regained by the British once they had been expelled. He led a successful defense against several American and French attempts to capture the city. When the war was lost, he withdrew on July 11, 1782 and retired to England.\n\nWright's extensive properties were seized by the revolutionary governments in South Carolina and Georgia. He died in London, and is interred at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n== Wright's offspring==\nJames F.

His father, who typifies the patriarchal family head, beats his son in childhood for wandering around in the company of his friends. He does not allow the young boy to learn to play the flute, or to perform in his school's plays.

Regarded as Nemade's [[magnum opus]], and accepted as a modern classic of [[Marathi literature]], the novel uses the [[Autobiographical novel|autobiographical form]] to narrate the journey of a young man, Pandurang Sangvikar, and his friends through his college years. \n\n''Kosala'' is considered to be the first [[Existentialism|existentialist]] novel in Marathi literature. Since its publication, its open-ended nature and potential for varied interpretations have been viewed as ground-breaking. The novel has become a modern classic of post-1960 Marathi fiction, and has been translated into eight Indian languages and into English.\n\n==Publication==\n''Kosala'', Bhalchandra Nemade's debut novel,<ref name=\"Chitre1969\">{{cite journal|last=Chitre|first=Dilip|author-link=Dilip Chitre|title=Alienation in Four Marathi Novels|year=1969|journal=Humanist Review|publisher=Modern Education Foundation|location=Bombay|volume=1|issue=2|page=161\u2013175|oclc=1752400}}</ref> was conceived and written during his [[Bombay]] phase.<ref name=\"Paranjape1996\">{{cite journal|last1=Nemade|first1=Bhalchandra|last2=Paranjape|first2=Makarand|author2-link=Makarand Paranjape|title=Speaking Out: Bhalchandra Nemade in conversation with Makarand Paranjape|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=July\u2013August 1996|volume=39|issue=4|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|pages=180\u2013184|jstor=23336213}} {{closed access}}</ref>\n\nAt 21, Nemade had failed in his journalistic aspirations, and returned to his native village. He was rebuffed there by his father, who was disappointed that his son risked squandering an expensive education to end up being a cowherd.<ref name=\"Paranjape1996\"/>\n\nIn 1963, Nemade was 25 and living in his village.

Using the autobiographical form, ''Kosala'' narrates the life-story of Pandurang Sangvikar, a young man of 25, in six sections.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nPandurang is the son of a well-to-do farmer from Sangvi, a village in Khandesh. His family includes his parents, his grandmother, and his four sisters. Pandurang's relationship with his father is a difficult one, and they have been estranged since Pandurang was a boy. His father, who typifies the patriarchal family head, beats his son in childhood for wandering around in the company of his friends. He does not allow the young boy to learn to play the flute, or to perform in his school's plays. Pandurang considers his father excessively money-minded, materialistic, selfish, unscrupulous, and dictatorial. In sharp contrast to his relationship with his father, Pandurang loves his mother and his sisters dearly.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nAfter passing his local school's matriculation examination, Pandurang moves to [[Pune]] to attend college.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/> While studying, Pandurang lives in a hostel. He decides to make the most of college life, and becomes the secretary of the college debating society, prefect of the hostel, and directs a play at the college Annual Day function. Out of kindness, he gives responsibility for the management of the hostel mess to one of his poor friends. But, although Pandurang tries to help everyone around him, he ultimately discovers that his friends are using him. Finally, when he fails his exams badly and his financial position deteriorates, his father becomes angered by Pandurang's lifestyle. Pandurang learns a lesson: that good deeds do not count for much in life.<ref name=\"George1993\">{{cite book|editor-last=George|editor-first=K. M.|editor-link=K. M.

Even his father now hesitates to ask him to mend his ways. He is shaken by the untimely death of his younger sister, Mani, but otherwise has no care for anything. In consequence, he fails his exam. After unsuccessful attempts to find work in the city, ultimately Pandurang returns to his village, his mind \"existentially vacant\". He is now one of many unemployed youngsters of the village. As Pandurang tries to understand their views on life, their sorrows and their joys, the true meaning of life begins to dawn.<ref name=\"George1993\"/>\n\n==Theme and techniques==\nThe main theme of ''Kosala'' is [[Social alienation|alienation]].<ref name=\"Chitre1969\"/> The novel is influenced by existential philosophy,<ref name=\"NatarajanNelson1996\"/> exploring existentialist ideas such as an obsession with birth and death, dread, alienation, and absurdity.<ref name=\"Khaladkar2010\">{{cite thesis|first=Dattatraya Dnyandev|last=Khaladkar |title=Existentialism in the Selected American and Marathi Novels: a Comparative Study|chapter=Existentialism in Marathi Novels |chapter-url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/9899/7/07_chapter%203.pdf |year=2010 |publisher=Department of English, Shivaji University |location=Kolhapur|type=PhD|pages=144\u2013145|hdl=10603/9899}}</ref> Like other existential novels, ''Kosala'' uses the [[First-person narrative|first person point of view]] to recount an individual's experiences, and in this exploration raises many questions regarding the [[meaning of life]] and the value of existence.

The language Pandurang uses, a Marathi dialect spoken in rural [[Maharashtra]], serves as an instrument revealing his [[worldview]]. Another technique the author employs is the description of \"historical investigations\" that Pandurang and his friend Suresh Bapat often undertake, and which ultimately uncover to them the absurdity and pathos of their condition.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}--->Despite the novel's pessimistic undertones, an element of humour runs through ''Kosala''.  Oblique, irrelevant humour is used as a serious moral strategy, to unmask the falseness of society and culture.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nIn its narrative, ''Kosala'' presents a fusion of different genres, including: [[autobiography]], the diary, the novel, [[Folklore of India|Indian folktales]], [[Folklore#Genres: the lore of folklore|folk narrative]], and medieval [[hagiography]].<ref name=\"Gurjarpadhye2014\"/> The novel makes varied use of language, style and register, including: [[standard language|standard]] and [[Archaism|archaic]] language, urban and non-urban dialect, [[slang]], [[jargon]], [[poetry]], and [[rhetoric]].<ref name=\"Gurjarpadhye2014\"/> ''Kosala'' is said to have been inspired in part by [[J.
